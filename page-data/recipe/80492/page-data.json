This recipe is a very strong, simple cinnamon roll that can be tasted without olfaction. \r\n\r\nItâ€™s basically a higher percentage Mt Baker Cinnamon Roll, with a little Super Sweet to enhance the tongue flavour and Marshmallow to moisten the dry cinnamon. \r\n\r\nYou can sub marshmallow for TFA whipped cream or TFA meringue, or use FA marshmallow at 0.5%. \r\n\r\nHarsh but serviceable as a shake n vape, but the doughy roll flavor replaces the burn around day 3. \r\n\r\nI mix at max vg but 80%+ will be fine.
