Maybe I was missing a flavor. I finally tried it after a two week steep. It's amazing! I usually vape Cheeba Steeba's Sweet Strawberry Cream. This recipe is much creamier. Like everyone else I thought it was way too much strawberry at first. After steeping it all blended very well. Excellent recipe! Thanks for sharing it!"},{"user":"Kriswk","text":"So at first, I admit..this recipe had some serious strawberry going on in the beginning. It was almost too much for me lol. I love Red Touch. I love Shisha Strawberry. Combining them both was one seriously intense, syrupy, sweet fruit. I tried it on the SNV and holy crap. I thought it may have not been for me. After speaking with Fear about this, he told me to give it some time. I'm certainly glad I did. I'm a person who loves the creams over the strawberries any day of the week. After about 2 weeks of letting this guy just sit, wow did it sure change. Now, this mix no matter what, is strawberry first, creams second. But man, the creams in this recipe are bangin'. That Shisha Vanilla blends with the creams and creates something magical. Its a sweet, mellow, milky vanilla cream and its floating in between all the bright, pink strawberry notes that are popping all over the place. The Dragonfruit really does its job well in this, combining the strawberries together and lifting them up in such a great way. Any sort of harshness or rather tartness from the fruits is immediately knocked out by the creams including that small touch of marshmallow that added just a tiny amount of volume to it all. I'd say this recipe is an amazing steeper. I can certainly bet anything that given a month, this recipe would be absolutely amazing. I've already mixed up a 60ml just to find out. Great job. The only critique I would even have would be to lower the FA Red Touch, a touch (pun certainly intended) simply because it is the type of flavor that benefits greatly from other sweet, forefront flavors such as the Shisha SB. You could easily set this at 2-2.5% and it would still be amazing and stand out just as much. Everything else is great. Me personally I would up the OOO Cream Milky to 3-4% and only mix this at 75-80% VG because I swear that flavor is best at that ratio. But, that's not really a critique..rather just personal preference. Anyways, great job man.. a terrific strawberries and cream."},{"user":"jbird","text":"As one of the people who have a hard time tasting strawberry, I had almost given up. But this recipe has finally made me see the light and understand why S&amp;C vapes are so popular. In fear of the strawberry fading, I started vaping this after a 2 day steep. It was in your face strawberry syrup! I was so happy to actually taste strawberry but wanted to see how the creams were gonna play out. So I continued to test this everyday. And each day, the creams came out more and more. By day 5 the Shisha Vanilla and Vienna Cream really showed up, while no fading from the strawberry. I ended up vaping the rest of the 50ml bottle in the next 2 days.&#xD;\nAbsolutely delicious recipe! If your like me and have trouble with strawberries, this might be the answer you've been looking for: )"}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"23264","name":"OnA (Opinions and Assholes)"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
