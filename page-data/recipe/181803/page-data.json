I had to do an MLK.\r\n\r\nYou can add 0.5% of CAP Super Sweet to this mix to brighten it and round up the edges.\r\n\r\nOne of the reasons why I am working as an advocate and an activist and one of my favorite quotes from MLK: “We know through painful experience that freedom is never voluntarily given by the oppressor, it must be demanded by the oppressed.”\r\n\r\nTo be a voice of critic be a force of proposition, and in the steps of MLK, be the change you want to effect.\r\n\r\nEnjoy, be queer and vape on.\r\n\r\n[Photo credits: from the Nation Michael K.
