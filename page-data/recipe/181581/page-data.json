VT toffee ice cream makes up the bulk of the flavor with the FA Italian relax bolstering the notes with its cappuccino qualities. The two interplay in a way that both of their dark flavor qualities evolve and evince a harmonious range of flavor for the palate. \r\n\r\nLB is simply the best vanilla ice cream flavor, in my opinion. VBIC is a close second now for me. LB vanilla ice cream creates the velvety, rich ice cream base with TFA vanilla swirl to add more of a vanilla punch along with VT warm custard to impart a slight buttery and eggy note. \r\n\r\nVT milkshake base helps drive it all home by giving it a dense  milkshake feel. I played with the idea of using a higher percentage but wasn’t sure how the malty notes that come out at a higher percentage would play with the already dark and bold flavors of the coffee and toffee. \r\n\r\nSweeten to taste, but I found .5% super sweet works well. It’s meant to be sweet and sticky. Feel free to add WS23 at .5% if you want the coolness of an ice cream/milkshake as well. \r\n\r\nI hope you enjoy!","steep_days":"7","temperature":"0","recipe_score":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-11T02:38:46.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"711","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Warm Custard","flavor_id":"8997","vendor":"VT","millipercent":750},{"name":"Milkshake Base","flavor_id":"8927","vendor":"VT","millipercent":600},{"name":"Toffee Ice Cream","flavor_id":"8987","vendor":"VT","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Italian Relax (cappuccino)","flavor_id":"505","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Vanilla Swirl","flavor_id":"189","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Vanilla Ice Cream","flavor_id":"1511","vendor":"LB","millipercent":5000},{"name":"Super Sweet","flavor_id":"2384","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":500}],"reviews":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"181581","name":"T.C.I.C."}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
