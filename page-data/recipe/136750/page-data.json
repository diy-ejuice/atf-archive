Vaping this out of my mtl setup picking up the lemon meringue up front with the vanilla pudding under tones. Vanilla swirl just blends in for me and the yoghurt drink is also blended nicely but I think it will be more present after a longer steep. &#xD;\nThanks for the recipe!","score":5}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"136750","name":"Lemon Curd"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
