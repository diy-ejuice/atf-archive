I wanted a nice pineapple mango smoothie then the lemony note in Yoghurt drink got me thinking about adding a dash of lemon/lime.  The VT YD can get overpowered pretty easily in a mix so the FW yogurt is being used to back it up.  You don't want to loose that yoghurty goodness in the fruit.  I decided to take my go to pineapple mix and add some of the Sugarloaf pineapple to it, its got a nice syrupy texture and mouthfeel and it helps to add to the juiciness factor.\r\n\r\nMango is tough to nail without the mango funk, but this mix of VT Shisha Mango and Fa Indian Special seems to do the trick without overpowering the pineapple.  Mango is the support here with the up front pineapple.  The shisha lime just adds works well enough with the VT to add some additional brightness and a touch of that citrus bite.\r\n\r\nI also use WS-23 in it and you can adjust it up or down.  No sweetener or softener required here so there was not point in adding SS or TFA Marshmallow to it.","steep_days":"8 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:51:31.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"2046","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Yogurt","vendor":"FW","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Pineapple","vendor":"INW","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Golden Pineapple","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":500},{"name":"Mango Indian Special","vendor":"FA","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Yoghurt Drink","vendor":"VT","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Shisha Mango","vendor":"VT","millipercent":750},{"name":"Shisha Lime","vendor":"INW","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Sugarloaf Pineapple","vendor":"VT","millipercent":2000},{"name":"WS-23","vendor":"OTHR","millipercent":500}],"reviews":[{"user":"rougeislander401","text":"Great tropical yogurt drink! You seem to have a knack for balancing slightly more complex recipes, great job supporting the yoghurt drink with fw yogurt to keep a kinda smoothie or lassi like feel and the fruit combination is simply incredible! Love what the lime does to accent the pineapple and mango and with chosen mango/pineapple flavorings you cant go wrong! Great work!"}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"192290","name":"Pimengo Lassi"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
