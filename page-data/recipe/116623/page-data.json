In my single flavour test I found it to be a very bright and fresh flavour that was very Morrish.\r\n\r\nI knew from previous trials that JF Boysenberry was a very juicy flavour and I'm not disappointed in how it's rounded off the Blueberry and given it a wetness.\r\n\r\nAlthough the CAP Sugar Cookie would of been fine by itself I wanted to up the ante a bit and try for a butter cookie profile. \r\n\r\nI was aiming to get as close as possible to my wife's old family recipe and once again I'm not disappointed with the result.\r\n\r\nI find that the CAP Golden Butter adds a certain fullness to the mix and brings the other flavours together. \r\n\r\nThis vape goes well with a nice cup of tea or coffee.\r\n\r\nMy only regret with this mix is not making a bigger batch as I'm going through it like nothing else.\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nEdit: After retesting a steeping batch increased steep time to 14 days.\r\n\r\nAfter two weeks the Blueberry has developed nicely but to me the cookie has dropped back so i've increased it to 3%","steep_days":"14 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:50:25.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"1502","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Golden Butter","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Sugar Cookie","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Blueberry","vendor":"FW","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Boysenberry","vendor":"JF","millipercent":250}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"116623","name":"Blurberry Cookie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
