I like my tobacco vapes pretty strong, so give this one a 2 week steep before you try it.  I have mixed dozens of \"cuban cigar\" recipes and nothing tastes like them like mine does.\r\n\r\nIf other cuban cigar recipes have you longing for more punch, look no further.\r\n\r\nTriple punch of shade, fire, and DNB give it the bitterness needed for tobacco vapes, and the dual cuban flavors give it the richness.  AP and BR smooth out the top notes and add some subtle sweetness.","steep_days":"14","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"total_reviews":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-06T20:44:47.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"2217","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Acetyl Pyrazine 5%","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Black Fire","vendor":"FA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Butterscotch Ripple","vendor":"FW","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Connecticut Shade","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Cuban Supreme","vendor":"FA","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Tobacco Absolute Cuban Cigar","vendor":"INW","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Tobacco Dirty Neutral (dnb)","vendor":"INW","millipercent":1000}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"147422","name":"Tobacco Flavor - Cuban Cigar"}}}
