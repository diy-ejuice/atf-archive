Tpa pistachio never tasted like a pistachio to me, just a different kind of sweetness, but this recipe brings it out really well and puts it on top of a delicious authentic tasting blondie. Great job guys!"},{"user":"Ebc88","text":"Tastes as described the pistachio, almond cookie, and flv give it a nice “crunchy” like texture. The white chocolate in my opinion makes this recipe. Excellent job guys and gal "}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"140704","name":"Pistachio Blondie | Developed"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
