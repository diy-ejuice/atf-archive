Purilium Condensed Milk. It is a fantastic addition to any cream/milk/dairy mixers collection. Buy that stuff.\r\n\r\nNot too many notes\r\n\r\nThe melon combo with Cactus and Honeysuckle is a direct adaption of my Honey Sucker recipe but playing around with JF Honeydew. I changed the strawberries up a bit in hopes that I could taste them more. But alas, it is a sweet hint of pinkish berry for me. Which is nice.... Thanks to @thadentman beta testing this I know that the combo works for \"normal strawberry tasters.\"\r\n\r\nThe combo of Purilium Condensed Milk with Shisha Vanilla is a delicious take on a heavy dairy on the front milkish cream. Accentuated by my undying love for Shisha Vanilla.\r\n\r\nCapella Super Sweet, the recipe needed a bit of kick in the sweetness department. The balance on it is great and I did not want to add extra EM with TFA Sweetener. Actually I tried it and it lost a good bit (to me) in the complexity department.\r\n\r\nThe profile is supposed to be akin to a bubble tea, without the roach eggs. No one thing is supposed to take main stage on this one. Just a balanced melony, fruity, milky creamy vape.","steep_days":"7","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:49:16.000-05:00","best_vg":"60%","views":"4686","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Condensed Milk","vendor":"PUR","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Honeydew Melon","vendor":"JF","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Cactus","vendor":"INW","millipercent":500},{"name":"Cantaloupe","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Honeysuckle (pg)","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Shisha Strawberry","vendor":"INW","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Strawberry ~ Red Touch","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1250},{"name":"Super Sweet","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":250},{"name":"Shisha Vanilla","vendor":"INW","millipercent":1000}],"reviews":[{"user":"ID10-T","text":"Itâ€™s juicy and refreshing and I really appreciate the way it combines both a sweet melon flavor and a creamy dairy milk, like a honeydew milk smoothie. Mixing melons and milk can be dangerous, that's a combination that can go south real easy in my experience, but it works well here.  At the suggested steep time, I'm getting plenty of honeydew flavor and a milky creaminess coming in underneath, which the slightest hint of vanilla. Not tasting any cantaloupe or strawberry but I'm sure they're contributing to the body and sweetness.  "},{"user":"DodgerFog33","text":"So on the Recommendation of Shyndo I mixed this up about a week and half ago. This recipe is definetely a banger. Love how the melon blends in so perfectly with the recipe. Also I was a bit afraid of the Honeysuclke cause I one of the few that find it to be just a bit too floral for me, but here it just works, the cactus adds a nice wet feel to the vapevand the flavors really blend together to make this recipe an absolute Allstar. Definetely reccomend mixing this up. Very good. "},{"user":"shyndo","text":"THIS RECIPE FUCKING BANGS! Don't like the soapiness you get from tfa honeydew? Bubbles has got you! For the first 15 or so days you vape this it is an orgasmically accurate honeydew milk. The honeydew is light enough it doesn't sit on your palate and wreck your rda and you even get a nice kick of cantaloupe in there with some well rounded sweetness. Pur Condensed milk is the secret weapon here and I don't know if I could see anything else working quite as well. After 15 days you really get the strawberry notes and the honeydew fades a bit. The cantaloupe comes out to play even more as well as the vanilla and some subtle sweetness from the honeysuckle. Let me get this straight tho, this doesn't take away from the vape. It simply morphs into something a little different but just as pleasing and wonderful. It's complex and simple at the same time. There's just a wonderful underlying sweet creaminess to the whole experience. If this profile intrigues you I can't suggest this enough. I have vaped through almost all 120 ml of this and that is quite rare for me."},{"user":"Thadentman","text":"Fear is so good with honeydew vapes... it's a very balanced realistic honeydew milk...
