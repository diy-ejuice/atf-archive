I don't know if this batch will last 3 days to steep.&#xD;\nNo TFA Butter in my tackle box..  Used CAPs Golden Butter at same percentage.   ***Update****  This is one that gets better and better with age.  Hands down the best Butterscotch recipe I've mixed to date.    NOV 13 update.  This is my #1 ADV.  It keeps getting better and better with every vape.  Its delicious, rich, savory, thick creamy mouthfeel and its converted a few of my friends who pretty much stick to fruit flavors.  Just goes to show that a great recipe like this one can get people out of their comfort zones.   This recipe is under appreciated on this site.

Beautiful recipe. Thank you for this one."},{"user":"Marnu","text":"Very delicious. &#xD;\nCreamy, sweet butterscotch. Very smooth and well worth a mix. Good job "},{"user":"Siskolgist7","text":"Definitely going to make this, sounds great! Thanks for sharing, will update after I tried it.
