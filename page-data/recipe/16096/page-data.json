Also, not quite an accurate clone. The Maple Syrup is out of place and it's not a very good flavor anyway; I would not recommend buying it if you haven't already. Just mix this up without it. Would probably be just as good if not better without the Marshmallow as well. "}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"16096","name":"Sugar Daddy"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
