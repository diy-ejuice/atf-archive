Creamy coconut infused sticky rice with ripe slices of juicy mango. \r\n\r\nFE sweet rice is the star of the show here and the main note of the recipe. It fades a little so we use it quite high at 5 percent.\r\n\r\nFA cream fresh bridges the gap between our coconuts and our rice and makes the mix cohesive. It also adds a pleasing tropical dairy note on its own.\r\n\r\nFA coco and TPA coconut candy blend in with our rice and infuse it with coconut goodness. This might look high for the coconut but it actually ends up pretty balanced throughout.\r\n\r\nFlv mango is the mango we use here because it is the only one that will not blend into the middle of the mix or add a musky note. We use it quite low for flv without using CAP sweet alongside it because we want the rice to remain the star and the mango to be balanced alongside it when the rice fades a little in the next couple of days. You will notice the more you vape this the more prevalent the mango becomes.  \r\n\r\nCap super sweet actually has a job here and it's to tone down the slightly bitter note you get at the end of the sweet rice exhale. This is something unique to sweet rice and this amount seems to mask it quite nicely.\r\n\r\nThis is not a recipe to throw in your steep cabinet. Great as a shake and vape.","steep_days":"0 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":4.9,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:49:30.000-05:00","best_vg":"69%","views":"40464","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Sweet Rice","vendor":"FE","millipercent":5000},{"name":"Mango","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":3500},{"name":"Cream Fresh","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Coco' (coconut)","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Coconut Candy","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":750},{"name":"Super Sweet","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":200}],"reviews":[{"user":"cxxxxp","text":"dang this is some sweet &amp; tasty juice shyndo, hadn't tried the FLV mango this high and it works. Great seperation in layers too. I waited too long to mix this up! Well done "},{"user":"Ihavenoidea","text":"My wife finished off the rest of the 30ml before I could get a two day steep on it. She's REAL picky, so that says something üòÅ"},{"user":"gilco","text":"So good. An elegant, well-balanced Mango fruit vape with body and volume. Excellent and netter than everything you could buy in a vape st√∂re. First I was afraid that the coconut fraction could be a little bit too dominant. But, what should I say? It's spot on. Also the seemingly heavy rice part is really nice. Never vaped such a combination before. Everything is so well balanced and exotic. I think you really should give this a try! Thanks @Shyndo for sharing the secret. Think I would try some of your other recipes too.... ;)"},{"user":"BigRed","text":"This was my first time trying this i had the one shot just chilling in my concentrate cabinet for like 6 months and jesus i wish i mixed this up sooner it just the right amount of mango and coconut and sweetness . shyndo you really need to keep dropping these  recipes I love almost every  recipe i have mixed up from you . much love bro keep fucking mixing bro !"},{"user":"Urs1ne","text":"This is a great recipe. I recently got burned out on dessert/bakery recipes so I started mixing a bunch of fruity recipes but most of the are just that, fruit. On a whim I decided to buy FE Sweet Rice to find something new to make and stumbled across this recipe. This is such a refreshingly new profile for me and I can't tell you how much I'm in love. It's a great balance of fruit and not being too fruity. I did notice that the rice fades after a steep so it would be awesome if there was something we could use to boost the rice a bit long term but then again my bottles usually don't last that long. I usually vape at day 3 and finish it by day 5. It's kind of a hassle but it's worth it. Bonus points because my girlfriend loves the smell so even if she isn't vaping it she is still getting the benefit of this recipe."},{"user":"DumHed","text":"Great recipe, Kyle...if that IS your real name...."},{"user":"Stephan","text":"Love this SNV mix.  I find it unique, intriguing and hard to put down! &#xD;\n@shyndo - Thank you for sharing your skills and talent! "},{"user":"shaunculwell","text":"This stuff is awesome! I'm a new mixer and one of the very first recipes I mixed was this masterpiece! I love this stuff! Great job @shyndo!"},{"user":"KenWhitfield","text":"I purchased the one shot for this mix and absolutely loved everything about it. "},{"user":"gravi-tea","text":"i wasn't super blown away but it was vapeable i think it is just too weird for me"},{"user":"Untitled","text":"My ADV since day 1. Bought the one shot just to support you! Thumbs up!"},{"user":"308_hobbiest","text":"Really good! Weird... but really good! This is one of the few recipes that I will make again. "},{"user":"BushHogin","text":"Wow, all I can say is wow. This stuff is so good. I‚Äôve only been mixing for about 2 months but I went a little overboard and bought a ton of flavors and got really excited But nothing I‚Äôve made has really blown me away until now. Thank you so much for sharing this recipe I knew it sounded good so I made 60ml to start and the SNV is so good I know it won‚Äôt last so I‚Äôm about to make another 60 to steep. Well done on this excellent recipe! "},{"user":"Echodub","text":"finally the mix has steeped, and after the first testing i have to say, this recipe has to be the best mango vape i've came across. i wasn't sure if i would like sweet rice as a vape, but this is outstanding. the way shyndo used the percentages is very clever. coconut candy to me is a key flavor here, it's so low that it fills out the recipe in very good way. i like it in a Taifun Gt4 the most, even more than in a hadaly... 5stars! thank you"},{"user":"Benoz","text":"I bought the one shot its amazing, really smooth, nice mango, great coconut, i would have liked a bit more rice but thats just me and it does come out more after a week well done mate keep up the good work "},{"user":"RuntDastardly","text":"This recipe is a goddamn masterpiece. It took me AGES to finally have all the ingredients in place, as I kept forgetting to add FE Sweet Rice to my ECX cart for some reason, but now that I've finally tasted it, I mix &amp; blow through 60mls on a regular basis. A week's steep is my personal sweet spot for this one, then it's gone in roughly that amount of time (which is fast for me!). This recipe has made my summer! I just recently moved, and one of the places we left behind was this expensive, problematic Thai restaurant. They had a mango sticky rice that was on the menu, but not always available, due to the head chef's insistence that he only ever used the most exquisitely ripe mangoes to make it. If he couldn't get ripe mangoes, no mango sticky rice for you, end of story. I don't know how common this is, but it was topped with toasted mung beans. It lent this sweet, crispy nuttiness to the dish, and I think about it often, the way a normal person fondly recalls a lost love. Anyway, not only does your recipe perfectly balance the juicy, fleshy, sexy fruitiness of a perfectly ripe mango with the rich, decadent, creamy layer of coconut rice, but I swear to god, I even taste a sprinkling of toasty mung beans here. Beyond delicious. Brought a tear to my eye, it did. Thank you for this one, Shyndo. Easily one of the top 5 best recipes I've ever had."},{"user":"vix","text":"First, I would like to state I mixed this from scratch, not from a One Shot and I cannot put this stuff down. I love the dessert and let me just say, this recipe lives up to the hype. I am a mixer who doesn't particularly enjoy added sweeteners to juices and although this juice was pretty good without the .2% Super Sweet, it did get better with the sweetener added. Great job, shyndo."},{"user":"alexis666","text":"This is certainly an interesting recipe but I can't say I like it very much. To me there is some kind of weird taste in there which I find unpleasant, it might be mango tasting overripe or a clash of some sort. I read an online review of the one-shot of this recipes recently and it also mentioned something being off/not right but they said that the juice improved with a bit of a steep. A week was about as long as I left it, it did change, but I think I will give it a try with a longer steep to see if the weirdness reduces. Great concept but certainly doesn't live up to the hype for me."},{"user":"Katumbas","text":"Great recipe indeed! Flavorful and innovative. The balance is good but the Sweet Rice fades pretty fast. Great job."},{"user":"KylezKloudz","text":"This stuff is good! Never had the original dessert before, but you could definitely substitute this for eating it... Great use of FLV Mango in this recipe, it's the one that will hold up to the rice and give it that authentic Thai experience. Job well done!üëçüëç"},{"user":"jimbubba","text":"Definitely lives up to the hype! This is such an amazing juice. Even the dry hits taste better than most of the other vapes I've had. Shyndo is a true credit to the DIY community."},{"user":"corvape","text":"Excellent recipe. I brought in Flv Mango for this recipe and I am so glad I did, I do not usually care for Mango, but this recipe has for sure changed that opinion. The combination with the sweet rice and other supporting notes are perfectly balanced and make for a 5 star mix!"},{"user":"SatJoe563","text":"I ordered FE Sticky Rice and Flv Mango just to make this.  Well worth it for me.  I need new cotton to taste it like it should, but taste great after a strong marshmallow juice a I have.  Thanks for sharing this."},{"user":"SlashaLO","text":"This is a phenomenal mix. The sweet rice is extremely accurate, with a slight nutty taste. The coconuts are creamy and blend well with the starch/nutty feel from the rice. FLV Mango is just straight up amazing, thats all there is to it. FLV Cream really does bring the two ends of this mix together, so it did exactly as it should haha. Love this stuff"},{"user":"LimeDrive","text":"Trying as a shake and vape- wow. This is stupid good. Bright, realistic juicy mango and a rich sticky white rice base with a sweet and creamy coconut finish. Tastes like a gourmet dessert. Overdrip certified."},{"user":"Loonicorn","text":"This is delicious! The mango is sweet and juicy, the rice is nutty and complex, and the coconut is a nice subtle backdrop. It's delightfully different. I am so glad I bought a 30 mL of the Sticky Rice! I can vape this for days without needing a break from it. I will be mixing this one often. Thanks for the great recipe."},{"user":"heatbbx","text":"I went into this not knowing at all what to expect. I had never tried FLV Mango or FE Sweet Rice and they were the highlights of this show.&#xD;\n&#xD;\nThis tastes like sushi sticky rice with nice diced mango + mango syrup (the kinds you get at sushi/thai places) spread over it. Freaking delicious my man. So glad I picked up the stuff for it."},{"user":"ConcreteRiver","text":"WAS IT WORTH THE WAIT? Yeah, totally.  Rice here works really well off the shake.  Great coconut, works really well as a stand-in for a coconut milk.  Mango seems dead on as well.  Very pleasant, but not as a back-handed compliment.  It's just nice, and really well balanced, and it's basically mango sticky rice. I'd be worried about how it steeps out, but as a S&amp;V as suggested, I dig this.  I could do with just a tiny hint of butter or just a hair more richness... but I wouldn't want to do anything to mess with the balance here."},{"user":"FizzChaser","text":"Mind=Blown. The balance is absolute perfection. The taste is just as good! Great job Shyndo."},{"user":"Gonzilla","text":"Accurate, delicious and an out of the box profile that's definitely worth picking up Sticky Rice for. My friend had been craving the flavor since his honeymoon in Thailand and was really impressed with the translation from the dish. Said it took him right back to being there and didn't switch juice till his 30ml was finished."},{"user":"DigitalDrops","text":"The attevntion to balance in this recipe is more impressive than a fat chick I'ma unicycle crossing a highwire with lopsided tits . Unlike the fat chick who had plenty of practice shyndo could not have because of sweet rice becoming available  just  shortly before he released this recipe he has such command of the acommpaning  flavors that it seems like they were born to lay under the sweet rice and just sit there silently as the rice takes it . By the time he slipped in the mango it was already a felony so why not .  Needless to say that got weird. But he recipe did not maybe the best recipe of the year ,I can think  of a few that are close and they didn't even have a tight rope walking fatty in their review did they ........"},{"user":"Deweysuds","text":"5 stars under two weeks.  After that it falls apart a little, but is still a 4 star after two weeks.   "},{"user":"Chewymidget","text":"This has been my favorite use of FE Sweet Rice to date. Most mixes turn into a tortilla after a few days but this recipe is delicious and even better after a few days. It is layered perfectly with nothing standing on top, but rather, all melded together. Give this a shot and give yourself a break from the norm, you won't be disappointed!"},{"user":"Fear","text":"I have no clue how this turns out on a steep. I mixed  a 30 to try it out and vaped the entire thing on the shake to the end of the day. Got home that evening and mixed a 60, that lasted two days. This recipe alone is all the reason you need to order FE Sweet Rice. This mix is spot on Mango Sticky Rice. A fantastic treat for your face hole mouth place thingy. Beautifully balanced and layered to perfection."},{"user":"TamVapes","text":"Not knowing what to expect with the mystery flavor of 'sticky rice', this is absolutely amazing.  I fortunately mixed 60 ml.  I don't know if it will last the week.  Such a great unique, well balanced recepie.  Love it!"},{"user":"Apexified","text":"Accuracy, as other's have mentioned, is where this recipe really shines. But on top of that is balance and vapeability. I've mixed two bottles at this point with the intention of seeing how it steeps but neither ended up lasting more than 5 days. It's worth getting a bottle of FE Sweet Rice for this recipe alone."},{"user":"ID10-T","text":"This is a masterpiece, both in accuracy and flavor. I've struggled with the way FLV Mango tries to sit on top of a recipe and come up with some tricks for dragging it down into the mix, but here, it rests right on top of the rice base, the way mango with sticky rice should. And the coconuts and cream fresh are used perfectly to get that sticky rice down. So it's both layered and balanced exquisitely and despite being a relatively simple recipe, it tastes like a considerable amount of work went into it. If you've ever worked with coconuts, you KNOW a lot of work went into it. A reminder, though, to anyone reading this, pay attention to the \"this is not a recipe to throw in your steep cabinet\" instruction. The FA Coconut might help keep it together a little longer, but FE Sweet Rice will fall apart before too long. "},{"user":"Thadentman","text":"One of the most accurate vapes I ever had, Tastes exactly like the dish irl if mixed at 70/30. Great job!"},{"user":"LonesomeRhodesTN","text":"This juice is ridiculously good.  So good it's almost to the point of never having to eat mango sticky rice ever again . . . you can just vape it.  Right off the shake, this smells delicious. Tasting a drop on my finger . . . holy shit, this is mango sticky rice! Only store bought I've had was Craft Vapery's . . . this is 1000 times better. The rice is perfect . . . a generous portion acting as the base. The mango is sitting just on top of the rice, and it's all covered in a thick drizzle of coconut cream.  The sweetener is used to perfection . . . well placed and well thought out.  If you've never had mango sticky rice at a Thai restaurant . . . just mix this up, and you'll know exactly what you've been missing all this time!  This may be the most accurate vape representation of an actual food I've ever tried. "}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"56405","name":"Mango Sticky Rice"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
