Naturally I wanted to try to make some in a vape form.  However I have had better luck with the white chocolate than the milk chocolate varieties, so I went with that instead.   I used the WF-White Fudge as my base, and even though it is pretty tasty on its own, I felt like it needed more complexity.  I added VT-Love and FLV-White Chocolate to get a more accurate white chocolate profile.  The VT-Honeycomb helps add those golden notes you would get from cooking the butter and sugar.  One of the main components to homemade fudge is marshmallow cream which is why I added a bit of the OOO-Marshmallow (Vanilla).   It also adds some creamy mouthfeel as an added bonus.    Last but not least I used the FLV-Eggnog and LA-Butter Rum as the accent flavors for my fudge.  The end result is delightfully close to the real thing with considerably less calories!  This needs 3 days minimum for the LA-Butter Rum to settle in.  I used it low but it is strong stuff and has a chemical taste upfront.  It will taste better with more steeping but it is still pretty tasty from 3 days on.\r\n\r\n**Optional Ingredients:  This is fairly sweet on its own but fudge by nature is sickeningly sweet, so you may want to add some sweetener of your choice around 0.3-0.5%.  You could also try adding TPA-Holiday Spice 0.5%, FW-Pumpkin Spice 0.5% or FLV-Rich Cinnamon 0.1% if you want a little more spice in your mix.**","steep_days":"5","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T17:35:20.000-05:00","best_vg":"60%","views":"1664","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Butter Rum","flavor_id":"925","vendor":"LA","millipercent":400},{"name":"Eggnog","flavor_id":"4396","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Honeycomb","flavor_id":"8901","vendor":"VT","millipercent":1400},{"name":"Love DIY","flavor_id":"8920","vendor":"VT","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Marshmallow (Vanilla)","flavor_id":"1798","vendor":"OOO","millipercent":600},{"name":"White Chocolate","flavor_id":"4444","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":400},{"name":"White Fudge SC","flavor_id":"8383","vendor":"WF","millipercent":3000}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"127789","name":"Eggnog Fudge"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
