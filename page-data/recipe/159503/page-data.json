They both pack quite a realistic orange flavor so the Blood orange is the tart and the Sweet Tangerine is the high sweet note. Cap Juicy orange just to fill out that odd mid flavor and add some wetness.\r\n\r\nTFA Dragonfruit to help the oranges blend. I don't even taste it, but it's just a meshing flavor.\r\n\r\nSoda Base to give it that \"soda can\" texture and some sweetness, .5% Fizz Pop for a soda fizz. No coolant as I drink my soda warm, feel free to add WS-23 or koolada to your own preference.\r\n\r\nSNV, best after a day or two steep.\r\n\r\nSweetener to taste. Old school Fanta is way different than the stuff we get nowadays with real orange juice in it which is why I used a lot of proper orange flavoring instead of more imitations. To me Fanta is the best orange soda on the market today, I love it!\r\n\r\nInspired by: https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/32883#fantastic_a_fantasia_remix_by_dazcole","steep_days":"2 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T21:33:06.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"1388","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Blood Orange","vendor":"FA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Dragonfruit","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":100},{"name":"Sweet Tangerine","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1750},{"name":"Juicy Orange","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":500},{"name":"Soda Base","vendor":"RF","millipercent":500},{"name":"Fizz Pop","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":500},{"name":"Super Sweet","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":500}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"159503","name":"Fanta-asm (Revisited)"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
