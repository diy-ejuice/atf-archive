This one is mine. I derived this from ye ol' Mustard Milk, after messing around, adding and subtracting things over about a six month period of time. Less strawberry and more cream. \r\n\r\n\r\nCAP Sweet Strawberry and TFA Strawberry 1:1, I think, makes a great artificial strawberry flavor, and it's what I ended up settling on for this version. \r\n\r\n\r\nTFA VBIC at 6% makes a great creamy base for us. I apologize if you get pepper from it. It truly is a shame some people do. We add TFA Vanilla Swirl at 2% and CAP Sweet Cream at 2.5% to give us an excellent cream that is not too sweet, and loaded with plenty of vanilla.\r\n","steep_days":"7 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-01T16:12:03.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"1803","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Strawberry","flavor_id":"272","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Sweet Cream","flavor_id":"117","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Sweet Strawberry","flavor_id":"121","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Vanilla Bean Ice Cream","flavor_id":"186","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":6000},{"name":"Vanilla Swirl","flavor_id":"189","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2000}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"34364","name":"Strawberry SCREAM"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
