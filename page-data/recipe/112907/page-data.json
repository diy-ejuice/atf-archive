I decided to mix up a Babbling Beverage potion to cast a spell on someone.   I wanted to make something that was a bit like taking a hand full of gummy candies and put them into a syrupy drink.  The idea was to make a potion that tastes great and would allow the caster to successfully deliver the potion to their target in vapor form.  \r\n\r\nIf you like sweet commercial candy type vapes, this recipe is one that will be an all day vape in a tank kind of flavor.
