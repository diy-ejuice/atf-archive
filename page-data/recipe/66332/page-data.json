Its the first time I've used the flavor in a mix. Nothing too out of the ordinary in regards to flavors other than that.\r\n\r\nFLAVOR NOTES:\r\n\r\nJF Pink Burst @ 3.0%: PB is only decent on its own in regards to its strawberry notes. It is definitely useful for the chewy candy texture it brings to the table, though. Adding a small amount of JF Juicy Lemon adds a tiny bit of sweetness/wetness to the candy profile so we don't have to use sweetener. CAP Jelly Candy is a flavor I add to any candy type profile I'm going for, regardless of whether I'm specifically looking for \"jelly candy\" or not.\r\n\r\nJF Sweet Strawberry @ 2.0%: This is a candy recipe, so I didn't want to choose a fresh strawberry flavor. Sweet Strawberry is perfect for this, as its candy-like on its own, and brings its own sweetness into the fold.\r\n\r\nTPA Marshmallow @ 1.0%: Using this for more added sweetness and for a bit of body.","steep_days":"2","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T14:12:40.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"1551","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Pink Burst","vendor":"JF","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Juicy Lemon","vendor":"JF","millipercent":750},{"name":"Jelly Candy","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Sweet Strawberry","vendor":"JF","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Marshmallow","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Shisha Strawberry","vendor":"INW","millipercent":750}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"66332","name":"Deadlights"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
