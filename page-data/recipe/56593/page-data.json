To me it is more like a strawberry shortcake ice cream bar with tones of apricot and a hint of orange instead of the strawberry. It also ages very well if you steep it longer with the creams and fruits developing more fully. It never really hit yogurt town for me, but is enjoyable none the less."},{"user":"folkart","score":"5","text":"This is a wonderful bright, delicious profile. After vaping a lot of heavy bakeries, this was a welcomed change in flavor. Very well balanced and really enjoyed the orange. Very well done Luis!"},{"user":"wadeyloops","score":"none","text":""},{"user":"shakenvape007","score":"5","text":"Laudr, wow this mix caught me off my game. It is truly amazing. I loved the way you incorporated the orange into the mix. It brings the finished product to a whole new level. I'm not a yogurt fan but now I am!!!  Well done sir.
