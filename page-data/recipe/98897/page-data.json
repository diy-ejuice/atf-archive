It is a full, juicy, fresh orange with no artificial notes. This is straight up orange juice without the acidic notes or annoyingly sweetness present in most orange concentrates. There is a fabulous zesty back note which emphasizes its authenticity perfectly.\r\n\r\nSweet tangerine provides a familiar, but not distinguishable, sweet citrus taste and blends wonderfully well with the orange to give us a full, well rounded citrus feel and more importantly, the sweetness element.\r\n\r\nCap lemon lime brings that refreshing, sharp (but not too sharp) lemon flavor followed up with a sweet lime punch all in one. \r\nI could have gone for other, more pronounced lemon or lime flavors, but this baby just works so well in here that no other lemon is required.\r\n\r\nINW Grapefruit is undeniably grapefruit and brings the final citrus element in the way of bitterness. This beauty is very realistic and encapsulates a fresh, white, grapefruit perfectly, skin and all.\r\n\r\nFeel free to 0.5% WS23 or Koolada to make this a chilled version.\r\n\r\nThis baby needs 2 days or so for all the fruits to blend.","steep_days":"2 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"total_reviews":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T07:00:40.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"2386","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Shisha Orange","vendor":"INW","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Lemon Lime","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Sweet Tangerine","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Grapefruit","vendor":"INW","millipercent":1000}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"98897","name":"Awesome 4Some"}}}
