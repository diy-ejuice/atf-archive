I used this to boost the \"blueness\" in the recipe.\r\n\r\nTPA-Blackberry-(0.15%)-****Be careful with this one do not over use it is very potent** **I used the Blackberry as the main blue note because I pick up some florals out of it ,which sings with the hibiscus beautifully. (The blackberry has a tendency to stick to whatever you put it on)\r\n\r\nTPA-Hibiscus-(1.5%)-Big Shout out to Edible Malfunction for pointing me toward this hibiscus and away from FLV, compared to how the FLV was making this mix taste like i was eating the stem with everything this work a lot better but can be perfumery at high %(Not Saying FLV is bad but for this mix for me it just didnt work)\r\n\r\n(Removed 10/6/19 because of fading) LA-Lemonade-(2.25%)-This is my Lemonade base to provide that tartness I need to counter all the sweetness in this recipe.\r\nFLV Lemonade-(2%)- As a replacement for the LA Lemonade I kept having fading issues with it this also bring some juiciness to the mix \r\n\r\nCAP-Hibiscus-(1%)-Serves dual functions as an accent to the TPA hibiscus and an emulsifier to help everything blend.\r\n\r\nTPA-Strawberry Ripe-(1%)-helps make everything pop and bring some sweetness to the party.\r\n\r\nVT Yellow  Passion Fruit-(0.25%)- to give it more of a tropical body (did experiment with FLV Boysenberry, FA Passion Fruit , VT Passion Fruit and FLV Passionfruit)  Felt like this one fit the best and joined with the florals,\r\n\r\nFWIW I feel like this capture the drink perfectly if there is anything u guys think i can sub to make it better etc. please lmk =]\r\n\r\nI used  1 drop cap super sweet per 30 ml you can add WS-23 to your liking hope you enjoy as much as I did working on it then finally getting it the way i wanted\r\n\r\nStarbucks Drink Inspiration- https://www.starbucks.com/menu/drinks/refreshers/very-berry-hibiscus-lemonade-starbucks-refreshers-beverage","steep_days":"2 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T17:35:55.000-05:00","best_vg":"74%","views":"1074","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Bilberry Ripe","flavor_id":"9886","vendor":"VT","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Blackberry","flavor_id":"214","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":150},{"name":"Hibiscus","flavor_id":"237","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Lemonade","flavor_id":"636","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Hibiscus","flavor_id":"72","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Strawberry (ripe)","flavor_id":"271","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Yellow Passion","flavor_id":"9367","vendor":"VT","millipercent":250}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"166558","name":"Very Berry Hibiscus Lemonade "}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
