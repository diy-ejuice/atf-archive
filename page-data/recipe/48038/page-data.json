I've been working on a version of this for a bit, and just got it like I wanted it.  The homework timing was a happy convenience.  This is not the traditional coconut-heavy snow cone tiger blood, I actually wanted the watermelon up front.\r\n\r\nTPA Coconut:  I used this instead of coconut extra because I wanted the watermelon to be the star of the show.  This lends just enough coconut flavor to know it's there.\r\nTPA Dragonfruit:  Accents the strawberry and adds a touch of juiciness to the mix\r\nTPA Strawberry:  I didn't actually try any other strawberry flavors for this.  My worry was that any other would either be too sweet, too strong, or too pink for this.  I may do a version of this with Straw Ripe just to see what happens.\r\nPUR Watermelon:  This is the watermelon I've been looking for.  Sweet and candylike without the qualities that annoy the hell out of me in TFA watermelon.  I did a batch of this with CAP double watermelon as well and it was okay, but this tastes better and more well-rounded to me.","steep_days":"1 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-02T15:33:37.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"1860","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Coconut","flavor_id":"317","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Dragonfruit","flavor_id":"226","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Strawberry","flavor_id":"272","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":5500},{"name":"Watermelon","flavor_id":"7797","vendor":"PUR","millipercent":6000}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"48038","name":"Tiger's Blood"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
