Don't look for a heavy cookie note, as you may not get it. I was moreso looking for the gooey part of the cookie which is a caramel/coconut/buttery concoction on the top layer of the cookie. This recipe is very sweet, as the picture would imply so also be aware of that. All that being said, I think it's good. Definitely reminds me of the GS cookies. \r\n\r\n*I mix low percentage wise, you will probably need to increase up to double what I did*\r\n\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k76C9p4buyM","steep_days":"5","temperature":"0","recipe_score":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-10T13:45:29.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"1384","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Biscuit","flavor_id":"642","vendor":"INW","millipercent":750},{"name":"Butterscotch","flavor_id":"613","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":250},{"name":"Caramel Coffee with Sweet Milk","flavor_id":"7748","vendor":"PUR","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Dessicated Coconut","flavor_id":"9362","vendor":"VT","millipercent":800},{"name":"Vanilla Ice Cream","flavor_id":"1511","vendor":"LB","millipercent":1000}],"reviews":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"105873","name":"Samoa Shake"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
