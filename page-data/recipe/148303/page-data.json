Just used to break the monotony of the tequila. The flavours i selected to use with the tequila sits almost on the same spectrum and i needed something to just give the base some body and depth. \r\n\r\nCAP Super Sweet\r\nAlong with the Citus soda helps give sweeteness and depth\r\n\r\nFA Lime Cold Pressed\r\nJust a dash of juicy lime to sharpen the profile. I chose cold pressed because its a nice sweet and juice lime. Not too zetsy, and no real bitterness. Didnt want to overload as the tequila is plenty bitter already. \r\n\r\nTop Notes\r\n\r\nFA Blood Orange\r\nThis is the star of the show. I love love FA blood orange. Sweet, crisp, loads of citrus high notes and not too deep \"red toned\" if that makes sense... I wanted a mid to high tone note here... To almost sit on the same spectrum as the tequila.\r\n\r\nAccent\r\n\r\nFW Ginger\r\nAgain sits on the same spectum as the blood orange and tequila. Together they come accross muddled and they almost translate to a new, unique flavour.Linear, dryish ginger with a tame ginger bite. \r\n\r\nNote: ws-23 is a 25% dilution","steep_days":"2 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-05T02:14:20.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"900","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Blood Orange","vendor":"FA","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Tequila Agave","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":350},{"name":"Citrus Soda","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Ginger","vendor":"FW","millipercent":500},{"name":"Lime Tahity Cold Pressed","vendor":"FA","millipercent":350},{"name":"Super Sweet","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":500},{"name":"WS-23","vendor":"OTHR","millipercent":500}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"148303","name":"Bloody Ginger Reeta"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
