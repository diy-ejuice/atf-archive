This is my second version of Lemon Tart Cracked! I found that the first version did not steep as well using the tpa lemon/lime and fa lemon sicily. It had a very strong lemon/lime zest to it making it bitter and harsh. This version still has a bit of a throat hit on the first few hits but smoothes out after a bit. And a few days steep it gets even better. I believe fe lemon is the correct lemon to use for this mix as it doesn't have a lot of the zest. \r\nInhale you get a slight zest from the lemon and on the exhale a nice tart and creamy lemon with a crisp \"graham cracker-like\" crust without having to use graham cracker. The fa apple pie and cap cereal 27 does this nicely. The tpa greek yogurt adds a very slight tanginess that sits well with the fa meringue, and who doesn't love meringue. Just a touch of sweetener to liven it up a little and you have a great adv for the hot weather to come. \r\nYou can also add .5% tpa vanilla bean gelato to add a eggy note to the recipe if you're looking to get a bit more of a custard flavor, but I prefer it without the VBG.\r\nGood as a shake and vape but only gets better with a few days steep. Please comment, mix, and or rate, it makes us all better mixers.\r\nPS I have a pg sensitivity so all my recipes are maxvg. I haven't tried this with adding pg, so if anyone mixes this with adding pg please let me know your thoughts. Enjoy :)","steep_days":"3 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"updated_at":"2020-12-12T15:39:15.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"2211","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Greek Yogurt","flavor_id":"173","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Meringue","flavor_id":"530","vendor":"FA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Apple Pie","flavor_id":"551","vendor":"FA","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Cereal 27","flavor_id":"4163","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Sweetener","flavor_id":"339","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Lemon","flavor_id":"1655","vendor":"FE","millipercent":2000}],"reviews":[{"user":"diesel223","text":"This is a delicious and refreshing light vape when I need a break from the heavy bakeries.
