I hope this is the last cold day in NYC. Here's to the summer. \r\n\r\nI also said I'd be delving into fruits so here's another one.\r\n\r\nMy clone of Naked's Hawaiian POG. This is not 100% there but it is close. \r\n\r\nI originally used FW blood orange but found it too top heavy and hard to balance, it either gets lost or gets weird. FA orange was on my shelf so I gave that a go in this version and it sits perfectly here. The recipe is built around CAP sweet guava and wow what a nice flavor it is. The FA orange is sweet, not  really tart and doesn't get in the way of the passion fruit being all tart/sour and what not. I am having a hard time putting this one down. That lil bit of TFA marshmallow goes a long way taming the passion fruit and getting rid of some of the sharp edges. \r\n\r\nGolden Pineapple just adds to the tropical vibe and without it there had seemed to be something missing, even though you don't really taste pineapple here.\r\n\r\nThis is version 2 for me after about 5-6 variations, can't say that i want to change anything about this because it's really damn good. \r\n\r\nAnother shake and vape for sure.\r\n","steep_days":"1 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"updated_at":"2020-12-12T10:33:21.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"4425","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Orange","flavor_id":"500","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Passion (passionfruit)","flavor_id":"585","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Sweet Guava","flavor_id":"118","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Marshmallow","flavor_id":"332","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":250},{"name":"Golden Pineapple","flavor_id":"61","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1000}],"reviews":[{"user":"Bukah","text":"Addicting, so delicious, I love it.","score":5}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"37750","name":"New York POG"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
