Formerly part of my Twisted Imagination one shot range at ChefsFlavours.co.uk\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFor me this needs at least 4 weeks to blend together and for the toffee and hazelnut to come out completely, however some have been enjoying this off a shake.\r\n\r\nI was sat drinking a Latte made with hazelnut and toffee syrup and found myself thunking this would make a great vape, this is my attempt to re-create that profile\r\n\r\nThe coffee backbone is made up of OSDIY Lotta Latte, a pleasant and creamy latte on it's own, used here at 2.5% for the robusta coffee and that little bit of cream for a latte, used higher than this it just made the coffee too strong and wiped out all the other flavours. If you can't get OSDIY, VT Caffe Latte should be a decent sub but use at 1%-1.5%\r\n\r\nTo this 0.25% VT Arabica darkens up the coffee with the strong roasted black arabica beans, this increases the strength of the coffee in the mix without overpowering everything.\r\n\r\nNow with the nice strong coffee base notes I needed to make it creamier so 3% VT Hokey Pokey Ice Cream (This tastes identical to VT Toffee Ice Cream so use instead if you can't get hokey pokey) is added, this gives a pleasant, sweet and creamy Ice Cream into the mix as well as the added bonus of adding the toffee, used lower than 3% it doesn't add enough toffee and higher than 3% it makes this more of a coffee flavoured ice cream.\r\n\r\nFor the hazelnut FW Creamy Hazelnut was the perfect choice at 1.5% this adds a realiatic Hazelnut with a creamy mouthfeel, the creaminess adds into the ice cream and starts to take it away from ice cream and more towards cream.\r\nTFA Vanilla Swirl used at 2% to blend it all together and further steer the Ice Cream to a straight cream while adding more vanilla notes.","steep_days":"30","temperature":"0","recipe_score":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-12T17:13:01.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"1734","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Lotta Latte","flavor_id":"4348","vendor":"OSD","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Arabica Coffee","flavor_id":"8822","vendor":"VT","millipercent":250},{"name":"Creamy Hazelnut","flavor_id":"1265","vendor":"FW","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Hokey Pokey Ice Cream","flavor_id":"10018","vendor":"VT","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Vanilla Swirl","flavor_id":"189","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2000}],"reviews":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"181186","name":"Toffee Nut Latte"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
