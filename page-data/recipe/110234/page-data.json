This is my take on that   with the fruit soaked in spiced rum.   \r\nWild melon is a just a solid all around  ripe melon mix   that I enjoy, if you want to bring out  more cantaloupe or honeydew feel free to add that to this mix, but I just wanted a blended melon  that sits  in the middle of this mix \r\nThe pineapple adds some top notes and  add brightness  to the mix\r\nThe rum and the milk and honey add the  dark spicy  sweetness that acts as a nice contrast to the lime and mint  as well as adding some body \r\nLime and mint   help to add a finish to this mix  and balance out the darker sweet notes -   Add sweetener to taste\r\nThis is just a lovely mix that is well balanced  and  addictive for me \r\n\r\nLooking to learn  more about  making your own mixes - Check out what DIY Downunder has to offer:\r\nFacebook group : https://www.facebook.com/groups/diydownunder/\r\nDoscord:  https://discord.gg/kH4Fqbc\r\nYourtube channel:  https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCTCwb7ULyfJALQlehomZZQA \r\nWebsite :  https://www.diydownunder.com","steep_days":"3 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-11T16:20:40.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"1637","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Golden Pineapple","flavor_id":"61","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":3500},{"name":"Jamaica Special (jamaica Rhum)","flavor_id":"521","vendor":"FA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Lime Tahity Cold Pressed","flavor_id":"581","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1300},{"name":"Milk & Honey","flavor_id":"609","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Mint","flavor_id":"683","vendor":"INW","millipercent":500},{"name":"Wild Melon","flavor_id":"619","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":2500}],"reviews":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"110234","name":"Havana Nights "}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
