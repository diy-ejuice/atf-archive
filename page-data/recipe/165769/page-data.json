If your a fan of these 2 flavours I really do recommend you give this one a go,Iâ€™m really happy with it thus far. You can S&V this sucker but naturally it will only  get better and better. Please rate my recipe and leave a review for the world to see.

Great play with the chocolate and coconut here. Finally got coconut custard was looking for a play on that so ended up here as I had everything else. Was concerned about the flavor percent being low but made it up anyways in a 30. Now wish it was a 60! Creamy, flavors all play great together with coconut being the focus which is another reason for the 5 star. The name. What I get out of this is the chocolates adding to the depth of the coconut. It's creamy coconut done well. Yet another layer of depth to this mix is the toasted almond. It needs to be there as support. From inhale to exhale fantastic mix, thanks for sharing, adv for sure. Mixing more soon. I tried after a week steep and will let it sit a little longer to see what happens. "},{"user":"DixxleRoo","text":"Really, really nice rich chocolate and definitely get the coconut. You have to like FLV Choc Deutsch as itâ€™s quite prominent- but that seems to be true of whatever you put it in. This recipe is really yummy- Iâ€™ll definitely make it again. Thanks for uploading it.   "},{"user":"JustMixIt","text":"Really liking this one! The combination of Chocolates is awesome.
