Figured what the hell. This was born shortly after. I'm not a big cereal fan for vapes, the custard& sweet cream really cut back the crunch berry and blends it nicely with the brown sugar into that last few spoonfuls of milk. The Rich cinnamon and zepolla add that donut type taste to it. It's been in rotation for a few weeks now.\r\n\r\nAlso add 3 drops per 30ml of TFA kettle corn to round out the crunch berry cereal milk taste","steep_days":"2","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"total_reviews":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T09:26:10.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"1532","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Brown Sugar","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Capt.crunch Berries","vendor":"FW","millipercent":5000},{"name":"Rich Cinnamon","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":300},{"name":"Sweet Cream","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Vanilla Custard","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Zeppola","vendor":"FA","millipercent":4000}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"26501","name":"Cruchberry Milk and Donuts"}}}
