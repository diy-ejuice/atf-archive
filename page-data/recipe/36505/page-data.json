Not a bad trade, and an easy decision in my mind.\r\n\r\nWhy not combine my recipe with a variable ingredient, with a recipe that is, in itself, a variable ingredient?\r\n\r\nI present a *modified* Cliche(dropped the fruit values because I didn't want 25% flavor) mixed with the regular old Strap-On.

The flavors come through so distinct. Even with just a short steep2 days so far. This recipe is nothing short of amazing. These flavors meld together so well. The use of the strawberry ripe really helps to pop this recipe to something so unique. With every strap on recipe I always get almost that exact Fuji taste with nothing else. This has so much more. The Raspberry sweet gives it a nice tart without taking anything away from the mix. The use of the ice cream along with cream fresh is just amazing making this an absolute ADV for me. It's just so tasty and so good perfect use of the creams together to make this recipe fantastic. I get that nice strawberry/watermelon on the palette with a nice crisp refreshing apple on the exhale. This revoke is perfectly Sweetneend and is just so good. Thanks for a new recipe that will be in my daily rotation. 5/5"},{"user":"super8line","text":"When I saw this recipe I honestly didn't think I'd ever mix it nor would it be good.  But after the rave review from ID10-T I decided to try it and wow am I glad I did. This stuff is awesome! Completely different than my other strap on over tried and definitely one of the best. "},{"user":"Reldof","text":"Ok, why haven't this been mixed and reviewed more? ID10-T said this was his favorite strap on so I had to try it. Its a really nice strap on you get a pretty solid strap on flavor with a tart, raspberry and strawberry milk addition. Overall really nice and could be a lot better with another flavor addition IMO (gonna try FW Shirley Temple). Personally I like my strap on better but this one's the third best one after Suckle my Manly Strap On."},{"user":"ID10-T","text":"Wow. I am impressed, even with just an overnight steep - and I imagine it will only get better with time. I was definitely skeptical about this one, even with Skiddlzninja's name on it. I thought it might be too busy with the fruit notes or have something pop out as being out of place. Did he even try or was he just throwing some shit together to keep up his end of a strange bargain? But all my doubts have been laid to rest. It's a bit weird, yes, but in the best possible way. None of the fruit notes really stand out, they all sort of melt together into this big, somewhat candyfied fruit something. Best way I can describe it... Remember when you were a kid and your grandparents dragged you to one of those bland, disgusting cafeteria-type restaurants, like Golden Feeding Trough or whatever, and they had soft-serve ice cream and a ridiculous array of various toppings, gummy bears and sprinkles and fruits and even freakin' gumballs, and being a kid (who either trusted with the innocence of a child the effectiveness of those sneeze guards, or simply didn't think about them at all) you just loaded that shit up with all kinds of crap? And you loved every single bit of it so much that your little heart was just bursting with love for grandparents and ice cream and fruity candy? That's what this is. Every hit of this is an instant trip back in time to eating that bowl of wonderful, ridiculously-topped soft serve. Skiddlz earned those scotches, for sure.
