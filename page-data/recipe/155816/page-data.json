It is much less expensive to try it in a vape first, and it really works!  Not too sweet and a real change of pace from the typical pineapple vape.\r\n\r\nI used VT Creaming Soda as the beverage base and punched it up with two pineapples, FLV and INW.  I tried several almond flavors, and settled on the clean FA Almond.  I did not want to add more brightness with the stone fruits, so I chose FA Apricot.\r\n\r\nTested on a Pixie, 0.38 ohm, 40 watts","steep_days":"1","temperature":"0","recipe_score":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-12T18:30:29.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"1107","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Almond","flavor_id":"528","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Armenia (apricot)","flavor_id":"507","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Creaming Soda","flavor_id":"8862","vendor":"VT","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Pineapple","flavor_id":"4428","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Pineapple","flavor_id":"809","vendor":"INW","millipercent":4000}],"reviews":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"155816","name":"Sandy Pineapple"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
