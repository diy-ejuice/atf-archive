Vape it. Love it. Inhale my juice. This was the recipe I submitted for the inaugural DIYorDIE mixer's competition. Mix it up, let it sit for a few days and let me know what you guys think. If you're one of the unfortunate people that gets a pepper taste from TFA Vanilla Bean Ice Cream, I'm sure you could substitute for CAP's version. However, the TFA VBIC at a low percentage really blends in well with everything else and lends a buttery hand to the Vanilla Custard and Butter Cream. Try my version first then if needed, substitute TFA VBIC for CAP's version.

Only thing I'd update is the apple to something more modern like Country Apple (PUR).","score":4},{"user":"LianazVapin","text":"Goldfish18, I am enjoying this recipe, thanks for a great vape. I had the pleasure of receiving your one shots from a friend to try and I am very impressed. I don't have a bunch of fancy words for you, and they already exist in the reviews here! So I can tell everyone to mix this, you won't be disappointed!","score":5},{"user":"kawinskim7","text":"After seeing this hundreds of times, I finally decided to mix it.  I subbed out the 1% VBIC for WF Tahitian Vanilla Cream at 0.25% and LB Vanilla Ice Cream at 0.5%, and dropped the FA Fuji to 2.75%.  FA Fuji gets too sharp for me above 3%, and I get disgusting pepper from VBIC.  Holy hell is this a masterful mix though.  Well done, man.  Right off the shake it's a nice, soft, smooth and buttery spiced apple butter!  Can't wait to see what it's like after a week or more!","score":5},{"user":"TapersVongue","text":"Really good. No off flavors, very smooth and well balanced. ","score":5},{"user":"Katumbas","text":"Great take on this profile. Liquid Amber does wonders with Fuji but at 4% is too much for me so I decrease to 2%. Gongrats and once again great job!","score":4},{"user":"elsignor","text":"","score":4},{"user":"Mr-G","text":"Very tasty","score":5},{"user":"ObiWanCannoli","text":"This is a prime example of master level mixing. The balance is amazing, the flavor is on point and it's intriguing from the first puff until the bottle is empty. I like to fall back on this recipe whenever I get frustrated or bored with my own and other people's recipes. Easy 5 stars right here. In all honesty though, I dropped the Fuji down to 3% for my personal taste as I found it just a bit too strong. Otherwise this is an amazing piece of art. Well done and keep up the great mixing!","score":5},{"user":"Bradmaden","text":"This recipe has been done so well, its very often in my daily rotation, thanks for sharing!

Awesomely layered - it's one of the few recipes where you can taste every flavor distinctly.","score":5},{"user":"heatbbx","text":"This is delicious, even as a S&amp;V and moreso after 7 days. Tastes just like I'd expect an apple butter to taste and I ripped through a full 60 mL.&#xD;\n5*","score":5},{"user":"gilbert","text":"Cant get enough of this. One of my favorites. Amazing work.","score":5},{"user":"BuryMeInSmoke","text":"The FA Amber and FA Fuji combo is devine.  The Amber and FA Caramel really takes the brightness from the Fuji and cooks it down.  Perfect amount of CAP CDS as well, just enough to add a hint of cinnamon without being overbearing and 'dusty'.","score":5},{"user":"HerrHut","text":"Nice use of Fuji.

","score":5},{"user":"Richm20","text":"LOVE IT! My ADV has been Muffin Man for a LONG time. Rarely got away from it as it had \"something about it\" Mixed up 30ml of this and though \"I think I found my replacement\" Then I did another batch but bumped the Cinnamon Danish swirl up to .75 and the butter to 2.5 and im in love. I love the DCS so i may bring that up to 1 and see how that comes out. Great as a SAV but after just a few days its already getting better.","score":5},{"user":"bonniefcrawford","text":"","score":5},{"user":"altneurose","text":"Even though this is way too much Fuji for me to handle, even after a month, it's still an amazing use of Fuji and a great vape.","score":4},{"user":"RobS","text":"mixed my first batch of this 4 months ago and still enjoy it today.&#xD;\nso to add to all the previous praise i'd say this has \"staying power\" not many recipes i enjoy this much for this long.","score":5},{"user":"ali","text":"nothing left to say that wasn't said before...","score":5},{"user":"Nugget40","text":"Delicious, rich, buttery apple...enough has been said about this recipe, just mix it","score":5},{"user":"Hawger03","text":"I absolutely love this juice!

This is a truly remarkable recipe, there needs to be way to give more than 5 stars to this one. It does need about a 5 day steep to reach perfection. And after that I can imagine it might not be a strong steeper, but I'll probably never know how long it can last because it's too good to put down.
