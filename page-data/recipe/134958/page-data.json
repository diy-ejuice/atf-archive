I have only had a cannoli once and it was a LONG time ago.. so I googled and one of the more popular versions has chocolate in it. I don't like mixing w/ chocolate flavors because they tend to get muddy... so I figured this was a good opportunity to try the Cookie Crust, hoping it'd be more like crumbs than a liquid chocolate mess. I was lucky because it's exactly what I wanted, a chocolate cookie dusting. The inside of the cannoli, I used WF buttercream because it's thick and good but not too sweet (VT's version is VERY Sweet) and added New York cheesecake as the \"cheese-like\" component. Overall I really like it. It's fairly simple but tastes fairly complex. It's similar to the Cassadaga's version w/ the chocolate chips except better because it's less busy and vapes cleaner.
