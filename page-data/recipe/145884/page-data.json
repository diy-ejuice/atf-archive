I chose **EM** as my sweetener because it tends to thicken custards/puddings in addition to providing sweetness.\r\n  \r\nThe pistachio portion of my pudding is formed with **FA Almond**, **INW Marzipan**, and of course **TFA Pistachio**. I purposely did NOT use FA Marzipan, as INW's version provides a more creamy feel.\r\n  \r\nOur 'pudding' base is formed with both **FLV Vanilla Pudding** and **INW Shisha Vanilla**. The INW SV adds a slight boost to the vanilla pudding which was very useful in this recipe.\r\n  \r\n**STEEP: 9 DAYS(steeping with this particular mix is a must!)**\r\n  \r\n**VG 80%**\r\n\r\nAs always, please dont use free offerings of recipes for commercial gain & dont post to other websites without permission. \r\n  \r\n**E-JuiceMakers**\r\n","steep_days":"9","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-06T22:03:19.000-05:00","best_vg":"80%","views":"1703","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Vanilla Pudding","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":3500},{"name":"Shisha Vanilla","vendor":"INW","millipercent":500},{"name":"Marzipan","vendor":"INW","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Almond","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Pistachio","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Ethyl Maltol","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":500}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"145884","name":"PÜDIO"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
