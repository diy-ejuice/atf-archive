It is a bakery-type cinnamon that is perfect for spiced beverages that mixes extremely well with the next spice. \r\nFA Cardamom at .5% is a sweet, green, true cardamom flavor that no other company does. Thank goodness FlavourArt does it right. You cannot have a chai recipe without cardamom.\r\nFW Ginger has a fresh ginger root flavor. Too much, even .5%, can over take the mix. I found the sweet spot for this mix to be .25%\r\nTPA Holiday Spice at .5% stands in for my Nutmeg spice. I love this flavor for any winter recipe.\r\nFLV Clove at .30% is perfect to make this bold and spicy. Someone once said, \"FLV Clove is pretty damn analogous to FLV Rich Cinnamon in that it's bold, ridiculously strong, way too expensive, and pretty great.\" I fully agree.\r\nThe last one I am sure has a lot of people scratching their heads. FA Black Pepper at .5%. It's a warm, woody spice that is a delicious addition to this recipe.\r\n\r\nThen I added the FA Black Tea and made it sweet; And for the milk component, I went with FA Vienna Cream 1%, which really stands out when you add spice, FA Vanilla Tahity .5% for sweetness, and FA Cream Fresh 1.0% for bulk.\r\n\r\nThis puppy needs a 5 day steep and a day or so to breathe. *Do not skip the breathing. It needs to breathe off some spice.*\r\n\r\nI wouldn't say it's an ADV, but it's definitely tasty with the cool weather coming.\r\n\r\n-vix","steep_days":"5","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"total_reviews":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T19:15:45.000-05:00","best_vg":"%","views":"1136","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Pepper Black","vendor":"FA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Tea Black Water Soluble","vendor":"FA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Cardamom","vendor":"FA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Cinnamon Ceylon","vendor":"FA","millipercent":750},{"name":"Clove","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":300},{"name":"Ginger","vendor":"FW","millipercent":250},{"name":"Holiday Spice","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Super Sweet","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":500},{"name":"Vanilla Tahity","vendor":"FA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Vienna Cream","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Cream Fresh","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"121744","name":"Masala Chai Latte"}}}
