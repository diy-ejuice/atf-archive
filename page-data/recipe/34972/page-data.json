So everyone seems to be after this recipe and I was inspired by the last live mixing where we all talked about what to put in the new recipe with Wayne. So my base is completely different but the inspired parts are the FW - Graham cracker (Which could be halfed) and FW - Butter Pecan and to me they seal the deal.. a few tweaks and to me this is spot on the OG Duchess.. I left it unsweetened to see what the body does, but if you want to vape it a little now its gonna need cap ss at 0.5-1%","steep_days":"7 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"updated_at":"2020-12-12T10:14:21.000-05:00","best_vg":"80%","views":"2522","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Vanilla Custard","flavor_id":"131","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Dulce De Leche","flavor_id":"1273","vendor":"FW","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Butterscotch Ripple","flavor_id":"1217","vendor":"FW","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Graham Cracker","flavor_id":"1297","vendor":"FW","millipercent":1400},{"name":"Butter Pecan","flavor_id":"1212","vendor":"FW","millipercent":2000}],"reviews":[{"user":"RedHerring","text":"Wow!
