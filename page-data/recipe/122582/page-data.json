This is one of my failed attempts at it. I mixed my 3rd 30ml today so I figured I'd share, just in case someone craves pears as much as I do.\r\n\r\nIf you grew up eating canned pears, like me, cause your dad wasn't around, try this out.

Part of me was pissed off that someone misplaced it and that I didn't know I had a can of pears, but I decided to focus on the prize I had been awarded.   Now I'm not much of a fruit vaper.  I'm a custard, vanilla, butterscotch and caramel seeker but sometimes you need to break up the monotony.  I've found that I quite enjoy apple, blueberry, and pear vapes.    This recipe is straight up fucking delicious.  The pears and the cream are in harmony and the sweetness of .25% is dialed in and compliments the authentic pear experience.  This is good to go off the shake.  Very wet/moist feel almost as if there was Cactus in there.  I don't think this batch will last 5 days.  Even if your not a big fruit vaper like myself, I guaranteee you'll love it.  I thought Commodore Pearry was good, but this recipe blows that one away."}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"122582","name":"All The Pear"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
