I know that is subjective, but I can't get enough of this flavor.  This is one of the first recipes I tried on my own and the one that demonstrated to me the power of DIY.  I was hooked.\r\n\r\nMost everyone is familiar with TPA RY4 Double.  Mild tobacco flavor with a double dose of caramel and vanilla.  You can see this is the front flavor leading the way.  The TPA Graham Cracker Clear is adding a bit of texture to the caramel and tobacco and the TPA Vanilla Swirl is lifting up the vanilla notes on the RY4 a little and adding some additional smoothness and body to the overall recipe.\r\n\r\nIt's another simple recipe and most DIY'ers should have these flavors as staples in their arsenal.  If you decide to try it let me know what you think.  Feel free to tinker with it and let me know what else you could see changed.\r\n\r\nI was thinking maybe a touch of Acetyl Pyrazine?  Maybe some FLV Milk & Honey?","steep_days":"7","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:51:14.000-05:00","best_vg":"80%","views":"2106","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Ry4 Double","flavor_id":"379","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":6000},{"name":"Graham Cracker Clear","flavor_id":"325","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Vanilla Swirl","flavor_id":"189","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1500}],"reviews":[{"user":"natemaia","text":""},{"user":"robolto78","text":"Of the shake, its your standard RY4 flavor. Give it about 5 days though and that vanilla and graham really start to make a difference. I am truly surprised that no one has left a review yet.  This is a simple, yet tasty recipe that even the newest of mixers can enjoy. Appropriately named, It's Worthy. Great mix!"}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"175429","name":"It's Worthy"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
