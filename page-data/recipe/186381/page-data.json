A wish for Mark Clough!\r\n\r\nFresh made a donation and requested a French pastry from me. I know Fresh is a breakfast pastry lover so I chose a traditional, delicious French breakfast pastry called 'pain aux raisins' or 'currant bread' in English. It's a lovely flaky pastry jammed with custard and raisins and a nice sweet sugar glaze on top. This is how we made it, with the help of @TamVapes:\r\n\r\nWF Croissant/VT Croissant/JF Biscuit = for the pastry which is strong and buttery.\r\n\r\nWF Caramel Butter = has the job of adding butter, that little browning of flaky pastry and some sweetness on top.\r\n\r\nFA Custard Premium/LB Vanilla Ice Cream/FLV Vanilla Pudding = that's Fresh's quick custard which is well eggy and vanilla reach which is what we want.\r\n\r\nFLV Raisin Rum/FLV Sweet Fig= for the raisins and the currants and that dash of rum in every custard-filled viennoiserie in France.\r\n\r\nI hope you enjoy it and Fresh too!\r\n\r\nBe Queer & vape on,\r\n\r\nC. aka Queer Your Vape\r\n\r\n[Photo credits = www.thespruceeats.com]","steep_days":"5","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"total_reviews":1,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:51:24.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"814","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Croissant SC","vendor":"WF","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Biscuit","vendor":"JF","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Caramel Butter","vendor":"WF","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Custard Premium","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Vanilla Ice Cream","vendor":"LB","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Sweet Fig","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Raisin Rum","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":750},{"name":"Vanilla Pudding","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":500},{"name":"Croissant","vendor":"VT","millipercent":2000}],"reviews":[{"user":"TamVapes","score":"5","text":"Just mixed, is excellent off the shake.
