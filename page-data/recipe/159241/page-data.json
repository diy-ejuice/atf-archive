The addition of FLV smoked butterscotch adds the toasted smoked notes. TFA Irish cream is an old trick of mine used in small amounts to boost and deepen the butterscotch notes. I used FA Capuchino for the main sweet slightly creamy coffee notes and boosted it with a little Dark bean in order to push the coffee through the dense butterscotch notes. \r\nI felt it needs some additional undescriptive cream notes without too much of a heavy vanilla and without adding additional heavy cream notes, so I combined cream fresh and Vanilla Ice cream from FA since both those creams are light and milky. TFa toasted marshmallow is in the mix as the sweetener and to add another layer of toasted notes.
