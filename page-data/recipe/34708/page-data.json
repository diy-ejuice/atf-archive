It smells just like eggnog to me, with that delicious nutmeg smell, so I figured I would try to make something tasty out of it. Here's the breakdown of everything here. I may change stuff up, but I feel like this version is delicious enough to warrant a post. You can always up the Cin danish to get a little more kick out of it. It needs some time to steep, for everything to mend together but it is well worth it.\r\n\r\nCinnamon Danish Swirl + Holiday Spice = The eggnog spice section, I wanted to give a little spiced edge to the base because what's eggnog without a little bit of cinnamon? The danish swirl also contributes a little bit to the cookie aspect as well.\r\n\r\nMadagascar + Milk and Honey + Vanilla Custard = This makes a super delicious creamy filling to it, like an actual eggnog feel, thick in all the right places, and a nice vanilla flavor. it blends really well with the holiday spice and cinnamon danish swirl to create that delicious eggnog taste.\r\n\r\nSugar Cookie = Well it's an Eggnog Sugar cookie, so of course I needed to use this, it's delicious, creamy, sweet, the perfect component.","steep_days":"7","temperature":"0","recipe_score":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-12T01:40:25.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"1378","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Cinnamon Danish Swirl","flavor_id":"35","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":750},{"name":"Holiday Spice","flavor_id":"305","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Madagascar (Vanilla Classic)","flavor_id":"526","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Milk & Honey","flavor_id":"609","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":750},{"name":"Sugar Cookie","flavor_id":"115","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":3500},{"name":"Vanilla Custard","flavor_id":"131","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":2000}],"reviews":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"34708","name":"Eggnog Sugar Cookie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
