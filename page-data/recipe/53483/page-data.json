A unique strawberry syrup, a realistic freeze-dried strawberry, and a candy strawberry that puts CAP Sweet Strawberry to shame. \r\n\r\nThis was a first attempt at recreating a Strawberry Slurpee. Missed the mark, still hits the spot for a sweet, refreshing summer strawberry recipe.  Sharing because even though it's what you might call a failed early version, it tasted so good I didn't want to put it down. When you mix up something like that, the profile goal suddenly seems so unimportant.
