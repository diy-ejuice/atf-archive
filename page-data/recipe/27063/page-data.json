I hope you enjoy it as much as I do!\r\n\r\nFA Pomegranate\r\nFA's Pomegranate is my favorite pomegranate flavor, because it is so close to the actual fruit. It's both sweet and tart and has a hint of bitterness, like the original fruit. It is not so easy to blend in fruit mixes, because it easily overwhelms a lot of other fruits. But I found it works pretty good in this mix.\r\n\r\nINW Melon & CAP Cantaloupe\r\nThe combination of these two melon flavors gave the best result for a realistic honeydew melon flavor. INW Melon is a bit strong, so I used it at a low percentage. It has the tendency to be a bit \"throaty\" in the fresh mix, which goes away after a few days of steep.\r\n\r\nNotes: mixed at 80/30 (VG/PG). Steep: minimum steep over night, best after 2-4 days.\r\n\r\n","steep_days":"2","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-06T20:41:58.000-05:00","best_vg":"80%","views":"1671","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Pomegranate","flavor_id":"418","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Melon","flavor_id":"676","vendor":"INW","millipercent":750},{"name":"Cantaloupe","flavor_id":"23","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1500}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"27063","name":"Dewy-Granate"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
