The Glaze portion needs time to develop and come forward, while the Dough portion needs time to settle.\r\n\r\nThis is a collaboration recipe by myself and /u/ID10-T to create a more realistic glazed doughnut for those that can't stand the pre made concentrate flavors (tasting like play-doh).\r\n\r\nI don't know what else to say on this folks. This recipe has seen more than 15 revisions, but I lost count and started over at some point.\r\n\r\nThis final revision I found some old notes on FA Almond, and worked it in and wow, it helped. I previously tried INW Marzipan but it was too much, the Almond is what's up. Adding the TFA Marshmallow in for more sweetness and adding to that wet mouthfeel was clutch.\r\n\r\nEDIT 8/30/16\r\nAfter a couple weeks the almond came throug too much so I toned it down.","steep_days":"0","temperature":"0","recipe_score":4,"updated_at":"2020-12-12T11:50:17.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"4124","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Almond","flavor_id":"528","vendor":"FA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Bavarian Cream","flavor_id":"145","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Biscuit","flavor_id":"642","vendor":"INW","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Holy Vanilla (DIYFS)","flavor_id":"2385","vendor":"OTHR","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Joy","flavor_id":"401","vendor":"FA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Marshmallow","flavor_id":"332","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Meringue","flavor_id":"530","vendor":"FA","millipercent":5000},{"name":"Sugar Cookie","flavor_id":"115","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":4000}],"reviews":[{"user":"ID10-T","text":"UPDATE: Tastes like a good steep might make it a winner 2 days out in my tank, but some problematic off-notes when dripped. Excited to try this again with all of the flavors reduced by a quarter, no other changes. Older review: Made this last night so it hasn't steeped yet (and it definitely needs to), but with my morning coffee it seems like you may have finally cracked the donut code with your crazy-looking flavor %'s. Will update this review after steep. I still have two more versions I want to try, one planned and one already steeping, but I won't be surprised if I find this is the winner. It finally has that \"wet, sticky glaze\" quality that previous versions were lacking.
