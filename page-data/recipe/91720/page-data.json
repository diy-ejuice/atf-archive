I kept the coffee light, but coffee is such a distinctive flavor it still comes out in the front along with the caramel.  I went lighter on the bakery side and brought in some creams to tone down the coffee.  Great vape with your morning coffee.","steep_days":"14","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"total_reviews":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T14:13:02.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"2315","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Caramel Coffee with Sweet Milk","vendor":"PUR","millipercent":250},{"name":"Caramel","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2500},{"name":"New York Cheesecake","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Cheesecake","vendor":"LA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Biscuit","vendor":"INW","millipercent":500},{"name":"Greek Yogurt","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Vanilla Bean Ice Cream","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":2500}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"91720","name":"Caramel Macchiato Cheesecake"}}}
