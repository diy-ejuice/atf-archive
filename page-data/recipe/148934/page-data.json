Reminiscent of a nice Juicy Mango.\r\nExtremely delicious off the shake. I can't put it down to let it steep.\r\nYou can easily pick out each flavor layer, BUT! It also tastes like a single mango mix.\r\nVery intriguing to say the least!\r\nIf you like Mango, you will definitely like this.\r\nGive it a mix and enjoy! You won't be disappointed.","steep_days":"3 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"total_reviews":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-01T02:15:42.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"1135","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Pina Colada","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":5000},{"name":"Creamy Yogurt","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Papaya","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Cantaloupe","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Super Sweet","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":500}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"148934","name":"Pina Papayaloupe aka Not a Mango"}}}
