The drink has a straight cola flavor with a stronger lemongrass accent to it and a slight vanilla flaor on the back end. So this is the profile I'm attempting to pull out.\r\n\r\nThank you apocalypticdiynewb for the suggestion. I did end up using some of alfredpudding's 007 cola in this. Because it's a mash up of a Red Bull Cola, 007 Cola by Alfredpudding and my own ideas this is why I named it Frankenstein's Cola. Hopefully it's finished but I'm thinking I may have some work ahead of me...\r\n\r\nThe first iteration had lower cola and fizzy sherbert percentages and higher Lemon Sicily and more of the 007 Cola in it with the bourbon and vanilla. The problem was that the Lemon Sicily made it cloudy and i wasn't getting so much of the cola as I was the lemon flavor. So the current recipe is stripped down and I'll be preparing this as well as a version of this where i bring back some of the Lemon Sicily and totally bringing back the bourbon and vanilla. I know I was close on the first go around so I'm hoping this stripped version or the updated version will win out....","steep_days":"0 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-02T07:44:20.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"963","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Cola","flavor_id":"350","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":5000},{"name":"Fizzy Sherbet","flavor_id":"8878","vendor":"VT","millipercent":3500},{"name":"Super Sweet","flavor_id":"2384","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":300},{"name":"WS-23","flavor_id":"8085","vendor":"OTHR","millipercent":500},{"name":"Vanilla Ice Cream","flavor_id":"1511","vendor":"LB","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Lemon Sicily","flavor_id":"524","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Rich Cinnamon","flavor_id":"638","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":70}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"192303","name":"Frankenstein's Cola"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
