Vaping it MTL on the Kayfun lite 2019, I don’t get too much blueberry but I find it difficult picking up blueberry in an MTL configuration. It’s still present, but I do get an incredibly authentic tasting champagne, literally the inhale tastes like drinking the champagne and the exhale tastes like the breath you take after the sip. No off notes whatsoever, and also not cloyingly sweet. Very good recipe. I also liked that coffee bacco on YouTube a lot too, you guys should post that up on here!","score":5}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"155904","name":"Blueberry Champagne | Developed"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
