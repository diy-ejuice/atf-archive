It just tastes like butter pecan ice cream minus all of the ice cream. Or, something that could pass for the top part of the pie, with all the baked pecans, cooked sugar sweetness, and extra butter. But where's the eggy goopy inside? Why does it have \"pie\" in the name when I'm not getting even a hint of crust. **FA Apple Pie** takes some time to come out but I'm only getting the hint of pie crust I wanted from it at 1%, no apple or other fruit, no apple pie spice. **INW Custard** fills it out wonderfully. Three other versions didn't work the way I wanted them to. FA Custard Premium 2% was enough to take over and turn it into a custard recipe. Lovely, but off-topic. Not a pie. CAP Vanilla Custard 2% fit the pie profile and tasted good but that unmistakable Capella vanilla stuck out, calling too much attention to itself in an annoying way. The INW Creme Brulee 2% that someone suggested gave it a nice sweetness but wasn't custardy enough for a pie filling and tasted a little burnt.
