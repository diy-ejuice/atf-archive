The Creme Brûlée  showcases how I go about mixing, that caramelized sugar on top accents the honeycomb perfect and the custard base boosts the base just a little bit more. This part of the description was added 30/01/19, when I mix I sometimes just go head first into it and not explain my use of concentrates and I didn’t understand how badly other mixers like to know the reasoning behind the choice of flavours, I have gotten better and I hope other mixers can take something away from my recipes.\r\n\r\nCreated by myself, Nevans.\r\n\r\nGet the one-shot now at chefs flavours.\r\n\r\nhttps://www.chefsflavours.co.uk/nick-n-mix-one-shots/6626-honeycomb-custard.html\r\n\r\n","steep_days":"21","temperature":"0","recipe_score":4.8,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:50:19.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"17525","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Creme Brulee","vendor":"VT","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Honeycomb","vendor":"VT","millipercent":6000},{"name":"Sugar Cookie","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Super Sweet","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":400},{"name":"Warm Custard","vendor":"VT","millipercent":5000},{"name":"Vanilla Custard","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":4000}],"reviews":[{"user":"AAP-DAAP-DERP","text":"This gem is unique.
