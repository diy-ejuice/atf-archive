Note that this is no liquor flavored vape. This is a Ginger Ale first and foremost with a kick of sweet and sour blue raspberry and a hint of lime.\r\n\r\nYou might want to back off on the TFA Ginger Ale by a percent. Personally, I'm a huge fan of the flavor and like it loud.","steep_days":"0 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-06T20:52:42.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"455","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Ginger Ale","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":5500},{"name":"Shisha Raspberry","vendor":"INW","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Sour Blue Raspberry Candy","vendor":"WF","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Citrus Punch","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Lime Tahity Cold Pressed","vendor":"FA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Super Sweet","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":500},{"name":"Sour","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1000}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"201457","name":"Cancun Blue ðŸŒŠ A Blue Raspberry Ginger Ale"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
