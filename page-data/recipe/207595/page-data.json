FLV on the top not while FW on the base, bringing in that stickiness that we love so much!\r\n\r\n**CAP Cinnamon Sugar, FW Sweetener**\r\nThe typical mixture of cinnamon powder and sugar where we roll that fried goodie right after coming out of the oil. FW Sweetener brings that sugary, lingering after taste just like when you bite into a churro or our own Brazilian version of a donut, called \"Sonho\" which translates to \"dream\".\r\n\r\nMix this up and let us know what you think by commenting!
