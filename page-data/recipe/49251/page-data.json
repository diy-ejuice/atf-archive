It was an attempt to use fa pandoro in a recipe where the lemon wouldnt be out of place.\r\nA lemon frosted cream filled cupcake.\r\nCap lemon meringue pie was used as a supporting lemon. Because the lemon in pandoro gets a lil weird and bitter to me.\r\nThe 2 cupcake concs hardly scream cupcake by themselves but like most flavorings i try to use them for their good qualities. Cap is almost all frosting to me and tfa has alot of frosting but with some cake underneath. The cakes notes blend well with pandoro and what kind of maniac eats cupcakes without frosting?\r\nCap butter cream is used to help out the richness of the cake AND the cream filling.\r\nPur marsh and cap van whipped have been my first choices in any twinkie like recipe so no mystery that i would use them here to complete my cream filled lemon frosted cupcake.","steep_days":"14","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:49:21.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"4331","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Vanilla Cupcake","flavor_id":"187","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2750},{"name":"Vanilla Cupcake","flavor_id":"129","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Pandoro","flavor_id":"538","vendor":"FA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Lemon Meringue Pie","flavor_id":"84","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Vanilla Whipped Cream","flavor_id":"1","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Marshmallow","flavor_id":"7768","vendor":"PUR","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Butter Cream","flavor_id":"3","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Lemon","flavor_id":"1655","vendor":"FE","millipercent":200}],"reviews":[{"user":"Deweysuds","text":"Two week steep:  Tangy lemon cupcake.  Cupcake base is fluffy and full at the same time.  The frosting note is tangy and creamy.  Very tasty and unique.  When I think of lemon cupcake I think of a super sweet lemon frosting note, but this has more of a tart lemon meringue type punch.  Very well layered.  Almost reminds me of a lemonade cupcake.  Very unique and well put together.  "},{"user":"NonStopMix","text":"Since hearing about this on the Noted episode, I've been waiting for you to release the recipe. I'm writing this review 12 days after mixing, so it's probably going to change a little. This is my first time using Pandoro (had the ingredient for a good 6 months), so I don't have any recipes to compare the use of this ingredient to.  As far as the recipe goes, it's very good. You definitely get lemon in this recipe. It hits you in the face the first couple pulls, then it calms down and it's not overpowering. The frosting is present, but I think can be a little heavier to separate it from the cupcake (this may change with a longer steep). I wouldn't change anything with the cream filling nor cupcake. Overall, it's a very good recipe. The only thing I would tweak is the frosting. Adding a sweeter lemon might help the frosting, but I might be wrong. Maybe adding some FE Lemon might help this. &#xD;\n&#xD;\nI rate this a 4.25 / 5.00 &#xD;\n&#xD;\nThank you for the share!"}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"49251","name":"Lemon Frosted Cupcake"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
