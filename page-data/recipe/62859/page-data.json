HOW is it that such a unique recipe has zero reviews on it?!  Allow me to proudly be the first then.  &#xD;\nIt definitely needs to steep but once it does, wow.  very unusual, like, wtf am I vaping?... I found myself vaping it while drinking gin and even beer.  I love, love love WF Fro yo and think this likely tipped me over on this one, prior to this I had yet to find a floral recipe that I could take to.  Amazing ingenuity with this flavour combination, its now in my rotation.  I don't think its an ADV for me due to its distinctiveness but very much one worth having around."}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"62859","name":"Violet Hops (floral, herbal, exotic)"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
