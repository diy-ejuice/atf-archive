A touch of Ry4 Double to bring some dark caramel notes to the profile.\r\nGive at least a week to steep to calm down the TPA Turkish.","steep_days":"15","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-06T20:44:03.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"1664","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Double Apple","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Kentucky Bourbon","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Pear","vendor":"FA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Ry4 Double","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Turkish","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":5000},{"name":"Two Apples","vendor":"INW","millipercent":1000}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"105319","name":"Turkish Tobapple"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
