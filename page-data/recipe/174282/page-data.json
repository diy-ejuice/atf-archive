I'm not terribly into tobaccos but like to dabble in them once in a while. This gives me a decent fresh tobacco leaf feel, not quite a cigarette, not quite a cigar yet gives that smokeyness taste left in the mouth. Yet, while this is decently good out of a Kayfun Lite, every other puff or so, I get this wet, almost skim milk watery like taste/feel, almost like TFA Dairy Milk or a Sweet Cream of sorts. Maybe it's the CGC? I don't know. It's weird. &#xD;\nAnywho, 4 stars."}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"174282","name":"Kayfun Light "}}}
