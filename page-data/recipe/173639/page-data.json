WF caramel rice crispy treat is a great flavor and it definitely shines here.  I haven't found a plain crispy treat that I've thought was amazing, and I feel like I've mixed them all. Fortunately I enjoy the caramel aspect of the flavor and this recipe so as far as I'm concerned this is the best version of rice crispy I've found"}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"173639","name":"Caramel Rice Crispy Treats! 5 STARS"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
