Mixed at 50/50, you'll certainly get more flavor.\r\n\r\nThe inhale is minty -- think spearmint, wintergreen. The longer you inhale, the 'harsher' the minty throat hit. Its a pleasant kind of harsh.\r\nThe exhale is fruity -- peary, berry, fairly refreshing.\r\n\r\nThis recipe works fine as a shake and vape, and I couldn't discern much differences after vaping it a week later.
