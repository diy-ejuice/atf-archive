Flavorah caramel adds a nice honey sweetness to it. The cream fresh and Bavarian Cream give it a nice amount of dairy. The cereal 27 gives it a nice crispy ness. The Graham cracker almost adds somewhat of a Granola taste to it at this percentage. Caramel candy enhances the Peanut butter from TFA without taking over the recipe. FLV cookie dough when steeped long enough gives off a sweet honey note and adds that great cookie goodness. You canâ€™t have a perfect Peanutbutter cookie without brown sugar. . I recommend 5-7 days Steep for all ingredients to meld together. I like it sweet so I added .5% Supersweet to my mix. But this is optional. Mixed at 69/31. Enjoy.","steep_days":"7","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T20:32:28.000-05:00","best_vg":"69%","views":"1656","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Peanut Butter","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Cookie Dough","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Caramel Candy","vendor":"FW","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Cereal 27","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Brown Sugar","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Cream Fresh","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Caramel","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":500},{"name":"Bavarian Cream","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Graham Cracker","vendor":"FW","millipercent":3000}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"91315","name":"The Ultimate PB Cookie Bar"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
