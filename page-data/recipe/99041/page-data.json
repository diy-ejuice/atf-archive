With milk. \r\n\r\nYou might not want to buy **FW Cake Batter Dip** to make this. It's got fructose in it, it will destroy your wicks relatively quick even at just 1%. It might be bad for you, too, burning sugars can release carcinogens. But if you have some already and want to use it, maybe give this a try.  Unfortunately, I don't have a sub for it, it's unique. And it perfects the sweet cereal that's been baptized in milk and is starting to return to its doughy origin. \r\n\r\n**TFA Lucky Leprechaun** has some oat puff cereal hiding in there with a somewhat weird (possibly emulating the taste of artificial coloring?) crisp cereal-type marshmallow. I used **CAP Cereal 27** to draw it out of hiding. Took some work to make it happen without turning puffed oat into corn or multigrain cereal, but I think this gets it down. **OoO Cream Milky PG** helps with that, sort of wraps around it and keeps that cornflake pyrazine taste from being too assertive while also doing a fine job as a cereal milk. If you're lucky enough to own some **FA Milk**, you can add that at 1% for an even milker cereal with whole milk. **TFA Meringue** in my opinion is a slightly better option for sugary, toasty cereal and cereal milk perfecting than FA Meringue, which is a more authentic meringue. But if you only have **FA Meringue**, you can sub that at 1% instead of the 1.5% TFA Meringue. Although Lucky Lep is mostly a cereal marshmallow flavor, cranking it up high enough to really make the marshmallows stand out  just gets too chemical-tasting and weird for me. **FLV Marshmallow + FLV Whipped Cream** finish putting the charms in Lucky's Charms. These two flavors are so similar that if you don't have one of them or are just too lazy to get them both out, you could make this with 1% of either instead of 0.5% of both. The difference will be how long you let the marshmallows soak in milk. All Marshmallow = No soak, just teeth-squeakingly crunchy mallows. All Whipped Cream = Marshmallows are getting milk-logged and have a slippy, gooey outer layer, but still have that crisp sugar center. I just happen to like a happy medium. \r\n\r\n*No flavor company executives' feelings were harmed in the making of this recipe.*","steep_days":"14","temperature":"420","recipe_score":5,"updated_at":"2020-12-12T15:39:55.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"9258","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Lucky Leprechaun Cereal","flavor_id":"141","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":3250},{"name":"Cereal 27","flavor_id":"4163","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Whipped Cream","flavor_id":"4440","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":500},{"name":"Cake Batter Dip","flavor_id":"1223","vendor":"FW","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Meringue","flavor_id":"176","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Marshmallow","flavor_id":"3521","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":500},{"name":"Cream Milky Undertone PG","flavor_id":"6539","vendor":"OOO","millipercent":1500}],"reviews":[{"user":"RUG_ly","text":"Man that bit with the cake batter dip is perfect.

Its subtle but just right because I can't put it down.  Mouthfeel is silky mallow cotton.  Amazing recipe.    ","score":5},{"user":"ObiWanCannoli","text":"Yep that's definitely Lucky Charms in milk! Unfortunately I had to sub out the FLV marshmallow and whipped cream for 1% FA marshmallow. I normally don't sub but I just had to try it out. Will pick up the FLVs and try it again however, as it was it turned out pretty awesome! I actually preferred the mix between snv and 10 days. I found it got a touch muddy after that point, although, it could have been due to the sub I made so I will not deduct any stars. Definitely a well thought out choice of ingredients. Nice mellow crunch from cereal 27, nice light sugar glaze and cakey sweetness from the cake batter dip, and beautifully executed milk from the CMU and meringue. 5 star worthy for sure and I'm sure it will be even better once I get those FLV concentrates in","score":5},{"user":"MrZigglesworth","text":"The addition of FW Cake Battar Dip is something I never considered using in a milk base for a cereal recipe. This is definitely delicious and worth a try!","score":5},{"user":"Thadentman","text":"The mix of cake batter and milky undertones is brilliant! This is not a dry vape, itâ€™s pretty damn spot on. Great job!","score":5},{"user":"CygnusY1","text":"I went for the Flv Whipped Cream option with this mix. Had no FW Cake Batter Dip so used 0.5%  Cap Cake Batter. &#xD;\n&#xD;\nVerdict: This is obscenely addictive. Only took 7 days to steep through. You get an insane frosted  sugar hit on the inhale from the  Meringue, Whipped Cream and also from the marshmallow in Lucky Leprachaun. The cereal base of Lucky Leprechaun and Cap Cereal is really well balanced too. It kind of tastes of oats and bran and is not too A.P. heavy either. Great use of Milky Undertones there. Really love vaping this when I want a sweet vape. Satisfies my sweet tooth and sugar cravings. Great work Dave.","score":5},{"user":"Tootall","text":"So lucky leprechaun is an extremely touchy strange flavor that needs a long steep. I tasted this on day 7 and thought you had lost your mind. It had a horribly weird off note. Somehow after two weeks that off note had nearly disappeared but because i had tasted it on day 7 i needed to give it just a little longer to let that strange flavor that i would almost describe as the food color strangeness in the lucky charm marshmallows if that makes any kind of twisted sense. After 3 weeks tgis is lovely a great lucky charms flavor marshmallow heavy just the way i wish my lucky charms would come lol. This is as close as i think anyone can come to a lucky charms vape flavor so stop chasing and start mixing it up!","score":5}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"99041","name":"Lucky's Charms"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
