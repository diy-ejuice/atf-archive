This is a great mix. Cocoa, tobacco, and vanilla are all nicely balanced, nothing over the top. The overall flavor is medium strong, and thereâ€™s a mild smokiness to it. The second time I mixed it I added 0.75% FA Walnut, which I find to go very well with it. Most of the mixes I vape are tobaccos, and this is one of the best."}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"32549","name":"Java Cigar"}}}
