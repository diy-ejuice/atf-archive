It's not a slushie type, it's not a freezepop, it's more like picking a fresh raspberry off the vine (Tree? How do raspberries grow?) in some mystical world that actually grows blue colored raspberries. &#xD;\nI plan on using this mix in some weird profiles eventually.&#xD;\nGreat job!"},{"user":"fadedjay1","text":"Great base. Over night steep and it fills out way more. LB blue ras is awesome but this trio makes it perfect for the blue raz syrup everyone wants. Thanks for the recipe.
