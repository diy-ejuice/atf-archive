VTA golden syrup helps make that salted caramel a soft set caramel and also plays beautifully with the bourbon. \r\n\r\nVTA bourbon used at 2% avoided any smokiness but wasn't as strong as i'd like so i topped up with a smidge of FLV bourbon just to make it present enough but not to overtake everything else.\r\n\r\nFA coconut, Self Explanatory... used at 1.5% just to sit behind everything and not be overbearing.\r\n\r\nIf you like this recipe and what i do then please rate and review accordingly :) \r\n","steep_days":"7","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T22:33:51.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"1110","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Bourbon","flavor_id":"4411","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":350},{"name":"Bourbon","flavor_id":"8839","vendor":"VT","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Coco' (coconut)","flavor_id":"416","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Golden Syrup","flavor_id":"8887","vendor":"VT","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Salted Caramel","flavor_id":"8959","vendor":"VT","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Super Sweet","flavor_id":"2384","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":300},{"name":"Tahitian Vanilla Cream","flavor_id":"6065","vendor":"WF","millipercent":3500},{"name":"Vanilla Custard","flavor_id":"131","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":3500},{"name":"Vanilla Ice Cream","flavor_id":"1511","vendor":"LB","millipercent":3500}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"174415","name":"Alex Mixanally"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
