Buttery gewey delicious.  Hoping this is it....lol...this is my first take on it lets see what happens.  I have never worked with Coconut, Buttercream or Brown Sugar before, so this is an adventure for sure.  I would love any advice or comments anyone has...thanks so much.  Love to all...Kitten  \r\n\r\nI mixed a 30ml batch and tried it, it was good but the coconut tasted too much like tanning oil, then I let it sit for a week and tried again....HUGE difference, it tasted like a cookie with coconut.  Tried again after ten days and it had been totally transformed...it is what I was looking for, a buttery sweet coconutty cookie but not a macaroon...I will continue to mix and vape it.....SMILES  :  )","steep_days":"8","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T17:34:03.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"1526","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Sugar Cookie","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":5000},{"name":"Cookie","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Coco' (coconut)","vendor":"FA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Brown Sugar","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Butter Cream","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Vanilla Custard","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Butter","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Sweetener","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Acetyl Pyrazine","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":200}],"reviews":[{"user":"KylezKloudz","text":"I've been on the hunt for a good coconut cookie recipe... Just mixed this up this morning before work and threw it in my pocket... Standing outside having a vape I decided to give it a try and I can say for sure that this recipe is gonna deliver! You definitely tell that it's gonna need time to steep, but it's not bad at all on the start! I think it'll be just what I'm looking for. Nice job! I'll give it a rating in a week or so because I don't want to underestimate it..üëçüëç"}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"45934","name":"CocoNutty Cookie V1"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
