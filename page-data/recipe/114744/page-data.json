Off the shake this recipe is not pleasant to vape. It's not going to be a shake and vape at all.  This is a shelf sitter recipe in order for the DAAPy notes to blend down into the vanillas and creams and allow the fried element to emerge from behind the rich butter notes.  The texture of the flaky crust will be come more apparent as the batch steeps.  This is a 4 to 6 week steep, possibly up to 8 weeks.  So if you are looking for a fall recipe, you could toss a bit of pumpkin spice or cinnamon in it, or maybe pull the cream back a little and add in some Apple Filling type flavor.

'Keep it simple. 2,3. or 4 ingredients is enough.' 'my new adv env... love it\" I don't have most of these exact flavors but I can see how to use my brie better having looked here. How does anyone make 120mls of a recipe and go though it fast enough to review anything else? The only thing I make 120 of is a custard base I want to lock away for 6-8 weeks before building from there. Beautiful architecture."}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"114744","name":"Jarvis- Mixen Vixens Episode 24 - Puffed-uper-roles"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
