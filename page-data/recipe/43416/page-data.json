It's already really close to a orange dreamsicle. \r\n\r\nblood orange + sweet tangerine: Makes up the top notes should be the first thing you notice biting into a dreamsicle. \r\n\r\nsweet cream + meringue + VBIC : the sugary creamy goodness inside the outer shell, the base of the whole thing. Meringue can be left out.\r\n\r\nButtercream : adds a buttery goodness to the creams, rounds out the smell of the juice, and feel of the vape.\r\n\r\nDragonfruit: used to boost up the tangerine/orange flavors.\r\n\r\nIf you want a shake and vape, leave out VBIC and sweet cream ~~but it'll be more like an orange popsicle than a dreamsicle.~~ but it won't be as good.","steep_days":"7","temperature":"0","recipe_score":4,"updated_at":"2020-12-12T14:05:19.000-05:00","best_vg":"80%","views":"2946","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Blood Orange","flavor_id":"1197","vendor":"FW","millipercent":500},{"name":"Dragonfruit","flavor_id":"226","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Sweet Tangerine","flavor_id":"123","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Butter Cream","flavor_id":"3","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":750},{"name":"Meringue","flavor_id":"530","vendor":"FA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Sweet Cream","flavor_id":"117","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":750},{"name":"Vanilla Bean Ice Cream","flavor_id":"186","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":250}],"reviews":[{"user":"cdaniell30","text":"I enjoyed this one a lot.
