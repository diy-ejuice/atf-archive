Those two plus the Meringue makes a dense sweet yogurt ice cream with body and volume.\r\n\r\nFor the grape, TFA Grape Juice is not the more \"real\" and for my is more like a candy type of flavor, which is great but I use the kiwi to add a more juicy and less synthetic flavor from it.\r\n\r\nI hope you enjoy it and feel free to play with it and give your most honest opinion and suggestions!!\r\n\r\nv2: +1% VBIC / -0.5% Grape Juice / +0.25% Koolada\r\n\r\n(English is not my mother tongue; please excuse any errors on my part)","steep_days":"3 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":4,"updated_at":"2020-12-12T15:39:16.000-05:00","best_vg":"50%","views":"3430","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Creamy Yogurt","flavor_id":"5","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Vanilla Bean Ice Cream","flavor_id":"186","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Grape Juice","flavor_id":"231","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":3500},{"name":"Kiwi (double)","flavor_id":"242","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Meringue","flavor_id":"530","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Koolada 10 Pg","flavor_id":"280","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":250}],"reviews":[{"user":"KaptenUtbrott","text":"I prefer myself the V1, nice well-rounded yogurty-grapey vape :)","score":5},{"user":"phried","text":"As ID10-T said, this is more yogurty than a fro-yo - which is still a pleasant vape to be honest.

And yet, this is both yogurty (to a fault, IMO) and super grapey. My only problem with it is that I'm not getting \"sweet yogurt ice cream\" or frozen yogurt that's more like ice cream than yogurt, I'm getting a full-on grape yogurt with emphasis on the 'gurt. That's a little off-putting when you're expecting grape fro-yo and you get grape go-gurt. On the other hand, adding Kiwi to get better grape out of TFA Grape Juice? Genius. This is a recipe that has a lot of potential, and maybe just needs some adjustment in that 2/2 Creamy Yogurt/Vanilla Ice Cream base for more ice cream, less yogurt.  If it can be added without bringing along icky off notes, some cooling additive might be welcome here as well.
