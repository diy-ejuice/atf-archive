Out of the gate, it's predominantly a sweet (but not overwhelmingly sweet) pineapple. Not sharp or acidic like some, very pleasant. Other flavor notes lurk in the background, again very pleasant, not \"in your face.\" Love it as a SnV, anxious to see how much better it gets as it ages....thank you for this!"}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"14479","name":"Paradise Sunrise"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
