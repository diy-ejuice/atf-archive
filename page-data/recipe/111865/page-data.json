I am not a huge fan of sweet juices so i used 0.25% of Super Sweet and 0.25% of WS-23 is the most of that stuff I can handle and taste anything other than coldness. The addition of Sour and FA Lemon to the LA Lemonade really helped it taste more like a natural lemonade, and the FA White Peach comes through just fine and isnâ€™t giving me any harshness after a 7 day steep.
