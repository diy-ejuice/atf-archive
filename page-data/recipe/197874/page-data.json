An old secret most southern women know, is if you run out of buttermilk, you can mix a little lemon juice with milk to get that flavor. Here we used Lemon and whipped cream to fake out that tangy buttermilk taste. For the crust we're using a trick I heard from Developed Cookie/Sugar Cookie. Custard gives it that creaminess you need, and without butter, well bless your heart you just ain't living! Don't go getting your panties in a wad, or jumping the gun, because it takes a few days for that lemon and whipped cream to mix. If you try this on the shake and vape you're gonna get a sweet lemon curd, which ain't half bad, but sweetheart, it ain't buttermilk either.","steep_days":"3","temperature":"0","recipe_score":4,"total_reviews":2,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:51:38.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"974","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Cookie","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Custard","vendor":"INW","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Golden Butter","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Lemon","vendor":"FE","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Sugar Cookie V2","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Super Sweet","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":500},{"name":"Whipped Cream","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2000}],"reviews":[{"user":"WalleBiela","score":"5","text":"Well well well.
