Off the shake this recipe is not pleasant to vape. It's not going to be a shake and vape at all.  This is a shelf sitter recipe in order for the DAAPy notes to blend down into the vanillas and creams and allow the fried element to emerge from behind the rich butter notes.  The texture of the flaky crust will be come more apparent as the batch steeps.  This is a 4 to 6 week steep, possibly up to 8 weeks.  So if you are looking for a fall recipe, you could toss a bit of pumpkin spice or cinnamon in it, or maybe pull the cream back a little and add in some Apple Filling type flavor.
