I'm needing the GC pieces to stand out more... Maybe uping the FW 1% and adding .5% AP will help? It's pretty damn close but I need some of y'alls help... Thanks and hope you enjoy... Flavor notes to follow... In the mix is on right now!","steep_days":"5","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T21:32:40.000-05:00","best_vg":"65%","views":"1790","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Graham Cracker","flavor_id":"1297","vendor":"FW","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Vanilla Bean Ice Cream","flavor_id":"186","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Graham Cracker Clear","flavor_id":"325","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Caramel (original)","flavor_id":"149","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":3000},{"name":"French Vanilla Icecream","flavor_id":"2129","vendor":"HS","millipercent":500}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"113369","name":"Crumbs along the Mohawk"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
