My favorite flavor company. They are great people and they care about the community. They have the BEST tobaccos around, period. So this mix is a shoutout to flavorah!\r\n\r\nI haven't played with Horchata yet, which is surprising, its one of my favorite flavors in general. I went with a \"spicier\" style by adding ginger and lemon grass with it. The cream was added to blend everything more, and give it a slightly deeper mouthfeel as well. Sweeten to taste :) ","steep_days":"3 (SNV)","temperature":"400","recipe_score":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-11T14:05:34.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"589","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Horchata","flavor_id":"4439","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Lemon Grass","flavor_id":"2592","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":750},{"name":"Ginger","flavor_id":"4415","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Cream","flavor_id":"604","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1000}],"reviews":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"195361","name":"Ode"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
