He began pondering the aromas from the night before, doing some quick foggy headed math he knocked together a simple banger.\r\n\r\nINW Black Cherry for Pipe\r\nINW Vanilla for Pipe\r\n\r\nIt's Cherry Vanilla Pipe Tobacco, needs no notes, just mix it, vape it, enjoy it, modify it.\r\n\r\nDisclaimer.
