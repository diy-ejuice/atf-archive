It is a very unique Flavor. When i found this flavor it ended up being my ADV for a year. Then the company that made it stopped selling juices so i decided to try and clone it. I think this is 99% cloned. The only reason i don't say 100% is because I don't have the original to test against. This is a Max VG mix because the original is a 90/10 so I make it that way. It is very good after 3 days so mix it up and enjoy.\r\n\r\nPrickly Victory:\r\nDo you like simple recipes? 2 ingredients provide mountains of flavor.\r\n\r\nInspired by slumberland pink hedgehog. Instead of grapefruit I did guava.\r\n\r\nI've been really diggin this guava flavor its super delicious. at 5% total this recipe has flavor for days, my 10ml sampler was gone in an hour and I just made a 50ml batch which will get me through these last few cold days before spring hits.\r\n\r\nthis shit is sweet enough I wouldn't dare put sweetener but go ahead if you please.\r\n\r\nShake and vape certified.\r\n\r\nRecipes inspired by this one: Tickly Victory by amouthforwar |\r\n\r\nThanks to Hashlingingslashur and Antjuice for  recipes that made this mashup possible.","steep_days":"3 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-06T20:45:55.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"841","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Cactus","vendor":"INW","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Jackfruit","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Super Sweet","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":500},{"name":"Sweet Guava","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":4000}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"193837","name":"Calypso Victory"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
