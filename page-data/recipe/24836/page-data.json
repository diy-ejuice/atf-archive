Also one of the first shooting from the hip recipes I created. The original was made in November '16. \r\n\r\nThis is something I whipped up after searching google for candies with jasmine and tea in them. I can't find the actual food recipe I found but my ingredients were used to reflect what I have on hand and what I felt replicated them. \r\n\r\nOn the exhale it has a nice smooth milky green tea flavor, on the after taste its a milky caramel flavor. \r\n\r\nI actually did vape about 10ml of this the few days after making it and it was good then but obviously after 2 months in the cabinet, I can say a steep brings it to life. \r\n\r\nI've never done notes before be gentle.
