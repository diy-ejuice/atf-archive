It is so close to the real thing there’s just something that it’s missing . If anyone wants to help clone this mix it up and give me some ideas in the comments ! Or mix it up any ways because it dose indeed taste very good . MAMASAN eliquid’s  describes this juice as A (Golden graham cracker mixed with delicious milk ) Now here are some flavor notes/ How i put this Remix/Clone together .  i’m using (TPA) Bavarian cream for a thick but not too creamy milk . And then i used (CAP) Graham cracker because i get a slight cinnamon note from the original Graham slam and because i can’t think of any other graham cracker i could be but it works well so far . Now i’m using (VT) Golden syrup and (VT) honeycomb to give the mix a thick honey type flavor but also because i do get a thick syrupy like note in the  original graham slam . I have used (OOO) Pie crust to give the graham cracker more  of a “ authentic “ graham cracker , But also because (OOO) Pie crust has a honey like note and smell to it. So If ANYBODY has any ideas of how we can get this remix/clone to taste even more like the  original  let me know in the comments . The  original juice also has this  certain note to the honey that i just can’t put my finger on it , And if we can get that down we’re GOLDEN . Don’t be scared to play around with the percentages either this is just a good START to this clone/remix . Much love keep mixing!!","steep_days":"7 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"updated_at":"2020-12-12T10:34:59.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"3117","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Bavarian Cream","flavor_id":"145","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Golden Syrup","flavor_id":"8887","vendor":"VT","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Graham Cracker","flavor_id":"62","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Pie Crust","flavor_id":"2010","vendor":"OOO","millipercent":500},{"name":"Honeycomb","flavor_id":"8901","vendor":"VT","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Super Sweet","flavor_id":"2384","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":500}],"reviews":[{"user":"Ayvaluv11","text":"I vape the commercial Mamasan regularly .
