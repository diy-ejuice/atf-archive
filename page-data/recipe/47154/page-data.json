I adjusted the recipe a bit to match the most recent version of this recipe that I had vaped all of, as I couldn't remember while doing the show exactly which creams I had used.  This recipe is delicious.  Tastes just like Basmati rice pudding that I have made at home. \r\nIt is a single drop of Rich Cinnamon in a 30ml bottle for this recipe or the cinnamon overpowers everything.  If you have trouble tasting cinnamon you could probably increase it to 2 drops in a 30ml, but it will be strong. My first version of this recipe I did 3 drops in a 30ml of cinnamon and all I could taste was cinnamon.  \r\nAs with my pineapple cake, I've used INW Creme Brulee to give this a baked sugary kind of taste. It is just enough to give a hint of baked, if you want a sugary type of taste to it more than this up the Creme Brulee to 0.8% or 1%. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFor More Mixing Tips and Info Visit my Site and Youtube Channel: \r\nhttp://flavor-pro.com/\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCA6gV-5vxieuG2_TcIKpYCg\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nphoto credit: arsheffield <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/82304216@N00/6657605227\">Coconut Rice Pudding with Almond and Cardamom</a> via <a href=\"http://photopin.com\">photopin</a> <a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/2.0/\">(license)</a>","steep_days":"10","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:49:20.000-05:00","best_vg":"75%","views":"4333","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Sweet Rice","flavor_id":"7727","vendor":"FE","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Rich Cinnamon","flavor_id":"638","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":60},{"name":"Cream","flavor_id":"604","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":400},{"name":"Custard","flavor_id":"4388","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":800},{"name":"Vanilla Pudding","flavor_id":"4433","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":750},{"name":"Sweetness","flavor_id":"4413","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":500},{"name":"Sweet Coconut","flavor_id":"605","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":300},{"name":"Creme Brulee (yc)","flavor_id":"894","vendor":"INW","millipercent":600},{"name":"Sweet Cream","flavor_id":"4402","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":500}],"reviews":[{"user":"ali","text":"I made a few adjustments since I don't have many Flavorah concentrates but I love this recipe nevertheless.
