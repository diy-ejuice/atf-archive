It nails the creamy richness, you would expect. But you also get some nice deep undertones of brown sugar that gives a nice mouthfeel. Flv is more of the peanut than the butter and my favorite choice. It's here to add  more of a dry, gritty texture ( like the stuff in Reese's ).\r\n\r\n*INW & FLV Milk Chocolate, Milk & Honey -* It seems everyone is on this INW Milk Chocolate band wagon. I personally think it needs a lot of help. FLV did a great job on this. I get more of a Chocolate Milk single flavor testing this but, in this recipe, it worked really well in  adding the chocolate I was missing with INW. The downside of FLV Milk Chocolate is, I was getting an off note that was hard to describe, because it's only present for half a second. Adding Milk & Honey worked for masking that note and also seems to meld the chocolates together. It also added the sweetness I was looking for. I've noticed Chocolate almost always needs some sweetener to help it. Known that chocolate itself is usually a coil killer, I didn't want to add sucralose. Milk & Honey was definitely the reason I didn't need to add the sweetener.\r\n\r\n*TFA Bavarian Cream* - This was added just for some additional mouthfeel and creaminess. I plan on trying this with JF BC next time, since that stuff is magical. So feel fre to sub, if you like.\r\n\r\nNow for the bad news- This really needs the full 2 weeks( 1 month is even better) to let everything come together and smooth it out.","steep_days":"14","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"total_reviews":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T11:43:12.000-05:00","best_vg":"50%","views":"4029","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Peanut Butter","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Peanut Butter","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":3500},{"name":"Milk Chocolate","vendor":"INW","millipercent":3500},{"name":"Milk Chocolate","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Milk & Honey","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":500},{"name":"Bavarian Cream","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1000}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"17196","name":"Peanut Butter Cup"}}}
