I used WF  frozen yogurt and FLV cream to achieve that .,  WF almond cookie  and toasted almond  were  perfect for the outer almond cake  shell .  I love FLV coconut  so I added it here but it is not  needed if you are not a coconut fan.  The vanilla whipped cream was just for more volume and vanilla accent for this mix.   \r\nmixed up for mixing in the kitchen episode on yogurt https://youtu.be/JS7fE5ONxx8","steep_days":"5","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-05T13:09:16.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"1347","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Frozen Yogurt SC","flavor_id":"8369","vendor":"WF","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Almond Cookie SC","flavor_id":"9013","vendor":"WF","millipercent":2300},{"name":"Sweet Coconut","flavor_id":"605","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":750},{"name":"Sweetness","flavor_id":"4413","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":300},{"name":"Cream","flavor_id":"604","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1250},{"name":"Toasted Almond","flavor_id":"128","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Vanilla Whipped Cream","flavor_id":"1","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Shisha Vanilla","flavor_id":"841","vendor":"INW","millipercent":300}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"102933","name":" Toasted Almond Frozen Yogurt Bar "}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
