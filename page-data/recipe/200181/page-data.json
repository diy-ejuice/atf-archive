I tried to recreate that first love feeling and ended up creating something deeper. \r\n\r\nI tried using lower %s but it didn't come out quite right.  Feel free to lower or omit the sweetener. If you want it to be more authentic, in reality you would use 1.5 - 2%.\r\n\r\nGood off the shake but 3-5 days steeping is better as usual. I tend to mix my liquids as needed so I rarely steep anything more than a couple days.","steep_days":"3 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":4.5,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:51:40.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"905","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Strawberry","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Strawberry (ripe)","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Shisha Strawberry","vendor":"INW","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Cheesecake (graham Crust)","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Vanilla Custard","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Dx Bavarian Cream","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Super Sweet","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1000}],"reviews":[{"user":"BryanF","text":"I found it to be a great vape..Shisha was a bit overpowering so I made a second batch with (FA) Red Touch as a sub..
