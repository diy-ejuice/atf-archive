FLV Milk & Honey was an obvious choice, but I wanted to add a little extra body and sweetness to it to mask some of that underlying chocolate notes that hide around in FLV M&H. CAP Sugar Cookie was the best choice. Just adds some great mouthfeel, makes it even smoother, and adds some great sugary sweetness.\r\n\r\nA simple fucking mix. Nothing special here, but it's a great recipe if you're looking for a quick ADV that is smooth as fuck and sweet with a lot of full-bodied flavour.\r\n\r\nArt by me.

Just bought because I read a lot about its amazing single flavor. Eaw. Disgusting. Same thought I had with your sick af, as a S&amp;V. Almost tossed. But after 12 days it’s decent. I still can feel kind of ether-hospital-dentists flavor to it. But it’s hell lighter and STRANGELY fit the “sick” profile. &#xD;\nCongrats. And thanks ","score":4},{"user":"staybert","text":"Best 2 flavor banger I have yet to try! Also the best use I have seen of FLV Milk &amp; Honey, this shit is delicious. Together with the morning coffee this is a match made in heaven.","score":5},{"user":"RockyHarlow","text":"Simple is better 99% of the time, this is no exception. The room note on this one is fantastic as well, and leaves your house smelling like fresh baked maple cookies. I tend to actually vape this when I'm under the weather as it pairs with a hot cup of tea like no other recipe I have found so far. Great work. ","score":5},{"user":"Xist","text":"I really enjoyed this super simple mix.  I can't say it's an ADV for me, but I kept coming back to it.  I  just went back to finish the bottle off after nearly two months an really enjoy how it melded and smoothed out even more.  There are very few two flavor mixes I enjoy.  Well done Matt.","score":5},{"user":"RdaJunkie","text":"I mixed this when it was first released and hated it. In a drunken state i decided to try it again. Off the shake i hated it again.  So instead of dumping it i decided to let it sit. 3 or so days later I gave it another try and I was impressed. And even though I'm not sick i could definitely see this being soothing. it is super simple but delicious. &#xD;\nSincerely, fuck you&#xD;\n","score":5},{"user":"cdaniell30","text":"I love it when a recipe this simple turns out so damn good","score":5},{"user":"ParkusMaximusIII","text":"Pretty damn good! Got REALLY sick this past week and on like the first day I was doing a juice order and ordered M&amp;H simply because I remembered seeing this recipe around when you first posted it. Thought it would be good since it had had such great reviews and up until today I was suffering through all of my mixes tearing up my throat. This has allowed me to get my fix while not having to feel like razorblades are slicing up my throat. Although I can't really tell what the profile is, its delicious and that sugar cookie adds that chewy mouthfeel that we all know and love. Thanks for the sick af recipe Matt! (see what I did there??)","score":5},{"user":"horizonism","text":"Delicious stuff. Got a nasty flu right now, and this stuff is seeing me through. Have had Milk &amp; Honey in my stash, almost unused, for a while now, and this is easily the best use for it I've found so far. Silky smooth, rich and delicious. Thanks! ","score":5},{"user":"KylezKloudz","text":"I like FLV M&amp;H on its own around 8% and every time I vape it, my wife says it smells like my lil girl Chihuahua (Fiona) ears...I made a recipe on my app called Feef's Ears, as a tribute to her, but I didn't make it public, as it's not much of a recipe... That being said, this is a great recipe using M&amp;H... It does tone down that chocolatey taste you get with M&amp;H. Definitely simple, definitely good! Nice job! ","score":5},{"user":"MrBurgundy","text":"This is really good. Great balance of the two flavors. It packs a punch for being 6% flavoring! Smooth, sweet, and easy on the palate. It's an excellent shake and vape as well. Thanks for sharing!","score":5}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"22099","name":"SICK AF"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
