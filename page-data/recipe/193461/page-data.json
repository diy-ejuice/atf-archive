First, it gave me a use for TFA Hypno Type, which after trying standalone I didn’t think I’d ever have a use for.  Same goes for FLV Milk. Honestly it’s been so long I couldn’t even remember what I didn’t like about that one, but it works here. I looked up some notes I made on it and saw that it's not really a very problematic flavor, it’s just that I liked other milky flavors more, so I hadn’t found a use for it yet.  Also, it’s plenty of flavor even at just 4.25% total flavor, and all three colors of the unicorn drink come through. I get the orange liqueur, something pink and sweet, and a creamy coconut. I find HPNO Type to be pretty unpleasantly harsh by itself, but these other ingredients smooth it out quite a bit and the small amount of sharpness that’s left right up front really sells this as a cocktail. Maybe it could use a little WS-23 for a frozen cocktail? Maybe that would mess it up, but it might be worth a try. It could also stand to have a little wetter feel to it. I didn’t find it to be dry or even think about it needing to be a little wetter until I’d already been vaping it for a couple hours, but maybe some cooling would help with that, too? Other than that I can’t think of a way it could be any better.  This is an absolutely solid recipe and enjoyable recipe that I could vape almost all day and a good literal interpretation of the picture. If you already have the ingredients, definitely give it a try! ","score":5}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"193461","name":"Rin's Unicorn Drink"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
