Okay for the flavor-pro-year-of-mixing challenge week 19 - my take on a drink that has gin in it - which I don't like gin so I'm swaping that for my take on vodka which is made up of hops/moscato (not really very vodka-like but I couldn't find my black tea darnit) - then the drink has peach, an orange cordial, basil, lemon juice and soda (I'm using a combo of champagne, cream soda and orange cream but in small amounts).  Off the shake it tastes alcohol-y but not very peachy or orange-y - I think it needs a steep. Or maybe more peach and orange LOL - we'll see.","steep_days":"7","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T21:32:33.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"1461","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Orange Cream","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":600},{"name":"Bergamot","vendor":"FA","millipercent":650},{"name":"Cream Soda","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Sparkling Wine (champagne)","vendor":"LA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Blood Orange","vendor":"FA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Italian Lemon Sicily","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1650},{"name":"Yakima Hops","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Moscato","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Basil","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":750},{"name":"Peach","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1650}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"100296","name":"Tabernacle Crush"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
