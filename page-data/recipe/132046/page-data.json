This is my latest, turned out really good.\r\n\r\nThe recipes a little coconut forward, on a shake and vape., the coconut does fade, I haven't found a coconut that doesn't yet.\r\n\r\nShortbread cookie base- JF biscuit, TPA butter and \r\nFA vanillaa classic come together to create a delicious shortbread cookie.\r\n\r\nCoconut - sweet coconut with a touch of f l v coconut to make it slightly more authentic and it helps keep the coconut from fading after steeping.\r\n\r\nChocolate - they've trained Devon cream and FLD milk chocolate in my opinion are the two best chocolate flavorings on the market. JF milk chocolate is a suitable substitute if you do not have FLV s offering.\r\n\r\nButterscotch - FLVS butterscotch does a nice job here.Toyed with the idea of adding fa caramel as a supporting flavor. didn't really feel like it was necessary in this recipe if you find the butterscotch lacking .25 fa caramel should give it more body.\r\n\r\nMerry Christmas\r\n","steep_days":"3","temperature":"420","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T05:58:34.000-05:00","best_vg":"69%","views":"1433","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Devon Cream","flavor_id":"8869","vendor":"VT","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Milk Chocolate","flavor_id":"4389","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":500},{"name":"Sweet Coconut","flavor_id":"605","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Coconut","flavor_id":"640","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":350},{"name":"Butterscotch","flavor_id":"613","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Biscuit","flavor_id":"4487","vendor":"JF","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Butter","flavor_id":"147","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":350},{"name":"Madagascar (Vanilla Classic)","flavor_id":"526","vendor":"FA","millipercent":300}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"132046","name":"Santa's sort of Samoa"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
