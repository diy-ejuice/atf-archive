The design brief was \"Not a Dessert\" and someone named dropped a Tobacco Leaf and Coffee Custard.  This is an attempt at that profile.\r\n\r\nThe custard base is straight stolen from the beautiful @EdibleMalfunction.  His S&V custard base is pretty tight, yo.  No need to reinvent the wheel when you can just plagiarize?\r\n\r\nAnd the tobacco/coffee.  You know what's a non-awful coffee flavor? Half of FLV Connecticut Shade.  Plus, it has some cool cigar wrapper type of cocoa notes.  Strong stuff, and a bit hard to use as the only tobacco in a recipe.  It's filled out with some FLV Cured, because it's one of the leafier straight ahead FLV Tobaccos.\r\n\r\nMy hot take: This is pretty solid. Since it's a S&V custard base with FLV Tobaccos it actually works surprisingly well off a shake.   I'm digging this.  Should follow the same general rule as other FLV tobaccos though, so it'll probably die down after 3 days and come back in a couple weeks.","steep_days":"1 (SNV)","temperature":"450","recipe_score":5,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:50:13.000-05:00","best_vg":"65%","views":"3254","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Custard","vendor":"INW","millipercent":1500},{"name":"New York Cheesecake","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Madagascar (Vanilla Classic)","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Connecticut Shade","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":250},{"name":"Cured Tobacco","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":2000}],"reviews":[{"user":"Ebc88","text":"First off I donâ€™t get coffee from this at all, but it is a solid tobacco custard off the shake. Most of my tobacco mixes that I used Connecticut Shade in absolutely destroyed my wicks so I assumed it was the cause of it, but this one didnâ€™t cotton was still whiteish after vaping 30MLs. I forget who you said you stole the custard base from, but it is super good and pretty rich off the shake.
