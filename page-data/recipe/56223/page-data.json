In the beginning, I was going for a nutty/woodsy/earthy vibe with a hint of tobacco. Tested that one, and it just wasn't doing it for me. Contemplated for about half a day, and decided with all that oak, it might be good to char it a bit and get some more Tobacco in the mix. I wanted to keep a bit of the nutty vibe, but not quite as desserty as INW 555 Gold, so I went with just a pinch of AP and Tobacco Symphony. Then a bit of Garuda to bring some sweeter Tobacco notes to the mix. \r\n\r\nShake and vape is a bit heavy on the Black Fire, but I expect that will settle down quite a bit in the next week or so. The oaks with the Black Fire is quite nice though. It's got the intensity of black fire, but it feels a bit fuller.\r\n\r\nThe oaks eventually take the lead after the Black Fire settles down. It has a very satisfying bite to it.","steep_days":"10","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:49:29.000-05:00","best_vg":"60%","views":"3710","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Acetyl Pyrazine 5%","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Black Fire","vendor":"FA","millipercent":750},{"name":"Tobacco Dirty Neutral (dnb)","vendor":"INW","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Oak Wood","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Red Oak","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Tobacco Absolute Garuda","vendor":"INW","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Tobacco Tobacco Symphony","vendor":"INW","millipercent":2000}],"reviews":[{"user":"Benoz","text":"ok so some of these concentrates were hard for me to get to australia so i had to do some subbing i subbed the tobacco absolute for virginia tobacco FLV and tobacco symphony for 7leaves ultimate FA now this could have changed the entire mix lol but i wasnt sure what my options were as this is my first tobacco recipe and vape ever. it came out great tho and tasts to me like smoking log cabin but is missing the after taste of log cabin. its getting 5 stars from me because it tastes like a actual smoke thanks cbv hopfully i am filthy rich one day ( or stop being a tight ass) and can get the proper inw flavours shipped to australia. "},{"user":"LimeDrive","text":"Mixed 50/50, steeped 10 days. What a pleasure to vape! I get a strong tobacco leaf taste surrounded with nuts, wood,  smoke, dirtiness and...coconut. I think it's the Red Oak that gives me coconut. Anyway, it fits perfectly and adds to the tastiness. This is a very creative recipe that inspires others to make cool tobacco recipes. Highly recommended.&#xD;\n"},{"user":"matthewkocanda","text":"Reviewed this on the BLND Podcast during the Mix It or Fix It portion of the show. Big ups to CBV for sending me a sampler of this banger of a recipe. First off, let me address the fact that this is by no means an ADV, in my honest opinion (unless you are a tobacco maniac that can handle that all day). However, this is the best tobacco recipe I've tried in my entire time vaping. Smoaked is something special, and if you're looking for a recipe that literally is a reminder of the good old days of smoking cigarettes, look no further. On the first few hits of a freshly saturated wick, there are heavy peanut butter notes that play nicely with the tobaccos to create a fairly sweet, dessert type profile. However, after those initial pulls, we're left with something completely unique and amazing. Literal smoke. This shit hits the throat like a cigarette, and leaves an aftertaste of campfire, oak, and beautiful earthy deliciousness. I have never had a tobacco recipe that left me wanting more after a few minutes, but Smoaked kept enticing me to hit it again. The tobaccos are a perfect blend of sweet nutty notes on the inhale, and ashy, smokey, woodsy flavour on the exhale and aftertaste. This one is an expertly crafted recipe that only improves with steeping. A great mix for someone fresh off the smokes still looking for that burning cigarette note, but also complex enough for the experienced mixer to enjoy while pulling out those subtle nuances. Well done, I'll be getting the concentrates to mix this up for those long nights of bourbon and painting."}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"56223","name":"Smoaked"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
