Not too many good pear recipes around but this is definitely one. The pear and creams work well together. I added .5% SS just because I like my juice a little on sweet side . Excellent recipe , thank you sir."},{"user":"ianerb","score":"none","text":"Looking for a good Pear and this works. 2x 10ml and now into a 100ml "},{"user":"FizzChaser","score":"5","text":"Excellent work here! A tasty pear trinity! This is my favourite pear recipe yet, and it's really not even close."},{"user":"LonesomeRhodesTN","score":"5","text":"The pear trinity!!  A smooth, sweet, crisp work of art.  If you've been looking for an authentic pear . . . look no further!  What Foment_life has done here rivals any trinity created thus far!!  I'm just going to mix up a big batch of TFA/FA Pear and FA Fuji, call it Fomented Pears and use it at 5.5% wherever a pear flavor is needed!  Outstanding work!!  "},{"user":"ID10-T","score":"5","text":"Satisfying AF pear &amp; cream with a nice balance between the two - I love it. Other people want to play with that cream base, but I want to see where I go with with this ratio of TFA/FA Pear and backed up with some Fuji. It really tastes like pear, crisp but sweet, with great depth. "},{"user":"Zany","score":"4","text":"I've had TFA and FA Pear since my first order - Haven't been able to find a use for them .. till now!&#xD;\n&#xD;\nThis is a great recipe! The pear note is subtle, and not too overpowering for me - The Fuji really helps out the pear in this mix - Creamy and delicious!"},{"user":"UnappreciatedRobot","score":"5","text":"The 10ml sample I made didnâ€™t even last 24 hours from when I started vaping it. I was lucky enough to try the cream base from this recipe before it was released. I can confirm that this base works very well with strawberries as well as pear. I imagine you can throw whatever fruit combo you want at it and it will be good.&#xD;\n&#xD;\nThe combo of TFA Pear and FA Pear really stands out here with a little help from FA Fuji. FA Pear and FA Fuji add just the right amount of juiciness and TFA Pear seems to bring more of the actual pear flavor. Very good."},{"user":"bjorama","score":"5","text":"I'm not a big fruit vaper but this is 100% delicious.  Only the 2nd pear recipe that I thought was good.
