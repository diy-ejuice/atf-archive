Maybe we can figure out why you don't like it and improve it for your tastes. \r\n\r\nWhen using TFA's Smooth: Use only 1 drop per 10ML. so in a 30ml bottle use 3 drops. This blends it all together and puffs it up a little bit. Mutes the sour notes and brings out the more sweetness from the caramel.\r\n\r\nNote: This is a first run. there's room for improvement. \r\n\r\nLet it sit for 3 days minimum.\r\n\r\nBest after 14-21 days.\r\n\r\nE: This is pretty bad. I can't believe anyone saw this and thought it might be good.","steep_days":"7","temperature":"0","recipe_score":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-11T17:19:42.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"1555","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Bavarian Cream","flavor_id":"145","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Butter Cream","flavor_id":"3","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":750},{"name":"Caramel (original)","flavor_id":"149","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Catalan Cream","flavor_id":"483","vendor":"FA","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Cereal 27","flavor_id":"4163","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1320},{"name":"Hazelnut","flavor_id":"1312","vendor":"FW","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Smooth","flavor_id":"381","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":100},{"name":"Vienna Cream","flavor_id":"516","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1500}],"reviews":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"45973","name":"Honey Caramel Cream"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
