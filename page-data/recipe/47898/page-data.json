The creams blend together to give a nice creamy mouthfeel. The vanillas work together to bring out the cake and the holy adds a little bit more richness to the recipe without overpowering it. The frosting combined with the meringue adds a perfect amount of sweetness. Thebcatalan cream gives it a tiny bit of spicyness to the cake to add to the Fuji apple true authenticity. I added 1 drop of rich cinnamon per 30 ml to give that perefect spiced note.  The super sweet is optional, but I like my deserts sweets so I added it to make it taste great right from the Shake. Give this a full 7-10 days to steep for everything to come together.
