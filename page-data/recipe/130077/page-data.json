Uncle Freddy's famous, fancy fried dough, showered with carnival cultivated cinnamon-sugar, serenaded with a cosby-quality banana pudding.\" \r\n\r\nSo, here it goes...\r\n\r\nFLV Vanilla Pudding/VT Pudding Base: these 2 combined make up a delicious \"Cosby-esque\" vanilla puddin'\r\n\r\nSA Banana Flambe: gives the fried banana aspect and also adds a touch of cinnamon...\r\n\r\nVT Banana Custard: ties together the banana flambe with the pudding while adding some more depth to the banana pudding aspect of the recipe\r\n\r\nFLV Rich Cinnamon: turns up the cinnamon flavor. \r\n\r\nCAP Funnel Cake: In Bad Drips description they talk of funnel cake and Capella had just dropped their funnel cake around the time that Ugly Butter hit the shelves, so I figure it's in there... so why not? \r\n\r\nWF Cinnamon Pastry: no reason other than I just picked this up and wanted to give it a try... plus I figured it would add some more depth to the bakery/dough aspect of the recipe while adding a bit more cinnamon... which it seems to do just fine...\r\n\r\nTPA Toasted Marshmallow: to add a little sweetness, mouthfeel, depth and body to the entire recipe. \r\n\r\nCAP SS: why not?... It's a tooth rotting belt busting State Fair Treat... it needs to be sweet! 0.5% does just that... add more or don't if you want to...\r\n\r\nFA Joy: to bring out the yeasty-ness of the fried dough just a lil more... feel free to omit it... I personally don't care for joy either, but it works well here...\r\n\r\n3 day steep and the banana calms down... day 5 the pudding melds together and everything tastes delicious... didn't make it past a week with the first batch, so I don't know if it'll change much at the 2 week mark...\r\n\r\nPlease rate and review if you mix. \r\n","steep_days":"5 (SNV)","temperature":"1975","recipe_score":5,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:50:36.000-05:00","best_vg":"60%","views":"1772","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Banana Flambe","flavor_id":"9131","vendor":"SA","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Banana Custard","flavor_id":"8825","vendor":"VT","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Rich Cinnamon","flavor_id":"638","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":150},{"name":"Vanilla Pudding","flavor_id":"4433","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Pudding Base","flavor_id":"8948","vendor":"VT","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Funnel Cake","flavor_id":"4166","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Cinnamon Pastry","flavor_id":"6049","vendor":"WF","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Toasted Marshmallow","flavor_id":"340","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Super Sweet","flavor_id":"2384","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":500},{"name":"Joy","flavor_id":"401","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000}],"reviews":[{"user":"lionhrt9","text":"Right up our alley.
