Needed citrus is given by FA Lime Tahity Cold Pressed and FE Lemon, VT Bergamot adds to the aroma. INW Cactus does its thing giving freshness, but lies hidden in the mix. VT Fizzy Sherbet smoothes it all out, and gives an extra zesty touch. Can add CAP Cucumber, to smooth it out 2-3% but it is great as is. Helps clean cotton like a champ, specially after tobaccos!\r\n\r\nINW Coolada (or WS 23) to taste. Cheers!\r\n","steep_days":"1 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-02T07:44:10.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"685","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Bergamot","flavor_id":"8827","vendor":"VT","millipercent":260},{"name":"Botanical Gin","flavor_id":"9887","vendor":"VT","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Cactus","flavor_id":"647","vendor":"INW","millipercent":300},{"name":"Coolada","flavor_id":"10313","vendor":"INW","millipercent":500},{"name":"Fizzy Sherbet","flavor_id":"8878","vendor":"VT","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Lemon","flavor_id":"1655","vendor":"FE","millipercent":500},{"name":"Lime Tahity Cold Pressed","flavor_id":"581","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Tonic Water","flavor_id":"9900","vendor":"VT","millipercent":3000}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"176019","name":"Gin & Tonic (classic)"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
