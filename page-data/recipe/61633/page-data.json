I don't know why, its a pretty simple and linear profile.  I guess it may be because ever since I was 12 I've been lactose intolerate.  Man have I missed my chocolate milk.  I've always detected a coconut note on the finish with ninja man, and I just knew it had to be Flavorah chocolate deutch.  I've been playing with this and I think it's pretty spot on.  It been a struggle trying to get the body exactly right, there are just too many options and variables.  Here's where I'm at right now:  \r\n\r\nFlavorah Chocolate Deutch:  This is a great flavoring, but its strong.  It's a bit bipolar, keep it low and its a nice smooth chocolate, a tad on the darker side, with a touch of coconut on the finish.  The closer you get to 1% with it and the coconut starts to shine.  0.4% about 2 drops per 10ml is just right.  A little really does go a long way.  \r\n\r\nTPA Bavarian Cream:  A great easy to use custard with a nice medium body.  Its thick and rich and just about right.\r\n\r\nFA Vienna Cream:  I used this to loosen up the Bavarian Cream a bit to make it a little more milky.\r\n\r\nTPA Vanilla Swirl:  This in conjuction with Vienna Cream help make the Bavarian Cream into a looser cream body.  Not quite milk, more like a nice medium body cream.  I chose to use it for its lighter creamy texture, and a little note of vanilla, as chocolate and vanilla always go hand in hand. It does like a good steep tho.\r\n\r\nThis is good as a shake and vape.  Vanilla Swirl does like  a good steep so it should get better over time.  I usually mixed a 30ml bottle and it usually doesn't make it past a few days.\r\n\r\nEnjoy and please leave me a comment!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","steep_days":"1","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:49:34.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"2263","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Chocolate Deutsch","flavor_id":"2151","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":400},{"name":"Vienna Cream","flavor_id":"516","vendor":"FA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Bavarian Cream","flavor_id":"145","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Vanilla Swirl","flavor_id":"189","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Super Sweet","flavor_id":"2384","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":500}],"reviews":[{"user":"tw2k","text":"This german chocolate cake shines.
