(Cinnamon Hearts Candy)","author":"MotherPunker","created_at":"2018-04-14","image_url":"https://storage.googleapis.com/dev-images.alltheflavors.com/uploads/recipe/imageUrl/96835/tattooed-redhead-1.jpg","description":"Don't be mistaken, she may look all sweet but she'll set you on fire.       This one's spicy like those redheads ya just can't stay away from!   \r\n\r\nTastes just like a cinnamon heart candy; spicy, sickeningly sweet with that creamy-ish hard candy center you get after you suck all the spicy off. Oh, and the room note on this, if you like hot cinnamon, is to die for!  I've been painstakingly trying to achieve (and by that I mean literally...my poor throat!) this profile on and off for years now, its something Ive not seen any mixers truly be able (or brave enough to try) to pull off.   That made me even more determined and well, Ive finally nailed it down, just in time for Valentines day.  Now I don't do holidays but you might want to mix up a bottle for your crush or sweetheart \"t-t-t-t-t-t-today junior!\" (if you didn't know thats from Billy Madison...tsk, tsk, shame on you)\r\n\r\nI initially started by trying about every red hot/tamale flavor out there but to me they all have this synthetic chemical taste on the exhale that I really despise, I wanted to feel like I just swallowed a mitt-ful of the candy hearts I keep around all year long cuz I love em so much :p  The trick with cinnamon flavorings is they need to be used really low otherwise they're just miserable and will tear a hole though your throat.  My initial starting place of 2% with these was a truly painful experience, I couldn't taste anything for a bit after that thanks to the perfume note that TPA takes on if used higher than this.\r\n\r\nFLV RED CINNAMON is a good spicy hot cinnamon with no chemical taste but kinda lacks that candy edge, so we need to help it out some.\r\n\r\nTPA CINNAMON; by accident, I realized that this is not in-fact a spice type flavor but rather a red hot flavor without the nasty chemical/perfume taste like the other offerings.  This helps to fill the edge that FLV is missing.\r\n\r\nINW CHERRIES/INW SHISHA STRAWBERRY/VT GOLDEN SYRUP \r\nThe combination of fruits at low% help fill in the candy note while staying low enough to not come upfront & golden syrup helps with the sticky mouth feel.  I had initially tried CAP hibiscus & WF grenadine for the syrupy mouthfeel they are known for adding to a mix but they altered the taste too much.  Golden Syrup is an incredibly useful flavoring that adds body and mouthfeel, deepens flavoring in a mix without being distracting at all.\r\n\r\nLA CREAMCHEESE ICING/PUR MARSHMALLOW/DFS HOLY VANILLA/000 POWDERED SUGAR\r\nThis builds a chewy sticky mouthfeel with a hint of creaminess & helps blend out the harshness of the spicy cinnamon.  PUR marshmallow might seem like an odd choosing but I had a reason for this.  Other offerings are great for mouthfeel but PUR, I feel actually has the candy marshmallow taste, as well as feel.  If you don't have it you could sub which ever marshmallow you have but I would up the holy vanilla to 1% in addition to it.  Powdered sugar adds a great confection taste and feel to pretty much everything, its for sure one of those flavors you don't wanna be without.  \r\n\r\nTPA SMOOTH \r\nThis just helps to soften the harshness of the cinnamon and meld the mix together.  You could sub MTS vape wizard if you have that instead, or omit it completely.  I do find it helps but it wont break the recipe if you don't have it.\r\n\r\nSUPERSWEET\r\nYes this is insanely high!  You could certainly omit the sweetener or adjust to your liking, I just feel that for an authentic candy cinnamon taste, it needed to be sickly sweet.  This isn't an ADV anyways, (unless you're a masochist) so why not?\r\n\r\nIf you have a sensitive throat, I suggest making a small sample of this first and if you find it too spicy, you can reduce the cinnamon flavorings to .10% and .25% they are still detectable at this level but not as saturated or spicy.\r\nI vape it right off the shake but breathing overnight will mellow it a bit and after a week steep, its a bit more creamy.   This is better at higher wattages.\r\n\r\nI honestly rate and review every single recipe I mix up & ask you to do the same.\r\n\r\nPlease do not repost elsewhere without first gaining my consent to do so.  You may not use this for commercial gain.\r\nHappy mixing!","steep_days":"2 (SNV)","temperature":"450","recipe_score":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-12T03:45:47.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"1185","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Cinnamon","flavor_id":"298","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":250},{"name":"Smooth","flavor_id":"381","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Super Sweet","flavor_id":"2384","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1250},{"name":"Shisha Strawberry","flavor_id":"1711","vendor":"INW","millipercent":750},{"name":"Cream Cheese Icing","flavor_id":"2380","vendor":"LA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Marshmallow","flavor_id":"7768","vendor":"PUR","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Red Cinnamon","flavor_id":"4363","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":500},{"name":"Powdered Sugar","flavor_id":"6522","vendor":"OOO","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Golden Syrup","flavor_id":"8887","vendor":"VT","millipercent":1250},{"name":"Cherries","flavor_id":"757","vendor":"INW","millipercent":350},{"name":"Holy Vanilla","flavor_id":"2385","vendor":"DFS","millipercent":600}],"reviews":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"96835","name":"Those Redheads though....
