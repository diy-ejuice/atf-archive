I keep coming back to this, and it doesn't get old.  Tasty as hell off the shake and only gets better given time.  For me, this reaches ADV status . . . from pairing it with coffee in the morning, to accompanying a sip of whiskey at night, and everything in between.\r\n\r\nThis is a sweet, robust RY4 tobacco slathered in vanilla-laced caramel backed up by the velvet-smooth cream of cheesecake . . . I'm in my happy place.\r\n\r\nListening to this amazing [Deftones Mix](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9TPY2Jyyplk&t=287s) throughout concept, creation, and testing.
