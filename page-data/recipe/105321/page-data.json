Very simple and versatile recipe.\r\n\r\nOSDIY Luck Shot / TPA RY4 Double - This two combined create a warm \r\ntobacco swetness and infuse a dark caramel richness to the cookie component.\r\n\r\nFA Cookie / TPA Graham Cracker (Clear) - To raise the graininess and to complement the body of the cookie.\r\n\r\nFW Butterscotch - Just to bring more of the caramel aspect.

Finally a good use for lucky shot! I mixed this up at 24mg and I'm vaping it at 15w and it's excellent. Nice subtle coffee flavor with lots of caramel and a bit of crunch. This is definitely one of the best recipes for MTL I have tried."}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"105321","name":"Dark RY4 Cookie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
