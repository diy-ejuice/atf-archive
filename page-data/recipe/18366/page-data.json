It won't shout out hey I'm Strawberry but it does add to that yogurt Base.\r\n\r\nCapella CDS \r\n\r\nAgain this is one of the chosen basket flavours so it had to be used. I wanted to use it in a way that doesn't allow it to be it's bakery elements so I went a small percentage here to just allow them cinnamon notes to shine through. It adds some added flavour to the cereal 27 without it overpowering and making it lead towards its bakery pastry flavour. It adds bite and a little spice to the topping without offending. \r\n\r\nFA Fuji \r\n\r\nAgain another basket ingredient this I used for the granola topping it's a strong flavour and works just about wherever you place it. It plays it part well and adds some added flavour to the cereal topping, an extra element.  The honey from the FLV milk and honey kind of sweetens it up and combines well to give the apple a twist.\r\n\r\nFLV milk and honey \r\n\r\nI used this along side the yogurt it takes away some sourness from the Greek yogurt and the honey adds a twist to the apple and the cereal 27 giving both a more glazed effect kind of coating them with extra flavour.  The honey works very well into crunchy cereal and apple. \r\n\r\nCapella cereal 27\r\n\r\nThis is a great flavour to use for the crunchy flaky topping it's quite weak so 3% is a good point. It adds enough to the yogurt to replicate that granola topping it's toasted elements work really well especially with the honey unfortunately I could play further with this but the 6 flavours won't allow so this works fine in doing its job of a granola topping. \r\n\r\nFLV Greek yogurt \r\n\r\nThis is an amazing yogurt flavour I was amazed when I found this flavour.  It stands very well in what it does its creamy and thick with a slight sour profile you get from a Greek yogurt.  It punches through the other flavours you know it's there 2% is a perfect amount. The milk combines very well and turns it more into a creamy yogurt we all enjoy.\r\n\r\nEthyl maltol \r\n\r\nAdding just 0.75% is completely necessary it adds some sweetness and brings down the sour note from the yogurt. It also rounds out the recipe. \r\n\r\nMix at 30pg 70 vg\r\n1 week steep ","steep_days":"7","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T15:20:21.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"2947","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Strawberry (ripe)","flavor_id":"271","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":6000},{"name":"Fuji","flavor_id":"506","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1250},{"name":"Cinnamon Danish Swirl","flavor_id":"35","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1250},{"name":"Cereal 27","flavor_id":"4163","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Milk & Honey","flavor_id":"609","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Greek Yogurt","flavor_id":"615","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Ethyl Maltol","flavor_id":"1710","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":750}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"18366","name":"Spoon Me "}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
