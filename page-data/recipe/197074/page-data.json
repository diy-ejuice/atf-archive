For those that can indulge (let me say how jealous I am) this is one of those recipes that I vaped until every last drop in the bottle was gone.  My husband still vapes this in a MTL tank and I seriously think he does it to make me jealous, but enough about that.  It was a sweet, fulfilling flavor with a great balance of cinnamon, cream, and dark undertones.  If you try it make sure to let me know so I can be jealous of you too.","steep_days":"7","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:51:36.000-05:00","best_vg":"60%","views":"1346","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Cinnamon Danish Swirl","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Rice Crunchies","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Ry4 Double","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":5000},{"name":"Super Sweet","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":500},{"name":"Vanilla Bean Ice Cream","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":3000}],"reviews":[{"user":"Slushy","text":"I'm thinking deadly sin kinda vibes on this one...absolutely amazing.
