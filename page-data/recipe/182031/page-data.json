I think that using this combined you get a pretty nice upfront \"walnut\" ice cream.\r\n\r\nThe caramel drizzle is made by FW Butterscotch Ripple and WF Caramel Butter wich together add a nice drizzle of caramel on top this Holy Nuts Cream.","steep_days":"3 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"total_reviews":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-06T20:52:17.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"820","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"French Vanilla Icecream","vendor":"HS","millipercent":750},{"name":"Vanilla Ice Cream","vendor":"LB","millipercent":5000},{"name":"Vanilla Swirl","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Butterscotch Ripple","vendor":"FW","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Caramel Butter","vendor":"WF","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Nut Mix","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Super Sweet","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":500}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"182031","name":"Holy Nuts Cream"}}}
