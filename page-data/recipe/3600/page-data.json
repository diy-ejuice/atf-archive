The creames are were well chosen and build a perfect background for the strawberries.&#xD;\nOne of the best S&amp;C i have mixed so far. Well done, thanks for the recipe. :-)"},{"user":"cxxxxp","score":"5","text":"What can I say... but that you could probably go through 'x' number of S+C flavours from the premium juice lines in any country and you still won't find one that can stand up to this recipe. The sharing of this creation is a gift to the DIY community (Thankyou @CheebaSteeba) The combination of strawberries tastes just like a strawberry chupa-chup (lollipop) and I look forward to playing with this combo in recipes inspired by this. Personally, I like to add a *little* FA Whipped Cream (0.5%) and CAP Vanilla Whipped Cream (0.25%) to swing the ratio of cream:strawberry in the direction of cream a little more and this is purely a subjective tweak I make to adjust to personal taste. This recipe should really be crowned the king of the Strawberries and Cream profile though IMO. Great work man!"},{"user":"Grfxman","score":"5","text":"This recipe deserves every five-star review below - figured one more cannot hurt. This is so delicious, perfect blend of cream and strawberry. I also added about a half a percent of SS. But I always do. Steeped 5 days and cannot put it down."},{"user":"RUG_ly","score":"5","text":"Real good. I didnt have the LA Cream Cheese so I used Gelato Vaniglia by FA. "},{"user":"ianerb","score":"5","text":"The best S&amp;C I have mixed to date, profile is per the reviews below. Must have in the rotation"},{"user":"cincinnatiking","score":"5","text":"I can't believe I've never reviewed this recipe either. I have vaped it every single day for well over a year! I think I'm the number one promoter of this recipe. Every time someone ask's for a good S&amp;C I give them this. This is a true masterpiece! I've tried and tried to make a better S&amp;C, but for my taste it's not possible. This recipe changes as it steeps. I would say that after ten days it's perfect, but I let it go for a month sometimes. The strawberry doesn't fade much at all. The LA CCI really comes out a lot more as it steeps. I also get a very nice  dairy note that comes and goes. That dairy not that is so lovely comes in a lot stronger after a month. I'm assuming it's the FLV Cream. I would not recommend subbing anything. I've adapted this recipe every way possible. If you are missing any of the flavors I highly recommend you get them. I do add a little Cap's Super Sweet. This is without a doubt the best S&amp;C ever made hands down!"},{"user":"ObiWanCannoli","score":"5","text":"Can't believe I forgot to review this when I tried it last year! This is definitely one of the best s&amp;c I've tried and I've tried a buttload. That cci truly takes this recipe to the next level, the creams are very well balanced with the strawberry and the flavor is nice and saturates the palate. I unfortunately pick up a bit of harshness which I definitely attribute to the strawberry ripe. I would like to try this baby out with 1.5% strawberry sc(RF) in place of the strawberry ripe. Wonderful recipe here, definitely a must mix!"},{"user":"SatJoe563","score":"none","text":"I am going to have to add / repeat what every one else had already said.  I have been chasing a strawberry I can taste for over a year now.  As far as mixers, I am still a beginner for sure.  That said, I have tried numerous strawberry cream recipes.  Following this one to the \"T\", I am able to taste strawberry off the shake.  Going to hold my star review till it steeps a few days.  It can only get better.  Hoping the strawberry stays, and creams start to meld together some more.  Scratch that, adding the 5 now!  Personal taste, I wish it were sweeter, but can adjust to my taste later.  Thank you for this recipe!"},{"user":"Gonzilla","score":"5","text":"Worthy of the praise, an excellent take on a well loved profile. Introduced me to INW Shisha Strawberry which was a massive boon for someone like me who struggles to taste some of the strawberry concentrates. "},{"user":"corvape","score":"5","text":"This is a delicious strawberry and cream recipe. I mixed it a few months ago and kind of forgot about it. I remember it was pretty good off the shake, but after a steep, it has really come together. The Strawberry balance and flavor is perfect, combined with the creams, specifically the cream cheese icing just giving it that extra zing. Cant go wrong with this one!"},{"user":"ID10-T","score":"5","text":"Tried this one what seems like forever ago and just forgot to rate it. S&amp;C's are a bit overdone but this one is still the best I've tried. Like Runt said in the very first review over a year ago, it's the LA CCI that really makes it shine. "},{"user":"G8RH8R23","score":"5","text":"Mixed this up a week ago. I can finally taste a strawberry!  Good as a shake and vape but awesome after about 4 days.  "},{"user":"Alt-FcTs","score":"5","text":"Dude... Ive gotta give you props man. This shit is ri-fucking-diculously refreshing. Ive tried every strawberries and cream under the sun, and tried sooooo many times to make one of my own. The only s&amp;c vape ive enjoyed more than this is probably rose milk and back when i started to mix Gods milk. They both do something completely different for me than this. Anyways, im just a nobody from Louisiana, that absolutely think you hit this one out of the park. Sweet"},{"user":"Fiftytrent","score":"5","text":"This is phenomenal"},{"user":"Tootall","score":"5","text":"This was a good break from the standard strawberry and cream. I like the way that flavorah cream and cream cheese icing is what sets this recipe apart in my mind. Thank you for this  offering. "},{"user":"Billywilly","score":"5","text":"Best strawberries and cream recipe I've had to date. The bar has been set high with this one."},{"user":"DodgerFog33","score":"5","text":"This was a great take on a Strawberry and Cream recipe. The flavors really blend together so well. I tried this flavor right off the bat and instantly it was very good. Then after three days I tried it again to see how it tasted after a little steep time. Wow the flavors were really coming together. The flavor was really good. After 7 days of steep time all I can say is \"WOW what a masterpiece. The flavors all come together so wonderfully. The strawberries work so well together and the La cream cheese and the Flavorah cream really bring out a nice tangy creaminess that meld the recipe together. Then add the Shisha Vanilla which really makes this recipe so balanced on all ends for the perfect all day vape recipe. Definitely a 5/5 on this recipe. Thanks for this complete Allstar take on a Strawberry and cream recipe. I will definitely be mixing up more of this as I see this flavor being in my daily rotation. "},{"user":"AndreM","score":"5","text":"Still my favourite sweet strawberry cream since mixing it up in September of 2016. Always in my rotation. Thank you for sharing the recipe."},{"user":"MrColdOne","score":"5","text":"I really really like this strawberry cream! Theres something about the mix of FLV Cream and Shisha Vanilla that really nail the cream base. And this combo of strawberrys are layered perfectly in this recipe. This recipe will be a staple in my rotation for sure! Awesome job!!"},{"user":"BX1018","score":"5","text":"Very nice bright strawberry profile with a light cream finish.  Not overbearing, but you definitely can taste the strawberry even after a long steep.  Highly recommend you give this one a try."},{"user":"mlNikon","score":"5","text":"Very tasty Cheeba! This mix is balanced beautifully."},{"user":"jbird","score":"5","text":"This recipe is special to me because it was my first strawberry vape I could taste. I'm one of the damned people who can't taste strawberry very well. This combo of strawberries is so addicting but that's not where it ends. The CCI works perfect with the VBIC and Shish Vanilla combo. Very thick, creamy and perfectly balanced.&#xD;\nExcellent job!"},{"user":"Friction2600","score":"5","text":"Excellent recipe mixed 60mls (which is a lot for me) right off the bat trusting in the ingredients and percentages seen in this recipe. I am glad i followed directions. It is fantastic. I will def be making up more. I vaped it after about a 9 day steep and it is glorious. Going to def make more and see how it does after a few weeks steep. Thanks again for the great vape!"},{"user":"Dalpho","score":"5","text":"It's a great strawberry vape, unique and stands out. One of the only strawberry vapes I actually can taste the strawberry."},{"user":"Steevsta","score":"5","text":"This is really nice and one of the few strawberry creams that i can taste the strawberry well done sir!!"},{"user":"Thadentman","score":"5","text":"After the first week It was still cream cheese icing heavy. After the second week this recipe really shines, it's unlike anything I have tried so far. It's really great."},{"user":"RuntDastardly","score":"5","text":"Out of every Strawberry &amp; Cream recipe I've ever mixed up, and there have been many, this one is my favorite. Here's why. &#xD;\n&#xD;\nThe first thing that struck me was the strawberry profile. I have a feeling that those who have trouble sensing strawberry in a vape should consider giving this particular combo a go. It's a very potent, but not overly so, idealized fresh strawberry. Not too candied, not too earthy, not too sweet or tart, just perfect. &#xD;\n&#xD;\nThe strawberries mesh beautifully with the combination of creams, which have exactly the right amount of vanilla to give them depth and complexity. But, the really inspired flourish here is the inclusion of LA Cream Cheese Icing. There's something about that tangy zing that really nuances the citric pop of the strawberries, both keeping them from being too sharp, and ensuring that they stay perfectly present against the subtle weight of the creams.&#xD;\n&#xD;\nI've mixed this recipe up several times now, which is a notable rarity for me. I'm good for about 15 to 30 ML of most recipes before the novelty wears off and I'm seeking a completely different profile. This one, though, I can't get enough of. It's satisfying and intriguing every time I taste it, which is often throughout the day. This is an undisputed ADV masterpiece."}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"3600","name":"Sweet Strawberry Cream"}}}
