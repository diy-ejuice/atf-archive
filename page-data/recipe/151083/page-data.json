Sadly, since my youth I haven't found a recipe that comes close to matching her expertise with this marvelous dessert. I was fortunate enough to not only have a mother who was a great cook, but also an expert baker!\r\n  \r\nFor my base, **RF COFFEE CAKE** was the obvious choice. This flavoring is not the most potent(probably because it is VG-based), so a high percentage was needed. Within this flavoring, you will taste cooked apple, cinnamon, and brown sugar \"crumblies\". It still needs help though, to become *full flavored*.\r\n  \r\n**FLV APPLE FILLING & FLV APPLE** filled out the cooked fruit/cinnamon layer quite nicely here. I tried FLV Apple Pop before this combination but found it didn't quite do what I wanted it to do. This doesn't mean it would not be a perfect additive in any other baked apple dessert. I just found that it didn't quite work *here* as I wanted.\r\n \r\n**JF YELLOW CAKE & JF BISCUIT** complete the *cakey* base of this recipe. This is a very good combination at these percentages.\r\n\r\n  \r\nIf you want, you can crank up the **CAP SUPER SWEET** to about 0.5%. I can't stand this flavoring too high...which is why I kept it relatively low here. Too much sucralose smothers little nuances afaic.\r\n  \r\nOf course, this is a potent enough mix to be vaped fresh. But I prefer it from 5-7 days plus.\r\n  \r\n**STEEP: 5-7 DAYS**\r\n  \r\n**VG: 70%**\r\n  \r\n*Please don't use this recipe for commercial, as it was shared in good faith*\r\n","steep_days":"5","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"total_reviews":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T15:21:41.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"1295","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Coffee Cake","vendor":"RF","millipercent":8000},{"name":"Apple","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Yellow Cake","vendor":"JF","millipercent":3500},{"name":"Biscuit","vendor":"JF","millipercent":500},{"name":"Super Sweet","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":250},{"name":"Apple Filling","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":750}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"151083","name":"Jewish Apple Cake"}}}
