I was kindly offered the possibility to go sponsored by Wonder Flavours and I took the opportunity. The best part is, Frank also made sure I received the whole line of Wonder Flavours flavorings.\r\n\r\nThis mix being for the second biggest French expo, I decided to only use Wonder Flavours TPD ready flavorings. I'm usually not a big fan of pear, but this pear is so ripe, so sweet and so lovely, I had to go with it.\r\n\r\nI want to thank MB ( https://alltheflavors.com/users/MECH_MOD_RN ) who helped developed and test these recipes !\r\n\r\nWF Pear = A great pear flavoring if you like a sweet, ripe and juicy pear. The body can be a tad thin and that's why I cranked it up. It ages well at this % and doesn't have any off notes I can taste.\r\n\r\nWF Almond Cookie = If you want a lovely, almond that doesn't at all taste like cherry, this is a great choice. You have to go a little high if you want the buttery cookie to come out, but otherwise, it tastes like almonds and that's really what we want.\r\n\r\nWF Starfruit = So I'll let you in on my little secret about this flavoring. Incredibly enough, it tastes like honey to me. And I mean a sweet, balanced honey that smells good, tastes good and doesn't fade at all. Don't put too much,  it's quite potent and will definitely bend over 1%. Personally I love it, and I will use it again for sure.\r\n\r\nAnd there you have it, the  very famous French sablé amande et poire. We even have a dessert called tarte Normande with just this style of recipe but in a warm bed of vanilla eggy custard.\r\n\r\nEnjoy, be queer & vape on !!\r\n\r\n\r\n[Photo Credit: Natural Born Feeder - Rozanna Purcel]","steep_days":"10","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"total_reviews":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-05T16:44:00.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"688","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Almond Cookie SC","vendor":"WF","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Ripe Pear SC","vendor":"WF","millipercent":5000},{"name":"Starfruit SC","vendor":"WF","millipercent":750}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"139747","name":"WF Sablé Amande et Poire (Pear Almond Cookie)"}}}
