This is not an overly sweet vape and taste is very subjective to where you can change out the sweetener.\r\n\r\nAfter messing around with the Liquid Amber I will put out a warning.. DO NOT USE IT AT HIGH PERCENTAGES .50% max it can destroy the recipe if used to high.","steep_days":"14","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-05T14:26:46.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"1564","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Ripe Pear SC","vendor":"WF","millipercent":1800},{"name":"Brandy","vendor":"FA","millipercent":750},{"name":"Crepe SC","vendor":"WF","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Vienna Cream","vendor":"LB","millipercent":750},{"name":"Super Sweet","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":750},{"name":"Liquid Amber","vendor":"FA","millipercent":250},{"name":"Brown Sugar","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":750}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"101407","name":"Crepe with Brandied Pear Glaze"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
