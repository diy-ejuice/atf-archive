(Btw i can't stand CAP Nyc Cheesecake.It gives me a rancid disgusting aftertaste at the end of of the exhale)\r\nAnyways,with this small alteration you get just enough crust and the creamy cheesy properties of a cheesecake.You could probably bump it up to 2% if you like even more crust and \"cheese\",but that might throw the balance off a bit.\r\nFor me 1% is just enough to get where i want it. \r\nAll the other flavor notes you can find at my original recipe\r\n https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/33148#another_awesome_straw_milk_by_demonic_mixer\r\n\r\nEnjoy and let me know what you think!\r\n","steep_days":"1 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-11-30T14:54:27.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"1451","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Strawberry Sweet","vendor":"JF","millipercent":3500},{"name":"Vanilla Swirl","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Vienna Cream","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Meringue","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Hazelnut","vendor":"FW","millipercent":500},{"name":"Biscuit","vendor":"JF","millipercent":250},{"name":"Cheesecake (graham Crust)","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1500}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"72219","name":"another awesome straw cheesecake"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
