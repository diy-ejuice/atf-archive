I just mixed it, not steeped yet, but the flavor is so true to form.  I had to substitute Banana Cream for a mixture of 3 parts CAP Vanilla Custard and 1 part Banana nut bread TPA and that is in addition to the 3% TPA Banana Nut Bread.  I didn't have CAP Caramel so I used FW Salted Caramel.  Taste just like a cream filled banana nut cookie.  I needed something different I could vape right away and this is it.  I will always keep this on hand......thanks for the Recipe....Love to all...Kitten"}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"45980","name":"Banana Nookie"}}}
