Sweet cream and the cheesecake graham gives it that dairy flavor while the Bavarian cream and vanilla swirl add in the vanilla along with the vanilla custard which also adds weight and holds everything together in this recipe.\r\n\r\n Lastly the whipped cream is just used as a topping. Picture a strawberry banana milkshake glass with that whipped cream on top that's exactly what it is there for just to finish it off.\r\n\r\n 5 day steep \r\n Tried to keep this recipe using only tfa but capella vanilla custard v1 works better in my opinion but tfa vanilla custard will do fine.\r\n\r\n\r\n","steep_days":"5","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:48:51.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"12856","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Strawberry","flavor_id":"272","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Strawberry (ripe)","flavor_id":"271","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Banana Cream","flavor_id":"210","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Vanilla Swirl","flavor_id":"189","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Vanilla Custard","flavor_id":"188","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Bavarian Cream","flavor_id":"145","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Sweet Cream","flavor_id":"183","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Cheesecake (graham Crust)","flavor_id":"152","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Whipped Cream","flavor_id":"193","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1000}],"reviews":[{"user":"alexmori","text":"I did not like it after 5 days so I put it in my steep drawer and left it alone. After 1 month it's awesome. The banana isn't too strong and it's married the banana and strawberry perfectly while still being creamy. Love it!

This one is superbly balanced if you give it the right amount of heat."},{"user":"Sinesiom","text":"Absolutely amazing recipe,  sweet Creamy strawberry vanilla inhale and a very Ripe and rich banana exhale with a lot of body.&#xD;\nCongratulations!

Creamy fruity strawberry on the inhale and a meaty, creamy banana on the exhale. "},{"user":"Peewee","text":"I waited the 5 days steep and used cap vc1. I like it. So many recipes go unrated.
