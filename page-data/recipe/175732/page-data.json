Why not have all 3!  The picture chosen was as close as I could get to what I was thinking of. One look at that picture on the box and I was into making this happen. \r\n\r\nTake some under-rated  CAP crunchy frosted cookie and sugar cookie combo  and coat it with extra buttercream frosting and then infuse  it with some light donut flavoring. Dunk these into some creamy milk base of FA milk with VT vanilla cream  and add in some sprinkles  to start  off your morning. \r\n\r\nDon't expect this to be crunchy though - lets get real! \r\n\r\nThis goes great with a coffee by the way.\r\n\r\nWF buttercream frosting was used here instead of VT as it is less \"hard\" . There was enough waxiness coming from the CAP crunchy frosted cookie.\r\n\r\nOptional sweetener - try FW Sweetener 2 drops per 15ml should do it.\r\n\r\nI use an RDA about 50-60 Watts, 0.2-0.3 Ohms.\r\n\r\nFind me at **DIY MIXERS CREW** https://www.facebook.com/groups/dmcdiy/\r\n\r\nask for lukeloop or feel free to message me here\r\n\r\n","steep_days":"7","temperature":"0","recipe_score":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-12T15:40:52.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"1228","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Glazed Donut SC","flavor_id":"9025","vendor":"WF","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Buttercream Frosting SC","flavor_id":"8361","vendor":"WF","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Crunchy Frosted Cookie","flavor_id":"10000","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Milk","flavor_id":"523","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Vanilla Cream","flavor_id":"8992","vendor":"VT","millipercent":1200},{"name":"Sugar Cookie","flavor_id":"115","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Sprinkles","flavor_id":"8490","vendor":"FW","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Sugar Crunch","flavor_id":"10221","vendor":"NR","millipercent":250}],"reviews":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"175732","name":"Sprinkled Donut Crunch  - The Worst Yet"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
