This mix comes off light, but still real creamy. The coconut/van swirl/cream fresh triad lays a wonderful foundation. (This base would be awesome with berries, especially.) Hard to detect major pineapple note, but the lime and pineapple do coalesce nicely to provide that acidic top note, cutting through the cream. I've never used FA Cold Pressed at this high of a percentage, but it works well. I would love this with a super-candy lime flavoring. Of course, I own nearly every lime out there, and naturally, it doesn't exist. INW Lime Shisha might work well here, with some FLV Pineapple, or INW Pineapple? Maybe? Possibilities are endless, but this mix is killer, as is. Worth a shot if you're a coconut-lover, or fan of creamy citrus mixes. Kudos!","score":4}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"61362","name":"\"Pineapple  D Lime in The D Cocunut\""}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
