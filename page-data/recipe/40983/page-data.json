I was out and needed to find something that I could SNV. I usually do a banana menthol, or a Thug Juice Clone, but I like to let both of them sit. I figured this would be worth a shot. I thought that this Creme de Menthe was a little risky, but I'm really enjoying this. Please let me know what you think. :)","steep_days":"5 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:49:15.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"2558","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Strawberry Sweet","flavor_id":"4745","vendor":"JF","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Sweet Strawberry","flavor_id":"121","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Kiwi","flavor_id":"1330","vendor":"FW","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Cr√àme De Menthe","flavor_id":"1266","vendor":"FW","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Menthol (liquid)","flavor_id":"1353","vendor":"FW","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Mint","flavor_id":"683","vendor":"INW","millipercent":500},{"name":"Sweetener","flavor_id":"339","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":600},{"name":"Vanilla Swirl","flavor_id":"189","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1000}],"reviews":[{"user":"Skywxp3d","text":"My first review after making +40 recipes and lurking FINALLY a recipe that has full flavor and satisfies!
