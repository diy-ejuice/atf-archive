Its great. Very thick, creamy vape. Great PB taste. Custard and creams are balanced. You can taste the thick shake. Great job!"},{"user":"mlNikon","text":"I have been craving peanut butter so, upon recommendation from someone else, I decided to mix this up and boy am I glad I did. This is really a delicious recipe. I left out the saline solution since I didn't have any but it is still so very tasty. Very well balanced with the creams and milkshake components with the peanut butter. Nice work sir!"}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"33176","name":"Peanut Butter Custard Milkshake"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
