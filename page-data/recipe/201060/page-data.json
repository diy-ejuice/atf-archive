It is \"simple\" in the sense that all of the components are necessary in some sense for me. The base two flavors are FA milk and Cereal 27. The rest of the flavors are meant to help bring out or \"fix\" these flavors, so to speak. Most of these I got from the guys and gal over at the Noted podcast as suggestions on what auxiliary flavors go best with cereal, so shout out to them. I took their suggestions and ran with them. \r\n\r\nAP brings out the nut'n'honey type of nuttiness that I expect in a cereal. The Graham cracker clear just rules and I put it in everything (but seriously I was told it goes really well with cereals and....well, it does). For the milk, FA meringue sweetens up the mix and milky underpants really just goes well with FA milk at 2 to 1 and I also use it a lot with FLV cream so it was a must for me to make that perfect milk aspect.\r\n\r\nAnyways, I use this as a good starting off point for a cereal vape, but mostly I like it by itself as an ADV.
