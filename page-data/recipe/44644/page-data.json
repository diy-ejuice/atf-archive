Only problem was... I didn't have Devon Cream. I had to purchase the flavor so it was a great reason to get even more flavors. I'm so glad I mixed this up! It's creamy, has nice texture, the strawberry is nice and sweet, and the cinnamon fills out the recipe perfectly. It's been 5 days since I mixed it up, and it just keeps getting better and better. Great job  on this! The lingering smell from the vapor is heavenly."}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"44644","name":"The Second Horseman. War. "}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
