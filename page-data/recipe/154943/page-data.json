SC Black Tea is a pretty good sweet black tea.  Adding that to LA Lemonade + FLV Lemonade(helps the lemonade longevity) and I wanted to try the VT Sour Lemon.  This is a really sweet, tart and zesty Lemon which does a wonderful job of adding to the lemonade base.  VT Mango juice is like that mango nectar that you get in a can and FLV Mango is that pure ripe mango.  This is a pretty fun refreshing vape, add WS-23 or Sweetener to taste.","steep_days":"0 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T22:33:37.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"1203","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Mango","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Mango Juice","vendor":"VT","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Lemonade","vendor":"LA","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Lemonade","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Sour Lemon","vendor":"VT","millipercent":750},{"name":"Black Tea","vendor":"SC","millipercent":3000}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"154943","name":"Mango Arnold Palmer"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
