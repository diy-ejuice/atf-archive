I think it's fairly good off the shake but will see how it goes over the coming days. \r\n*Update, brilliant after 2-3 days! I have tested this on Pod Mod, Sub-Ohn Tank & RDA and its great! \r\n\r\nFull description & Mixed Live Here: https://youtu.be/817APHhsF_E\r\n\r\nThis has been a fun mix to create!\r\nI hope you enjoy mixing this as much as I have enjoyed this creative process. Let me know what you thought in the comments below.\r\n\r\nSimply mix and enjoy off the shake but allow 3 days for best results!\r\n\r\nI enjoy this at 60W on a Single 0.2ohm SST coil on a Recurve RDA.\r\n\r\nSeriously if you like a solid recipe that works give it a go!\r\n\r\nCheers for reading this far, now go and get mixing!\r\n\r\nMake your Magic Happen! âœ¨ðŸ’–\r\n\r\n\"Together, Let's Discover!!!\"\r\n\r\nFacebook - https://www.facebook.com/groups/diydownunder/\r\nDiscord - https://discord.gg/kH4Fqbc\r\nYoutube - https://www.youtube.com/c/diydownunder\r\nWebsite - https://www.diydownunder.com/\r\nInstagram IGTV : @diydownunder","steep_days":"3 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-10T21:33:41.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"1447","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Blue Raspberry","flavor_id":"10178","vendor":"NR","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Frosting","flavor_id":"4412","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Gushy Fruit Candy SC","flavor_id":"9027","vendor":"WF","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Lemon Sicily","flavor_id":"524","vendor":"FA","millipercent":250},{"name":"Lime Tahity Cold Pressed","flavor_id":"581","vendor":"FA","millipercent":250},{"name":"Sour Blue Raspberry Candy","flavor_id":"6061","vendor":"WF","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Super Sweet","flavor_id":"2384","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":750},{"name":"WS-23","flavor_id":"8085","vendor":"OTHR","millipercent":500}],"reviews":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"193289","name":"Blue Slushy"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
