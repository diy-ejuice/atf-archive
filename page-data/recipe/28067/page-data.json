Ran a couple searches to find something similar and couldn't find any so I had a good feeling. After a little work this blood orange marshmallow was the result. Hope you love it!

Really well balanced with the cream cheese icing and marshmallow. After 200ml, it certainly qualifies as an ADV for me. Thank you."},{"user":"altneurose","text":"A nice, sweet blood orange vape. As a vape, not as soft as a marshmallow due to the strong Blood Orange which has like this Grapefruit tang to it which easily cuts though everything. CCI imparts just a slight bit of cakiness along with the graham cracker, drawing away from the actual marshmallow. Even though I don't think it's a marshmallow, it's still very tasty."}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"28067","name":"Adams Blood Orange Pillow"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
