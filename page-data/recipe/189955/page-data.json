This worked out to be a Nilla Wafer and I’m super stoked with it. I put a good amount of cookie in this to dry is out and replicate the actual wafer. I used TPA DX milk (not listed as a flavor on atf) instead of dairy milk, however I’m sure dairy milk would work well. I needed that powdered milk taste to pop and calm down the butter cream from cap so it comes thru very lightly. The French vanilla deluxe comes in very subtle and just ties is all together. This is a drier e juice meant to replicate the actual cookie.","steep_days":"3 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"updated_at":"2020-12-12T11:53:28.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"711","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Butter Cream","flavor_id":"3","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Cookie","flavor_id":"4369","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Dairy/Milk","flavor_id":"2164","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"French Vanilla Deluxe","flavor_id":"169","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Super Sweet","flavor_id":"2384","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1000}],"reviews":[{"user":"Jonnycoldcutz","text":"Great job on the recipe man. It's got me reminiscing on when I would go over to my grandmas house and she used to make vanilla wafers from scratch! She was a french baker and teacher at a cooking school. This recipe is spot on and immediately brought me back to those days","score":5}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"189955","name":"V’nilla Wafer"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
