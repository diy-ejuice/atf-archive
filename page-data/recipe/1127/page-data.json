Nice and fruity. The lemon lime is rather prominent, but the cherry and orange are noticeable. The graham cracker and sugar cookie add the just right cereal notes and the perfect amount of sweetness to bring across the drier side of the bowl. The genius bit comes in with the milk. The vienna cream is a touch heavier than even whole milk, but damn, that with the cream cheese icing and the hazelnut add just the right amount of extra sweetness to excellently approximate the sugar saturated milk at the bottom of the bowl. This is one seriously well thought out vape."},{"user":"FuriousMixer","score":"4","text":"The first time I mixed this and tried it @21 days I could see this recipes potential however for me,it was missing a few things...I’ve mixed this up again 3 weeks ago but changed up the TPA GCC from 3% down to 2.25%, the CAP L&amp;L I took out completely and swapped for FA SICILY LEMON @ 1.50% and FLV LIME @ 0.50%. I also added FW BLUEBERRY @ 0.80% and TPA AP @0.50%. I’m vaping this right now and IMO is soooooooo much better and cleaner tasting. The blueberry tartness really knits this together and the other adjustments I’ve made have really polished up this recipe. Please try it and see what you think. I may put the recipe up on ELR as an adaptation.... "},{"user":"kindground","score":"2","text":"This is a decent shake and vape and very enjoyable in the first week or so. It gets seriously muddy with a steep. It feels like the cap lemon-lime does something strange to muddy up the bakeries with a steep. Another lemon may work better. "},{"user":"RemoveHasperat","score":"4","text":"Pretty good Fruity Pebbles flavor. Its not 100% perfect but its really very close and more than good enough. I've made this on many occasions which is rare for me. Very good job of piecing all the flavors together individually.  "},{"user":"Zugmaschine","score":"5","text":"Top ADV Juice. After a 6 weeks steep, very tasty. All is coming well together. A nice fruit cereal taste. Will make a bigger batch and add some Strawberries.  Thanks for that recipe."},{"user":"Ebc88","score":"5","text":"Had this in my favorites for months now finally mixed it a few weeks ago and it doesn’t disappoint "},{"user":"wh1skeyk1ng","score":"3","text":"Apologies for the harsh critique, but there's a review from one fellow here who didn't even try it before rating it, so here goes.  This smells like pebbles, but the taste after 14 days isn't fruity pebbles.  3% TFA Graham Clear gives me a slight burnt taste, (as it has to my own recipes in the past as well, I like to stay under 2 or 2.5%) and I would prefer less Sugar Cookie and Meringue if I were to mix it again.  I personally didn't have any issues with the Lemon Lime, but I think the other fruits could use a bump or even another fruit to represent the full spectrum.  I'm sure you've meant to adjust this (maybe not?) but if you're like me, you just keep coming up with new recipes and trying new flavors and don't get too hung up on any particular recipe for too long.  Kudos on a tasty recipe that really uses some \"outside the box\" ingredients to drive home a specific profile."},{"user":"RdaJunkie","score":"1","text":"this taste like licking fruity pebbles from a girls sweaty butt hole"},{"user":"Gonzilla","score":"5","text":"One of the first recipes I mixed up and a favorite since then. Nails that artificial fruit cereal taste in the best possible way. I like it the most after a 3 week steep, around that point it comes together into something magic. "},{"user":"Chewymidget","score":"5","text":""},{"user":"super8line","score":"3","text":"Have been thinking about trying this for quite awhile and awhile back finally picked up the flavors I was missing to make it..  Let it steep the required 14 days and while it does taste good it's kind of a let down.  I don't find I get much if any cereal flavor from it at all and I'm not sure what flavor it is I do get from it, definitely not pebbles.   Taste is subjective so that's my opinion.&#xD;\nI'll let it steep another week or so and update my review if needed."},{"user":"lolwtf","score":"5","text":"Love this recipe.  After my first bottle, I mixed up another big bottle of flavor concentrate.  Now I have a dedicated Pebbles RDA and it never gets old.  Thanks Manson. &#xD;\n&#xD;\nUpdate:  I have found that mixing the  Pebbles concentrate at 14-15% instead of 17% is just as enjoyable, maybe even better.  Mixing at 70/30 I could probably go even lower! "},{"user":"cincinnatiking","score":"4","text":"Steeped for 24 days. Something is way too potent for me. I think it's the CAP Lemon Lime. I might try to mix this again, and lower the percentage. It smells exactly like fruity pebbles. I made a small 15 ml batch. I could have gone over a little bit on one of the flavors. Will try again, and report back."},{"user":"6retro6","score":"4","text":""},{"user":"mowgs","score":"5","text":"top recipe .thank you for this piece of juice heaven.like and many of my friends like it too .well done"},{"user":"altneurose","score":"5","text":""},{"user":"tachampagne","score":"5","text":"Congrats on DIYorDIE dude. Can't wait to mix this up!"},{"user":"dioblanblu","score":"5","text":"sick AF bruv! congrats! I mixed this when it first came out and I was blown away by it...I still mix it regularly, although, I find that I need to drop the blood orange a tad... incredible work man!"},{"user":"ParDeus","score":"5","text":"Just down right amazing.  I've never taken time to write a review, mostly because my taste buds are very unreliable.  I can say this is the first juice to stay in one of my tanks for more than a week since I started vaping.  I've used INW Orange, INW Lemon and FA Lime Tahity Distilled in place of the CAP Lemon Lime and FW Blood Orange, and it works great that way as well.  Congrats man!"},{"user":"Kriswk","score":"5","text":"I shall give credit where credit is due, I didn't care for this when I first made it because that CAP Lemon Lime just killed it for me, but I also subbed TFA Toasted Marshmallow with FW. Once I made it correctly, and let it steep for a good 2-3 weeks, it was terrific. So close to a true Fruity Pebbles flavor than any other. I love it man, it pulls at my heart strings since I love Fruity Pebbles so much. The cereal aspect is the best part and hard to beat."},{"user":"forgotten99","score":"5","text":"Had to use key lime tfa. Still good stuff. I like the flavors to taste like you can choose what you want to taste. Like a separation or separate layers. This mix really touches on that. I hope yall can understand that. Cuz that's all I want. When PPL starting talking about layers I thought someone knows what I'm talking about. It Sounded good. Like fairy dust that makes your dic bigger. Anyway awesome recipe. Cap lemon lime is on the way. Thanx"},{"user":"triangulatethisdick","score":"5","text":"Absolutely spectacular man! I've been meaning mix this for months but seemed to always put it on the back burner. Well I finally had a late night mixing sesh and this made it way to the steep drawer where it sat for a week before being rediscovered. I'm so glad I finally tried this highly regarded recipe. Well done"},{"user":"Boomdog07","score":"5","text":"I know there are a lot of people that knock Dr. Crimmy out there.. but it was the first juice I ever bought when I started vaping before all the crap went down and the accusations about his dirty facilities or whatever. Anyway THIS is almost dead on and brought me back to that first day I tried that juice. I go back to this time and time again and mix it now in 500ml batches just so I can have some steeping while I blow through 120ml the first couple of days. Thank you sir for your work on this!!!"},{"user":"ID10-T","score":"5","text":"Another review I should have done sooner. It's almost freakish how much this tastes and even FEELS like Fruity Pebbles. Shows that the creator of this is either a genius or put in a crazy amount of effort to make this happen. Maybe both. "},{"user":"Tootall","score":"none","text":""},{"user":"Smoky","score":"3","text":"Juding by the comments maybe some people are extra sensitive to cap lemon lime. Personally its all i could taste even after steeping."},{"user":"Rageisalotofwork","score":"5","text":"Should have commented on this months ago, but this is by far the best cereal recipe I've ever had. Very refreshing and fruity, I feel like this is the recipe the actual Fruity Pebbles cereal wanted to be. "},{"user":"R08U57","score":"5","text":"just bangin'"},{"user":"Aquaneo","score":"4","text":"I made 120ml of this as the reviews were so good for it and it is by one of our greats. I was disappointed after a couple weeks as the CAP Lemon Lime really takes over and creates a \"sprite\" taste about it but after steeping for 2 months this has really mellowed into a nice vape. All I can say is give it some time if your not happy after mixing as it really comes out nice after some time. Great Job NCM."},{"user":"Thadentman","score":"5","text":"This is great after 2-3 weeks, the best i have had made from scratch"},{"user":"BigMoose","score":"4","text":"This a great cereal vape that nails the Froot Loops (I get Froot Loops not Fruity Pebbles) flavor while taking a different approach from all other cereal recipes by not using any cereal-based flavorings. Definitely needs a little bit of a steep for the different fruits to mellow out. Closest thing I've had to SJ's Fruition, which is my fav cereal vape."},{"user":"Goldfish18","score":"5","text":"Absolutely the best cereal recipe I've ever tasted. The fruits used are spot on fruity pebbles and the sweet milk flavor you get from the vienna cream, meringue, and cream cheese icing is magical. Great job!"},{"user":"Highd","score":"5","text":"This is a wonderful recipe, the thing I loved the most about it is the back end flavor, you can really taste the cereal flakes. It's like taking a bite of Pebbles! Thanks so much for sharing this. "},{"user":"tranceinate","score":"5","text":"Spot on fruity pebbles. It's gewd. This following picture is all I have to say about DuderMcCuder's review. There's a reason it's all citrus flavors besides cherry, dude.&#xD;\n&#xD;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/vnvAgQi.jpg"},{"user":"Mixepic","score":"3","text":"Didn't get much fruity pebbles from this, more of a fruit loops flavor. The CAP lemon lime dominates this profile. It's a cereal vape, that's for sure. The base is very well done, however I feel it could use some sort of berry, whether that be strawberry, blueberry, or whatever berry...it's pure citrus flavors. "},{"user":"Vurve","score":"5","text":"Super realistic fruity pebbles, without using a cereal base. Very well done."},{"user":"Queuetue","score":"5","text":"Definitely the most realistic Fruity Pebbles I've ever mixed.  My ADV for about a week after I mixed this."}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"1127","name":"Pebbles"}}}
