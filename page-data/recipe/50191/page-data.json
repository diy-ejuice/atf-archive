A Banana Moon Pie! This is for Wayne's weekend assignment....Banana Desert recipe. Tastes just like it's supposed to. INW Biscuit and TPA Pie Crust works well to give it a nice flaky but somewhat cookie-like flavor. TPA Marshmallow is sandwiched in between and creates a nice fluffy feel. The TPA Banana, TPA Banana Cream, and LA Cream Cheese Icing works great for that hard banana icing that surrounds everything. This recipe has it all, full textured mouth-feel, fluffy marshmallow, and sweet banana icing.\r\n\r\nShake and Vape\r\n\r\nPlease comment, mix, and or rate, it make us all better mixers. Enjoy :)","steep_days":"3 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"total_reviews":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T23:35:42.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"2144","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Biscuit","vendor":"INW","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Pie Crust","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Banana","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Banana Cream","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Cream Cheese Icing","vendor":"LA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Marshmallow","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Super Sweet","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":250}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"50191","name":"Moon Shot!"}}}
