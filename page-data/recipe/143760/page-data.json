Well the back bar bitters by FLv seems to me  like an  orange bitters ,  which traditionally have  made from the peels of Seville oranges, cardamom, caraway seed, coriander and burnt sugar in an alcohol base., and create a  unique pairing against the bright tropical notes of the passion fruit.      \r\n\r\nThe combination of  **passion fruit and yellow passion fruit**create  a lovely authentic passion fruit .   I wanted some more of the orange note I get from the  passion fruit so I used that higher but you can use it as a 50/50 .  The yellow passion fruit provides more of a tart finish  that I used at a slightly lower percent\r\n\r\n**Coconut**was used  for some body and creamy notes, to help blend the mix rather then a  dairy cream \r\n\r\n**Back bar bitters** are used for that  bitter orange note that picks up on the orange from the  passion fruit.   It also adds  some darker spices that  get the tropical fruit to pop .  it is noticeable in the exhale and make for a really interesting finish   \r\n\r\nAdd sweetner to your liking I added .5%  of  FLV sweetness   to mine ","steep_days":"3 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-10T16:01:17.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"870","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Yellow Passion","flavor_id":"9367","vendor":"VT","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Passion Fruit","flavor_id":"8935","vendor":"VT","millipercent":3500},{"name":"Sweet Coconut","flavor_id":"605","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1200},{"name":"Back Bar Bitters","flavor_id":"10082","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":500}],"reviews":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"143760","name":"Bitter Sweet passion (passion fruit,  coconut, orange bitters) "}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
