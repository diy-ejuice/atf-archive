It reminds me of hot chocolate with a candy cane in it.  I tried it as a shake and vape after an hour steep on the counter and it is delicious, after 24 hour steep even better.  Warning it is a coil gunker so use on a RDA, I don't recommend as a sub ohm daily vape.  This is a work in progress, so the recipe may change.\r\n\r\n","steep_days":"1 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-05T20:49:55.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"998","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Coconut Extra","flavor_id":"316","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":750},{"name":"Coconut Candy","flavor_id":"223","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Chocolate","flavor_id":"489","vendor":"FA","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Mild Winter (peppermint)","flavor_id":"532","vendor":"FA","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Sweet Cream","flavor_id":"183","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2750},{"name":"Koolada 10 Pg","flavor_id":"280","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Super Sweet","flavor_id":"2384","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Marshmallow","flavor_id":"473","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"74398","name":"Christmas Hot Cocoa"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
