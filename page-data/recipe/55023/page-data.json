Fresh from an organic, free-roam, cruelty-free bantha farm in a nice cozy corner of the endless desert that is Tatooine. \r\n\r\nExperience the sweet, creamy blueness that is the legendary Bantha milk, a local treat brought from a galaxy far, far away to tantalize the tastebuds of Jedi, senators, desert folk, hell even Imperial storm troopers!\r\n\r\nThis vape comes out strong, bursting with ripe blueberry juiciness up front and then that sweet creamy milk comes pouring out as fresh as the day it was squeezed from that bantha teet, leaving an amazing milky aftertaste at the finish. \r\n\r\nYes, friends, this is my most thoroughly vetted recipe yet. For once, I actually must say not to SnV but to give it at least a week for that sweet milkiness to shine. And yes I know the blueberry looks rowdy but FW Blueberry just has a super high flavor ceiling and I've played with it at 5-7% and I prefer it at 6-6.5%, however feel free to turn it down a little to your liking, I've just found at this high dose it really gives an awesome sugary, blueberry sryup poured into some whole milk flavor. \r\n\r\nEnjoy and let me know what you think, any and all feedback is appreciated ✌️\r\n\r\n**UPDATE 9/2/2017**\r\nI dropped the FW Blueberry just a hair and upped TPA Blueberry extra just a hair, I also dropped meringue to almost nothing because I love the little flavor it adds but I just get so much harshness from it. And lastly and most importantly, I've added sweet cream to really thicken up the milk base and add an awesome dairy note. I haven't had time to let this new mix steep longer than a few days but the dairy/milk aspect is really popping off the rip and that's been one of my biggest goals with this recipe is for it to have a really decent and accurate milk flavor worked in.

I steeped 7 days and everything melded together very nice. Fresh crushed blueberries swimming in a sweet cream, well done!","score":5},{"user":"kitu5","text":"...wow...full on blueberry taste up the front. It's not a fresh off the bush blueberry, more like the ones that come out of the tin in the blueberry muffin mix, and I dig the hell outta that. The exhale has a touch of the blueberry still in it, but it's got a rock solid dairy note, somewhere between cream and milk. The meringue is what I think is giving me the canned blueberry vibe, because my brain wants to interpret that as \"muffin\". Mixed with the sweet cream and cream fresh, it's mostly absorbed into the mix and makes for \"sweet as hell milk\".&#xD;\n&#xD;\nIt's what it says on the tin (if you read the description, cos I have no friggin clue what bantha milk would look or taste like), and of the blueberries and creams I've tried so far, it's my favorite. It's got that just right amount of blueberry, cream, and sweetness. &#xD;\n&#xD;\nThis one's for fruit and cream lovers, blueberry fans, and people who like it sweet, but not too sweet.&#xD;\n&#xD;\nConsidering I damn near drained the first tank in a day, only barely noticed it, and am going back for more, yeah, call it ADV worthy. Nice one!","score":5},{"user":"GObisco","text":"Great juice.  ADV worthy.&#xD;\nYou get a full blueberry flavor early in the vape followed by a light cremy smoothness on the exhale. &#xD;\nWell done and am loving this stuff.
