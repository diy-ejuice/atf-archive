The percentages took some time to play around with inbetween each steep time for each batch.. I never look up other peoples recipes to see how they are doing with thier own for this type of recipe.. I prefer to play around on my own and if I am close to someone else that would be my bad. This recipe has been on my ELR for sometime before I decided to release the recipe over here on ATF..
