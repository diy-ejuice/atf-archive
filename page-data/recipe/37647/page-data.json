They are similar but I do find flv vanilla pudding to be a bit sweeter.\r\nThe vanillas in this recipe work nicely together added to the cookie, the oreo filling, and the pudding. Vanilla bourbon is usually my go to in bakeries/cookies but here it was just a bit too \"dark\" for me...madagascar along with holy vanilla gave me the vanilla to creamy that i was after.\r\nJF cookies is a really great flavor...its somewhere in between Fa Cookie and cap sugar cookie.. the 1:1 worked nicely for me. Of course with some butter and fw graham cracker to just add something special to that cookie.\r\nLA CCI completed the cookie filling for me...\r\nI LOVE GOLDEN OREOS AND HAVE EATEN PROBABLY TOO MANY OF THEM IN MY LIFE this recipe is pretty darn close...ENJOY!\r\n  ","steep_days":"4","temperature":"0","recipe_score":4,"updated_at":"2020-12-12T10:33:21.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"24469","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Cookie","flavor_id":"4572","vendor":"JF","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Sugar Cookie","flavor_id":"115","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Holy Vanilla","flavor_id":"2385","vendor":"DFS","millipercent":500},{"name":"Madagascar (Vanilla Classic)","flavor_id":"526","vendor":"FA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Cream Cheese Icing","flavor_id":"2380","vendor":"LA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Butter","flavor_id":"147","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":350},{"name":"Vanilla Pudding","flavor_id":"4433","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Graham Cracker","flavor_id":"1297","vendor":"FW","millipercent":500}],"reviews":[{"user":"MikeRaf23","text":"this is excellent !!! my new ADV and swap from custard.

It nails the profile down with extreme accuracy.","score":5},{"user":"Grfxman","text":"Great cookie vape... I mixed this at 70/30 3mg - first week it was more cream filling from a golden oreo... then week 2 some bakery started to come out, week 3 (I forgot to test it) and week 4... it ROCKED! Very nice cookie and cream vape, rich vanilla note and I am picking up a faint hint of lemon... could be me, but it almost has that lemon butter cookie note, the ones that are like blonde oreo's but with a touch of lemon. It does not matter really - it is just lovely. You get a nice cookie inhale with creamy vanilla on the exhale followed by that very faint hint of acid. It is just amazing. New fav recipe to make on the regular.","score":5},{"user":"MixMasterJosh","text":"This is my favorite recipe to date, I never thought I would like anything better than Sad Lad toast Crunch (cinnamon toast crunch) and I really loved that, but I got tired of it after a while, but this is my all day vape, it is so damn delicious, If you haven't tried it yet, you definitely need to mix this up and give it a try, 5 stars from me, I'd give 7 stars if I could lol ","score":5},{"user":"FuriousMixer","text":"This is a well crafted recipe and clearly been created by a mixer who knows his concentrates!  I would of given it 5 ‚≠êÔ∏è ‚Äòs however I found myself wanting more flavour to come through at the end of the exhale. It‚Äôs just slightly lacking IMHO but this is still a very good recipe and I tip my proverbial hat to the creator. üëçüèª","score":4},{"user":"Zugmaschine","text":"Made 30ml because  all that good reviews. Will rate it after after a few weeks steeping ....","score":3},{"user":"bjorama","text":"For about the first 3 weeks I thought everyone was crazy who rated this so high.  I wasn't getting much at all and what I got was \"ok\".  Came back to it after about a month and this is a tasty delicious vape.  The wife likes it and she doesn't like anything unless it really stands out.  Not sure I agree with the 4 day steep timer but if your taste buds are like mine just wait a few weeks and its well worth it.","score":4},{"user":"GrizzlyVapes","text":"This recipe is ridiculously good. You need to try this if you like cookie type vapes. Deejay killed it with this one.","score":5},{"user":"Germ","text":"","score":5},{"user":"Katumbas","text":"All important aspects on a recipe formulation - checked! Outstanding recipe! The profile is dead on. The Graham Cracker is surprisingly noticeable on this which surprised me in a good way and I find it¬¥s the key ingredient (maybe I¬¥m wrong!). Thank you and great job.","score":5},{"user":"Theunmanifested","text":"Textures , flavor, and mouthfeel, are all on point. The grittyness of the cookie (almost feel like I need to chew because it feels like it crumbled), the Puddin/Filling, that mix of sweet gloopy vanilla flavor mixed with the waxy (in a very good way) of the cookie filling just delicious.  A very wholesome recipe.","score":5},{"user":"kindground","text":"Vanilla DAP bomb with the perfect combination of cookies. I always come back to this when I'm looking for something different and decadent. ","score":5},{"user":"SlashaLO","text":"This stuff...this...heavenly, delightful, making the fat kid in my happy stuff. Great work here Deejay. This mix is extremely accurate, and tastes amazing. You get the grittiness of the cookie, the Vanillas, almost separated; the cookie vanilla, the cream vanilla, and the pudding vanilla. The depth and complexity of just the vanilla is amazing. I can say this is one that I have actually gone through more than a 30mL before switching to another flavor.

Nice and smooth.","score":4},{"user":"HAYDEN5757","text":"At first I was thinking it tasted like a mess of bakeries or something. But now after a 3 week steep an extremely authentic golden Oreo is present. This is just one of those mixes that requires over a month to shine. Amazing recipe man. &#xD;\n&#xD;\nSome ingredients were a bit obscure but I didn‚Äôt want to sub anything. I‚Äôm glad I didn‚Äôt. ","score":5},{"user":"MrZigglesworth","text":"I didn't have JF Cookie so I subbed for FA at 1:1. After a 9 day steep I have to say this is amazing. I definitely need to get JF Cookie to see if that unlocks its true potential!","score":5},{"user":"MrBurgundy","text":"Excellent stuff. I get a highly authentic golden Oreo cookie drenched in rich vanilla pudding. The flavor is full but subtle enough that I want to keep vaping it. Really well balanced. It‚Äôs fantastic fresh but does get better and better with time. Thanks for sharing, Mills!","score":5},{"user":"Tootall","text":"Great  recipe I made 240 ml and I am glad I did because me and all my friends that got some loved it.. I really loved it after a 2 + week steep it gets better and better everyday it steeps in my opinion.","score":5},{"user":"Thadentman","text":"Very impressive! I'll be vaping this for quite a while, Great job!","score":5},{"user":"AndreM","text":"This is fantastic. I cannot get enough. Thank you for the recipe.","score":5},{"user":"hashslingingslashur","text":"Sadly, I had to make two subs:&#xD;\n&#xD;\nSubbed FA Vanilla for Shisha Vanilla at 0.25% and subbed FW graham for CAP graham cracker v2 at the same %. That being said this is fucking amazing. Even after an overnight steep this is an adv for me. So good, keeping this in my rotation. Probly go through a 50ml of this every two weeks or so. I tend to vape the same flavor til the bottle is finished, this one takes me about two or three days max to finish off. Really awesome and thanks for sharing!","score":5},{"user":"NonStopMix","text":"You nailed this profile perfectly! Come to think of it, this would even go great with coffee, ice cream, etc using it as a base additive.","score":5},{"user":"Springer","text":"Accurate and simply the best Oreo I've Vaped to date. I'm not one for leaving reviews unless, just Wow. Top Class mix and  following!","score":5},{"user":"Fear","text":"This is a freakishly good, freakishly accurate recipe. The taste of the liquid, the aroma, and the actual vapor. It is all GOLDEN OREO!!!! Mix this, and while you are at it, either mix large or mix multiple so you dont run out so fast. Fantastic Job man!","score":5},{"user":"ID10-T","text":"Oh my! That really is a Golden Oreo cookie in pudding! This tastes like a ton of work when into carefully crafting that cookie and then balancing it with pudding. Blown away by the authenticity here but it's worth noting that it's not only realistic, but also super delicious. That \"recipe is work in progress\" at the top needs to go; it's perfected. ","score":5},{"user":"Kopel","text":"When I first saw the recipe holding FLV Vanilla Pudding at 4% I thought maybe that it would sort of wash the rest out, but surprisingly your cookie tones manage to stand out just so. Great attention to balance and spot on authenticity. I enjoy to the role LA CCI plays here in shifting that pudding flavor into the cookie frosting flavor. I'm not typically a big bakery/cookie type but I can already tell this one won't last long after a wickful. &#xD;\n","score":5}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"37647","name":"Golden oreo pudding"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
