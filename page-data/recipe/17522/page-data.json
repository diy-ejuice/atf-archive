It just melds the Pomegranate and Raspberry together nicely giving this juicy effect.\r\nIf you feel like you need more sweetness then 0.5% TFA Sweetener is an option, wouldn't suggest EM as it will just mute the overall flavor.\r\nIt's great as Shake and Vape but 3 day steep will give fuller experience.\r\nTFA Dragonfruit at 0.5% is a nice addition to this, it will bring that strawberry out of shadows a bit.\r\n\r\nApologize for my shitty description and notes xD\r\nHope you enjoy,\r\nPeace V ","steep_days":"0","temperature":"0","recipe_score":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-10T13:44:24.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"1669","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Pomegranate","flavor_id":"262","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":6000},{"name":"Raspberry (sweet)","flavor_id":"267","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Strawberry","flavor_id":"272","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Cactus","flavor_id":"647","vendor":"INW","millipercent":1000}],"reviews":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"17522","name":"Pomeberry"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
