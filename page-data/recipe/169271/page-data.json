The picture they posted looked like mint chocolate ice cream, but I thought doing a toffee twist would be perfect for fall - inspired by stevenv84’s recipe, https://e-liquid-recipes.com/recipe/3251316/Chocolate%20Ripple\r\n\r\nTry subbing FW Butter Pecan or FA Almond for Caramel Toffee or use LB Lava Cake instead of VT Chocolate Mousse.  Also try using White Chocolate, VT Avocado Cream or VT Devon Cream  instead of Love and add a drizzle of Salty Caramel. Lots of tasty combinations to be had here. That’s the beauty of DIY, you can mix what suits your palate.  Hope you enjoy it as much as I did!","steep_days":"3 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T21:33:11.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"1088","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Almond Cookie SC","vendor":"WF","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Dark Chocolate","vendor":"VT","millipercent":500},{"name":"Chocolate Mousse","vendor":"VT","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Creme De Menthe","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":500},{"name":"Caramel Toffee","vendor":"HS","millipercent":500},{"name":"Chocolate Cookie Crust SC","vendor":"WF","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Love DIY","vendor":"VT","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Toffee Ice Cream","vendor":"VT","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Butterscotch Ripple","vendor":"FW","millipercent":750}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"169271","name":"Mint Chocolate Toffee Ice Cream"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
