This is one of the few.  Note: I do not have WF Cinnamon Pastry in my toolbox.  Instead I used CAP CDS at 1%.  Amazing amounts of flavor coming from this recipe.  Its a banger out of the gate and I'm intersted in seeing what the steep does here.  Probably should have made a bigger batch.  Well done and thanks for sharing !  So good I'm mixing up the rest of your recipes that I have all the flavors for."}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"121196","name":" Apple Doe"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
