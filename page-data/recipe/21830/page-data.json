While making the jam, my mom decided that the recipe called for way too much sugar, so she cut the sugar by a third. Well, as any experienced jam and jelly maker will tell you, you cannot cut any of the sugar from a recipe because the jam won't set. And of course, my mom's Spiced Apricot Jam did not set... So we took that syrupy stuff and poured it on pancakes, waffles and ice cream and Wow(!) was it ever good! But my memories of it mostly consist of sitting down in front of the TV to watch Fantasy Island and The Love Boat back to back on Saturday evenings with a humongous bowl of vanilla ice cream and (failed) spiced apricot jam. So now I give you my first ever recipe (based on, you guessed it),...\r\n\r\n***Spiced Apricot Glaze On Vanilla Ice Cream***  \r\n* Apricot (TFA) **5.0**  \r\n* Cinnamon Danish Swirl (CAP) **2.0**  \r\n* Greek Yogurt (FLV) **1.0**  \r\n* Fresh Cream (FA) **1.0**  \r\n* Vanilla Bean Ice Cream (TFA) **4.0**\r\n\r\n**Steeping:** At MINIMUM one week, but two is much better. [**EDIT: One week of steeping seems quite nice, and I'm not sure I can tell a discernible difference anymore from a two week steep. Maybe my taste buds were being rather exuberant on that second week steep. Whatever. Just wanted to add that I find it too bad that only one person has tried this recipe - that has commented, at least. It turns out to be a really solid recipe and I wish that more would find this out for themselves. It has been my ADV for several weeks now, and I'm not getting sick of it yet.** Two weeks lets the Apricot settle into its creamy base, and also allows the Greek Yogurt, Fresh Cream and VBIC to meld together nicely. Heck, guys & gals, one week gets them all out of the school at the recess bell, but two weeks gets them playing nicely together in the schoolyard. How's that for an analogy, eh?\r\n\r\nSo enjoy it, all! And please, I do hope some of you will try it, and if you do, hopefully some of you will comment back.\r\n \r\nBest,  \r\nMagnus.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n- I personally tried this with 1 drop of flv rich cinnamon and it was phenomenal! \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","steep_days":"14","temperature":"0","recipe_score":4.5,"total_reviews":2,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:48:55.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"2118","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Apricot","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":5000},{"name":"Cinnamon Danish Swirl","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Greek Yogurt","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Cream Fresh","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Vanilla Bean Ice Cream","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":4000}],"reviews":[{"user":"Dobry83","score":"5","text":"Wow,just wow"},{"user":"Zugmaschine","score":"4","text":"Good Recipe.
