When I was sampling it as a single flavor I felt as though it had some redeeming qualities but definitely needed a little love to make it a little more interesting to my taste buds. The first thing that came to my mind was to use the topping for my blue bird remix as part of the cannoli filling. Well only the berry crunch by tfa at 2.5% and flavor West blueberry at 2.5%. personally I don't get any of the horrible off notes that some people get from berry crunch I actually like this ingredient but some get some horrible off notes from it. Now with the flavor art pazzo  lines  Joker I get more of the cannoli crust than I did a creamy sweet filling. So to boost that creamy sweetness and to help smooth out the blueberry and  berry crunch combination I added 1% of vanilla cream by Inawera and 1% of whipped marshmallow by Capella. I didn't want to add any flavor art creams ect. Because I don't know what they used in there filling for the one shot joker?? And I didn't want to over do it with any of the flavor art creams so I used what I did. I have heard that inawera vanilla cream has been reformulated??? I am not sure if I have the reformulated version or the original because I purchased it within the last two months from Bull city flavors and I have no idea when they got there batch and further more I have no idea when it was reformulated. Lol. Then there's the whipped marshmallow in this recipe it's used for more of a whipped sweetness or almost a thick sugar if you will lol. Whatever I did i like it and I guess that's all that matters!!! I hope you enjoy it as much as I do!!\r\n\r\nSteep time: I was liking this on day two but I feel it needs 5 days to truly blend together fully.\r\n\r\nSweetener: I used .35% Flavorah sweetness but feel free to use it  or use your preferred sweetener of choice at your preferred percentage..","steep_days":"5","temperature":"420","recipe_score":0,"total_reviews":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T12:46:44.000-05:00","best_vg":"75%","views":"2907","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Blueberry","vendor":"FW","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Berry Crunch","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Pazzo Burlone (Joker)","vendor":"FA","millipercent":6000},{"name":"Vanilla Cream","vendor":"INW","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Whipped Marshmallow","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1000}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"95218","name":"Blue Bird Crunch Cannoli"}}}
