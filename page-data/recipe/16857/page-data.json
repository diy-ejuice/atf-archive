Plum pairs with hazelnut and with peach (which also pairs with hazelnut). Black Currant pairs with pear (which also pairs with hazelnut) and peach. I chose INW Plum and JF Honey peach here simply because they are tasty flavors that I wanted to mix with. I wanted this mix to have a unique finish and I have found myself really enjoying FW Hazelnut so I had to use it after I noticed that it paired with plum and peach. FA Pear is here as an attempt to juice things up and remove some of the harsher elements that the plum/peach combo present. FA Black Currant is here to brighten everything up and provide some background 'tart' notes.  \r\n\r\nThe end result is an intense, fleshy fruit flavor that suggests plum and peach. The hazelnut finishes and rounds out the bottom of the vape with a darker, creamier element to provide an experience that extends beyond mere 'fruit salad.' There is some initial throat hit that subsides after a few pulls, but I feel that the results of this sacrifice are worth it. I recommend steeping this for at least 3 days for proper homogenization.

Amazing use of Honey Peach as a backnote. (It's never worked up-front for me.) Try as I might, I couldn't stop vaping this after I made the first batch, so it didn't even make it to day 3. Immediately made some more to test how it turns out after a 3 day steep. Magic work. "}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"16857","name":"Kicking Rocks"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
