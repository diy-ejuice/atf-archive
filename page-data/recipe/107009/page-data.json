The FLV Mango really helps on this task and CAP Sweet Mango brings authenticity.\r\nFLV Eggnog / FLV Rich Cinnamon (1 drop) - FLV Eggnog brings warmness without getting the nutmeg note, which sometimes ruins recipes, and 1 drop of Rich Cinnamon just complements and sweetens a little the overall profile.\r\nFA Apricot / TPA Dragonfruit - FA Apricot is a key ingredient on this profile. It balances the mango out and gives another vibe to the Mango itself.\r\nTPA Kentucky Bourbon - Helps to cook the mango without bringing booziness to the profile.\r\n\r\nI can't get where I live but FLV Heat it's probably great here. Just a couple drops is enough.\r\n\r\nIt's recommended to vape this in an hot temperature to get the full experience.\r\n\r\nGive this recipe 1 week steep or you'll just get the FLV Mango.\r\n","steep_days":"7","temperature":"0","recipe_score":4,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:50:15.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"1490","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Mango","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Sweet Mango","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Eggnog","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":500},{"name":"Rich Cinnamon","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":80},{"name":"Armenia (apricot)","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Kentucky Bourbon","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Dragonfruit","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":750}],"reviews":[{"user":"ID10-T","text":"Someone get this man some FLV Heat. That’s what this really needs. The cinnamon and little touch of Eggnog brings some warmth and spice but doesn’t quite hit that “spicy” bar. It might also help to fully cook the mango more than the bourbon is doing. I enjoyed vaping this because mango, but it still tastes too fresh for sauce. Unfortunately I don’t have an answer for what would definitely take it there. Experiments with FA Liquid Amber and mango haven’t produced promising results. Maybe a bit of something jammy that tastes like some other cooked down fruit would get it the rest of the way there? VT Jam It or something like that?
