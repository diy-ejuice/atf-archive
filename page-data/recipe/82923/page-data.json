Matcha!","author":"Wildgypsy","image_url":null,"description":"So this came out of a sleepless night and a search for green pancakes for my restaurant. After some searching, I found matcha and matcha rice crispy treats. Intrigued, I made them the next day and they’re pretty damn good! This is my attempt to recreate the lovely, light floral flavor of the treats. And to find another use for FE green tea besides @exclusivegirl’s fabulous recipe.\r\n\r\nThis is my first posted recipe. Please try it and give me any feedback!

One of the better rice crispy type recipes I've tried, probably because I love FLV Marshmallow.  I don't really get much of a matcha specific flavor, and never have from FE Green Tea, but the tea flavor is mellow enough in this recipe that it doesn't really stand out super strong.  Definitely recommended. I've mixed it 4 or 5 times and I'm about to do it again now.  Thanks for the recipe."}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"82923","name":"Snap! Crackle! Matcha!"}}}
