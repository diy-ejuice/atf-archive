A good fluffy cakiness that's heavy on the tongue, bolstered with TFA VC to add some egg and butter notes. TFA Bavarian cream keeps it wet and helps it vape smooth. TFA Brown Sugar as the primary sweetener and to add that vibe of the brown sugar marbling throughout the cake.\r\n\r\nthe theme was lazy, so I went uber lazy with the percentages but it's a pretty good mix! Warning: It's vapeable SNV then over the next few days the cinnamon gets really strong. After about a week it'll die down and the custard and creams will open up a bit.\r\n\r\nEDIT: bumped up TFA VC, after a 3 week steep my original test wasn't nearly as thick and buttery as I intended.","steep_days":"7 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"total_reviews":null,"updated_at":"2020-11-27T09:27:21.000-05:00","best_vg":"60%","views":"1157","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Caramel Cinnamon Roll","vendor":"FW","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Yellow Cake","vendor":"JF","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Pound Cake","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Bavarian Cream","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Brown Sugar","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Vanilla Custard","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":3000}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"111815","name":"Heavy Ghosts - 123 Cinnamon Sugar Poundcake"}}}
