I needed something to bring out the cake part of it and here i used \r\n\r\nFA BREAKFAST CEREAL \r\n‚Ä¢ 0.75% is just enough to give the angel cake the texture without tuning it into a cereal. Works like a charm üòä\r\n\r\nWF COCONUT CUSTARD \r\n‚Ä¢ the coconut in this reminds me of the sticky‚Äôs coconut you get from a bounty chocolate bar, but it also has some sort of ‚Äúvibe‚Äù to it. A fruity vibe, whitch go very well with the lemon. The creamy custard ish taste in it, makes the buttercream along with the buttery note from the angel cake.\r\n\r\nTPA TOASTED ALMOND\r\n‚Ä¢ gives the coconut a slight toasted flavor making it less sticky, so what you get is more of a desiccated coconut type, with a light toast too it. And THAT is what I want in my butter cream!\r\n\r\nCAP LEMON MERINGUE PIE \r\n‚Ä¢ this works as i wanted it to. I get the lemon part of it that i was looking for, and the pie and meringue part just helps the butter cream and the cake part. WONDERFUL!üòä\r\n\r\nFA LEMON SICILY \r\n‚Ä¢ 1% just to brighten up the lemon a bit. Its just not strong enough lemon without it.\r\n\r\nThats it. Hope you will enjoy it as much as i do. This was a fun Challenge. \r\n\r\n","steep_days":"14","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"updated_at":"2020-12-12T17:12:08.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"1824","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Angel Cake SC","flavor_id":"9014","vendor":"WF","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Breakfast Cereals","flavor_id":"8810","vendor":"FA","millipercent":750},{"name":"Coconut Custard SC","flavor_id":"8363","vendor":"WF","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Lemon Meringue Pie","flavor_id":"84","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Lemon Sicily","flavor_id":"524","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Toasted Almond","flavor_id":"294","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":500}],"reviews":[{"user":"DJ_Tam","text":"Excited recipe.
