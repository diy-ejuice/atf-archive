The black currant comes through well with the help out the lemon you added. Your ice cream base is very good the milky cream and TPA VBIC blend together perfectly. I am not fan of really sweet juices so i only used 0.25% super sweet and its plenty sweet enough for me. Great job glad I stumbled upon this tasty recipe "},{"user":"keydrive","score":"5","text":"Solid winner. Cool, bright, and fruity. My first try with Blackcurrant. It was good as SNV, but really seemed to bloom at around 5 days. If you can, wait. But ADV and 5 full stars. Well done ruinate"},{"user":"whthek","score":"5","text":"My first mix using WS-23 and, I must say, I'm glad I found 'this' recipe. I haven't seen Black Currant pushed this high,this successfully...Ever. I am at 24hrs. post mix and can only imagine what some more time will do for it. No 'off' notes and the extra SS really compliments the Black Currant . Cooling took a while to get used to,but, won't change a thing when I mix a big bottle tom. Thanks so much! "},{"user":"CatWillMew","score":"5","text":"This is great, but I might ditch the WS-23."},{"user":"HerrHut","score":"5","text":"Love it.  First few days I mostly get ice cold black currant, but the ice cream creeps in after a week or so and makes it extra delicious.  Thanks!"},{"user":"Xist","score":"none","text":"Absolutely delish!  Black currant is one of my favorite fruit flavors, so I was excited to try this.  I was not disappointed!  I may add a bit of flv Cream, or some Fresh Cream as @amouthforwar mentioned, just to thicken it up since I as well do not have OOO CMU.  Thanks and well done!"},{"user":"amouthforwar","score":"5","text":"I don't have OOO CMU, so i used a touch of FA Fresh Cream as it's the closest milky, plain cream I've got. This is a great mix with a very unique flavor to it. Nice and tart berry blended with a tried and true VBIC. Ice cold, just how I like it. I've not yet vaped anything where blackcurrant was the main note so this threw me for a bit of a loop but it is delicious and I'm craving more!"}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"110138","name":"Black Currant Ice cream"}}}
