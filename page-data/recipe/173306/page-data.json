Just vaped it this morning and wow is this delicious. The lemon is a nice baked sweet lemon with a little tartness still and is balanced really well with the rest of the mix. I was nervous to mix this up because of the ry4 double but I'm glad I mixed a 30 ml because it works!","score":5},{"user":"RedWagonVapes","text":"Hands down best lemon meringue tart recipe the creme brulee and ry4 really make the recipe stand out among the rest","score":5},{"user":"DixxleRoo","text":"Really lovely. The RY4 is an interesting idea and I love FE lemon for these kind of lemony tart like deserts. Yummy! ","score":5},{"user":"FuriousMixer","text":"This is hands down the best lemon profile I’ve vaped in a long long time! It’s layered perfectly and utterly delicious! I did sub TPA RY4 for DFS Holy Grail but it was epic. Well done lads,great work right here. 5 stars ⭐️ ","score":5},{"user":"wadeyloops","text":"This is an exquisite recipe. I added 2 drops of VT Sour Lemon per 10ml for that extra touch of tart zing and sweetness instead of the super sweet and it was just right for me. Great work.","score":5}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"173306","name":"Bruleed Lemon Tart | DEVELOPED"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
