A lot of the recipes I've tried fell short on the berry part though.\r\n\r\nThis is sort of an adaptation of cereally easy crunchies but with some additions.\r\n\r\nOf course the Bavarian cream and the crunchy berries make the base of the cereal and the milk.\r\n\r\nAcetyl pyrazine adds the grainy nutty texture of the cereal, and a little bit of strawberry ripe brings out more of the actual berry to make it pop.\r\n\r\nI like it without sweetener but added a half percent and seem to like it this way better. This is still a work in progress and I'll be making some tweaks to it over time.\r\n\r\nGreat as a shake and vape, but after a few days the Bavarian cream really pops. You can use fw or tpa Bavarian cream at the same percentage and it's still good.","steep_days":"3 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":4,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:49:19.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"1223","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Berry Crunch","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Bavarian Cream","vendor":"FW","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Acetyl Pyrazine","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Super Sweet","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":500},{"name":"Strawberry (ripe)","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2000}],"reviews":[{"user":"Jerikorayne","text":" i changed it up more to my pallet i added 0.75 tfa crunchy cereal  and FLV crunch cereal at 0.50 just to add more mouth feel this is a good recipe im giving 4 stars if you havent already mix it up you will enjoy  "}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"46309","name":"Deej berries"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
