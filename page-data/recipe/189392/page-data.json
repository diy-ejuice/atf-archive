With the confinement, people can't buy vaping products on my island, so I'm trying to help.\r\n\r\nIt's Fresh's quick custard with my favorite graham cracker in it. The Sugar cookie brings more crust.\r\n\r\nMany thanks to @Fresh03.\r\n\r\nThis should work in a pod/MTL set-up at 50VG/50PG, but you can easily vape it in a sub-ohm tank or RTA/RDA at 70VG/30PG\r\n\r\nEnjoy, be queer and vape on!\r\n\r\n[Photo Credits: queen.com.au]","steep_days":"2 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-02T15:38:40.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"689","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Vanilla Ice Cream","flavor_id":"1511","vendor":"LB","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Vanilla Pudding","flavor_id":"4433","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":500},{"name":"Custard Premium","flavor_id":"9118","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Graham Crust","flavor_id":"9950","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Sugar Cookie","flavor_id":"115","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1500}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"189392","name":"Vanilla Custard Pie Quickie (with Graham Crust)"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
