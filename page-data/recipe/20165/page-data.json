I am going to be eating alot of this over the next 5-6 weeks so im sure the recipe will change as I get closer..ill be sure to edit any changes.  \r\nCAP Horchata 4% -milky, light cinnamon, closest thing to an impression of rice.  \r\nFLV Vanilla custard 2.5% - pudding flavor (i've heard somewhere that this was reformulated and i have to order flv vanilla pudding to try here)  \r\nDIYFS Holy Vanilla .75%- creamy delicious vanilla.  \r\n TFA Rice Crunchies 2.5%- Ive never gotten too much out of this flavor but i need that rice note so here is where i started. v1 was 1%.  \r\n TPA Coconut Candy 1.25%- because i love this with the next ingredient.  \r\nFlv Sweet coconut 1.25%- My favortie coconut on the market (v1 i tried Fa coconut because i wanted to switch things up and use something i dont normally and after v1 i quickly went back to my go to coconut mix).  \r\nFLV Vanilla Pudding 3%- With this I no longer needed Marshmallow. This brings a light extra vanilla custardy flavor but plays very nice with flv vanilla custard which has a nice pudding flavor in itself. \r\nSucralose .75%- v1 didnt have sweetener but thinking of how sweet my reference tastes it needed a bit.\r\ndropped cinnamon ceylon out of v1 because was too much even at 1 drop per 30ml.  \r\n Next week my mom will be making up some rice pudding and i will compare and tweak or maybe even reconstruct completly if i have to.\r\nIm enjoying the base even it needs to steep this is just notes off of S&V. pudding flavor is there, still no rice, and i need to up the coconut.  \r\nFor menu: Not My Mamas Rice Puddin: Sweet coconut rice pudding. Finished with a pinch of cinnamon.\r\nI have gotten positive reviews of this recipe.. still tweaking %s but damn good","steep_days":"5","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:48:54.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"3340","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Horchata","flavor_id":"74","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Coconut Candy","flavor_id":"223","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1250},{"name":"Vanilla Custard","flavor_id":"633","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":2500},{"name":"sweetener (sucralose)","flavor_id":"2313","vendor":"OTHR","millipercent":750},{"name":"Sweet Coconut","flavor_id":"605","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1750},{"name":"Rice Crunchies","flavor_id":"142","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Holy Vanilla","flavor_id":"2385","vendor":"DFS","millipercent":500},{"name":"Vanilla Pudding","flavor_id":"4433","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":3000}],"reviews":[{"user":"PerennialPhilosopher","text":"https://www.reddit.com/r/mixersclub/comments/5jb9ha/fused_26_group/&#xD;\n&#xD;\nhere are a few reviews (including mine)"},{"user":"triangulatethisdick","text":"I'm really stoked for this recipe. Need a couple flavoring. Rice crispy, and vanilla pudding, but when I get them I plan to mix this and write a real review. If anyone is reading this, try deejay mills' coconut flan recipe. It's delectable. Definitely a contender for recipe of the year in my book"}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"20165","name":"Not My Mama's Rice Puddin"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
