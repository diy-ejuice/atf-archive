This French Croustade is loaded with fresh pear and a slight hint of lemon zest topped with a small dollop of whipped cream. The combination of JF Cookie, CAP Golden Butter, FW Graham Cracker, and CAP Toasted Almond create the perfect flakey pastry crust. The filling inside this crust is created by using the combination of FA Pear and FA Lemon Sicily spiced by the FW Hazelnut and slight cinnamon note given by the FW Graham Cracker blended with a smooth whipped cream provided by the FA Cream Whipped. This is to be Mixxed at (((70/30))) and steeped for (((7 days))).  I hope you all enjoy it and thank you very much for running such a great competition.
