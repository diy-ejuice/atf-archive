I have tried Gushers candy, however. By nature this is a sweet, candy-style profile, and it is spot on Gushers. Matt's recipes never disappoint. The FW Shirley Temple is definitely the key ingredient here. Very strong, in-your-face flavor, and perhaps a bit too much for ADV territory. Nevertheless, Gush is terrific as an occasional treat. Glad I picked up the flavors for this one. Very tasty. It is quite hard to put it down."}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"7920","name":"Gush"}}}
