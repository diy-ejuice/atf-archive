I wanted a crispy cookie rather than a fluffy sugar cookie.\r\n\r\nThe filling: FA Red Touch, INW Shisha Strawberry & JF Strawberry Sweet. Used the holy trinity of strawberries from ID10-T's Strawberry Slurp here which makes for a delicious strawberry jam filling.\r\n\r\nThe powdered sugar: OOO powdered sugar - speaks for itself. But this flavour is pretty great.","steep_days":"1 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"total_reviews":null,"updated_at":"2020-11-30T14:37:10.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"1011","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Cookie","vendor":"FA","millipercent":3500},{"name":"Graham Cracker Clear","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Powdered Sugar","vendor":"OOO","millipercent":1250},{"name":"Red Touch (strawberry)","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Shisha Strawberry","vendor":"INW","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Strawberry Sweet","vendor":"JF","millipercent":750}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"81961","name":"Linzer Cookie"}}}
