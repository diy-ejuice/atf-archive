This is just the way I like it. \r\n\r\nI was disappointed with most I've tried and decided to make my own version. No big notes here on the flavors used, because it's mostly self explanatory, I think. Just 3 little things I want to talk about: \r\n\r\nUsed TPA Sweetener instead of, for example, CAP Super Sweet, because I don't want too much sweetness and the ethyl maltol portion of the TPA Sweetener is doing wonders here. I also love FA's Honey in most creamy profiles, and it fits really well here too. I think the WS-23 is necessary, because, you know, it's an ice cream after all.\r\n\r\nHope you enjoy and have a nice vape!","steep_days":"21","temperature":"0","recipe_score":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-11T14:05:33.000-05:00","best_vg":"60%","views":"689","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"WS-23","flavor_id":"8085","vendor":"OTHR","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Sweetener","flavor_id":"339","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Pistachio","flavor_id":"293","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":4500},{"name":"Vanilla Bean Ice Cream","flavor_id":"186","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Shisha Vanilla","flavor_id":"841","vendor":"INW","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Bavarian Cream","flavor_id":"145","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Honey","flavor_id":"531","vendor":"FA","millipercent":600}],"reviews":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"194166","name":"Pistachio Ice Cream"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
