This is just the way I like it. \r\n\r\nI was disappointed with most I've tried and decided to make my own version. No big notes here on the flavors used, because it's mostly self explanatory, I think. Just 3 little things I want to talk about: \r\n\r\nUsed TPA Sweetener instead of, for example, CAP Super Sweet, because I don't want too much sweetness and the ethyl maltol portion of the TPA Sweetener is doing wonders here. I also love FA's Honey in most creamy profiles, and it fits really well here too. I think the WS-23 is necessary, because, you know, it's an ice cream after all.\r\n\r\nHope you enjoy and have a nice vape!","steep_days":"21","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"total_reviews":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T23:38:55.000-05:00","best_vg":"60%","views":"683","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"WS-23","vendor":"OTHR","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Sweetener","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Pistachio","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":4500},{"name":"Vanilla Bean Ice Cream","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Shisha Vanilla","vendor":"INW","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Bavarian Cream","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Honey","vendor":"FA","millipercent":600}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"194166","name":"Pistachio Ice Cream"}}}
