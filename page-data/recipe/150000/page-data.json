Modeled after the blue and white shark gummy candies. I went pretty heavy with the raspberries to cover up the red licorice the 27 fish brings along. The vanilla swirl I used to blend everything together and add some more gummy texture. Add sweetener if you don't find it sweet enough as it is. Doesn't really need a steep it was pretty tasty off the shake. Please rate and review if you mix.","steep_days":"1 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"total_reviews":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-06T20:44:50.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"1537","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"27 Fish","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":5000},{"name":"Blue Raspberry (Candy)","vendor":"OOO","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Sour Blue Raspberry Candy","vendor":"WF","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Vanilla Swirl","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1000}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"150000","name":"Blue Sharks"}}}
