This is a very simple, delicious recipe showcasing just how good TFA Banana Nut Bread is, along with Cap Sugar Cookie,and Cap VC V1. This was something I used to mix up quite a bit and figure I'll share it for those that like simple recipes.

TFA Banana Nut Bread is obviously the star here and is actually a decent stand alone flavor. The only reason I rated this 4 stars instead of 5 stars is because I did not really see what 3% of CAP Sugar Cookie was doing for it. CAP Sugar Cookie is often used at higher percentages and for good reason. I think if it was either upped a bit percentage wise or replaced with something to add a bit more spice, this recipe would be even better. However, for a super quick and easy 3 ingredient recipe, this is definitely tasty."},{"user":"DadaFry","score":"5","text":"A great one! Tastes like banana bread fresh from the oven. Easy ADV"},{"user":"kitu5","score":"5","text":"Damned good after even a very long steep. It's precisely what it says on the tin, but it's very sweet, and the custard note fills the bread nicely, keeping it from being too dry. For someone who's not the world's biggest banana fan, this is really saying something. I love this stuff!&#xD;\n&#xD;\nNicely done!"},{"user":"Illegal_Immigrant","score":"4","text":"A pretty tasty recipe for sure, great mouth feel and not dry at all to me. I'm missing some of the nut and spice flavor from a real banana nut bread though. One week steep."},{"user":"JeffVader","score":"4","text":"A staple ADV in my recipe folder - simple and delicious!"},{"user":"Benoz","score":"4","text":"not to bad but think i am vaping at higher watts than your self i let it steep for 20 days i seem to be getting some off notes from the nut bread and not enough custard to cover it as i said i belive this is due to the temp i am vaping (80-90 w). i did try it lower and a good range was 40-60 watts i had a lot less off notes here. still not my adv but i give you big brownie points for 3 flavors and giving people something simple and easy to mix cheers."},{"user":"JustinLFranks","score":"none","text":"TPA Banana Nut Bread is such a great flavor, isn't it? CAP Sugar Cookie and CAP Vanilla Custard were perfect choices to pair it with, too. I prefer it with a bit less of those two, however. 2.5% CAP Sugar Cookie and 2% CAP Vanilla Custard worked quite well â€“ all of the good stuff they provide are still there, but it allows the TPA Banana Nut Bread some \"breathing room\"."},{"user":"NaCHeF","score":"4","text":"Great recipe! It is simple and full of flavor! The banana is a little too fake and maybe needs some hazelnut or other nut to make it a little more real, but I can vape this all day! Thank you for sharing!"},{"user":"Grorco","score":"4","text":"Unfortunately this just isn't quite hitting the spot for me, it taste good, but isn't screaming banana nut bread at me. It just feels to dry to me, and I'm getting eggy vanilla over taking the banana bread. Like I said it does taste good, but I think it needs some tweaking for me personally. "},{"user":"VaperKitten","score":"5","text":"Really delicious, I made this.....vaped it, it was good...I was happy then I forgot about it for six weeks and now it is incredible.  I added about 1/2 a percent of Browne Sugar.  The flavor is thick and rich and super good, I will always have this juice in my nebox."},{"user":"cdaniell30","score":"5","text":"I love a simple mix that tastes like so much more.  This is damn fine work."},{"user":"ID10-T","score":"5","text":"I gave it 12 days to let the VC V1 develop and because I had other things to try, so I can't comment on S&amp;V like others have done here. But after that steep, this is delicious and an excellent example of how a simple recipe doesn't necessarily taste simple. Sharing easy recipes that taste great is a valuable community service; thank you MrColdOne! "},{"user":"Rdubu","score":"4","text":"Spoton taste as shake and vape and 2 - 3 days steep; i find the flavor starts to change the 4th day, might be the Vanilla Custard.  I think the first 3 days I went through 50 mL.  thanks for sharing the recipe."},{"user":"tw2k","score":"5","text":"Very accurate banana nut bread--best I've tried. Thanks for such a simple ADV."},{"user":"horizonism","score":"5","text":"Perfect as a shake n vape. Can only imagine it getting better after a short steep. Great mixing! Can see myself making a lot of this in the future. Pairs nicely with a rooibos tea or black coffee. Thanks for sharing! "},{"user":"Deschain","score":"5","text":"I've only steeped it for a day as the recipe suggests, and it tasted pretty damn good as is. Some simpler recipes have a \"not quite there\" profile, but I don't get this from the recipe as all."},{"user":"HerrHut","score":"5","text":"Hits the profile. Very smooth and tasty vape. Love it."}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"34610","name":"3 Banana Nuts: Simple Banana Nut Bread"}}}
