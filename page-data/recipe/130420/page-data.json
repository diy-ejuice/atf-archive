What do Hobbits eat for second breakfast? I know what I would eat.....maple bacon pecan donuts. I’m hoping Middle Earth has everything they need for these donuts...I’m hoping the bacon comes out with a steep. I didn’t want it taking over the mix, so I kept it low.....might need a bumping up, being Hobbits like bacon. Thank you Jennifer Jarvis for such a fun challenge!","steep_days":"7","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T20:32:50.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"1094","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Bacon","flavor_id":"1828","vendor":"OOO","millipercent":1750},{"name":"Cream Milky Undertone PG","flavor_id":"6539","vendor":"OOO","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Deep Fried Pastry Dough SC","flavor_id":"8367","vendor":"WF","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Maple Pecan","flavor_id":"1347","vendor":"FW","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Powdered Sugar","flavor_id":"6522","vendor":"OOO","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Zeppola","flavor_id":"6312","vendor":"FA","millipercent":2000}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"130420","name":"Second Breakfast"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
