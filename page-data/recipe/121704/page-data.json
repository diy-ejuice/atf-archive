FA Florida Key Lime and FLV Sweet Coconut were both new flavors that I had not used yet, and knowing both flavor brands, assumed they would be a good fit with the percentages. I admit the profile pretty much came off the top of my head talking with ID10-T in the diy discord.\r\n\r\nPUR Banana is creamy, ripe, and fresh. You won't find any shitty runts flavor in this one (unless that's what you like. I won't judge).\r\n\r\nFA Florida Key Lime is great because I've previously used TFA Key Lime in my recipes, but it needs help and a steep as its quite harsh right off the mix and needs help from more Lime and some sweetener. Luckily FA FKL can stand on its own, and seems like it would be a great fit in any drink recipes.\r\n\r\nFLV Sweet Coconut made me like coconut vapes. And I actually think it made me like IRL Coconut as its bothered me in the past. I'm not even sure how that's possible. I've had it some other folks' juices before, so I knew it was good. GTFO FA Coconut and TFA Coconut Extra. But it tastes like an accurate Coconut, and its a bit creamy as well.\r\n\r\nYou definitely taste the creamy banana and coconut on the inhale more so than the Lime. But the Lime comes in at the end. I'm most impressed by the way the coconut and banana have kind of melded into a mash or a pudding, for lack of a better word. I would give it 4-5 days for the Key Lime to mellow out. If you dig the tropical style juice, or even remotely like coconut, try it out.
