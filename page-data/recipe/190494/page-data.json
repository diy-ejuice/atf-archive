With CAP Cereal 27 to bend it towards a cereal and some FLV toffee to add some nuance at .5% really helps the graham cracker out.\r\n\r\nI used a layer for the milk as suggested to me by Jennifer Winstead and since i trust her x1000 i used her suggestions for a good \"cereal milk\" and added my graham cereal layer to it.","steep_days":"14","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"total_reviews":1,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:51:30.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"825","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Graham Cracker","vendor":"FW","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Graham Cracker","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Toffee","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":500},{"name":"Bavarian Cream","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Meringue","vendor":"FA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Sweet Cream","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Cream Fresh","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Cereal 27","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Coco' (coconut)","vendor":"FA","millipercent":250}],"reviews":[{"user":"cxxxxp","score":"5","text":"This be the epitome of cereal vapes of all time, everywhere.
