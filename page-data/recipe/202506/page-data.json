This is a a booze free version, so feel free to add your favorite rum if you like. \r\nFlavorah Peach is the star of this recipe, and the apricot just adds a little extra boost to the flavor of the peach.  The Milk & Honey is just perfect to add  to help with the cooked aspect of the peach.  And what can I say about FLV Vanilla Pudding, it is delicious, and FLV Marshmallow Vanilla just adds a delicious touch to boost texture and fluffiness of parfait.
