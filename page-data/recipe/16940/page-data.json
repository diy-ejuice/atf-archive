I feel this pie is just so balanced with these particular flavors. It tastes like a home cooked pumpkin pie*\r\n  \r\n**CAP Pumpkin Pie:**\r\n*Used at 1% due to its potent spices. Anything higher and I'm gagging. Nice tasting crust, allspice and creaminess*\r\n\r\n**TFA Pumpkin:**\r\n*Used at 2% because it's a thicker 'pumpkin' with spices....but the spices are not too powerful that they take over the recipe. I used both brands because they both offer something different which is needed for this recipe.*\r\n  \r\n**TFA Eggnog:**\r\n*Why the low percentage on this? And why its inclusion? All I wanted from this is the nutmeg note. This flavor is pretty potent, so to balance it with the other flavors, only 0.3% was required*\r\n\r\n**TFA Vanilla Swirl & Strawberry Ripe:**\r\n*Both of these flavors tone down the strong allspice a smidgen and add creaminess and depth to the filling. Without them you get a spice pie with a little pumpkin.*\r\n\r\n**CAP CDS:**\r\n*Even though there are spices going on with the above ingredients, the one ingredient lacking is of course, cinnamon. We only need a little here. And at 1%, CDS not only helps flavor the pie filling...it also gives a \"baked\" crust flavor to the Graham cracker.*\r\n\r\n**LA Cream Cheese Icing/CAP NY Cheesecake:**\r\n*Both of these flavors pair so well and really make the pumpkins take on a pumpkin 'pie filling' taste.*\r\n\r\n**FW Graham Cracker**\r\n*Perfect graham cracker crust*\r\n\r\n*Round it out with sweetener and you've got your very own Punkin Chunkin Cheesecake Pie!!*\r\n\r\n**I vaped this fresh, but with steeping(3-7 days), the pie filling becomes more like a pumpkin filling and less spicy.**\r\n\r\n**Do not take it upon yourself to copy and publish this recipe over to ELR. THIS ACTION IS STRICTLY FORBIDDEN.** \r\nRespect mixers, they are not your ticket to success...They are your friends.\r\n\r\n#EJUICEMAKERS","steep_days":"0","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T15:20:20.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"1851","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Pumpkin Pie (spice)","flavor_id":"107","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Pumpkin","flavor_id":"263","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"New York Cheesecake","flavor_id":"90","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":5000},{"name":"Cream Cheese Icing","flavor_id":"2380","vendor":"LA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Graham Cracker","flavor_id":"1297","vendor":"FW","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Strawberry (ripe)","flavor_id":"271","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Cinnamon Danish Swirl","flavor_id":"35","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Vanilla Swirl","flavor_id":"189","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Sweetener","flavor_id":"339","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Super Sweet","flavor_id":"2384","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":200},{"name":"Egg Nog","flavor_id":"303","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":300}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"16940","name":"Punkin Chunkin Cheesecake Pie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
