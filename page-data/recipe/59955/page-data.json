I've always enjoyed Lavender and think it goes great with Black Currant so I decided to make a candy, not realizing I was making a different version of his Jazz Hands until just a few minutes ago. Anyways after a few trials this is what I've landed on. It's sweet, has a great gummy candy vibe, and the flavors fell into place perfectly. \r\n\r\nLavender and Black Currant dance around creating the base of this recipe, I wanted the Lavender to be prominent but not overtake the whole thing causing it to go dry so 1.5% works well. The Black Currant adds a nice musty and deep flavor at 2%, and the touch of Raspberry adds a little tartness to keep it crisp and up front.\r\n\r\nJelly Candy is perfect here at 3%, with a touch of Super Sweet at .25% you really get a gummy candy out of it.\r\n\r\nHoly Vanilla was put in at 1.5% to meld the two components together and make it one cohesive flavor as well as add a touch of Vanilla to the Lavender.","steep_days":"3","temperature":"0","recipe_score":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-12T08:12:54.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"1206","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Lavender","flavor_id":"510","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Blackcurrant","flavor_id":"545","vendor":"FA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Jelly Candy","flavor_id":"2170","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Holy Vanilla","flavor_id":"2385","vendor":"DFS","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Raspberry","flavor_id":"667","vendor":"INW","millipercent":250},{"name":"Super Sweet","flavor_id":"2384","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":250}],"reviews":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"59955","name":"Taaffeite"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
