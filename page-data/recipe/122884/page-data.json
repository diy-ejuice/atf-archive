So when I say that FLV does tea really well, I speak from  experience, and their red tea is spot on for me.  This is a  slightly sweet earthy vanilla maple base with some brighter fruit top notes.  it makes for a very nice easy all day vape .   This was mixed for the All flavorah  November  contest \r\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/BoZX1UznUri/?taken-by=flavorah\r\n\r\n **Apple filling** provides some body to this mix  some spice and cider  notes that accent this mix at this percent.. \r\n\r\n**Ginger peach Persimmon and Red tea** combine to create a natural sweet bright almost creamy peach note with a deep woodsy caramel vanilla back note from the red tea. .  Persimmon has some citrus peach notes that provide some bright top note to this mix.   The ginger sits on top and is noticeable on the exhale .   The deeper notes of the red tea come out after a 3 - 5 day period. \r\n\r\n**milk and honey** adds some darker base sweet caramel notes that anchor this mix and add some creamy body \r\n\r\n**vanilla bean** is an accent used to pull out the vanilla note  that is part of the ginger peach and red tea. \r\n\r\n** cream** adds some body and blends this mix.\r\n\r\n**NOTE**  :  I enjoy a sweeter tea hence the additional of sweetness, which I find  to be a sweetener that adds  the most natural  type of sweetness to a mix like this - but use the sweetener of your choice \r\n\r\n. \"Learn more about mixing here:\r\nhttps://www.facebook.com/groups/diydownunder/\r\nhttps://discord.gg/kH4Fqbc\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCTCwb7ULyfJALQlehomZZQA\r\nhttps://www.diydownunder.com/","steep_days":"5","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-06T20:44:19.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"905","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Apple Filling","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":750},{"name":"Cream","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":750},{"name":"Ginger Peach","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Milk & Honey","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1300},{"name":"Persimmon","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":750},{"name":"Red tea","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Vanilla Bean","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":750},{"name":"Sweetness","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":300}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"122884","name":"The Steeping ( Ginger peach red tea - all  FLV) "}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
