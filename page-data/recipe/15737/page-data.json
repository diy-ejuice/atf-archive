I had some hard time trying to put this together. One of the reasons, was having the right bread pudding flavor to start this recipe. In our country this bread pudding and it probably sounds weird, but is made with the oldest left overs pieces of bread that you can get. It needs to be very decomposed and hard for the pudding to turn out absolutely flavorful. I'm also missing the raisins that is a must have in this recipe. All the flavors in here are in the actual recipe on way or another. I'm not an expert on this, but I'm trying my best for this mix to be successful and for who ever that wants to vaped becomes enjoyable in there daily rotation. I'll keep updating you guys as I get results. This is my first shot at it, so hopefully we have the right percentages in. I'm looking for the Vienna Cream to blend with the Custard and give me that hint of sweetness, creamy profile. I added a bit of brown sugar which is totally up to your pallet, to add some more sweetness to it. I'll think that the Salted Caramel will hide a little bit of that. The Condensed milk will help to round off all this creams, at least IMO. The clove and the anise should be pronounced, you must feel that hint of them in it. Last and not least the Vanilla Custard will surround all this aromas to not let the other flavors overwhelmed the mix. The Bananas are pretty straight forward, Banana Nut Bread and Banana Cream I think they are delicious flavors. I just need to find out how well they lay out with each other. I'm expecting for the Butter Cream to do some great things in here. So here it is guys, some Budin from the heart of Puerto Rico Typical Desserts. Any comments or suggestions are always welcome people. I hope you enjoyed as much as I will! Thanks... \r\n\r\nSteep: I figured at least 3 or 4 days with the help of the Ultrasonic or what ever you want to use. I want to know as soon is possible, that's why I use this method + a really good shake.\r\nMix at: 80VG/ 20PG\r\nBath in ultrasonic cleaner: 1/2HR Cap off\r\nNic: 3mg\r\nBreath Time: 5 1/2HR Cap off","steep_days":"0","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T23:35:07.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"3340","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Vienna Cream","vendor":"FA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Clove","vendor":"FA","millipercent":250},{"name":"Anise","vendor":"FA","millipercent":250},{"name":"Banana Cream","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Caramel (original)","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Banana Nut Bread","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Custard","vendor":"FA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Butter Cream","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":500},{"name":"Brown Sugar","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Cinnamon Ceylon","vendor":"FA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Milk Condensed","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Caramel (salted)","vendor":"FW","millipercent":250},{"name":"Vanilla Custard","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":3000}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"15737","name":" BUDIN DE BANANA (BANANA BREAD PUDDING) (PUERTO RICAN STYLE)"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
