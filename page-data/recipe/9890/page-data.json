Its a lot of different flavors but I've went through the process of stripping this recipe completely down and building it back up many times. Its been in development for over a year, and its had an amazing local response. Any feedback is appreciated. As always, personally I add .5% super sweet to it.","steep_days":"2","temperature":"0","recipe_score":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-12T00:40:02.000-05:00","best_vg":"80%","views":"1479","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Cake (yellow)","flavor_id":"1222","vendor":"FW","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Biscuit","flavor_id":"642","vendor":"INW","millipercent":2000},{"name":"French Vanilla","flavor_id":"56","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Lemon Sicily","flavor_id":"524","vendor":"FA","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Brown Sugar","flavor_id":"313","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Cheesecake (graham Crust)","flavor_id":"152","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Lime Tahity Cold Pressed","flavor_id":"581","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Sugar Cookie","flavor_id":"115","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Ethyl Maltol","flavor_id":"1710","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":500}],"reviews":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"9890","name":"Lemon Biscotti"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
