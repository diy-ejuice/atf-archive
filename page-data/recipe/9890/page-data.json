Its a lot of different flavors but I've went through the process of stripping this recipe completely down and building it back up many times. Its been in development for over a year, and its had an amazing local response. Any feedback is appreciated. As always, personally I add .5% super sweet to it.","steep_days":"2","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"total_reviews":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-06T20:48:47.000-05:00","best_vg":"80%","views":"1468","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Cake (yellow)","vendor":"FW","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Biscuit","vendor":"INW","millipercent":2000},{"name":"French Vanilla","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Lemon Sicily","vendor":"FA","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Brown Sugar","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Cheesecake (graham Crust)","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Lime Tahity Cold Pressed","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Sugar Cookie","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Ethyl Maltol","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":500}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"9890","name":"Lemon Biscotti"}}}
