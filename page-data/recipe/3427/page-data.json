To echo what a few people have already stated in their reviews, with Strawberry (ripe) and FA Lemon Sicily both being notorious for muting/fading, this recipe should be enjoyed right off the shake, trying not to mix more than you can vape in a few days. A simple and great recipe. I add WS-23 and/or FA Polar Blast to my Lemonades because I prefer a cold beverage....in fact, I add it to almost all of my mixes!"},{"user":"Korlimann","score":"5","text":"If you like a fresh lemonade every now and then, this is your absolute go to. LA Lemonade has to be one of the best, if not THE best Lemonade base there is, imho. There might be a better choice for a raspberry than TFAs Raspberry (sweet), but I mixed a lot with it and personally I like the raspberry flavor it gives a lot, although some might not as much. TFA Raspberry just has this juicy raspberry sweetness which I think blends really well with a drink. Might not do much for a raspberry cupcake or other stuff, but for drinks it fits pretty well. The strawberry gives the raspberry a small boost and makes the drink more fruity and refreshing, and FA Lemon Sicily does a great job in rounding everything together, and provides a hint of lemony flavor in there. The only problem I really see with the recipe is, that TFA Strawberry (ripe) is known to fade a bit, so there might have been a better choice for the strawberry, and this way you shouldn't mix too much of this recipe and vape it quickly, otherwise flavor might change. But since it's only used at 1% and a bit of fading shouldn't really affect the recipe too much (at least, I didn't notice any great changes in flavor), it's still a 5 for me. Great job with this recipe!"},{"user":"YippYo","score":"4","text":"Great Pink Lemonade but the flavors fade FAST into a weird muted lemony mess. So vape this fresh for sure."},{"user":"LianazVapin","score":"4","text":"I mixed this for my husband and he enjoys it. The Strawberry faded for me, but his focus in on the lemonade. Good recipe "},{"user":"ScottMacWade","score":"5","text":"Was desperate for a lemonade vape while working on my own mixes during a hot &amp; humid day. Wow! Simple, easy, and a true SNV although I did a small cheat with a mag stir for a couple of minutes. Not only fantastic in the Entheon, it it also vapes great in my Hastur MTL @1.6 ohms. (I'm going to split off 10ml and try a few drops of VT Sugar Cane and Russian Vodka just for kicks.)"},{"user":"bjorama","score":"5","text":"Yeah..  title is accurate.  Yup perfectade"},{"user":"COB","score":"1","text":""},{"user":"Outofhand","score":"5","text":"Seriously great, and that's coming from someone who has never enjoyed a lemonade based commercial juice. The LA Lemonade and Lemon Sicily may be the perfect lemonade base to branch off of too. Great work here! Went through nearly 100ml in 4 days."},{"user":"Deetzz","score":"5","text":"Really Really Really good Lemonade!! I love it and its part of my permanent Mixes at the moment,&#xD;\nI just wish the profile stood up a bit better to a steep, the Vibrancy seems to fade down after about  10 days.... Not that a Bottle lasts that long with me :-)"},{"user":"diesel223","score":"5","text":"Great fresh realistic pink lemonade. Awesome in this summer heat and no steep needed. As some others said I wouldn't make large batch as it does fade with steep. Great one here."},{"user":"AlfredPudding","score":"4","text":"As already stated in these reviews, this recipe is really meant to be a SNV. Over time the qualities that lemon sicily and the raspberry/strawberry combination add will fade, and you will be left with a mildly pink LA lemonade. It is a solid recipe though, and the combination of raspberry and strawberry add a great \"pink\" flavor to the lemonade. "},{"user":"kindground","score":"5","text":"This is a staple summer recipe. Flavor is realistic and well balanced. The raspberry/strawberry combination creates a great berry to bring the pink to a great lemonade base. "},{"user":"ObiWanCannoli","score":"5","text":"Definitely in my top 3 fruit vapes which is saying a lot! Killer recipe, very nicely balanced although I found it a bit harsh on the throat. After mixing this up a few times I decided to replace the strawberry ripe with regular strawberry TPA which I find smooth as butter and added 0.2% of cactus. It was a total game changer now its silky smooth and juicier while retaining the exact same flavor as before. Great recipe, an easy 5 stars! "},{"user":"Kudo","score":"5","text":"First time mixing, could be a little sweeter but otherwise spot on. I definitely see this recipe as being something I shake and vape regularly while I wait for something to steep. Looking forward to trying other people's suggestions to this recipe"},{"user":"DodgerFog33","score":"5","text":"How have I never seen this recipe. Oh my god is this fucking amazing. I added .75 of TFA Sweetner as I like it Sweet. Fucking perfect pink lemonade. Great job"},{"user":"lococarnage","score":"5","text":"I replaced the 6% LA Lemonade with 4%FLV Lemonade.  It was quite pungent as a shake and vape but at day 3 it is lovely. I may lower the FLV Lemonade a touch next time."},{"user":"spite","score":"5","text":""},{"user":"ID10-T","score":"5","text":"Before I say something that might be misconstrued as \"don't mix this\" - MIX THIS!  But don't mix too much; the notorious fading of FA Lemon Sicily and the muting properties of Strawberry Ripe combine in a perfect storm of recipe degradation. It falls apart in about 3 days. Easy solution; don't make more than you can vape in about 3 days. Start vaping immediately; it's a true shake and vape recipe. During those days; enjoy a sublime blend berry and lemonade. The lemonade base itself is more CountryTime than anything an actual lemon was involved in creating, but there's absolutely nothing wrong with that. Who doesn't love a nice cold glass of CountryTime Pink Lemonade at the end of a hot summer day, right?! This is that, done perfectly. To make it even better than perfect add some coolant of your choice -- I made a second batch with 1.5% WS-23 (30% solution in PG), but FA Polar Blast would probably be good too -- and get refreshed AF. "},{"user":"shyndo","score":"5","text":"For me this is the king of lemonade bases with a little raspberry and strawb added. This whole recipe is absolutely amazing but the fact that I got a wonderful base to play around with out of it makes me supremely happy. It tastes like element's pink lemonade minus the abhorrent amount of sickly sweet on the exhale. For anyone who likes lemonade it's a dream come true and a perfect spring or summertime vape. "},{"user":"Fiftytrent","score":"5","text":"One of the first recipes I ever mixed and one of the very few I ensure to keep around at all times.  Love this one."},{"user":"mondayblues411","score":"5","text":"I'm relatively new to the vaping community, since November. After spending hundreds of dollars on e-liquid I've decided to start making my own. Spent lots of time researching recipes and chose this recipe as my first. It turned out amazing! First bottle ever. Made another for a big cloud lover and he said it's great for clouds. Thanks for making my first diy experience a great one!"},{"user":"SLIT","score":"5","text":"I'm an extremely tough critic of all e-liquid, especially my own. I'm always sceptical of other people's recipes, as a lot are pretty bad. I've been trying to come up with a good lemonade flavor for a while now. I have everything except raspberry sweet, so I decided to sub INW raspberry at 1% as its pretty strong. I mixed it, immediately dripped it into some fresh cotton, and it is by far the best damn pink lemonade I've ever had. I can't say what the original recipe is like exactly, but ican imagine that with sweet raspberry is even better. Kudos Vurve.

Though I continue to chase the lemonade dragon, nothing I've made comes close to the unfussy perfection of this one.
