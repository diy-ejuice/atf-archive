Its structure is that of a sandwich, with a creamy, custard-flavoured centre between two flat biscuit layers. Traditionally, the filling was buttercream (which is still used in home-made recipes) but nowadays cheaper fats have replaced butter in mass-produced biscuits. The filling tastes of vanilla and as such is more akin to the taste of custard made with custard powder than egg custard. It is believed that the custard cream biscuit originated in 1908.[1] They usually have an elaborate baroque design stamped onto them, originating in the Victorian era and representing ferns.[2]\r\n\r\nSome British and Irish supermarkets produce own brand versions, with variations including lemon, orange, chocolate, strawberry, coffee and coconut flavours. In a 2007 poll of 7,000 Britons, 9 out of 10 voted custard creams to be their favourite biscuit.[2] In 2009 it was ranked the eighth most popular biscuit in the UK to dunk into tea.[3]\" - wikipedia.\r\n\r\nSo here you go, my take on it. See below for a few notes.\r\n\r\nMarshmallow - don't sub for Cap Marshmallow, it's not the same what so ever.\r\n\r\nGraham Cracker - it was originally the dark one but have swapped for the clear due to the safety concerns and the limited availability of the original dark one.\r\n\r\nSucralose - I use the standard Capella sucralose, if you use Capella Super Sweet, use half of what my recipe states so 0.5% opposed to 1%.\r\n\r\nStarts tasting really good after 3 days or more. I always do a warm bath with the bottle straight after mixing, and shake until there is so much air that it is cloudy. If you can leave to steep for 1 week or more then it just gets better.\r\n\r\n<a rel=\"license\" href=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/\"><img alt=\"Creative Commons License\" style=\"border-width:0\" src=\"https://i.creativecommons.org/l/by-nc-sa/4.0/88x31.png\" /></a><br /><span xmlns:dct=\"http://purl.org/dc/terms/\" property=\"dct:title\">Custard Cream (The Biscuit) </span> by <a xmlns:cc=\"http://creativecommons.org/ns#\" href=\"https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/18240#custard_cream_the_biscuit_by_opensauce\" property=\"cc:attributionName\" rel=\"cc:attributionURL\">Matthew Murray (Open/Sauce)</a> is licensed under a <a rel=\"license\" href=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/\">Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International License</a>.\r\n","steep_days":"5","temperature":"450","recipe_score":0,"total_reviews":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T23:35:10.000-05:00","best_vg":"80%","views":"4919","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Butter Cream","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1700},{"name":"Ethyl Maltol","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Graham Cracker Clear","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Marshmallow","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Meringue","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"New York Cheesecake","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Super Sweet","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":500},{"name":"Vanilla Cupcake","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Vanilla Custard","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Vanilla Swirl","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":3000}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"18240","name":"Custard Cream (The Biscuit) "}}}
