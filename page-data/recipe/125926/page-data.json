It is a pleasant  fruit mix for when you're in the mood for something full flavored and a little sweet. I mixed a bottle with TFA's version and one with FA's version. I then put them away to give the FLV Cream a chance to open up. I promptly forgot all about them until today. They both turned out to be very good. I prefer Berry Mix over Forest Fruit, but each to his/her own.\r\n\r\nI would imagine that this recipe would be hard to mess up, so feel free to try out different flavors.","steep_days":"7","temperature":"0","recipe_score":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-10T14:52:57.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"1309","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Berry Mix","flavor_id":"5899","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":5000},{"name":"Cream","flavor_id":"604","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Shisha Strawberry","flavor_id":"1711","vendor":"INW","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Peach (juicy)","flavor_id":"254","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1750},{"name":"Rainbow Drops","flavor_id":"265","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Super Sweet","flavor_id":"2384","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1000}],"reviews":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"125926","name":"Berry Easy"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
