In other variations I added 1% FA Raspberry and/or 1.5% JF Sweet Strawberry to the blueberry, and they were all good, so add them if you want more berry flavor.\r\nI did not want a heavy ice cream for a summer vape, so I used WF Vanilla Cream Extra to add the dairy.\r\n\r\nTested in an Innokin ZBiip with the 1.6 coil.  Mixed 50VG/50PG and steeped for a week.  Edited:  After a month the flavor was much better.  Recommend a longer steep.\r\n\r\n\r\n","steep_days":"30","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-06T20:51:43.000-05:00","best_vg":"50%","views":"1180","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Blueberry","flavor_id":"2076","vendor":"HS","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Shirley Temple","flavor_id":"1412","vendor":"FW","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Vanilla Cream Extra SC","flavor_id":"8382","vendor":"WF","millipercent":1000}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"151296","name":"Berry Float MTL"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
