I am noting it more on the exhale\r\n**NOTE**  I  added a drop of  WS 23 and FLV sweetness   to  add vibrancy and sweetness to the soda .  CAP grapefruit could be  used around 7% instead of Honey Pomelo   but  it will have a slightly bitter tart note and leans more white grapefruit then pink \r\n","steep_days":"2 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-06T20:44:43.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"1002","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Citrus Soda","flavor_id":"10083","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1300},{"name":"Honey Pomelo","flavor_id":"8900","vendor":"VT","millipercent":3500},{"name":"Pink Guava","flavor_id":"637","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":750},{"name":"Lime Tahity Cold Pressed","flavor_id":"581","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1300},{"name":"Tequila Agave","flavor_id":"10148","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":750}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"144998","name":"PINK DOVE (paloma cocktail -  pink grapefruit and tequila) "}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
