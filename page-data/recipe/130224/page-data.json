Unfortunately this recipe does require a substantial steep, but most fruits will blend well with it, like apple strawberry or even banana. I mix it up 200ml at a time and always have a zero nic bottle of it around. I add a squirt of something else like pineapple or menthol and add nicotine. Shake and go. Again, don’t be afraid to vape it solo. It’s good on its own after the steep. Off the shake it kinda tastes like nothing. Definitely needs time but it really blooms.
