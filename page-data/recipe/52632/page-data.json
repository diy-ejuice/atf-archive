It's in almost every one of my mixes, but when I mixed this for my supervisor he asked for it to be dropped down to .2%\r\n\r\n\r\nI mixed this for a Tuesday that I was going golfing. I had hoped it would turn out well, but I was pleasantly surprised! This one is absolutely a good SNV, but I do think that it gets better after about a day. Please give any feedback.\r\n\r\nFA Fuji- For sweetness and juiciness.","steep_days":"1 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"updated_at":"2020-12-12T18:29:19.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"1844","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Pink Guava","flavor_id":"637","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Blackberry","flavor_id":"214","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Lemonade","flavor_id":"636","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":3500},{"name":"Apple Fuji","flavor_id":"4886","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Super Sweet","flavor_id":"2384","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":600}],"reviews":[{"user":"Wodde","text":"Mixed this Today without Pink Guava (hate Pink Guava), amazing Stuff :)","score":5}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"52632","name":"Haterade"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
