The first version was pretty close to a finished recipe but we wanted to try to complete it by adding JF Dulce De Leche and increasing the TPA Kentucky Bourbon.

For me, anything with JF honey peach in it is going to be good, but with the addition of kentucky bourbon it turns into something pretty addicting. Thank you developed for YET AGAIN making some awesome stuff."}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"202628","name":"Bourbon Glazed Peaches | DEVELOPED | INTERACTIVE MIXING"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
