It is a deep syrupy flavor that blends perfectly with any lemon or tea and adds an extra dimension and sweetness to the mix.\r\n\r\nSalud!","steep_days":"3 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:51:14.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"1560","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Ruby Red Grapefruit","flavor_id":"1404","vendor":"FW","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Lemon Tea","flavor_id":"3515","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Lemonade","flavor_id":"1336","vendor":"FW","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Sweet Tea","flavor_id":"369","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":10000},{"name":"Super Sweet","flavor_id":"2384","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":500},{"name":"Sweet Currant","flavor_id":"10171","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1500}],"reviews":[{"user":"dougc","text":"This is very nice.
