Just in time for the warm days headed to Atlanta, GA (Hotlanta). \r\nThe Base;: Blue Energy, Soda Base, and Fizzy Sherbet: the combo of these 3 creates a great base for a Energy Drink. Blue energy is a berry flavor, the soda Base helps to boost a slight effervescent effect, but more so by creating the density of the Drink. The fizzy sherbet adds a refreshing feel to this energy drink, the citrus taste that it provides stays with you on the exhale making you want more. \r\nThe Flavor: Succulent strawberry and Black Raspberry. Succulent strawberry is just hands down one of the best Strawberries I have had. Very authentic and natural Next Black Raspberry, this is a deeper Raspberry, but this helps balance the strawberry with the citrus of the sherbet. \r\nAdd sweetener if you prefer.
