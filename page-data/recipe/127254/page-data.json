The waffle is a trio of LB Belgian Waffle, JF Yellow Cake, and INW Waffle. It's an awesome combination of waffle dough, sweet, cake-like texture, and the \"fresh from a waffle iron\" accent provided by INW Waffle. FA Maple Syrup is used to add a maple syrup drizzle over the whole vape, and it shows up just enough to be present without bullying any of the other wonderful components. Finally, TPA Butter is there to make the experience incredibly rich without any artificial movie theater butter showing up. If you have the old INW Waffle sitting around somewhere, do yourself a favor and give this a shot. It delivers."}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"127254","name":"Blueberry Waffles"}}}
