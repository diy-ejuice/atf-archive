This recipe is tasty AF to me.   A lilttle bit of texture from the Cereal 27 and bit of that ripe cheese from TPA CGC lends itself nice.  FLV Cream for body and the rest add to milk things up even more and the end resulst reminds me of when the ice cream has melted and the spoon is no longer effective, and no one is watching.....  So you decide to tip the bowl and drink it straight from the source.  I enjoy this best after 5 days, but it's good to go and easily vaped after the shake.  \r\n\r\nThe correct amount of FLV Rich Cinnamon should be 1 drop per 30mls\r\n\r\n\r\n","steep_days":"5 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:51:31.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"755","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Pralines & Cream","vendor":"FW","millipercent":5000},{"name":"Cereal 27","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Vanilla Pudding","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Cream","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Butterscotch Ripple","vendor":"FW","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Cheesecake (graham Crust)","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Sweet Cream","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Super Sweet","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":350},{"name":"Custard Premium","vendor":"FA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Rich Cinnamon","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":10}],"reviews":[{"user":"Grfxman","text":"Found this recipe looking for Praline &amp; Cream recipes and am just blown away by this.
