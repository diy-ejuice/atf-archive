It's that exactly, a mother fucking hot tamale. Which means it's hot, so if you have a little pussy throat then don't mix this, 'cause it'll make you cry like a baby back bitch. To the real ones who have some hair on their nuts and like cinnamon candy, this one is for you.","steep_days":"1 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":4,"updated_at":"2020-12-12T14:05:21.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"1782","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Cinnamon Red Hot (no Pg)","flavor_id":"389","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Jelly Candy","flavor_id":"2170","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Sweetener","flavor_id":"339","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":500}],"reviews":[{"user":"ID10-T","text":"Well, that is almost 100% a Hot Tamale, right down to the sweet gummy candy body. There’s a little bit of a soapy off-note I get with jelly candy but it’s faint, intermittent, and mostly covered up with strong candy cinnamon. It is painful, not only to my “little pussy throat” but even to my mouth after vaping it for a bit, but I think that’s part of the attraction. Pleasure and pain have such a thin line between them. If you’re the kind of person who likes to hurt yourself just to feel something, this is a recipe for you. This is not a vape for people who eat Hot Tamales one at a time, it’s for folks who shovel them their faceholes by the handful. &#xD;\n","score":4},{"user":"Fear","text":"For a super simple mix this is actually pretty good. I give Matty a ton of crap in discord and was fully thinking I was gonna post up a 3 star review on this. Pleasantly surprised. Going to give it a 5 star on flavor and appeal. More like eating a Hot Tamale while chewing big red gum, which is interesting if you are into cinnamon candy.  If I were rating the terrible name and recipe description it would be a 2.
