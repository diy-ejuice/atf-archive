The rules were 5 ingredient all flavorah including sweeteners. I wasn't in a competition so I cheated and used a 6th ingredient being sweetness which is a sweetener of coarse and is purely by taste if you don't want to use it don't. It will be good with or without sweetener. This recipe is pretty good to me it tastes like frosted blueberry cake bites. This was just a quick good 5 ingredient all Flavorah recipe good after a shake but better after a 4 day steep.\r\nShout out to: Trevorxgage and his recipe Blueberry sweet rolls. He also did this challenge and came up with a recipe similar to this recipe go check it out Blueberry sweet rolls is the name.\r\n\r\nThe ingredients:\r\nBlueberry muffin flv- I really like the baked blueberry flavor in this concentrate but the muffin is pretty much non existent. It is also a pretty weak flavor overall but with that being said like it so I went up to 5% with it and I get a good baked blueberry flavor. This concentrate would be so much better if it lost the spice notes and just kept the baked blueberry flavor. \r\n\r\nPound cake/cupcake batter flv- this makes up the cake portion of the recipe and it does it well.\r\n\r\nFrosting/vanilla pudding flv- the vanilla pudding works with the frosting but it also helps the cake it mellows the cake notes and softens the frosting and binds them both together.","steep_days":"10 (SNV)","temperature":"420","recipe_score":4,"updated_at":"2020-12-12T20:29:21.000-05:00","best_vg":"75%","views":"2976","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Blueberry Muffin","flavor_id":"608","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":5000},{"name":"Cupcake batter","flavor_id":"2596","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Pound Cake","flavor_id":"4306","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Vanilla Pudding","flavor_id":"4433","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Sweetness","flavor_id":"4413","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":250},{"name":"Frosting","flavor_id":"4412","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1250}],"reviews":[{"user":"mlNikon","text":"The cake bite part of this mix is done perfectly! Very tasty. The blueberry is a little sharper than I feel it should be in a bakery and I don't know if  that is because the bb muffin is up too high or it needs another blueberry to help round it out. Overall it is very good, I mixed up a 30 ml of it and am vaping the whole bottle: which, if you knew me, you would know is pretty good.","score":4}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"57352","name":"Blueberry cake bites"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
