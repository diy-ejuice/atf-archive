You know, the ones with the gumball eyes? This is the bite with the eyeball in it.**\r\n\r\n**FLV Bubblegum** - an authentic bubblegum flavor that's less chalky than some other manufacturers' offerings.. I get some harsh throat from it standalone, but Vanilla Pudding and Marshmallow smooth that over nicely. \r\n\r\n**FLV Vanilla Pudding** - This soothing stuff makes a great base even without much of a steep. It tastes like a vanilla pudding cup, and those ice cream truck bars have much more in common with pudding than with actual ice cream. Kids don't know any better. They aren't looking for the perfect custard tones layered into crispy malty dairy notes in their all-natural preservative-free hand-churned ice cream made from the milk of Kentucky grass-fed holsteins and eggs from free-range chickens collected by Swedish virgins during a full moon and flavored with real Tahitian vanilla beans. Gods, that gets exhausting. Relax. Have some vanilla pudding. Enjoying this flavor lets you be a kid again. \r\n\r\n**FLV Lemonade** - Sweet, sugary lemonade. Definitely not freeze-squeezed, more like the Country Time, like something you'd buy from a kid with a lemonade stand. Blends in easily with the vanilla pudding to make one of those lemon-flavored ice cream cartoon heads. \r\n\r\n**FLV Marshmallow** - I want sleep on its pillowy deliciousness, just bury my face in there. It tastes more like an actual marshmallow than any of the other marshmallow flavors. In here, it eliminates any need for added sweetener, smooths over some of the rough stuff, and changes the mouthfeel and flavor of pudding into something more like soft-serve ice cream.  \r\n\r\n**FLV Cream** - Don't need a reason to use FLV Cream, only a reason not to. This recipes gives no reason not to. FLV Cream aka Frank's Red Hot does a great job of pulling all of this together and providing satisfying finish, without calling too much attention to itself.
