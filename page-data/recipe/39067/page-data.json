This is another example of how flavorah flavors seem to work well together because on the  third day steeping I feel it is such a good tasting Vape I would be lying if I said it would take longer to steep. I am still amazed at how good this was directly after shaking the bottle. This can definitely be vaped immediately but once the flavors have had 3 days to mesh and mold into one then its really good. Sweetness is just a super strong sweetener you sweeten to your preference.","steep_days":"3","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"total_reviews":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T20:31:58.000-05:00","best_vg":"75%","views":"2966","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Cupcake batter","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Biscotti","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":750},{"name":"Sweetness","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":500},{"name":"Sweet Coconut","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Macaroon","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Milk","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":750},{"name":"Milk & Honey","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1500}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"39067","name":"Milk and coconut honey cookies"}}}
