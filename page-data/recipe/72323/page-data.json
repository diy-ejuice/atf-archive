I didn't add sweetener but it didn't need it. It's very sweet on it's own. "},{"user":"goosegirl","text":"I enjoyed the overall flavor, but it was just too sweet for me.  I will make it again, but will leave out the Super Sweet."},{"user":"ianerb","text":"Into another 100ml of this. Very sweet, let it steep"},{"user":"BigFoot1","text":"I didnt get taste this at the 7 day mark. So its been 16 days steeping. So if anyone wants to know if it can hang in there for longer steep times. It most certainly can. Although i enjoy it. I get more vanilla than caramel just as picture would be. I read down the reviews and some say to add sweetner. It may make things pop more but I think its already sticky sweet. I give it 5 stars"},{"user":"ancient7","text":""},{"user":"bjorama","text":"I can't stop vaping this.  Excellent vanilla with caramel hanging on after the exhale.  Definitely a shake and vape.  Im not disciplined enough to let this steep!

Tastes dead on thanks !"},{"user":"nks","text":"fantastic taste but for my personal taste it needs 20 days steeping.good job!"},{"user":"KylezKloudz","text":"Great recipe! üëçüëç Nice, sweet and simply to the point... Mixed this up for the wife and I and we both love it! Great job!"},{"user":"cdaniell30","text":"I love how dark the caramel and vanilla in this end up tasting.  I love this exactly as it is, but if you want it to taste more like what's shown in the pic then CAP VBIC is probably the ticket."},{"user":"mlNikon","text":"Very tasty! For some reason, I thought I reviewed this already but I didn't. This is a very delicious mix!

Sweeter for maybe cap.super sweet 0.25% and drop the marshmallow &#xD;\nI didn't even let this steep it was good off the shake so it came to work with me!
