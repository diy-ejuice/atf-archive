I didn't add sweetener but it didn't need it. It's very sweet on it's own. ","score":5},{"user":"goosegirl","text":"I enjoyed the overall flavor, but it was just too sweet for me.  I will make it again, but will leave out the Super Sweet.","score":4},{"user":"ianerb","text":"Into another 100ml of this. Very sweet, let it steep","score":4},{"user":"BigFoot1","text":"I didnt get taste this at the 7 day mark. So its been 16 days steeping. So if anyone wants to know if it can hang in there for longer steep times. It most certainly can. Although i enjoy it. I get more vanilla than caramel just as picture would be. I read down the reviews and some say to add sweetner. It may make things pop more but I think its already sticky sweet. I give it 5 stars","score":5},{"user":"ancient7","text":"","score":1},{"user":"bjorama","text":"I can't stop vaping this.  Excellent vanilla with caramel hanging on after the exhale.  Definitely a shake and vape.  Im not disciplined enough to let this steep!
