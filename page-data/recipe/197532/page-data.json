What i taste after day 3 is only Tangerine-Lemon and a hint of Blueberry. I expected a good balance between the Blueberry, Pineapple and the Lime. Its still tasty and maybe a good remix but for my tastebuds not enough. Keep going!!"}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"197532","name":"Kendo ManðŸ€„ ( re-mix) pineapple, lime,blueberry "}}}
