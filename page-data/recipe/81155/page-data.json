I got the concept from the holiday pie they sell at McDonald's. It's nothing fancy, but damn is it good. That new custard is pretty much CAP V1 but without the sharp vanilla. If you sub it out here, this will still be good but it's not close to the same thing. The actual pie isn't full of vanilla, it's just an egg custard with sugar cookie and that's why this FA premium works wonderful in this mix. It fills out the INW and takes that dryness it has out and leaves you with a rich egg custard with a full body and buttery back note. If you like custard you need this new custard for sure","steep_days":"5","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:49:49.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"29515","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Custard Premium","vendor":"FA","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Cheesecake (graham Crust)","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Custard","vendor":"INW","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Sugar Cookie","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Biscuit","vendor":"JF","millipercent":500},{"name":"Super Sweet","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":500},{"name":"Vanilla Cupcake","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1000}],"reviews":[{"user":"Zugmaschine","text":"Good bakerie custard. Makes a big pop after the 10 days mark.  After 14 days the bakeries part, get strong. I love to add 1% INW Shisha Vanilla."},{"user":"Ayvaluv11","text":"The butteriness from the FA premium in this is superb! I Vape it every night and honestly can‚Äôt imagine going a day without it ! "},{"user":"Stephan","text":"Been mixing and enjoying this mix for long while... can't believe I haven't reviewed it.  Perd√≥name.  Definitely a 5 ‚≠êÔ∏è mix that hits all the right notes and satisfies!  Thank you for sharing your work @Gachatay "},{"user":"WalleBiela","text":"Wow wow wow. Today my wife said to me. Do you know what this is. And she shows me this 120 bottle of Holiday Pie made two moths ago. I loved it already then but wow. Now i'm mixin 250. A total superstar mix. Thank you."},{"user":"KylezKloudz","text":"Great custard/bakery/dessert recipe! I didn't have TPA Vanilla Cupcake so I used FLV Cupcake Batter and it turned out awesome! It gave it that sort of underdone gooey fresh from the oven/fryer taste. Great tasty custard recipe for all those custard lovers out there! üëäüòÅ"},{"user":"priest2705","text":"I don't often leave reviews. I don't necessarily feel that I pick out the nuances that others do, so I find it difficult to \"compete\" with some of the reviewers that I see. This juice prompted me to, at least, show the creator my appreciation. This recipe has sold me on Custard Premium and all of the love that it gets. I don't pick out all of the flavors and subtleties. What I do get is a flavorful vape, the sum of it's parts, so to speak. I definitely get the flavor of a holiday pie, although I've never had one. The most difficult part is waiting a week to partake after whipping up a batch"},{"user":"DumHed","text":"This is great even off of a shake, its crazy how that 1% vanilla cupcake gives that little bit of sprinkles to it. Overall an exceptional recipe, ive mixed 3 100mls of this and I rarely vape the same recipe twice. I often get fatigued from flavors pretty quickly, but not this one, full flavored and not exhausting."},{"user":"finsamson","text":"Just tried small batch after a few days steep, I couldn't wait very long. This is great. The lingering mouthfeel is incredible, so creamy and spot on, the closest mouthfeel to an actual food I've ever tried with vaping, especially a custard. Well done. I'll make a bigger batch and give it a longer steep as this is definitely a keeper and hopefully gets tastier with time. Thanks so much for sharing the recipe"},{"user":"MrBurgundy","text":"Chez! This is a killer recipe. I just love it. The custard comes off creamy and moist, while the cookie crust is pillowy soft. The vanilla cupcake in there sends it over the edge for me. It‚Äôs the perfect use of that flavor, and it‚Äôs actually really present at only 1%. It melds with the sugar cookie so well, and the icing note is exactly where it belongs. It definitely reminds me of those custard pies, only this is better. I can‚Äôt get enough of it. It‚Äôs my new obsession. This is probably my favorite custard recipe to date. Phenomenal job, my friend. You couldn‚Äôt have done better. Thanks so much for sharing!"},{"user":"Ebc88","text":"Very tasty. I know this is riddled with DAAP but it is so tasty that it is easy to overlook that. I don‚Äôt know how accurate it is to a Holiday Pie because I have never tried one"},{"user":"FizzChaser","text":"This is Excellent! This will easily become an all day vape for me. Great job Gachatay!"},{"user":"308_hobbiest","text":"This stuff is really great! I'm in the US so the fa custard premium was a bit hard to get but well worth the wait and effort."},{"user":"RdaJunkie","text":"Somehow this slipped past me last year and it wasn‚Äôt until all the talk on Facebook recently I found this beautiful creation. I‚Äôve never loved a custard off the shake this much before. If it‚Äôs this good on the shake I can‚Äôt imagine what a few weeks will do. Thick, rich and call me crazy but I can taste fucking sprinkles. 10/10"},{"user":"Cspicy","text":"This is by far the BEST custard recipe I have ever vaped!  No more Cap VC for me, this is the closest to how real custard tastes.  Thank you for a beautifully crafted recipe!"},{"user":"Demented76","text":"I got around to testing this today and it is absolutely delicious!  I am going to have to keep some of this on hand for the holiday season.  The real deal has way to many calories lol!  Excellent recipe."},{"user":"Zildjian","text":"Love love love this Receipe. So yummy. Tried after a week and it was very good. Let it sit for two more weeks for a total of three weeks and I can't put it down. "},{"user":"jbird","text":"Wow! This is an awesome custard. I love a thick, rich custard and this knocks it out of the park. I'm glad I bought a big bottle of Premium Custard. I already made another 240mls of this. Can't go wrong with sugar cookie, biscuit and graham crust. It makes a delicious vessel for the custard. Another great recipe!"},{"user":"kirstyla8","text":"I can only comment on this as a snv cause i only mixed it up today. I also used inw biscuit as a sub. Omg its delicious. Im glad i have enough of the concentrates to make a lot more. Thankyou so much for sharing this recipe. If you're thinking of mixing this, just do it. You wont regret it!&#xD;\nUpdate: this is my new adv, literally cant stop vaping this. I dream about this stuff its so good."},{"user":"Jerikorayne","text":"This is spot in my opinion I love the holiday pie Fa. premium custard was a good choice this is a nice recipe i will be mixing this again &#xD;\nGood job !"},{"user":"SweetPoisonKim","text":"Been vaping this for the last 4 days straight. I love it! Lovely blend of custards and the crust is well balanced too.
