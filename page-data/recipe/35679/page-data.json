FW Yogurt, CAP Creamy Yogurt and FA Madagascar Vanilla provide the backbone for a perfect yogurt base here. Feel free to change the fruit up in the recipe. In fact, I encourage you to experiment and come up with some wonderful versions of the yogurt. Here, I used INW Peach for a great Peach flavor at a low concentration. Give the mix two weeks to fully steep.","steep_days":"14","temperature":"420","recipe_score":0,"total_reviews":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-05T23:54:23.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"1128","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Creamy Yogurt","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Yogurt","vendor":"FW","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Madagascar (Vanilla Classic)","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Peach","vendor":"INW","millipercent":1000},{"name":"WS-23","vendor":"OTHR","millipercent":350}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"35679","name":"Peach Yumgurt"}}}
