I got this and 2 things popped into my head:\r\n1) This isn't the tobacco I was looking for\r\n2) This is a tobacco I should have looked for\r\n\r\nThis is a tobacco blend that is very aromatic and a great base for an analog cig. Problem is, its pretty wet, more of a cigar consistency with a cig taste. So I decided to dry it out a little. Oak wood does this very well. It also pulls the sweetness that I get from 7Leaves back a some as well, but its still there slightly. The oak blends nicely with the earthiness of 7Leaves as well. Most people feel that oak wood is a low % additive, and I feel a little different. It is underutilized and used too low. Once I got the oak wood in there, I wanted a little bit more wood notes and wood spice fits in nicely. It subtly adds a little more wood notes to the mix. The red burley is added to actually pull the 7Leaves into the wood a little better, and to add even more earthiness to the mix. \r\n\r\nThis ended up being a great analog cig for those looking for it. Its pretty aromatic and has that ash at the end of the exhale as well. Its got great flavor, so give it a try.\r\n\r\nGive it about a week for everything to come together. I feel around 4 days though is a good time to try it out and go from there. It seems to get drier as time goes by. I am finishing my 30mL of it right now, and it steeped for about 3 weeks.
