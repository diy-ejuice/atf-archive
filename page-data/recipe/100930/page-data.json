The  papaya, cantaloupe and dragon fruit  blend to make a bright vibrant, tropical  sweet base for this  smoothie.   The  vanilla, coconut  and  and meringue create the   milky  cream base with a touch of coconut on the finish. Rainbow sherbet is the glue that hold the creams and fruit together and at 2.4 is more of an additive then an actual prominent  flavor in the mix .   Koolada adds a note of coolness on the exhale which I really like with tropical flavor profiles .  This was made for a DIYDOWN under challenge  that required 7% papaya and  2.4% rainbow sherbet \r\n\r\nit is enjoyable as a Shake and Vape but the creams come forward and the the papaya settles down  after 5 - 7 days \r\nNOTE:   This would work in a low wattage  tank   or if mixed at 50/50 or   60/40  would be good in a pod  or a low wattage system very well and actually shines in these type of set up !!!   \r\nLOOKING for a group to learn about  mixing your own juice check out these groups and youtube channels  \r\nhttps://www.facebook.com/groups/diydownunder/\r\nhttps://www.diydownunder.com/ \r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/user/frank1360\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0xkeZFSG04","steep_days":"5","temperature":"0","recipe_score":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-10T13:45:24.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"1945","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Cantaloupe","flavor_id":"220","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Coconut Extra","flavor_id":"316","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Dragonfruit","flavor_id":"226","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Sweetener","flavor_id":"339","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":750},{"name":"Vanilla Bean Ice Cream","flavor_id":"186","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Koolada 10 Pg","flavor_id":"280","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":300},{"name":"Meringue","flavor_id":"176","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":750},{"name":"Papaya","flavor_id":"252","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":7000},{"name":"Rainbow Sherbet","flavor_id":"2312","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2400}],"reviews":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"100930","name":"Bahama Mamma Smoothie  - (winner of DIY down under challenge )"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
