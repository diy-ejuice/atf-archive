It is a super fruity and zero sweetener. The Cactus makes the vape super juicy with the slight hint of tart and sour to mess with your taste buds as you vape it. I used the Black Currant as a buffer to slightly enhance the Raspberry and it worked just right.. This is a nice SNV and it could be a daily vape.","steep_days":"1 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-04T21:24:24.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"1557","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Black Currant","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Royal Orange Juice","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1250},{"name":"Blood Orange","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1250},{"name":"Raspberry","vendor":"INW","millipercent":1100},{"name":"Cactus","vendor":"INW","millipercent":1100},{"name":"Tart and Sour","vendor":"LA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Coconut","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":200}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"92020","name":"Red is the new Orange"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
