His \"favorite juice of all time\" is called the Strawberry by Drip wich. Traditionally commercial juice, and cloning aren't *really* my thing, but I agreed to take a crack at the profile. I've no desire to actually clone the original, but the profile was at least potentially tasty so, why the hell not?\r\n\r\nThe Ice cream base here is shamelessly stolen from @eyemakepizza. I know it's not going to be the one in a commercial juice, but I wanted to make this decadent without falling into oversweet, and the ben and jerry's esque rich creamy concoction the pizza man put together is perfect for that.\r\n\r\nThe waffle base is pretty straightforward, both TFA belgian and FW waffle have holes in their overall profile. neither is quite right on their own, but by their powers combined you end up with a pretty accurate and tasty rendition of a lightly vanilla'd and slightly maple'd up waffle. maybe not as fluffy as a real Belgian waffle, but for the purposes of a breakfast treat being used as a sandwich around some ice cream and strawberry syrup it works quite well.\r\n\r\nThe strawberry combo is simple, INW shisha strawberry is a syrupy mess, strongly reminiscent in my mind of nestle's strawberry syrup. To boost that up, and give it a bit of body without venturing off into a full on strawberry Red touch works quite well to bring some balance to the whole ordeal.\r\n","steep_days":"0 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":4,"total_reviews":3,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:50:59.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"1834","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Vanilla Ice Cream","vendor":"LB","millipercent":5000},{"name":"Vanilla Swirl","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1500},{"name":"French Vanilla Icecream","vendor":"HS","millipercent":750},{"name":"Waffle (belgian)","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Waffle","vendor":"FW","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Red Touch (strawberry)","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Shisha Strawberry","vendor":"INW","millipercent":3000}],"reviews":[{"user":"nowar","score":"4","text":"If this had just a little more of a cakey feel, this could be a perfect strawberry shortcake to me. The richness of the ice cream with this really nice strawberry that doesnt come off as too sweet to me (im sweet sensitive) plays my mind into strawberry shortcake memories. I swear, i would swap out the waffle base and just find whichever wf cake combo to give that hint it needed to hit that spot. This is 99% there imo. In fact, I think I like this berry combo without the jf sweet in the mix with the heavier creams in a way more so than the trinity. It mitigates the sweetness which is clearly there with the ice cream and the ice cream washes away with the pull to leave your mouth coated in this nice solid SB flavor. And, I'm not even that big of a SB fan. "},{"user":"ID10-T","score":"4","text":"I think it might be hard to get anything using that ice cream trinity to taste anything less than pretty good. And this does taste pretty good. The strawberry part is perfectly effective. But at least one of those waffles, or the combination of them, has something just a little plasticky going on. There has to be a better way to waffle this up. "},{"user":"UnappreciatedRobot","score":"4","text":"I enjoyed this mix a lot. The combination of INW Shisha Strawberry and FA Red Touch do a fantastic job at selling a sweet syrupy strawberry. The ice cream trinity obviously is amazing and is a really good choice for this recipe. The only part I am having trouble with is the waffle. It definitely is not bad, I just feel as though its missing some sort of body. If something could be added to thicken up the overall waffle side of this recipe, I think it would be perfect. It has a lot to compete with since the strawberry and ice cream combo are pretty strong."}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"154703","name":"Dripwich++"}}}
