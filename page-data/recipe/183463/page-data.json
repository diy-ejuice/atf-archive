I went in with the usual \"unicorn-style\" set up (cream, custard, cheesecake, van bean ice cream and strawberry), and I added cookies... INW Biscuit and CAP Sugar Cookie go well together when you're looking for a good cookie mix. I added a little vanilla shisha (little goes a long way), because it's very tasty and it helps pop the VB Ice Cream and the Bavarian Cream. You can use other Sweet Strawberry's, like TPA Sweet SB or MB Sweet SB instead of Cap's. They all will give it their own twist, but very similar to using Cap's Sweet SB. I love MB's Legendary Custard. I actually prefer it over FA Premium Custard. This vape is really good, one of my favorites in constant rotation now. Steep AT LEAST 3 WEEKS! (Best around 4-5).","steep_days":"25","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T14:14:24.000-05:00","best_vg":"73%","views":"1032","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Cheesecake (graham Crust)","flavor_id":"152","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Sweet Strawberry","flavor_id":"121","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Strawberry (ripe)","flavor_id":"271","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Vanilla Bean Ice Cream","flavor_id":"186","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Legendary Custard","flavor_id":"10388","vendor":"MB","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Sugar Cookie","flavor_id":"115","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Bavarian Cream","flavor_id":"1187","vendor":"FW","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Shisha Vanilla","flavor_id":"841","vendor":"INW","millipercent":500},{"name":"Biscuit","flavor_id":"642","vendor":"INW","millipercent":2000}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"183463","name":"Pennywise Cookie Custard"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
