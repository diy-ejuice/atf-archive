Now that I have explained why I used the flavors, allow me to explain what roles they play in this recipe.\r\n\r\nI was going for a doughnut with toasted coconut powdered sugar topping and filled with raspberry cream.\r\n\r\nI have been eager to try zeppola for several weeks now and it was torture to keep reading all the raving about it and not having got to try it myself. At 4% Zeppola makes the doughnut without a question. Not overly yeasty, sweet and bready with a hint of cinnamon and powdered sugar.\r\nAnyone that knows me also knows that there is no other raspberry to consider than INW raspberry molina and at 1% it is noticeable but not overbearing. The only strawberry I had to compliment the raspberry was tpa organic strawberry which if I recall right is a vg based flavor. I overshot the median recommended percentage of the tpa organic strawberry due to the vg base but not too much as its only supposed to compliment the raspberry.\r\nZeppola already has a powdered sugar hint to it but I was worried that note would likely be drowned out by the cream choices I went with for the filling. I am new to OOO flavors but it was rumored that their powdered sugar might be used for the powdered sugar note that my favorite \"premium\" raspberry doughnut juice is (Hit That Juice Razzhole). 1% seemed a safe note as a smell test of it wasn't really a sweet aroma as I expected but definitely had an alcohol note.\r\nOOO toasted coconut is also a new one for me and based on smell alone I knew I should keep the % low as I got the faintest sour note on the sniff test.\r\nI love CAPs vanilla whipped cream as it is completely true to its title, real whipped cream with just the right amount of vanilla. I used it at 2% as its a lighter \"fluffier\" type flavor and I didn't want the custard notes I chose to make it too heavy in the cream department (if that makes any sense?).\r\nI m also new to WF but all of their flavors have been very well accepted so I got the few that most suited my usual mixes. The caramel butter at 1% and the vanilla ruyan custard at 2% just create this nice sweet caramel type custard with a nice balanced vanilla note and the combo just edges on buttery/greasy.\r\n\r\nRight after a shake and vape you get the dryness of the powdered sugar and the raspberry but the dryness that the powdered sugar creates seems to dry out/hide the cream notes and rather than that moist doughiness that you expect from a doughnut its more of a average cake type taste. I actually think it's the combo of the toasted coconut and powdered sugar that are making it \"dry\" initially. \r\nThis is going to require a steep of at least 2 weeks I would say to allow the custard and creams to wet down the powdered sugar note. By no means it is a bad vape at all but I can tell right off the bat that a steep is going to be necessary for this in its current form. \r\n\r\nBTW vaping this max vg 3mg nude nicotine salts smooth at 20 watts and 480*F with fused ss clapton (28g cores 38g wrap 3mm coil 7 wrap) on the hadaly at .9ohm.","steep_days":"14","temperature":"450","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-06T20:39:28.000-05:00","best_vg":"80%","views":"2183","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Zeppola","flavor_id":"6312","vendor":"FA","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Raspberry","flavor_id":"667","vendor":"INW","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Organic Strawberry","flavor_id":"2669","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Vanilla Whipped Cream","flavor_id":"1","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Vanilla Ruyan Custard","flavor_id":"6066","vendor":"WF","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Caramel Butter","flavor_id":"6046","vendor":"WF","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Powdered Sugar","flavor_id":"6522","vendor":"OOO","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Coconut Toasted","flavor_id":"1946","vendor":"OOO","millipercent":1000}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"32673","name":"Doughnanza"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
