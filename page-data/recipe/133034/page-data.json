Right,FLV Rich Cinnamon.1 drop per 30ml is enough to give it that nice,crisp cinnamon taste.\r\nHoly Vanilla is just here to fill it out a bit and to make it even more creamy,or less baked.Not like a cinnamon danish.\r\nThat's it,enjoy and leave review!\r\n","steep_days":"1 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"updated_at":"2020-12-12T20:30:39.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"2884","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Zeppola","flavor_id":"6312","vendor":"FA","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Funnel Cake","flavor_id":"4166","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Rich Cinnamon","flavor_id":"638","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":100},{"name":"Meringue","flavor_id":"530","vendor":"FA","millipercent":250},{"name":"Biscuit","flavor_id":"642","vendor":"INW","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Holy Vanilla","flavor_id":"2385","vendor":"DFS","millipercent":1000}],"reviews":[{"user":"Kittybit","text":"When I stumbled over this recipe, two warnings signs immediately flashed in my mind: The 1.5% INW Biscuit and CAP Funnel Cake, as INW Biscuit tends to get very dry and CAP Funnel Cake has a terrible habit of turning into play dough. But you know what? They oddly work great in this recipe! No dryness, no odd off-notes of play dough. It's a very enjoyable vape that had me vapin' it for two days straight.","score":5},{"user":"JAXXAN","text":"I have been looking for a churro recipe that I actually enjoyed for so long and this is absolutely it.
