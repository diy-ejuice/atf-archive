That's winning\r\nThe Vape Train Sweet Strawberry is present and seems to lay over the top of the mix very well so very impressed with my first use of it.\r\nIf you want to push the strawberry, drop the Yes, We Cheesecake and add 1% CAP Strawberries and Cream\r\nI'm going to expand this past a 321 I think, would do very well with a few add ons\r\nSee what you can come up with too...would love to see this worked with.\r\nGive this one a mix and a quick review if you have time, Thanks!\r\n\r\nThis recipe was tested and designed on the Haku single Clapton at .54ohms at 50W \r\n@s2k on ELR ","steep_days":"7 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"total_reviews":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T15:22:09.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"822","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Sweet Strawberry","vendor":"VT","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Vanilla Ice Cream","vendor":"LB","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Yes, We Cheesecake","vendor":"INW","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Super Sweet","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":500}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"194638","name":"Winning 3 2 1"}}}
