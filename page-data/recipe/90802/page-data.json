I hope she doesn't have an all the flavors account to see her fruit mixes name lmao!ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜ˆ Anyway all jokes a side this is a delicious simple bright fruit mix. Its great on a shake but perfect after a 24 hour rest. Nothing mind blowing here just a delicois mix that's not overly complex and a great shake and Vape!!! I used .25% Flavorah sweetness feel free to use a sweetener of your choice. This is not a mix that requires sweetener to taste good so totally a personal preference.","steep_days":"1 (SNV)","temperature":"420","recipe_score":5,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:50:00.000-05:00","best_vg":"75%","views":"3172","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Strawberry (ripe)","flavor_id":"271","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Juicy Strawberry","flavor_id":"8779","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Kiwi","flavor_id":"522","vendor":"FA","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Dragonfruit","flavor_id":"226","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":3000}],"reviews":[{"user":"cdaniell30","text":"It's hard for me to balance strawberry and kiwi exactly the way I want them to be in a recipe, and this comes pretty close to my ideal.
