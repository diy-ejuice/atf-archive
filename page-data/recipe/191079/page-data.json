I taste, while pleasant at this point it needs to pop. I add a little Super sweet and experiment with Caps Fizz pop. Give it one hell of a shake and boom, Golden Sparkles!!\r\n\r\nEnjoy!!\r\n\r\nI prefer vaping this on a recurve RDA at 50W 0.12ohm SST coil.\r\n\r\nSteep time 3 days. Good off a good shake though!\r\nSeriously if you like a solid recipe that works give it a go!\r\n\r\nCheers for reading this far, now go and get mixing!\r\n\r\n\"Together, Let's Discover!!!\"\r\n\r\nFacebook - https://www.facebook.com/groups/diydownunder/\r\nDiscord - https://discord.gg/kH4Fqbc\r\nYoutube - https://www.youtube.com/c/diydownunder\r\nWebsite - https://www.diydownunder.com/\r\nInstagram IGTV : @diydownunder","steep_days":"3","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"updated_at":"2020-12-12T11:53:31.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"1388","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Fizz Pop","flavor_id":"10291","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Golden Pineapple","flavor_id":"61","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Lemonade","flavor_id":"636","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Passionfruit SC","flavor_id":"10100","vendor":"WF","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Super Sweet","flavor_id":"2384","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":500}],"reviews":[{"user":"EyeM2sRus","text":"This is very tastey pip!
