This is the go to cheescake flavor that all other cheesecakes aspire to be and with FW Yogurt it is elevated even further. I have tried this recipe as is and swapped out strawberry for a variety of fruits such as blueberry, banana, and lemon. All with the same level of satisfaction as the last. This is a true \"plug and play\" recipe that just keeps on giving. I can't wait to try adding chocolates to the mix. Great Job!!"},{"user":"Scism","text":"Very easy recipe for a good cheesecake.  I prefer JF sweet strawberry at around 4% over the cap, but either way is good."},{"user":"alexmori","text":"The best strawberry cheesecake! I really tasted strawberry cheesecake instead of the usual strawberry with graham cracker or cream but not an actual cheesecake. This hit the nail on the head! Fantastic!"},{"user":"elsignor","text":"this is great, love this cheesecake. Dense and creamy on the inhale strawberries on the exhale with the graham note that stick in your mouth.&#xD;\nBest cheesecake for now."},{"user":"Gordo","text":"This is very easy and delicious.
