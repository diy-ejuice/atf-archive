Shake and vape certified.\r\n\r\nThis doesn't taste like an authentic blueberry tea, but rather like a sugary sweet ice tea that you buy bottled.\r\n\r\nBrief notes:\r\n**VT Bilberry Ripe** is my favourite blueberry flavor, it's more like a blueberry jam, but even though it's so jammy it has a very unique berry sweetness that I like a lot. It's also perfect for this recipe as the bottled ice teas usually are very sweet.\r\n**JF Blueberry**, another top shelf blueberry flavor. It's very similar to FA Bilberry, but better. It adds that tartness that the VT is lacking, together they give a very satisfactory blueberry flavor.\r\n**CAP Hibiscus** helps sweetens up the berries even more, and 0.75% is just the right amount to give a tiny bit of floral note to sell the tea vibe even more.\r\n**FLV Lemon Tea** adds a sweet black tea note, with a touch of lemon to it. We all know that a bit of lemon helps the blueberries pop, which is perfect here.\r\n**WS-23** is optional, it tastes great without it too. Use at your own preferred percentage. I like it at 0.5%, but some like it higher, some lower. If you are new to coolants I suggest you maybe go for 0.25%.","steep_days":"0 (SNV)","temperature":"420","recipe_score":5,"total_reviews":1,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:51:05.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"1111","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Bilberry Ripe","vendor":"VT","millipercent":1250},{"name":"Lemon Tea","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Blueberry","vendor":"JF","millipercent":500},{"name":"Hibiscus","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":750},{"name":"WS-23","vendor":"OTHR","millipercent":500}],"reviews":[{"user":"Vishousvapez","score":"5","text":"This recipe ha an awesome balance of the floral notes with the berries used ...
