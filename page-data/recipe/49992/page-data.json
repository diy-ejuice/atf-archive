Itâ€™s apparently some bright, tart strawberry licorice juice and for all I know this could be a perfect or near-perfect copy, or very likely even an improvement. Which would be an automatic five stars whether I like it or not, right? It hits the profile for sure and is a very good and tasty recipe, but I do get a little of that acetone-y chemical taste off the green apple."}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"49992","name":"ANML: Carnage REMIX [#REMIXMONTH]"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
