There was never any banana! And Bruce Willis was dead the whole time!\r\n\r\nI had never played with TFA Quince until recently, and realized its potential with the correct strawberry as it has a smooth and slightly over sweet flavor. The TFA Organic Strawberry was my first thought as it has a slightly tart taste to it that compliments and lightly tones down the Quince while adding light notes of banana while the INW Custard leaves a creamed distinct finish.","steep_days":"3 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T17:33:47.000-05:00","best_vg":"50%","views":"2006","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Quince","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2200},{"name":"Organic Strawberry","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":5000},{"name":"Custard","vendor":"INW","millipercent":2100}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"26911","name":"M.
