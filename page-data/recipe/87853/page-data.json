Use this at .5% so it does not overpower the mix.\r\nShisha Vanilla: Adds a nice sweet Vanilla Flavor to mix that blend very well to make the perfect Cheesecake a bit sweeter.\r\nCap Vanilla Custard V1: at .5% adds a nice Amount of body and eggyness to recipe to make it all round out. \r\nWhat you get in the end is a perfect Ny Cheesecake that is nice and not overly layered or complex and has the perfect Body of a real Authentic piece of Cheesecake. Mix this up and Enjoy, its absolutely delicious after a nice 3 day Steep.\r\nTaste good off the shake mixed at 70/30. If you want a fruit added to it feel free to make it. Works well as a Strawberry Cheesecake with 1% Shisha strawberry added.

I feel like a lot of cheesecake recipes have too much going on, and they never really come together.  This one is simplified quite a bit and hits the notes I want."},{"user":"cdaniell30","text":"This is delicious, but it reminds me of a chocolate cheesecake without the chocolate in it.  That's got my wheels spinning, so I'm mixing more of this and throwing some different chocolates at it to see what pokes the right spot."},{"user":"Kemmo","text":"Simple and delicious.
