I used a combo of TFA vbic and HS fvic for that ultra buttery and dense ice cream base. A touch of WF chocolate chunks brings just enough chocolate into the picture to be authentic but not distract from the real star of the show, FLV cookie dough. I had also tried a version using OOO cookie dough but the flavor was too dark for my liking and the chocolate note was too bitter and distracting. I hope you enjoy this as it is a profile I have been chasing for a couple of months and it certainly scratches that itch for me. If you are one of those unfortunate souls that gets pepper from tfa vbic, you can use liquid barns vanilla ice cream at 4% here.\r\n\r\nIf you want to know more about my recipe development process along with some other kick ass girls check out the Mixin Vixens.

Spot on profile too. "},{"user":"cdaniell30","text":"I love this recipe.  FLV cookie dough is one of my favorite concentrates, but sometimes it can be a bit too much as well.  The way you balanced it with the ice creams in this recipe dials that chewy dough down just enough that it's not quite as intense as biting into a stick of raw dough (which is somehow both heavenly and disgusting).  I had to sub HS Australian chocolate, but I used it lightly enough that it didn't really jump to the front of the profile...I wanted to see what the rest of the mix did with the cookie dough.  Fantastic recipe."}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"87429","name":"Cookie Dough Ice Cream!"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
