Now that I have that out of my system, I myself don't enjoy many tobacco recipes but I am digging this one more than most i have tried. It is ever so slightly sweet and nutty with stronger notes of vanilla and caramel. Then all brought together with an earthy authentic tobacco finish. If you fancy yourself a tobacco person or just enjoy tobacco recipes then please mix it up and let me know what you think.","steep_days":"7","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"total_reviews":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-06T20:44:32.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"1248","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Holy Vanilla","vendor":"DFS","millipercent":2000},{"name":"HOLY HOLY GRAIL RY4","vendor":"DFS","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Carrot","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Red Burley","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Smoked Butterscotch","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1000}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"134523","name":"\"Hop Scotch Cigar\""}}}
