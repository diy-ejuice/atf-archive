Although the recipe is not mine, the quotation marks in the title were added by me, because it doesn't really taste like a cheesecake to me. It tastes more like a most delicious graham cereal topped with kiwi. Don't be afraid of the high % of FA Meringue here; it does a lovely sort of dance with the tartness of the kiwi. Coop says only an overnight steep is required, but I liked it even more after three days.

Easily a 5-star recipe for me. I tasted this as a SNV and then again after 3 days, and although it really is great off the shake, Id10-t was right in saying that it is even better after a few days steep. For only 9% total flavoring, the flavor you get from this is insane.  FA Kiwi is a fantastic flavor and the FA Meringue balances it out very well. There is not really anything to compare it to since it really is not a cheesecake. The closest thing I can think of is a kiwi parfait without the yogurt."},{"user":"YippYo","text":"Surprisingly accurate for how simple it is. The kiwi really pops and the cheesecake note is actually pretty creamy. Everything works so well together in this recipe."},{"user":"beeker","text":"Do yourself a favor and mix this one. Buy the FA Kiwi if you need it, it's worth it and no substitution will do it justice. Just do it, you'll thank me later."},{"user":"NikosD","text":"Simple, tasty and well balanced indeed."},{"user":"Ebc88","text":"This is great plus to be only 3 flavors and little to no steep time makes this an easy ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è  The meringue &amp;cheese cake graham crust work very well together and then the delicious FA ü•ù just tops it off"},{"user":"nuff_vapes","text":"Really good simple 3 flavoured recipe.

As ID10-T says it's not your regular cheesecake but highly recommended."},{"user":"6retro6","text":"Perfectly balanced recipe, that meringue sits so perfect there together with the kiwi and cheesecake.
