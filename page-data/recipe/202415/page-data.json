With as much as it has going on, I only needed a couple berries to push into a bit of a new direction while still keeping the heart of the vape distinctly forest fruit. Wanting to get a little more saturated currant flavor up front, sweet currant was an easy grab. Blueberry juicy ripe is a flavor that I've beeen digging for awhile and it pairs nicely with the sweet currant. The dragonfruit is used at a 1 percent to add a little background note while also blending this whole thing into a tasty mixed berry profile. I like it with a quarter percent sweetener and mix every other 30ml with 1% ws23 but feel free to dress it up how you like.\r\n\r\nThis can be vaped off the literal shake and you will get a delicious currant and blueberry forward vape, 24 hrs and it starts to meld together.","steep_days":"1 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"total_reviews":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:51:41.000-05:00","best_vg":"80%","views":"584","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Blueberry Juicy Ripe","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1750},{"name":"Forest Fruits","vendor":"FA","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Sweet Currant","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Dragonfruit","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Super Sweet","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":250}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"202415","name":"Thicket"}}}
