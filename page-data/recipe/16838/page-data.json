I would lower strawberry to 2-3% or remove completely and up the cantaloupe and Honeydew and maybe add .5% Super Sweet. I gave a C+ in my notes."},{"user":"Friction2600","text":"pretty good, a fair sweet vape, exactly what i was looking for, thanks. imo it could use a touch more cantaloupe and honeydew melon. i have tfa cantaloupe so i'm not sure how much different mine would be from op, but still very delicious.
