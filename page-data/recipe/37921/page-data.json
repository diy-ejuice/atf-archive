This is a simple and authentic Lemon Meringue Pie, with a sweet gram crust.\r\n\r\ni'm vaping this on the 528 customs Goon with a dual-coil build at .13 ohm and at 72 watts.\r\n\r\nThe key is in using Cheesecake Graham Crust with Sugar Cookie. The graham crust adds the texture of the crust, and adds some body to the Meringue, and the sugar cookie adds flavor and makes the crust pop more. It doesn't come across as a cookie, but more as a sweet graham cracker crust.\r\n\r\nThe vanilla custard adds a good weight to the whole recipe, and the fresh cream helps hold down the egg flavor from overpowering the whole profile. Meringue was a no-brainer, and the lemon sicily comes through without being too sharp and tart.\r\n\r\nOver all, this vapes really smooth, and has just the right amount of sweetness. It really needs about 3-5 days steeping time, because the crust flavors are a little gritty/ cardboard texture. But, after a little steep, that texture fades and out comes a very distinct crust flavor on the exhale.\r\n\r\nThe inhale is a nice sweet meringue with a touch of lemon, and the hold gives you a nice tart/tangy lemon filling.\r\n\r\nIt all comes together for a nice balanced recipe without any added sweetener. You could probably add a little EM if you wanted. May balance the crust a little better\r\n\r\nWell, it's a great vape using common flavors, mix up a batch and let me know what you think!","steep_days":"4","temperature":"0","recipe_score":4.3,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:49:13.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"5165","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Lemon Sicily","vendor":"FA","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Vanilla Custard","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Cream Fresh","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Meringue","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Cheesecake (graham Crust)","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Sugar Cookie","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":4000}],"reviews":[{"user":"Boomdog07","text":"I will stay along the lines as the others. Lemon fades pretty quickly, not sure exactly how to combat that. It is wonderful day 2-7, before that I get a little overbearing lemon, after that the lemon dies out almost totally. Good recipe though and great for a quick bottle or 2 that you can blow through."},{"user":"DominicalDaze","text":"Great beginners recipe, tasty without a long steep. Only con is the lemon dies after about 2.5 weeks. Also I didn't get as much graham as I'd want on the first batch so I'm going to try 3% next time. Cheers!"},{"user":"HerrHut","text":"Very nice balanced recipe.  I like it a lot.  Thanks for sharing!"},{"user":"G8RH8R23","text":"Mixed this exactly to the recipe. Of course I tried it after a shake and it was good but it needed a steep. After 5 days it really does come together nicely. I get a great crust and the sugar cookie does a good job combined with the cheesecake.  The lemon cream is good but the lemon is a little muted for my taste. It just needs something to make the lemon really pop. Overall it's a great recipe and I'm really enjoying it. Thanks!"}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"37921","name":"Simplicity - A Simple Lemon Meringue Pie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
