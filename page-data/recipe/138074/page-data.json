It's pretty damn good... But I still feel it's missing a little something maybe it could be a bit thicker, Well After 2 weeks i revisited this Profile, and it worked fine the way it was , however i still wanted to tinker with it just a bit to get some more thickness. so lets talk about why i chose the flavors i chose:\r\n\r\nMy Cookie Stone - INW Biscuit Has a Flaky /buttery crust and feels light and airy with a small amount of texture i felt 1% was all that was needed for this stone. paired with CAP sugar cookie and WF Graham cracker crust SC , the  CAP Sugar cookie is a must IMHO in any cookie type profile it carry's a flaky and buttery note as well and was the highest % used in this profile @ 4% ...the WF GCC sc on the other hand was a little different than what  i expected , it had sweetness, texture and a waxiness that fit right into this mix and bridged my cookie with the filling, it gave the filling that Oreo like waxy sugar filling. i used it @ .44% and it slide right in there......\r\nOn to the Creamy filling , I Paired TPA Meringue, TPA Bav Cream and TPA Van Swirl , the meringue was used for its sweetness and grittiness and its slight vanilla taste,Van Swirl was used for that creamy Vanilla and Bav Cream was used for a darker vanilla note and thickness... i am really happy with \r\nthis recipe ... its very satisfying \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","steep_days":"5 (SNV)","temperature":"400","recipe_score":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-10T16:01:11.000-05:00","best_vg":"60%","views":"1387","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Biscuit","flavor_id":"642","vendor":"INW","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Sugar Cookie","flavor_id":"115","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Meringue","flavor_id":"176","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Vanilla Swirl","flavor_id":"189","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Sweetness","flavor_id":"4413","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":700},{"name":"Bavarian Cream","flavor_id":"145","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":250},{"name":"Graham Cracker Pie Crust SC","flavor_id":"10105","vendor":"WF","millipercent":440}],"reviews":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"138074","name":"Gowden OweeOh"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
