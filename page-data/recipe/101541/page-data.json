This was an accident, and clearly a mistake born of experimenting with flavors I hadn't ever used before. That being said, I'm very much enjoying it as is.\r\n\r\nWorth noting- this is using TFA Honeydew 1. I have no idea how Honeydew 2 differs, and I strongly suspect that the honeydew in this recipe is what pushes it over the edge into bubblegum territory along with the cantaloupe and fuji apple. For this reason I recommend sticking to Honeydew 1. I also personally enjoy the high percentage of WS-23 30%, but it should be great at any percentage you like.","steep_days":"2 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-10T13:45:25.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"1200","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Watermelon","flavor_id":"984","vendor":"LA","millipercent":5000},{"name":"Dragonfruit","flavor_id":"226","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1500},{"name":"WS-23","flavor_id":"8085","vendor":"OTHR","millipercent":1250},{"name":"Fuji Apple","flavor_id":"8456","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Honeydew","flavor_id":"238","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Cantaloupe","flavor_id":"23","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":3000}],"reviews":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"101541","name":"Melons and Bubbles"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
