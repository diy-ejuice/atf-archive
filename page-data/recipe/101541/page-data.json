This was an accident, and clearly a mistake born of experimenting with flavors I hadn't ever used before. That being said, I'm very much enjoying it as is.\r\n\r\nWorth noting- this is using TFA Honeydew 1. I have no idea how Honeydew 2 differs, and I strongly suspect that the honeydew in this recipe is what pushes it over the edge into bubblegum territory along with the cantaloupe and fuji apple. For this reason I recommend sticking to Honeydew 1. I also personally enjoy the high percentage of WS-23 30%, but it should be great at any percentage you like.","steep_days":"2 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"total_reviews":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T10:43:58.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"1192","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Watermelon","vendor":"LA","millipercent":5000},{"name":"Dragonfruit","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1500},{"name":"WS-23","vendor":"OTHR","millipercent":1250},{"name":"Fuji Apple","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Honeydew","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Cantaloupe","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":3000}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"101541","name":"Melons and Bubbles"}}}
