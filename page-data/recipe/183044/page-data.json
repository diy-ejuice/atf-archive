My only issue is the steep. After the suggested 5 days I felt it was weak. Set it aside for a month -- glorious. Try it"},{"user":"Ebc88","text":"Well balanced the 2% zeppola and 5% sc, created an excellent donut taste and texture, strawberry is spot on inw shisha works well as a stand alone. Cream/frosting combo is good as well. I did knock the super sweet down to 0.25% felt like 1% would been a bit much for me and my sweetness likings. Excellent job and thanks for sharing"},{"user":"jigsaw314","text":"Very impressed with this one. Description is on point - simple and delicious! 0.4% super sweet for me, and it was already great at 3 days. Will mix again.
