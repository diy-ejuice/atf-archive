You get delicious vanilla notes with a very light hint of caramel. Enjoy this after a meal or all day. It's perfect for a relaxing lazy Sunday.\r\n\r\nRecipe breakdown:\r\nThe body of the recipe is comprised of custard premium FA, vanilla pudding FLV which not only helps with the body, but also gives it the flan texture. Flan WF rounds out the recipe and adds a hint of light caramel. All delicious flans use condensed milk and what better condensed milk to use than PUR.\r\n\r\n####When choosing the vanilla, I went with the original holy vanilla DIYFS. It's perfect in bakery type recipes. \r\n\r\nFor the sweetener, I like sucralose FW for bakery type recipes. Adjust sweetener to your liking. At 0.6%, it's not overly sweet.\r\n\r\nThis is good right off the shake but after 3-5 days, it really comes together. I use this primarily in the Jenna, Recurve, and Reload S rda. Quad core fused clapton N80 (0.2 ohm range). 45 to 70 watts but you can push it higher.\r\n\r\nVG/PG ratio: 70/30\r\n\r\nBatman's (FOWTB) recent delicious e-liquid line release, was the inspiration for this recipe.\r\n\r\nPlease leave a review. Enjoy.","steep_days":"5 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"total_reviews":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-04T22:28:49.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"1271","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Flan SC","vendor":"WF","millipercent":1750},{"name":"Custard Premium","vendor":"FA","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Holy Vanilla","vendor":"DFS","millipercent":2750},{"name":"Sweetener (sucralose)","vendor":"FW","millipercent":600},{"name":"Condensed Milk","vendor":"PUR","millipercent":1750},{"name":"Vanilla Pudding","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":3250}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"166452","name":"Traditional Sweet Vanilla Flan : (Custard Premium, Pudding, Condensed Milk, Holy)"}}}
