After SFTing it I wanted to make a recipe that tasted like Andes mints. Then, I got some VT flavors, and after SFTing them decided to try using them to get the missing cream and chocolate.\r\n\r\nThis recipe will taste pretty boozy and not too pleasant for the first few days after you mix it. It's pleasant by three days and comes together a bit more after a week - the harshness of the mint fades away over time.","steep_days":"7","temperature":"420","recipe_score":0,"total_reviews":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T20:33:07.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"828","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Chocolate Mousse","vendor":"VT","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Super Sweet","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":500},{"name":"Devon Cream","vendor":"VT","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Creme De Menthe","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Vanilla Swirl","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1000}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"158880","name":"Altmint"}}}
