Turning a candy strawberry into more of a dark sweet strawberry jam? Butterscotch Ripple and Hazelnut got you, fam. Turning Sugar Cookie into a creamy, soft, and very buttery sponge cake?

Every flavour on the right place. Its not that i dont like bakery vapes in general, but the most are not the way i like them.&#xD;\nWhen i vaped this mix the first time, after 9 days of steeping, i was dancing the Tootsee Roll, like in the video. :-)&#xD;\nWell done, thanks a lot for this Recipe.","score":5},{"user":"humanpuck","text":"I should have reviewed this a long time ago.  I never really thought I'd like something like this, but boy was I wrong.  I just got through my 2nd 100ML batch.  This recipe is so well balanced between sweetness and buttery bakeriness.  This is actually the recipe that got me to buy CAP sugar cookie and I've since used it so many times.  The bakery base of JF Biscuit with the Cap Sugar Cookie tastes like a dream.  I'll use that combo again.  I wasn't sure how the TFA butter would taste, but man does it work well here.  The 2% FA Meringue is just a perfect amount to add the sweetness and the hint of creamy nuttiness from the FW Hazelnut just goes perfectly with it.  All in all this is a phenomenal recipe and it doesn't have nearly enough reviews.  Well done MR. T.","score":5},{"user":"nowar","text":"Can't believe I never left a review for this the way that I talk about it. Admittedly, I'm not much of a bakery guy, but I fell in love with this recipe. The description does NOT do it justice. I really do like sugar cookie though, but have always found it needed some help, I just never knew what, nor had the patience to try things out. In comes Tootsee roll. There's stuff happening here, and all of it is good. Bisquit, Butter and meringue. Hot damn! This is the kind of simple mix that I think new mixers should try. It's completely stealable, swappable, and inspirational. i wouldn't even exactly call it a light fluffy cake, but it's the cake i want. Sweet and rich with a bit of gooey and tooth too. And I never get tooth off a vape, so it triggered that receptor in my brain. I liked Amalfi and Amity from Bigglesworth when I was buying commercial liquid and now, this takes its place. Also, works very well in mtl setups with full flavor. I HIGHLY recommend this one as a learning tool, pleasant dessert, or strawberry lovers (because that part was super well done too, if covered by other reviews). Real star for me is that cookie turned cake base. Fricken lovely, ID. 6 out of 5","score":0},{"user":"Ebc88","text":"This was really tasty stuff while i could taste it. I brought it to work with me today. Was super delicious on the way to work Strawberry was coming through everything seemed well balanced. Then after lunch all i can taste is a creamy sweetness and butteriness. Its my first time mixing with JF strawberry. So maybe i go blind to it after vaping it for a few hours. ","score":5},{"user":"CatWillMew","text":"This is a really well-constructed recipe.  The sugar cookie and butterscotch ripple highlight the strawberry really well.  The butter (I think) adds kind of a creamy note to it.  It's also kind of a rollercoaster ride as it steeps...at the recommended steep time you'll still be getting more of the biscuit, but the longer it goes the more the flavors blend together (in a good way).  I actually think this stuff is best with a month+ steep if you have the patience.","score":5},{"user":"fcomputerg","text":"finally a real strawberry that's not a dull mess after 4 weeks..

This is ridiculously delicious, as it was one of the first recipes that allowed me to taste Strawberry.  For all the other Strawberry non-tasters out there, try this recipe!","score":5},{"user":"mlNikon","text":"This is a beautiful mix Dave! Absolutely lovely. I love how the hazelnut and butterscotch ripple mingle with the stb and the biscuit and sugar cookie just dance together. I will probably be mixing this again and you know what that means.","score":5},{"user":"PerennialPhilosopher","text":"Accurate to description, delicious all day quality!
