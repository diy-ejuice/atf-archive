I enjoyed using FA coconut but I never was able to get a good mix that featured coconut. I cannot stand TPA's coconuts so I never wasted my time with those. I recently ordered a 5ml of FLV sweet coconut and fell in love, thus spawned this recipe. Here's some notes:.\r\n\r\nThis is another recipe that kind of just built itself, the flavors just make sense and the result is great. Shake and vape ADV for me.\r\n\r\nI saw a post about someone saying they get a coconut taste from graham crust. I'm not sure I get it too but the bottle does smell a bit like coconut. I decided to throw it into this recipe and it just works.\r\n\r\n**FLV Sweet Coconut** a stellar flavor. Before this I couldn't make a coconut vape that I found enjoyable.  I mixed it at 2% solo and it tastes like coconut milk, it's just creamy and delightful coconut. Reminds me of coco lopez. I threw some other things in here just to help it become even more decadent. \r\n\r\n**FA coco** a nice coconut that's light and reminds me of coconut flakes, threw it in to backup the FLV\r\n\r\n**FA Cream Fresh** adds some light cream to the body of the milk. Really fits here nicely, I tried to use Holy Vanilla or Vanilla Swirl here but this works better imo.\r\n\r\n**TPA Bavarian Cream** so I tried this with a couple ingredients like FLV vanilla custard (1%) and CAP VBIC (1%) but Bavarian cream is the answer. Its got a light brown sugar or what some describe as maple nuance which I'm attributing to the Cyclotene in it. A bit of vanilla from the BC also just shines here. Works very well with the coconut to thicken up the milk and compliment it so perfectly.\r\n\r\n**FA meringue** An additive, this recipe doesn't need help being sweet but meringue definitely helps this come across as thick sweet as fuck coconut milk.\r\n\r\n**TFA cheesecake graham** kind of an additive, any higher and it would take away from the milk but its a perfect counterpart for everything else going on. Contributes to the body of the recipe, to me its like 50/50 on the graham vs cheesecake.\r\n\r\nI mix this at 65% VG feel free to go up to 75%, shake and vape is awesome and it just gets better over the first week. \r\n\r\nIf you want it sweeter I recommend erythritol (0.5%) but you can use your favorite sweetener or a drop of TFA marshmallow per 30ml helps sweeten things up too.","steep_days":"5 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":4,"updated_at":"2020-12-12T11:50:48.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"38809","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Sweet Coconut","flavor_id":"605","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1750},{"name":"Coco' (coconut)","flavor_id":"416","vendor":"FA","millipercent":750},{"name":"Cream Fresh","flavor_id":"540","vendor":"FA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Meringue","flavor_id":"530","vendor":"FA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Bavarian Cream","flavor_id":"145","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Cheesecake (graham Crust)","flavor_id":"152","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1000}],"reviews":[{"user":"Jroc","text":"If you’re interested in coconut, I highly recommend this. If you vape it right away, it taste just like coconut water then it gets more creamy as you let it steep. This is one of my favorite vapes of all time.

This is absolutely delicious!  Thanks for sharing this recipe Hash.","score":0},{"user":"SeLeV","text":"I guess I'm an outlier, here. Even after a good steep, this feels immensely drowned in Bavarian Cream and it doesn't shine to me as a custard or especially not what I know coconut milk tastes like. Nevertheless, it's still somewhat enjoyable, and I commend the craft that went into this recipe,","score":3},{"user":"NikosD","text":"I didn't enjoy it much as SNV but after 5-7 days the flavour is way more rounded, satisfying and I would say intense.","score":5},{"user":"beeker","text":"I hate most things coconut related. The exception was when I went on vacation to St. John's island in the Carribean, and I was presented with a coconut that had been sliced open so that I could enjoy the smooth, subtle sweetness of the milk within. That's what this tastes like. Top marks. ","score":5},{"user":"kettle","text":"It is impressive from the first vape, but more importantly it stays enjoyable once you've become familiar with it.  This, along with the low percentages, making it a true ADV.  Its realistic! Great recipe.&#xD;\n","score":5},{"user":"RuntDastardly","text":"Such a beautiful recipe! An excellent \"cream\" for warm weather, when custards can feel like too much, though I don't want to limit this one to a season. It's great anytime! So smooth and satisfying; a perfect ADV.","score":5},{"user":"horrend","text":"Straight off the shake and for the first few days I got nice coconut and a lot of graham from the TPA Cheesecake (graham Crust). I think I may just have a shitty palette that picks this out. 5 days in and now I think I'm tasting what everyone else is: it's thick, it's creamy, it's delicious!","score":5},{"user":"Arasal","text":"New ADV for me.

No coconut candy here, no suntan lotion here - this is the real thing. An absolute winner for me.&#xD;\nSo, I subsequently added 1.0 % MF Coffee and 1.0 % WS-23 (30%) for the most sublime iced coffee.","score":5},{"user":"ObiWanCannoli","text":"Awesome recipe! 5 stars all the way. Pretty good off the shake but this is excellent after 3-4 days once the creams start to thicken up and the the tiny bit of harshness I get dissipates. This reminds me of a certain thick and creamy coconut water with small coconut chunks  I get sometimes. A bit linear to be an adv for me but I would like to test this out with a small addition of FLV Mango or some TPA Jackfruit. Great job on this one!","score":5},{"user":"wadeyloops","text":"This deserves a 5 star rating for realism. I added some VT Jam it to this on a whim and it caused an interesting bend. The recipe as is can also be used as a stone for other mixes requiring coconut for an excellent head start towards your creations, so if you are into crafting this is a worthy color for your pallet.

This is a sweet, creamy and accurate coconut cream, I think the addition of the cheesecake GC was a great choice here.

Worked great with a drink too which surprised me as it's usually fruits or tobacco. &#xD;\nWill def be mixing more of this. Thanx","score":5},{"user":"coop34","text":"I can finally enjoy coconut! This is a pleasant vape, light but full tasting. Very satisfying! I have now gone thru 100ml, and will be mixing another 100ml. Good job Hash!","score":5},{"user":"ConcreteRiver","text":"Excellent stuff.  Smart mixing, and really dead on to profile.  Accurate coconut milk, all the way. I've noticed this works better for me in a high-resistance, low wattage setup.  It can get a tad buttery at higher wattages with a lot of air, I think it does a much better job staying creamy in a more sedate kind of setup.  Overall pretty great.","score":5},{"user":"ID10-T","text":"Hell, yes! In a word, this recipe is SATISFYING. I love coconut vapes. Something like half of my recipes have coconut in there. But I never would have attempted or assumed I would enjoy a straight up-coconut milk vape. The coconut flavors we have just didn't seem built for that. I was wrong. This has all the right things and none of the wrong things. Tastes like coconut milk with some coconut cream added in and is very natural, none of that suntan oil or even snow-cone flavor. It's rich and sweet but not too rich or too sweet and a smooth, easy vape. ","score":5},{"user":"HerrHut","text":"Wow. SNV is good. After an overnight steep it's magical. I love it! Thanks!","score":5},{"user":"bhamcatmaybe","text":"this shit is wild, nothing like other coconut creams i've attempted. very smooth, very realistic. great moutfeel, perfect amount of sweetness. i can't thank you enough for this recipe- i've been looking for something like this ever since i started diying. flv's sweet coconut is the star, and a grand addition to my stash. i didn't let it sit more than 48 hours before i tried it- was too hard to wait, and it's baller even before 5 days, i fucken love it. ","score":5},{"user":"Deejay_mills","text":"Very solid and delicious even as a shake nd vape. I added .25% inw marzipan because i love that flavor and this profile screamed at me for it. Such a nice easy to vape recipe and I could see myself vaping for hours and not getting tired.
