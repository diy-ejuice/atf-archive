It is a very unique Flavor. When i found this flavor it ended up being my ADV for a year. Then the company that made it stopped selling juices so i decided to try and clone it. I think this is 99% cloned. The only reason i don't say 100% is because I don't have the original to test against. This is a Max VG mix because the original is a 90/10 so I make it that way. It is very good after 3 days so mix it up and enjoy.","steep_days":"3","temperature":"450","recipe_score":4.3,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:49:46.000-05:00","best_vg":"90%","views":"3414","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Cactus","flavor_id":"647","vendor":"INW","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Jackfruit","flavor_id":"240","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Super Sweet","flavor_id":"2384","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":500}],"reviews":[{"user":"Sublimeice","text":"I like this a lot. I mixed at 70/30 and its still really good.  Pretty good as a SnV too.&#xD;\n&#xD;\nThe addition of FW Blood orange at 1% makes this juice like Noms X2 Cactus Jackfruit Mandarin flavor, Use TPA's Mandarin to really get that flavor profile"},{"user":"Ceedge","text":"Mixed this up about a week ago and thought it was pretty tasty. A friend tried it out of my tank and promptly stole the bottle. Will have to mix more of this simple yummy recipe.    "},{"user":"boomshankr","text":"Delicious fruity vape. Should be good with a little bit of cooling."},{"user":"cdaniell30","text":"So, I have a thing about INW cactus...but in this mix with the jackfruit I'm really liking the flavor.
