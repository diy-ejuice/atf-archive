Its a delicious full bodied juicy mango - with a purple black currant finish. Oddly these two fruit belong together. You are going to need a smidge of Super Sweet to in this combo - trust me. It works very well. \r\n\r\nPotential applications:\r\nIce cream - Perhaps something like LB Vanilla Ice Cream\r\nCocktail - look for a white rum, or vodka base\r\nIce Lolly - Bang some ws23 in here, and you are going to have a party\r\n","steep_days":"1 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-11T13:45:17.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"1382","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Mango","flavor_id":"1659","vendor":"FE","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Black Currant","flavor_id":"10086","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":5000}],"reviews":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"139953","name":"Layerz - Purple Mango"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
