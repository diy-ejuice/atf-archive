I've lowered the % on the FA Cream since it was first posted . \r\nThe raspberry adds a subtle bump to the strawberry and helps it stay in front of the dairy flavors. Alternatively, FA Pomegranate at 0.3% to 0.5%  will be more than happy to act as a substitute kicker. Recommend aging for 5-7 days.\r\n\r\n","steep_days":"7","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:48:39.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"2594","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Cream Fresh","vendor":"FA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Malted Milk (conc)","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Meringue","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Raspberry (sweet)","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Strawberry (ripe)","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":5000},{"name":"Sweet Strawberry","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":5000},{"name":"Marshmallow","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1000}],"reviews":[{"user":"s2k","text":""},{"user":"nowar","text":"This is one of the very first juices I'd mixed that I really liked. Mixed up a batch on xmas '17 and wasn't into it at first. I put it aside after a few days and it sat in the drawer for another month. While some of the pink has faded, I loved this mix. Not sure what the magic was, but it crept up on me, kind of slapped me around. I think the SB faded a bit and let the raspberry really shine like the hunker that it is, like a solid reach around. I'm writing this now, a solid 7 months later and -- guess what -- yup I found the last 10 ml of this sitting around daring me to mess with it like that tramp you know you can have a wild romp with every now and again. So here I am, the morning after, with no regrets. You should try it some time, have your turn at it."}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"307","name":"Pink Panther Milk"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
