It's by no means a clone but rather an inspiration taken from the days of using low power mods and MTL atomizers (Vamo v5 and Nautilus).\r\n***\r\nI love the combination of various custards with CAP Cake Batter and there's nothing I can do about it. Tobaccos are not too bold but still quite noticeable even after two weeks of steeping. Thick caramel tobacco custard with some SPICE!\r\n***\r\nFor those who want less tobacco but more caramel can simply drop the HS Ry1 and increase HS Ry4 percentage up to 4% or use your preferred Ry4.
