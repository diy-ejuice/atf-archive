It might need a lil more tweaking but it's pretty damn good now... Used MB Strawberry Milk for the ground work since it's basically a one shot, and everything else is to support and build up the rest of the recipe...\r\n\r\nI think some WF Cookie Butter could turn this into a nice cereal milk (maybe with an add of a lil custard) just cause I put this over some of Silky's Cookie Crumble Custard https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/188966 and it showed alot if promise to going into a cereal milk... Idk 🤪 experiment at your own expense... It's DIY mofos! Either way hope y'all enjoy... And atleast keep on mixing and keep the community alive! 👊","steep_days":"5","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"total_reviews":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T19:16:34.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"685","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Strawberry Milk","vendor":"MB","millipercent":8000},{"name":"Strawberry Sweet","vendor":"JF","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Cream Milky Undertone PG","vendor":"OOO","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Super Sweet","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":500},{"name":"Dairy/Milk","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2000}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"200689","name":"Strawberry Milk"}}}
