It might need a lil more tweaking but it's pretty damn good now... Used MB Strawberry Milk for the ground work since it's basically a one shot, and everything else is to support and build up the rest of the recipe...\r\n\r\nI think some WF Cookie Butter could turn this into a nice cereal milk (maybe with an add of a lil custard) just cause I put this over some of Silky's Cookie Crumble Custard https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/188966 and it showed alot if promise to going into a cereal milk... Idk ü§™ experiment at your own expense... It's DIY mofos! Either way hope y'all enjoy... And atleast keep on mixing and keep the community alive! üëä","steep_days":"5","temperature":"0","recipe_score":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-12T17:13:25.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"696","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Strawberry Milk","flavor_id":"10387","vendor":"MB","millipercent":8000},{"name":"Strawberry Sweet","flavor_id":"4745","vendor":"JF","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Cream Milky Undertone PG","flavor_id":"6539","vendor":"OOO","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Super Sweet","flavor_id":"2384","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":500},{"name":"Dairy/Milk","flavor_id":"2164","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2000}],"reviews":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"200689","name":"Strawberry Milk"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
