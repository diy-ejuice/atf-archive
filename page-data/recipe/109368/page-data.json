They are simple and the key thing that differentiates them from pancakes (besides being thin) is butter. Crepes use a decent amount of melted butter right in the batter. \r\nThis is a sweet and light mix. The crepe itself is light and subtle and raspberry filling is more like a compote that you added some fresh strawberries and raspberries to. It is decent as a shake n vape but for best results, give it a week to come together more.\r\n\r\nCrepe (SC) (WF) 2% / Butter Tart (SC) (WF) 0.5%:\r\nCrepe WF is an excellent flavor, its light, slighting doughy, with a hint of spices. Its lacking a bit however so the Butter Tart is there to back it up. Butter Tart smells funky out of the bottle, its not a great smell to be honest but it is a solid flavor in low dose for its use here. Since crepes are buttery, and Crepe WF isn't, the Butter Tart is used to add the butter and backup the spices a bit more. Thank you RageIsALotOfWork for turning me on to this flavor!\r\n\r\nRaspberry Shisha (INW) 1.5% / Sweet Strawberry (JF) 1% / Milk & Honey (FLV) 0.5%:\r\nI struggle to taste raspberries the same way many cant taste strawberries. Please feel free to try this with other raspberries if you have one you favor more. The combo of raspberry and strawberry here is mainly there to help my taste buds pick up the raspberry more and make it pop a bit. The Milk and Honey is being used to slightly cream up and sweeten the fruits so it is more of a compote instead of just fresh fruit. Its also being used to sweeten the crepe a bit.\r\n\r\nMix it up and let me know what you think!\r\n#mixinvixens","steep_days":"5","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T09:44:35.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"1123","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Butter Tart SC","flavor_id":"8360","vendor":"WF","millipercent":500},{"name":"Crepe SC","flavor_id":"8365","vendor":"WF","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Milk & Honey","flavor_id":"609","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":500},{"name":"Shisha Raspberry","flavor_id":"836","vendor":"INW","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Strawberry Sweet","flavor_id":"4745","vendor":"JF","millipercent":1000}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"109368","name":"Episode 1: ExclusiveGirl's Raspberry Crepes #mixinvixens"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
