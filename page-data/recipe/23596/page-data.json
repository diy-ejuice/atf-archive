Im very happy with it, tastes like left over fruit loops milk. Could still probably be refined, percentages might be to high for some peoples taste. So feedback always appreciated. I went all out on trying to go for that cereal milk taste with the HAZELNUT ALMOND MERINGUE and CREAM FRESH. Not sure how necessary the BERRY CRUNCH is, was trying to get a bit more dry crunch but don't know how much effect it had over all. I actually used FRUITY RINGS but couldn't find it in the drop down menu. FRUITY RINGS is a great flavor, at high percentages it's super grainy or you can turn it down and put it behind a bunch of cereal milk to really enhance it's unique cream profile. \r\n\r\nThanks :)\r\n\r\n","steep_days":"7","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T15:20:24.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"1640","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Almond","vendor":"FA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Berry Crunch","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Cream Fresh","vendor":"FA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Fruity Flakes","vendor":"FW","millipercent":5000},{"name":"Hazelnut","vendor":"FW","millipercent":500},{"name":"Marshmallow","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Meringue","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Vanilla Bean Ice Cream","vendor":"FW","millipercent":3000}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"23596","name":"Hooks and loops (so original) "}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
