Initially I find the custard to be too strong but with repeated vaping the custard mellows on my tongue. The result is flavor pretty close to legit powdered strawberry quik milk. For my tastes, it‚Äôs not exactly what I‚Äôm looking for. I just taste custard too strongly I think. Might be worth halving the custard and adding in vanilla swirl or replacing it all together with vanilla swirl. Really solid flavor though as is and might be what someone is looking for.","score":4}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"76485","name":"Strawberry Quik"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
