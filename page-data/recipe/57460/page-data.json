So I went back to the drawing board, and wanted to create something that was more than just a one-off. In this one, we focus more on the tart fruit flavours instead of the cream to create a refreshing vape with enough brightness that'll work not only as an ADV, but also as a nice palate cleanser. Let's get into it.\r\n\r\nFA Pear / TPA Pear - you already know this combination works. The FA Pear brings the juicy sweet notes, while the TPA Pear helps make it more accurate and multidimensional. In previous versions of Green Cream, this was the focus for the flavour, but in this one, it works more as the base for the rest of the concentrates to work with.\r\n\r\nINW Anton Apple / INW Lime - this pairing really makes this recipe feel green. It also pushes this one more into a tart fruit vape with hints of cream, as opposed to a cream vape with fruit notes. These two flavours are super potent, and the percentages used give us a really crisp green apple with that tart bite you get from lime juice. INW Lime is one of the most accurate lime flavours I've ever tried, but it's incredibly potent. Keep this shit low, even if you want it to be up front in a mix. Even at 0.25%, we get a strong punch of lime juice with a hint of the bitter rind note.\r\n\r\nFLV Cream - this is our base for the cream, because this flavour really works as a neutral vessel for the the other flavours to hang out in. The best part about FLV Cream is that it imparts a velvety mouthfeel without any odd notes you get from other \"mouthfeel\" cream concentrates.\r\n\r\nTPA Marshmallow / HS French Vanilla Ice Cream - I love the sweetness that TPA Marshmallow brings to the table. On it's own, however, it is easy to lose in a recipe that is so tart as this one. We're using it high to help combat some of the bitter notes from the lime, while accentuating the sweetness of the pears and apple. Furthermore, it helps add even more cream and sugar notes to the end result. Using HS French Vanilla Ice Cream is simply here to give the cream base more flavour, without really pushing it too much into a full on ice cream vape. If you want more of that cream note in this recipe, I'd recommend leaving HS FVIC where it's at, and then adding some TPA Vanilla Bean Ice Cream in at maybe 1.5%\r\n\r\nSteep Time - this recipe is a little strange right off the shake. I can really only describe it as tasting similar to what a citrus cleaner smells like. It has some funky off notes coming from the INW Lime, but let it sit for at least three days, and the creams and TPA Marshmallow come in to mellow out those bitter off notes. What we're left with after three days is a really tasty and bright fruit recipe with hints of sugar and cream. However, if you're impatient, it's not horrible as a shake and vape. Just needs those few days to really let the flavours get to know each other.","steep_days":"3","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"updated_at":"2020-12-12T20:29:21.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"2088","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Pear","flavor_id":"411","vendor":"FA","millipercent":2250},{"name":"Pear","flavor_id":"257","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":750},{"name":"Anton Apple (yc)","flavor_id":"737","vendor":"INW","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Lime","flavor_id":"662","vendor":"INW","millipercent":250},{"name":"Cream","flavor_id":"604","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1250},{"name":"Marshmallow","flavor_id":"332","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"French Vanilla Icecream","flavor_id":"2129","vendor":"HS","millipercent":300}],"reviews":[{"user":"CatWillMew","text":"I really like this.
