I added INW Banana to help out the banana profile a bit and I feel for the real banana heads out there that both banana cream and INW banana can be upped .5%\r\n\r\nThe Creme De Menthe to me is perfect, it's not overpowering mint, but it's there.  It makes this recipe cool and refreshing.  If you want a stronger mint experience you can add 1% more of Creme De Menthe or menthol of your choice.","steep_days":"14 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-06T14:06:44.000-05:00","best_vg":"80%","views":"1594","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"French Vanilla Deluxe","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":4500},{"name":"Cheesecake (graham Crust)","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":4500},{"name":"Vanilla Custard","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":6000},{"name":"Banana Cream","vendor":"LA","millipercent":3500},{"name":"Creme De Menthe","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Super Sweet","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":500},{"name":"Banana","vendor":"INW","millipercent":500}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"26516","name":"Dirty Banana"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
