It made me decide to do my own variations of it by adding more things I like.\r\n\r\nI really like (FA) Passion fruit as it is a solid mix of passion fruit FRUIT and passion fruit JUICE without that 'off' or 'Over ripe' taste that some Passion fruit has. Its  'Clear' flavor and blends well with other vibrant fruit without dropping down unto the profile.\r\n\r\nThe rest was based on ID10Ts recipe and I added my preferred additives.\r\n\r\nSubbing Note:\r\nI have subbed the (FA) Passion fruit with (VTA) passion fruit (In my Passion Twist (V2) and definitely prefer the (FA). The (VTA) adds a over intense taste and the profile is not as realistic as (FA) is. its also much harsher and needs something to mellow it out further.\r\n\r\n","steep_days":"4 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"total_reviews":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T09:44:46.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"2173","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Oba Oba","vendor":"FA","millipercent":400},{"name":"Fizzy Sherbet","vendor":"VT","millipercent":3500},{"name":"Lemon Lime","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Passion (passionfruit)","vendor":"FA","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Super Sweet","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":250},{"name":"WS-23","vendor":"OTHR","millipercent":500}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"120633","name":"Passion Twist (v1)"}}}
