Love the profile but most Fruit Loops flavors miss the mark. I wanted a super simple one that didn't taste of lemon pledge or consist of 10+ flavors.\r\n\r\nFW Fruit Rings - Best Fruit Loops flavor I've tried. Not overly lemon but a great and authentic cereal flavor. I'm not a huge fan of FW in general but they knocked this flavor out of the park; puts TFA's version to shame. This flavor has that sugar coating we all use FA Meringue for but lacks in the dry cereal flavor.\r\n\r\nFA Breakfast Cereal - A really good Kix type dry cereal. This one isn't as \"dark\" as Cap Cereal 27 but this flavor excels with the lighter dry cereal flavor with no cardboard notes. FA did a really good job with this flavor. Brings the dry cereal notes that FW Fruit Rings is lacking.\r\n\r\nPUR Condensed Milk - I really only added this to bring a light milk flavor to the profile as most people prefer it with a milk flavor. The original one I made didn't have this in it and it was still awesome. I wanted to keep it to one more flavor so I chose PUR Condensed Milk to fill that roll. This brings a light milk flavor but it does the job. You can feel free to completely omit this flavor or add your prefered milk base but this flavor is worth picking up.\r\n\r\nGive this 3-5 business days to sit as FA Breakfast Cereal needs some time to make the mix crispy. If you don't the flavor will not really be there and the mix will taste lacking. The lemon flavor from the Fruit Rigns calms down a bit also.","steep_days":"5","temperature":"400","recipe_score":5,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:49:42.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"1836","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Fruit Rings","vendor":"FW","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Breakfast Cereals","vendor":"FA","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Condensed Milk","vendor":"PUR","millipercent":2000}],"reviews":[{"user":"CygnusY1","text":"This is the best Fruit Loops recipe I've tried so far. Funnily enough, FA Breakfast Cereals grain flavour reminds me of Looper's one. Great job. Simple too. Sick of mixing up 10 ingredient tongue-fuck recipes. Great job. Highly recommended if you're into looper style vapes. "}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"74722","name":"Breakfast Rings"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
