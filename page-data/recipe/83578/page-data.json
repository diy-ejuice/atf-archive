I was going to call this Blue Karma, as it was supposed to be a blueberry-caramel milk.  However, I thought that name quite trite (and as it turns out off the mark), and, since it was a Monday when I mixed it . . . and I have an undying love for all things Vonnegut, I decided to go with Goodbye Blue Monday.  So it goes.  On a side note, the name LonesomeRhodesTN, is an homage to Vonnegut's novel, Slapstick (subtitled Lonesome No More), as well as Andy Griffith's character in the amazing Elia Kazan movie, A Face in the Crowd.\r\n\r\nThis recipe was an experiment with a few new (to me) concentrates: Oak Milk, Melty Caramel, and HS Blueberry.\r\n\r\nFW Blueberry (1%) and HS Blueberry (0.5%) make up the candied blueberry flavor.  The Cream Fresh (1%), FE Oak Milk (2%), MB Melty Caramel (1.5%), and OOO Cream Milky Undertone (1.5%) come together to make the Tootsie Roll part of the Tootsie Pop (which we all know is not really a chocolate flavor).  I'm assuming the malty milk and caramel come together to create this aspect of the flavor.  I didn't add any sweetener . . . but I'm sure 0.5% of CAP Super Sweet wouldn't hurt, if you're into that kind of thing.\r\n\r\nI'm not going to lie and say this was the flavor I was shooting for, but this tastes spot-on like taking a crunchy, chewy bite out of a Blueberry Tootsie Pop.  Tasting this after mixing it three days ago, it was unmistakable that this had become the familiar candy that I loved as a child.\r\n\r\nMr. Owl, how many licks does it take to get to the Tootsie Roll center of a Tootsie Pop?\r\n\r\nLet's find out. A one . . . A two-HOO . . .
