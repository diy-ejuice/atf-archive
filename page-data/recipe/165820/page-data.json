But as a vape, wow.. this flavor combined with the Cheesecake and the raspberry is just addictive.\r\nWhen i give out a bottle to friends for testing, i don't mention anything about the rhubarb, and everyone just says, this recipe is tart and plays very well with the cheesecake part.\r\nAs the recipe steeps, the cheesecake pushes a bit forward and the raspberry & rhubarb combo blend together into a sweet, syrup type fruit jam thing.\r\n\r\nUse sweetener at your own taste, i like it even with 1%","steep_days":"2 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:51:08.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"891","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Yes, We Cheesecake","flavor_id":"9272","vendor":"INW","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Super Sweet","flavor_id":"2384","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":500},{"name":"Rhubarb (yc)","flavor_id":"711","vendor":"INW","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Raspberry","flavor_id":"606","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1000}],"reviews":[{"user":"insan0r","text":"Love it, the Rhubarb makes this vape exceptional"}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"165820","name":"Rhubarb n Raspberry Cheesecake"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
