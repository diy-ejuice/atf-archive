INW Gold for Pipe is used it because it has a very mild tobacco note and I felt it would pair well with a floral flavor. CAP Hibiscus out of the 2 Hibscus’ I own I felt this would work better in a tobacco. INW Marzipan I used it add a nutty almond note. FA Meringue was used to add some sweet creaminess. INW Garuda Absolute to me is a very earthy tobacco and I know Hibiscus is used in teas which are earthy so i figured the earthiness from the Garuda would pair well.

But I can't, because it's that good! Instead of coconut, I get something that wasn't in the description, honey. I'm not mad about that. How can I be? It's too damn delicious and satisfying to be mad. I think it really drives home the tea thing; this is like drinking honey-sweetened hibiscus tea out of one side of my mouth with an unlit nutty cigarillo hanging out of the other. I had some real doubts about how that syrupy CAP Hibiscus would work with a tobacco. I would have advised against trying it. I would have been wrong.  Vaping this makes me feel like I need a Hawaiian shirt and some criminal underlings to boss around. This tastes like a boss, and not just any boss, a tea-drinking island crime boss.

I just want to make sure I give it the 5 stars I said I would before I forget. &#xD;\n&#xD;\n&#xD;\nBy ebc88&#xD;\n&#xD;\nUh oh, Chemy likey. I can tell there’s some Gold Ducat in there, and I think we are kind of on the same page with that flavor. Couldn’t really get in to it very much until recently, but now I’m really starting to dig it. It seems like kind of a Bible Flavor- everyone has their own interpretation. I always got honey from it. Lately I’ve been getting a pretty nice smoky honey from it. Some get plum, some get coconut, some get butter. Right now, I’m just getting delicious. I’m going to peak at the recipe now just to see what I need to order to make it myself.&#xD;\n&#xD;\nThat Marzipan and Hibiscus are going on the next order. Great choice on the tobaccos. I couldn’t think of anything that would go with the Hibiscus any better. Giving this one a 5 star.&#xD;\n&#xD;\n- reviewed for Mixers Club"}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"105140","name":"Smokin Hibiscus"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
