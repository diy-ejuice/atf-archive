Initial testers were one with eucalyptus mint and one without. I prefer without the mint, but I could see myself vaping it if I had a sore throat.

I altered it a little by upping the watermelon to 5% and adding 0.25% Super Sweet to my tastes, but all in all this is wayyyyy better than Thug Juice. "},{"user":"Jthectic","score":"5","text":"This is really good alternative to jungle juice by FW (AKA thug juice). It has a stronger grape flavour, and unlike jungle juice isn't drowned out by the menthol. Delicious."}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"4260","name":"Thugger Juice"}}}
