I altered it a little by upping the watermelon to 5% and adding 0.25% Super Sweet to my tastes, but all in all this is wayyyyy better than Thug Juice.

It has a stronger grape flavour, and unlike jungle juice isn't drowned out by the menthol. Delicious.","score":5}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"4260","name":"Thugger Juice"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
