The Vanilla Pudding gives a nice hug to everything, and the Vanilla Swirl is that aunt or uncle that is welcome everywhere!

The eggnog is notable and that's a good thing. The hazelnut adds a richness and slight nutty flavor that plays well off the biscuit, which cements the dessert vibe. The vanilla swirl and vanilla pudding add a wall of thick tasty goodness for everything to stick to. Basically, this is a holiday cookie dunked in a glass of eggnog, and it's all very delicious.&#xD;\n&#xD;\nNice one!","score":5}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"124022","name":"Hangin' For The Holidays"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
