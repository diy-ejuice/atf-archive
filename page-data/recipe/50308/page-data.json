Meringue adds some nice additional sweetness and texture.\r\n\r\nStrawberry Ripe - contributes a jammy quality to the cooked banana and is also used in place of sweetener.\r\n\r\nI could see some caramels or nuts (almond, peanut butter, walnut) as well as spices like cinnamon being nice additions to the base.\r\n\r\n","steep_days":"4 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-10T17:56:42.000-05:00","best_vg":"60%","views":"1453","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Banana Cream","flavor_id":"210","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":3500},{"name":"Vanilla Bean Ice Cream","flavor_id":"186","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":4000},{"name":"White Chocolate","flavor_id":"1462","vendor":"FW","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Meringue","flavor_id":"530","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Strawberry (ripe)","flavor_id":"271","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2000}],"reviews":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"50308","name":"Fried Nana Base"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
