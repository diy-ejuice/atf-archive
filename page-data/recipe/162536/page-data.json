Tested on a Cthulhu 1928 and flavor is amazing. Makes me want to mix the non-pod version as well. This will probably end up becoming an ADV for my MTL vapes. Well done"},{"user":"Hexical","text":"Totally agree with ID10-T. I'm using this in a Pasito w/ an RBA Deck, 50/50 VG/PG 25mg nic salt, and the flavour is superb. I get a lot of melon from this which seems damn near impossible to achieve in pod devices in the first place. Mixed up a 10mL sample and im already mixing up a 30mL the next day! "},{"user":"ID10-T","text":"Hell yes! I've never had a sour melon ball candy but I imagine this is exactly what one would taste like. Mixed at 25mg salt nic 50/50 VG/PG for my Caliburn. Plenty of tangy-sweet, satisfying melon flavor with a candied base, which is hard to do in this dinky little device. Surprisingly sweet without sweetener, especially in this set-up, which is great, because (presumably) it won't tank by pod so fast and things that rely on Super Sweet. It really does taste amazing. I needed a break from my own failed attempts at pod recipes so I gave this a try and I'm so glad I did.
