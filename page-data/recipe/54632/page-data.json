This is the first version of this recipe and I feel it came out absolutely wonderful! Feel free to tweak to your liking! I am a fairly new mixer (4 months) so if you enjoy this recipe please rate and share with your friends! \r\n\r\nSteep Time: Is good right away but even better if left at least 24hrs. For full out flavor steep 5-10 days.\r\n\r\nFLV Blueberry Muffin and FA Bilberry are the stars of the mix and adds a wonderful slightly cooked Blueberry flavor to the mix. FA Bilberry adds a dark blueberry flavor and helps keep the blueberry from washing out through the steep. \r\n\r\nTpa Blueberry Extra is used to add backbone to the blueberry in flv Blueberry muffin and round out the blueberry a touch. \r\n\r\nFW Blueberry Graham Waffle is used to add even more Blueberry goodness and also to add a bit of baked flavor to the bready notes. \r\n\r\nTpa Brown sugar is used to add to that dark bready baked profile I was looking for and is just excellent in bakeries in general!\r\n\r\nFW Yellow Cake is the main bread body for the muffin\r\n\r\nCAP cake Batter is used to add more of a cakey mouthfeel and texture to the mix\r\n\r\nFA Cookie is used to complete and round out the muffin body and is an excellent playmate with FLV Blueberry Muffin \r\n\r\nCAP Golden Butter is there because who eats a fresh baked Blueberry muffin without butter!? \r\n\r\nCAP Vanilla Whipped Cream is used to add a touch of creaminess to the entire mix and just works. \r\n\r\nCAP Super Sweet is used at 3/4 of a percent to sweeten the mix. I prefer sweet juices but you can omit this one if you want.","steep_days":"5 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-10T18:59:56.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"2014","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Blueberry Muffin","flavor_id":"608","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":4500},{"name":"Bilberry","flavor_id":"533","vendor":"FA","millipercent":250},{"name":"Blueberry (extra)","flavor_id":"218","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Blueberry Graham Waffle","flavor_id":"1203","vendor":"FW","millipercent":500},{"name":"Brown Sugar","flavor_id":"313","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Cake (yellow)","flavor_id":"1222","vendor":"FW","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Cake Batter","flavor_id":"22","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Cookie","flavor_id":"490","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Golden Butter","flavor_id":"60","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Vanilla Whipped Cream","flavor_id":"1","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Super Sweet","flavor_id":"2384","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":750}],"reviews":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"54632","name":"Blueberry Muffin Goodness "}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
