This is a caramel and white chocolate candy with a tiny hint of nougat in there to help add a fluffy filling. If you do not have the FA-Torrone you could omit it but it does interesting things to this mix. Admittedly I have trouble tasting white chocolate and vanilla profiles for any length of time, so this was difficult for me to adjust.   This was as close as I could get to what I was trying to create.  The white chocolates and caramel come together and accent each other nicely.  The FLV-Smooth Vanilla helps to bring in some of that cocoa butter taste that the white chocolates were missing.
