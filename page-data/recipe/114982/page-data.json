Waffle brings our maple syrup and Vanilla cupcake adds some light fluffiness to the base. \r\n\r\nGolden Butter butters things up and Whipped Cream emulsifies and adds some extra airiness to the vape, creating some nice breathing space for Sweet Strawberry to punch through. \r\n\r\nI prefer this with a little extra sweetener, but do whatever works for you.
