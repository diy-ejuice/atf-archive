We were also limited to a set amount of concentrates. The final product was also tested in sub ohm tanks, which added another point to consider. This was my entry, I didn't win the compo - but fuck it I love it so here you go. \r\n\r\nINW Cactus To add some wetness, and also boots the citrus notes of Juicy Lemon\r\nLB Pink Lemonade - Just a nice pink base to work from, wont work as a main note\r\nCAP Jelly Candy - Making everything a bit more artificial and soda'like\r\nRF Strawberry - What a lovely strawberry, works well in a lemonade. \r\nWS23 - I used a 20% dilution in this mix, also helps with the fizzyness.\r\n\r\nThis is a sugary soda, and the recipe has a commercial feel to it - you can sweeten, and cool to your liking. But consider its purpose when doing so! Hope you enjoy!","steep_days":"2 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"total_reviews":1,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:50:28.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"2612","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Cactus","vendor":"INW","millipercent":300},{"name":"Jelly Candy","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":700},{"name":"Juicy Lemon","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":2700},{"name":"Pink Lemonade","vendor":"LB","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Strawberry","vendor":"RF","millipercent":6500},{"name":"Super Sweet","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":700},{"name":"WS-23","vendor":"OTHR","millipercent":1000}],"reviews":[{"user":"photohap","score":"5","text":"This has got to be one of my favorite pink lemonade recipes, I did sub the jelly candy with TFA gummy candy at the same percentage, since I didn't have that in my rotation.
