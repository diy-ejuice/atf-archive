On the face of it, it *sounded* like a bad idea, but it came together very quickly, and upon reflection it really makes perfect sense to me that these flavors blended together to make a truly brilliant sweet, lightly fruity, and refreshingly piney refreshing vape.\r\n\r\nThe recipe hinges on so many things going just right, but happily the balance was key to making this an honestly delicious mix.\r\n\r\n**Juniper Gin** can be a bully, the piney notes are in full force with this flavor, so keeping it low was integral to success, especially while pairing it with the Yakima Hops.\r\n\r\n**Yakima Hops** was an obligate inclusion when combining our individual interests into a single recipe, we didn't keep it near so low as the gin as we did want the crisp hoppy notes to be a major factor in the recipe.\r\n\r\n**Fizzy Sherbet** again an obligate inclusion, but one that brings a citrus bent to things and helped steer the decision toward using FW Blood Orange to round out the citrus compliment to our crisp gin and hops combo.\r\n\r\n**FW Blood Orange** was chosen because it complements the sherbet's citrus notes while avoiding the conventional trappings of a Gin and Tonic. Adding a bit more sweetness and an undercurrent of orange that helps carry the body of the recipe. \r\n\r\n**INW Pitaya** is my compulsory pick, but we toned down the usage to 1% to avoid leaning too heavily on the inherent weirdness of INW's pitaya and just let the sweet, sort of strange fruit notes stand among the pillars of the recipe to accent the brilliance of other flavors rather than as a focal point.\r\n\r\nEverything comes together to create a recipe unlike anything else I've vaped to date, crisp, refreshing, inherently sweet, and a true melding of our individual tastes to make something none of us might have ever chased down without the others.","steep_days":"0 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:51:01.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"2358","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Dragon Fruit - Pitaya","vendor":"INW","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Blood Orange","vendor":"FW","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Juniper Gin","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":250},{"name":"Yakima Hops","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1250},{"name":"Fizzy Sherbet","vendor":"VT","millipercent":3000}],"reviews":[{"user":"staybert","text":"First of all, this is the first booze recipe that I ever tried. I've never really dared to dive down to use that FLV Juniper Gin myself, because I'm not drinking that often anymore, so the thought of me vaping booze has not been too inciting. I do love a great Gin &amp; Tonic though, especially on a nice gin like Hendricks or Tanqueray. Luckily for me, FLV Juniper is precisely that, a very nice and piney london dry gin.&#xD;\nThe balance of the gin flavor in this mix is damn perfect, it's pleasantly there, but it also leaves a lot of room for the other flavors to express themselves. Yakima Hops and INW Pitaya are definitley both really funky, and it works really well here because the gin flavor is so fresh in itself, and the Fizzy Sherbet just adds to that freshness even more. I get no Orange flavor here, but I don't thats the point either, but I can definitley see the body and sweetness it brings to this wonderfully crafted wierdness of a recipe."}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"157127","name":"Dragon in the Pines"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
