I didn't have all the things i needed to make his recipe so i came up with this with what i had. To me it tastes pretty damn true to the real thing. Very delicious and easy vape with a good nutty richness. I wanted a bit more sugar cookie with mine and it works wonderfully. With this one i honestly get impatient and pretty mush SNV, and it tastes wonderful as is.
