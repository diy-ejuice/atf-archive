Shame on me for not copying them to notepad. This is the short short version because i am tired.\r\n\r\nPicture a pretty little square of pie crust with cinnamon sugar under juicy apple filling with a dollup of fresh vanilla cream covered in a strawberry brandy reduction. Pure delight\r\n\r\nFA Fuji - I must be super sensitive because this seemed to overtake everything I tried. In this recipe it mingles with both the CAP CDS and the TFA Brandy giving it cinnamon and syrup qualities and giving that baked nuance much the same as liquid amber does.\r\n\r\nTFA Strawberry (Ripe) -  I used a lot. i didn't want to use sweetener and this plays triple duty. Sweet, creamy, and strawberry flavor.\r\n\r\nCAP Cinnamon Danish Swirl - All i ever get is cinnamon from it on a short steep so i went with it knowing to keep it low to get that cinnamon and a little bit of bakery after the week steep. It lends just enough bakery to pull of the tart and adds complexity.\r\n\r\nTFA Brandy - I looked at a lot of flavorings trying to bind the basket ingredients together where necessary and this one worked great in adding that syrup-like and baked quality.\r\n \r\nFA Cream Fresh - This and TFA Vanilla Swirl make up the cream by playing off the creamy underbelly of the Strawberry (Ripe) and add mouthfeel and depth.\r\n\r\nTFA Vanilla Swirl - (SEE ABOVE)\r\n\r\nThis has been a  lot of fun listening to the show and participating in the contest. Respect to the hosts and to all the mixers, new and seasoned, for their art and passion for mixing.\r\n\r\nMuch Love, \r\n    Brett Grosswiler (That Hohmie Brett)","steep_days":"5","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"total_reviews":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-06T12:54:09.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"1630","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Fuji","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Strawberry (ripe)","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":6000},{"name":"Cinnamon Danish Swirl","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Brandy","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Cream Fresh","vendor":"FA","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Vanilla Swirl","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":3500}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"18311","name":"A Strawberry Apple Cinnamon Tart with Vanilla Cream"}}}
