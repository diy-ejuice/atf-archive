A variation to ID10-T's famous detachable artificial reproductive organ, but with a bit of them ~ t r o p i c a l v i b e z ~\r\n\r\nWe know the base works, thanks to the original recipe. While I don't necessarily like FA Strawberry, I wanted to stay with the normal base for this recipe, since it does seem to work best to impart that sort of subtle strawberry note that is not too candied or sweet. I think, if needed, a substitute of TPA Straw Ripe at 5% would work. It WON'T be the same, but it is one of the other strawberries out there that isn't too sweet or offensive. I also felt as though the watermelon notes could be improved a bit from the original, and while FA Watermelon is a great flavour, I like how the addition of FLV Watermelon helps add some of that lingering mouthfeel you get when actually eating a watermelon. This also adds a slight note of sweet watermelon candies, but again, it's VERY subtle. FLV Watermelon SMELLS like it'd be OP as fuck, but it's not. Like, not even close.\r\n\r\nSo the tropical notes. I wanted them to sit in the back. Just as a bit of an afterthought to keep you coming back after the exhale. Let this one sit a few days to really bring out the tropical notes, but once you do, the LA Banana Cream will give that sweet banana note, and the TPA Coconut will hit you with some delicious coconut flakes. There's a little bit of the throat hit on this recipe, but that might also be from my nicotine being old. Who knows.\r\n\r\nI dig the original recipe, and I think this one is good if you're tryin to get some of that S U M M E R T I M E S A D N E S S ,\r\n\r\nor you know, you just like dicks.","steep_days":"2 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"total_reviews":2,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:49:09.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"4498","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Fuji","vendor":"FA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Red Touch (strawberry)","vendor":"FA","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Red Summer (watermelon)","vendor":"FA","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Watermelon","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Banana Cream","vendor":"LA","millipercent":1250},{"name":"Meringue","vendor":"FA","millipercent":750}],"reviews":[{"user":"DigitalDrops","score":"none","text":""},{"user":"ID10-T","score":"5","text":"If this is what a penis literally tastes like, maybe I've been playing for the wrong team all along. There's enough going on here to keep it very interesting but not so much as to be a mess. It's a yummy blend of fruits that tastes like a Polynesian vacation away from custards and cookies. Punching up that realistic but weak watermelon with a melon that really lingers on the palate and adding coconut gives it kind of an 'otai vibe, as if someone blended a banana and some applesauce into a watermelon 'otai for added fun and deliciousness. This was a nice surprise for me because on paper, I thought this might just taste like a more interesting and watermelon-forward version of Tiger's Blood snow cone, with an added squirt of banana syrup that the snow cone stand guy might let you have for a wink and a quarter. Instead, the strawberry stays well in the background and could maybe even be left out of this mix, either just omitted or possibly replaced with addition of a little of a different coconut. But then, that'd be a different dick and this one tastes terrific just the way it is. "}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"34500","name":"The Best Damn Literally A Penis"}}}
