This is the 1st part of my Seven Of Nine/Borg Trilogy*\r\n  \r\n**Description:**\r\n  \r\n*Feel her pale, milky mounds & sweet vanilla nectar dance over your tongue. She will undoubtedly tease & tantalize you, and most definitely leave you wanting more. Many of us, at one time or another have desired to \"make\" Seven Of Nine. But up to now, none have mastered her unique perfection. Resistance, in this case, is indeed futile...*\r\n  \r\n*I enjoy this after a 2 day steep. But like all fine women... er, ELIQUIDS, \"My Sweet Borg\" improves with age!*\r\n  \r\n\r\n**\"My Sweet Borg\" Notes:**\r\n \r\n\r\n*TFA Vanilla Swirl adds that \"soft-serve\" quality/creaminess I needed in this mix. It is my personal \"go to\" for all things milk, and was a huge asset in my \"My Milk\" clone awhile back. It was with that recipe I realized this concentrate's perfect milk base position in a recipe.*\r\n\r\n\r\n*CAP Simply Vanilla I feel, is an extremely under-rated flavoring. This was used to boost the vanilla in Vanilla Swirl to a whole new level. And that's its' only purpose in this recipe.*\r\n \r\n\r\n*FA Fresh Cream: Holy Mackerel! At 2%, this contributes to that extra thick, milky mouth feel that was missing.*\r\n \r\n  \r\n*FW Hazelnut: This adds a nice malty back note just to keep things interesting.*\r\n  \r\n  \r\n*NN Erythritol: Originally, I had incorporated CAPs Super Sweet at the same percentage. But man....double-strength sucralose is a major coil-killer(why is life so unfair?). I then remixed this with Nude Nicotine's Erythritol. At the same percentage, I thought it wouldn't have been as sweet & would need to be boosted up in percentage. But as it turns out, this was a fabulous improvement to not ONLY my coils-but also my taste buds. And if you REALLY want to be adventurous, add 0.75% TFA Sweetener in addition to the Erythritol. Very sweet and I actually prefer it with both sweeteners.*\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n  \r\n*•••Star Trek: Voyager & all its' characters are the sole property of Paramount. No profit has been made on this recipe.*\r\n\r\n**Do not take it upon yourself to copy and publish this recipe over to ELR. THIS ACTION IS STRICTLY FORBIDDEN.** \r\nRespect mixers, they are not your ticket to success...They are your friends.\r\n\r\n#EJUICEMAKERS","steep_days":"2","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"total_reviews":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-06T23:07:06.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"1799","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Vanilla Swirl","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":6500},{"name":"Cream Fresh","vendor":"FA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Hazelnut","vendor":"FW","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Simply Vanilla","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Erythritol 5%","vendor":"OTHR","millipercent":750},{"name":"Sweetener","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":750}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"30144","name":"\"My Sweet Borg\""}}}
