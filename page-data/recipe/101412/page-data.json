As part of that challenge, you were only allowed to use the TPA/TFA concentrates that are available  from SydneyVapour.com. With those rules in place there was a great selection to chose from. \r\nWith the Papaya being the biggest player in this recipe you'd expect it to be over powering but it's not. The Papaya plays very nicely with all of his little companions. On the inhale the Papaya is slightly in the lead on a mild note, then his juicy friends are right behind him and all at the same time. It's a lovely moist and juicy, not so tropical inhale. The exhale is almost the same and you are left with a refreshing feeling. If I did have a TPA Meringue I would have used it at around .5% for a chewy center and also a small amount of sweetener would not have gone astray. But it is what it is and it's actually refreshing, I find myself picking it up and vaping on it just as you would pop a piece of gum or candy in your mouth for a refreshment. I see it as a Papaya flavored juicy fruit with a nice light bubblegum factor. Tested on an rda.\r\n","steep_days":"1 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-05T09:52:23.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"1410","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Papaya","flavor_id":"252","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":7000},{"name":"Rainbow Sherbet","flavor_id":"2312","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2400},{"name":"Pear Candy","flavor_id":"256","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2250},{"name":"Cotton Candy","flavor_id":"319","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Bubblegum (fruity)","flavor_id":"314","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Sweet And Tart","flavor_id":"338","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2000}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"101412","name":"Pappies Gummies"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
