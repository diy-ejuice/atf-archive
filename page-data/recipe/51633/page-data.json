I wanted a similar taste, without all that damned sweetener, and I believe I was able to achieve it.  I post very few of my recipes, but I ask you to please try & rate, as it helps us all!\r\n\r\nCAP Graham Cracker/TPA Graham Cracker (clear)/FA Apple Pie - This is not so much a crunchy crust, as utilization of the spice notes to construct a contrast to the sweetness of the fruit.  It gives the flavor that multidemensional layering that is the key to keeping a vape interesting, for my tastes at least.  Don't mind the high % of CAP GC, it just works here.\r\n\r\nJF Fuji/TFA Pear/FA Liquid Amber - Nothing to special here besides the JF Fuji.  FA fuji never sat well with me, and I would usually mix it 50/50 with CAP Double Apple when pursuing this profile.  JF Fuji is much more balanced and moist.  Liquid Amber is obvious, just for the cooked/carmelization of the fruits.  The Pear brings the sweetness and rounds off the Apple, as well as acting as a bridge with...\r\n\r\nCAP Vanilla Whipped Cream- An amazing ingredient, one that is a must in any fruit/cream hybrid, used here for it's ability to bring a light vanilla flavor, but not muddy the recipe with too much cream.\r\n\r\nDF Clove- I'm putting this in many of my fruit recipes as of late, but it's at home with apple.  Again, it provides a counterbalance to the sweetness, helping with the aforementioned multidimensionality. (ok not sure if that's a word but fuck it I'm on my tablet, in the bathtub, after another accidental Ambien @2am)\r\n\r\nI sincerely hope you enjoy this!","steep_days":"3 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-11T18:23:50.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"1307","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Graham Cracker","flavor_id":"62","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Graham Cracker Clear","flavor_id":"325","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Apple Pie","flavor_id":"551","vendor":"FA","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Fuji","flavor_id":"4488","vendor":"JF","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Pear","flavor_id":"257","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Vanilla Whipped Cream","flavor_id":"1","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Liquid Amber","flavor_id":"476","vendor":"FA","millipercent":350},{"name":"Clove","flavor_id":"6187","vendor":"DF","millipercent":1000}],"reviews":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"51633","name":"FAPPLE"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
