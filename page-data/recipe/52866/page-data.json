The two that look the most out of place in this recipe. It never would have crossed my mind but before even trying to construct this recipe I looked up an actual baking recipe. Almond extract and coconut where two ingredients. I thought why the hell not it sounds good. In the first few testing days the coconut was way too forward. I almost scrapped the recipe and wanted to make a V2 leaving it out. But I was patient and to my surprise after about 7-10 days it fades somewhere into the distance just leaving a nice subtle coconut cream with a little nutty help from the almond. It's hard to explain until you experience it for yourself. \r\n\r\nI hope you guys enjoy this one as much as I have been. Give this one a solid week or more for everything to fall into it's comfort zone","steep_days":"7","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:49:25.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"2514","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Raspberry (sweet)","flavor_id":"267","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Strawberry (ripe)","flavor_id":"271","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Biscuit","flavor_id":"642","vendor":"INW","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Sugar Cookie","flavor_id":"115","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":2000},{"name":"New York Cheesecake","flavor_id":"90","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Almond","flavor_id":"528","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Coconut Candy","flavor_id":"223","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Yellow Cake","flavor_id":"5854","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1500}],"reviews":[{"user":"cdaniell30","text":"I had to sub JF yellow cake, but it came out nice.
