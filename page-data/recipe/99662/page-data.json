The rose enhances the strawberries in a very nice and sweet way. It brings a certain airiness to the recipe. FA Red Touch combined with TFA Strawberry is one of my favorite strawberry blends when I'm not looking for a candy strawberry. Rose in this recipe is very delicate and not floral. I considered bumping the rose but chose against if because while it may have added additional floral notes it also can add a pungent green stem note if used too high. \r\nI Used almond to enhance my vanilla notes because I tend to be vanilla blind unless I enhance with either coconut or with almond. FA Creme fresh to add the homemade aspect of the recipe, FLV Custard (not to be mistaken with their Vanilla Custard) is a very nice smooth cream the Vanilla swirl adds the vanilla notes I was looking for and the silky ice cream texture. \r\n\r\nadditives : \r\nWS23 - because Ice cream is supposed to be cold or its just cream but feel free to omit it if you don't like cold creams.\r\n\r\nSweetener : Just because I like it a little sweeter than the flavors I chose provide ","steep_days":"14","temperature":"0","recipe_score":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-11T22:44:29.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"1171","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Rose","flavor_id":"511","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Almond","flavor_id":"286","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":100},{"name":"Cream Fresh","flavor_id":"540","vendor":"FA","millipercent":750},{"name":"Custard","flavor_id":"4388","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":750},{"name":"Red Touch (strawberry)","flavor_id":"421","vendor":"FA","millipercent":2750},{"name":"Strawberry","flavor_id":"272","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Vanilla Swirl","flavor_id":"189","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"WS-23","flavor_id":"8085","vendor":"OTHR","millipercent":250},{"name":"Sweetener","flavor_id":"1432","vendor":"FW","millipercent":500}],"reviews":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"99662","name":"Crema De' Vanilla Rose #Mixin Vixens"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
