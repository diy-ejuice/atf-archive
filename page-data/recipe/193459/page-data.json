It's one of my favorite flavors that TPA makes. If you've never had it before I strongly recommend you pick it up. It's warm and buttery and a perfectly dense Banana Nut Bread. \r\n\r\nI've combined it with TPA Cinnamon Danish Swirl to bump up the spice notes and add to the bakery note of the banana bread, give it a little bit of crispness, Those slightly toasted edges are perfect. I think the two compliment each other really well. \r\n\r\nAnother of my favorites from TPA is Bavarian Cream. It's sweet and sticky. The mouth feel that it provides is second to none in the BV Cream department.\r\n\r\nI've added TPA Vanilla Custard II in really low here. Not for the custard but for the vanilla sweet creamy vanilla note that compliments the BV Cream.\r\n\r\nFinally, the recipe needed some sweetness. TPA Sweetener is not my favorite sweetener but it does fine here.\r\n\r\nThis recipe needs a good steep of 4-5 days.
