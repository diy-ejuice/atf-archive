To me it's a tropical bubblegum pog! I didn't try it as a s&v I let it steep for 5 days and I cannot stop vaping it! Rick's sugar daddy is pretty high at 2% I guess but the last time I used it at 1% it did nothing for me...now at 2% it's right where I like it. I'm not a big fan of fruit eliquid but I think this one gonna be in my rotation for quite a bit!
