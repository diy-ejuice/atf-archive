I wanted to try the #Flavorah blueberry n berries in an all FLV concentrate recipe, and id have to say its a keeper. The black currant works so wonderful to deepen the dark berries and the boysenberry is so yummy!!\r\nCinnamon crunch goes so well with blueberries they may as well be married!!\r\nI added the lemonade to give the berries a touch of citrus to accent because it adds a little brighness to the mix.\r\nIf you have the flavors give it a mix and if you are a fan of berries. I think youll enjoy this as much as i do","steep_days":"3","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"total_reviews":1,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:50:52.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"1285","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Black Currant","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":500},{"name":"Blueberry","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Blueberry Muffin","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Boysenberry","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Cinnamon Crunch","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Lemonade","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":500}],"reviews":[{"user":"CheebaSteeba","score":"none","text":"Love it! I really dig the mix of berries, and the lemonade to punch it up. The real fun starts with the FLV Cinnamon Crunch. While lending itself toward the profile of a crumble, it also adds an extraordinary depth and almost takes this in to an abstract realm, as if I was tasting the painting that the artist portrayed. Well done Jazzy!"}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"147902","name":"Blue crumble #Flavorah"}}}
