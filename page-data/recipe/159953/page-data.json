This is a sweet and vibrant cherry limeade with distinct and contrasting profiles yet balanced and complementing each other.\r\n\r\nWF Blackcherry Jelly Bean/MB Red Cherry/CAP Tart Cherry = that WF Blackcherry Jelly Bean is the meat of the cherry that the other two build onto. The cherry is red, fruity and not at all medicinal.\r\n\r\nFW Lemonade/CAP Grapefruit = that the juiciness of the lemonade with a little zing and a great soft drink body.\r\n\r\nVT Persian Lime/CAP Lemon Lime = the lime of my limeade. I had 1% of FA Lime Tahiti Distilled and you can add it if you feel there is not enough lime, but I like this drink to be more cherry than lime. Lime is also a bit like lemon, they all fade somewhat after a week, but in this mix the lemonade and the grapefruit manage to help the limes a lot.\r\n\r\nI really like this vape, it's sweet and red and citrusy and it is nice. Go for a 30ml at a time and you'll have a great experience.\r\n\r\nEnjoy, be queer and vape on!\r\n\r\n[Photo Credits: www.foxandbriar.com ]","steep_days":"3 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-05T04:17:20.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"939","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Red Cherry","flavor_id":"1516","vendor":"MB","millipercent":3250},{"name":"Persian Lime","flavor_id":"8942","vendor":"VT","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Blackcherry Jelly Bean SC","flavor_id":"8359","vendor":"WF","millipercent":750},{"name":"Tart Cherry","flavor_id":"10052","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":5000},{"name":"Lemon Lime","flavor_id":"83","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Lemonade","flavor_id":"1336","vendor":"FW","millipercent":5000},{"name":"Grapefruit","flavor_id":"65","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":500}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"159953","name":"Ma Chérie (Cherry Limeade)"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
