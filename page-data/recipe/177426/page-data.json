It gives a good hint of grape flavor on the inhale, and smooth grape exhale.\r\n\r\nCAP Sweet Strawberry\r\nThis adds some texture to the mix. If you think about eating grapes, it has the same texture as eating strawberries.\r\n\r\nTPA Watermelon\r\nThis is one of my favorites watermelon flavor. It don't compete with other flavors and it gives this recipe a some wetness into it.\r\n\r\nFA Meringue\r\nThis gives some body into the mix\r\n\r\nFA Raspberry\r\nThis add some consistency on the exhale. It gives that edge when it comes to adding some authenticity to the grape flavor that I'm trying to achieve in this recipe\r\n\r\nWS-23\r\nThis goes well with this recipe. I tried using Koolada but I dont like it because the grape flavors dies down a bit.\r\n\r\nTPA Dragonfruit\r\nThis also adds consistency and it blends well with this recipe. \r\n\r\nCAP Super Sweet\r\nThis adds that processed sweetness of Koolaid drink\r\n\r\n","steep_days":"7","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"total_reviews":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T09:27:49.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"978","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Grape Juice","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Concord Grape With Stevia","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Sweet Strawberry","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Watermelon","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Meringue","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Berryl (raspberry)","vendor":"FA","millipercent":500},{"name":"WS-23","vendor":"OTHR","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Dragonfruit","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Super Sweet","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":500}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"177426","name":"Kool-Aid Jamerz"}}}
