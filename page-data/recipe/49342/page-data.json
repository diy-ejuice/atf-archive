I picked up a bottle for remix month and was pleasantly surprised it wasn't that bad actually pretty decent. The flavor profile was hard to find in writing but what I could find basically say  a blueberry cheesecake with a crunch berry crust. In my opinion I was able to make this flavor in my opinion 95% of the way there.  I started to vear away from the flavor attempting to match the dark yellowish tint to the original e liquid so I had to forget about the color and go back to the flavor and in my opinion I am very close to the authentic e juice they are doing something different because of the color of the e liquid but as far as the flavor I think you would be hard pressed to pick which one was the authentic in a side by side in my opinion my version is a little more flavorful. If you have tried the original e juice Blue Bird and enjoyed it give this a try and let me know how close you think I got.

I assume that this ingredient is the same as TPA Berry Crunch. Name change? There is also a Crunchy Cereal. Either way, this wasn't what I was expecting, but it was definitely a pleasant surprise! I dig this. Not an ADV for me, but memorable. Well done.  "},{"user":"Ebc88","text":"Never tried the original but this is a damn good recipe.

(Og a little too sweet, but remixed @ .5 sweetener &amp; much better, but that's just me &amp; this is a commercial clone)"},{"user":"Dank1","text":"Never had the original but this recipe kicks ass"},{"user":"HerrHut","text":"Can't comment on authenticity, but this is tasty."},{"user":"Seakow","text":"Never had the actual e-liquid but this stuff is stellar!"},{"user":"ObiWanCannoli","text":"This is a really great recipe! Not too much graham crust but a really creamy and tasty blueberry vape. If you like cheesecakes you decinitely should mix this one up. Will be mixing again. Thanks for sharing this and keep up the good work!"},{"user":"Deweysuds","text":":  Two month steep.  Upfront I get a crunch berry note with a back note body of cheese cake.  Real smooth and blended.  The crunch berry is not off putting.  It was initially which tells me this needs a long steep because right now this is a pleasant recipe.  The blueberry blends in to both the cereal and cheese cake note.  Overall this is a great recipe.  Havenâ€™t tried the original, but this is good. 4 stars under a month.  After a month 5 stars all the way.  "},{"user":"ParkusMaximusIII","text":"Never actually tried the original but man.. this shit's GOOD. Always been a big fan of cheesecake vapes so this immediately caught my attention. As I said earlier, I haven't tried Blue Bird so I can't say if it's \"authentic\" to the original but I am definitely digging it a whole lot! Thanks for the recipe Tootall!

My GF killed my original bottle and loves this stuff, we both think it's ridiculously similar. We did steep for two weeks before trying, I like to give most creams and bakeries a month at least but this is very good at 2 weeks. The CCI does a good job giving it that tang it needs and I think if you have this a full month that NYCC will really shine. Great mix, thanks!
