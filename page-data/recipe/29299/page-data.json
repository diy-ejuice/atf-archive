Im positive the original is awesome and one day I'll get the 2 missing flavors.  I subbed Brip and TFA Dulce at respective ratios.  The cream thats only coming the irish and in small part from the dulce is deep and that bscotch carries it well.  Massive flavor for a 10 percent mix with these flavors.  The oak wood sells the smoked part but for me adds like a subtle awesome back end spice that finishes the butterscotch.  I see you originally mixed this in 2017 and wish I would have found this back then.  Once I have the flavors you used I will mix that but for now this 30 isnt enuff!  Thanks for sharing!!!"}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"29299","name":"Smoked butterscotch cream"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
