Surprisingly good as a shake and vape, less good from a week onwards. Give it a try "},{"user":"Deschain","text":"I love this recipe. I've mixed many PB recipes but I like this one much better over others that I have tried. The only thing I haven't tried yet is the PB Cereal recipe released by Charlie Noble. &#xD;\n&#xD;\nThe only problem is of course the juice starts to taste muddled over time, but that seems to be a problem with TFA Peanut Butter, and not a problem with the recipe itself.
