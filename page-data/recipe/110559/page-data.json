Again, I'm just riffing on [Fear's Cardinal](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/24962#cardinal_by_fear) . . . instead, here I'm trying to build it from similar components (some of which I used because I accidentally ordered 60mL of Digestive Biscuit from Chef's a while back and have been itching to use it something).  I tried to create a ramped up RY4 similar to Holy Grail  . . .then added some more tobacco.  I used JF RY4 Double instead of TFA RY4 Double . . . VT Coffee Milk Froth instead of DIYFS Cafe Napoleon . . . butterscotch instead of caramel . . . threw some extra vanilla, graham crackers, and biscuits at her to round her out.\r\n\r\nWhat I got was a smooth ADV worthy RY4 . . . from that first cup of joe to some late night sips . . . this recipe can carry you through.  She's not the Cardinal . . . but she is classy on the outside and downright filthy on the inside.
