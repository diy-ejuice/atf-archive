A vanilla custard with a light vanilla candied rose. The Marshmallow Vanilla and/or Vanilla Bean really candies those edible rose petals and even at 3% the Rose Essence doesnâ€™t become too intrusive or any sort of perfumy, it just makes it interesting so itâ€™s not just a vanilla custard. I put this one really high on my list because I love these simple recipes that are simply good. Itâ€™s no wonder FLV put this in their recipe book. Definitely one Iâ€™d mix again, itâ€™s just a lovely dessert with a gentle floral appeal throughout. "}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"141736","name":"Vanilla Rose Custard"}}}
