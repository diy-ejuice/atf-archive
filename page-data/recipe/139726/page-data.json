The thing with a lemonade is you can chuck any candy berry or fruit for that matter and it should work. If you love lemonade, and you are looking for something with a sparkle - this has to be the closest you can get. Then when you get bored of it - you just bang a berry or whatever in it, to put a different spin on it. \r\n\r\nThis is a somewhat affordable high brow middle class sparkling lemonade drink - with about 16% actual lemon in it. (WOW)\r\n\r\nI tested this in my 22 Citadel, and its very in your face lemonade - so my suggestion would be to keep the ratio and just bump it down by 20% if you are planning to vape this in a flavor atty.\r\n\r\nFLV Lemonade : Uptown home made lemonade, also has a slight bitterness to it\r\nFLV Citrus Soda : Bit of a sparkle, citrus notes - to turn my uptown lemonade into something more affordable for the middle-class. \r\nCAP Jelly Candy : Texture\r\nWS23 20% : Coolness \r\nCAP Super Sweet : Removes bitter note from lemon, they do this in the real world also, I like sugar. \r\n\r\n","steep_days":"1 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"total_reviews":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T23:37:22.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"1817","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Citrus Soda","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Lemonade","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Jelly Candy","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":700},{"name":"WS-23","vendor":"OTHR","millipercent":1200},{"name":"Super Sweet","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":500}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"139726","name":"Layerz - Lemonade"}}}
