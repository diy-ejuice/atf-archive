Yes, yes,...I know you're thinking.. \"Folkart is such a nerd.\" And well, you would be right. I absolutely love the Harry Potter story line. My brother and I even dressed like characters from the movies for a midnight showing of the last in the Harry Potter series; Don't judge. \r\n\r\nAnyway, Jen Jarvis asked me to create a recipe based on a fantasy genre and Butter Beer was it. Now if anyone has visited the Wizarding World of Harry Potter in Orlando, FLA, you would know that they sell the fictitious brew in the park. It's a combination of a cream soda, butterscotch, and whipped cream; A very delicious desert drink. However, being the Harry Potter nerd that I am, I dove a little deeper into this wizardly brew.\r\n\r\nWikipedia describes this witchy brew as tasting a little bit like \"sickly butterscotch\". Butter Beer was served cold in bottles and hot in foaming tankards. An extra sweet variant was brewed by Madam Rosmerta. Another variant was named Butter Beer 1707, which was considered very rare and could be ordered for delivery. And so, this was my quest to imagine what this rare formulation of Butter Beer 1707 tasted like.\r\n\r\nI imagined it to be sweet, thick, and stickier than the basic brew. Although most real Butter Beers are made with cream soda, the 1707 version needed to have more of a bite, so instead I used FLV Root Beer.\r\n\r\nThe star of a good Butter Beer is the butterscotch. I used FA Butterscotch on the first versions but Butter Beer 1707 needed to be richer. So, I settled on VT Butter Toffee Base to bring a much richer \"butterscotch\" and add that butter note I was looking for. Paired with VT English Toffee, it gave it a more \"sickly butterscotch\" note.\r\n\r\nI used FA Bavarian Cream at 2% to fill out the mix by adding creaminess to the mix.\r\n\r\nButter Beer 1707 should only be served hot with a frothy whipped cream atop. Therefore, CAP Vanilla Whipped Cream was my choice for this layer.\r\n\r\nI added a touch of TPA Vanillin to lift up the Toffee's  and added 1% CAP Super Sweet. If 1% SS is too high for you, feel free to lower it, but as I mention in my description of Butter Beer 1707, it's supposed to be sweet, thick, and sticky.\r\n\r\nOk, so now I can go back to the muggle world but I hope you will enjoy this brew on those cold winter months. Enjoy :)\r\n\r\nYou can most defiantly vape this as a shake and vape, but I would suggest a week steep.\r\n\r\nI hope you will mix, comment, and or rate, it make us all better mixers. :)\r\n\r\nVisit Freedom To Mix on Discord https://discord.gg/cMUjtPf\r\nJoin our Freedom To Mix FaceBook group https://www.facebook.com/groups/415341418920740/ \r\nVisit https://freedomtomix.com/ for resources and information on DIY mixing!

It’s one of the best liquid I’ve ever tasted. It’s rich, sweet creamy just wow! The only reason I did not give 5 star is although delicious, the Rootbeer bites a little too much for my taste. Even at lower percentage, the minty bite I could do without. But no rootbeer is not an option as it changes the taste too much. Wondering if it could be swapped with cream soda flavor or cola... Overall great job on this mix !!!"}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"129283","name":"Butter Beer 1707"}}}
