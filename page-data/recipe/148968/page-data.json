I'm not sure if I'm imagining but I feel that the citrus/sprite taste gives you somewhat of a fizzy feeling. It's also just enough % so that it gives a good contrasting flavor to the berries, without overtaking them.\r\n**INW Raspberry:** At 0.75% this flavor is amazing, just enough to get that bold sweet raspberry flavor, without becoming floral.\r\n**FLV Boysenberry:** Just a touch of this fantastic flavor is enough to give the raspberry more body and a sweet syrup-y taste that you expect a soda to have.\r\n**TFA Dragonfruit:** This works as the emulsifier, bledning all these flavors together to a unified soda.\r\n**INW Cactus** adds some wetness and complexity to the whole mix, it also helps tone down the bright citrus notes a bit. The first days you might feel a slight taste of it (not bad imo), but it will be much less over time.\r\n**WS-23** is optional, but I like my sodas COLD! Personally I use this at 1%, but I put a lower percentage so that it doesn't catch anyone by surprise, as it can be quite overwhelming if you are not used to it.","steep_days":"1 (SNV)","temperature":"420","recipe_score":5,"updated_at":"2020-12-12T15:40:34.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"9798","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Citrus Soda","flavor_id":"10083","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1250},{"name":"Cactus","flavor_id":"647","vendor":"INW","millipercent":250},{"name":"Raspberry","flavor_id":"667","vendor":"INW","millipercent":750},{"name":"Dragonfruit","flavor_id":"226","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":750},{"name":"Lemon Lime","flavor_id":"83","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Boysenberry","flavor_id":"614","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":500},{"name":"WS-23","flavor_id":"8085","vendor":"OTHR","millipercent":500}],"reviews":[{"user":"Jthectic","text":"Delicious berry soda.

Thanks for sharing this one!!!","score":5},{"user":"TheJuiceJackBuilt","text":"Beautifully balanced mix of berry and citrus. This has easily become my new adv. I get a lovely taste of those refreshers candy bars with the sherbet in the middle. Has a very authentic soda feel on the exhale. Well done Bertie, cracking recipe!","score":5},{"user":"beeker","text":"This is just gosh darn delightful. Perfectly balanced blend of delicious berries and citrus, this makes a very challenging flavor profile seem easy. Mix it, you wonâ€™t regret it. ","score":5},{"user":"humanpuck","text":"This is really tasty recipe.  You might want to knock the WS-23 down if you're not a lunatic like Bert.  I mixed this up without the cap lemon lime and it was still an absolutely banging summary vape.  The cactus is just enough to make the juicy and the %'s on the Rasp and Boysenberry are pretty much perfect.  I love how he got so much flavor out a low total flavoring %, well done.","score":5}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"148968","name":"Citraspberry Soda"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
