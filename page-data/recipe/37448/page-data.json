At 1.5% its not strong enough to overtake the Strawberry but still very noticeable.\r\nThen of course we have the TFA Dragonfruit at 0.75% to bridge the fruits and allow them to brighten a little more. \r\n\r\nSnV all the way, best after a few days steep. Cream will come out a bit more and the fruits will dull slightly. Still very tasty though.
