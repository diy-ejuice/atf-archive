The DX Juicy peach is a powerful peach and you get that and lemonade on the inhale.  The FLV nectarine adds a little bite and some dryness similar to FA white peach on exhale and cherry blossom gives you that nice floral exhale, which gives off the tea vibe.  I'm really getting much cherry in this, but I'm guessing that's from the low %.  Overall this is pretty refreshing drink.  Thanks to Foment_Life for giving me the base idea.","steep_days":"5","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T22:33:27.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"840","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Lemonade","vendor":"LA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Lemon Sicily","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Cherry Blossom (pg)","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Nectarine","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1000},{"name":"DX Peach (Juicy)","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2000}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"142539","name":"Cheaky Arnie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
