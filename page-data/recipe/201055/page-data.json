So I decided to K.I.S.S. and just take a stab at a simple Mango Cream which is almost custard-y but more akin to a heavy whipped cream with mango puree folded in a pushed through a sieve. At least that's what I was going for in my mind.\r\n\r\nCream(Milky Undertones) & FLV Cream: These two for me work really well as a duo to add creaminess to a recipe. I have been using them at a 2 to 1 ratio and they compliment each other very well this way, FLV cream adding a lot more weight to the milky undertones..  This creates a nice cream base, along with the vanilla swirl, for the mango to sit on.\r\n\r\nVanilla Swirl: This is used basically as the main body and adds a dessert vanilla note to the mix. At 3% this does the trick. \r\n\r\nFLV Mango: I hear from most people this is the best mango and it didn't disappoint. It is thick and well rounded and really accentuates my favorite aspects of a mango. I used it at 1% because I wanted more of the cream/dessert aspects to come out so the mango didn't take over. I like it where it is, but If you wanted more mango and a little less of the vanilla cream base, I think 2% would work just fine.\r\n\r\nBlood Orange(Natural): Added in a very small quantity to add a bit of acidity to the mix that I thought it needed. The flavor of orange doesn't really come across as much as just the acidity does.\r\n\r\nStrawberry Gummy Candy: This might seem like a weird choice, and admittedly it may be. But I wanted a sort of gelatinous, sweet, candy sort of mouthfeel to round out any harsh edges left over from adding the orange. And I love this flavor so it seemed like even if the strawberry came forward a bit, I would still like the mix. For me, at a half of a percent I don't really taste strawberry but it did  get some of that mouthfeel I was looking for so I kept it in.\r\n\r\nThis is a work in progress and I am always open to any  suggestions to make my mixes better as I am a relatively new mixer (only about 6 months).
