Go ahead and leave a review if you mix this.\r\nThis is an adaptation of both her *V1* and  *V2* recipe.\r\n\r\nMy changes:\r\n**TPA Toasted Marshmallow** \r\nUsed for the sweetness of the EM, with the *Toasted* version adding a nice smokiness. *ANY Marshmallow/Cotton Candy/Ethol Maltol* is a perfect sub.\r\n\r\n**TPA Butter**\r\nReally this recipe couldn't get enough DAAP in it, the Butter adds a lovely layer of richness to the creams and saltiness to the nuts. *CAP Golden Butter* is a good sub\r\n\r\nAs an addition, *FLV Peanut Butter at 0.3%* wouldn't go amiss, not has a nice authentic \"nuttiness\" that most of the other nut flavours are missing.","steep_days":"7","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T17:34:34.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"2354","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Hazelnut","vendor":"FW","millipercent":7000},{"name":"Butter Pecan","vendor":"FW","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Bavarian Cream","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Sweet Cream","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":5000},{"name":"Toasted Marshmallow","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Butter","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":750}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"79037","name":"Bust a Nut"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
