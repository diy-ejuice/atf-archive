I craved for fruit salad, so I picked up any flavors that looked like they could belong in a fruit salad, used the recommended percentages ELR back then gave me and voil√† - my current ADV was born\r\n\r\nHonestly, I feel like there is lots of room for improvements. I'm currently playing a lot with this but I feel like this is good enough to put it out there. Good enough that I vape this stuff since months everyday.\r\n\r\n(Sweetener is optional. I simply used it because I like it sweet)\r\n\r\nFULL CREDIT TO THE THUMBNAIL/ARTWORK GOES TO @Zany","steep_days":"3","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T12:47:34.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"1160","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Apple","flavor_id":"207","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":5000},{"name":"Grape","flavor_id":"784","vendor":"INW","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Cherry","flavor_id":"649","vendor":"INW","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Pear","flavor_id":"257","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Whipped Cream","flavor_id":"193","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Sweetener","flavor_id":"339","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1000}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"151841","name":"Obstsalat"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
