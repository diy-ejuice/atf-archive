I donâ€™t find it needs any sweetener but your welcome to sweeten to taste. The tiny bit of almond separates the frosting center from the pastry puff and the small amount of joy plays with the zeppola in airing and fluffing up the cupcake. The milk adds to the lightness of the overall bakery. Enjoy.","steep_days":"10","temperature":"0","recipe_score":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-10T13:45:40.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"1506","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Almond","flavor_id":"528","vendor":"FA","millipercent":50},{"name":"Frosting","flavor_id":"4412","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Joy","flavor_id":"401","vendor":"FA","millipercent":100},{"name":"Milk","flavor_id":"4385","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":250},{"name":"Sugar Cookie","flavor_id":"115","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Vanilla Cupcake","flavor_id":"129","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Zeppola","flavor_id":"6312","vendor":"FA","millipercent":750}],"reviews":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"114735","name":"Pastry Puff By: eJuice Fairy (Jenn Winstead)"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
