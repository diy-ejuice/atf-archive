The Cinnamon Danish Swirl and Gingerbread help to add a little bit more density to it.\r\n\r\nThe Filling-I used a combination of Butter Cream, Cream and the Vanilla Sugar Daddy to add a sweet and creamy filling.  If I had more time I may have tried to add some sort of whipped ingredient to lighten it up a bit but it has been a hectic week lol. \r\n\r\nI also used the Cinnamon Danish Swirl and Gingerbread to add the layer of cinnamon and spice to it.\r\n","steep_days":"1","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"total_reviews":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-06T07:15:49.000-05:00","best_vg":"60%","views":"1387","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Butter Cream","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":800},{"name":"Cinnamon Danish Swirl","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Cookie","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Cream","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":800},{"name":"Croissant SC","vendor":"WF","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Gingerbread","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":500},{"name":"Rick's Vanilla Sugar Daddy","vendor":"TBV","millipercent":400}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"114278","name":"Churro Cream Puff #Mixin Vixens"}}}
