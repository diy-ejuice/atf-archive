The Fa White Peach with Caps Juicy Peach make a lovely juicy peach stone but to take it to the next level I round the edges off with a little FA Apricot which also adds a little more moisture as does the INW Cactus.  I hope you enjoy this as much as I enjoyed creating this from these fine concentrates. \r\n\r\nSee it being made here:https://youtu.be/Yd8ch6jNYlM?t=1h15m\r\n\r\nCheck out what DIY Downunder has to offer:\r\nhttps://www.facebook.com/groups/diydownunder/\r\nhttps://discord.gg/kH4Fqbc\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCTCwb7ULyfJALQlehomZZQA\r\nhttps://www.diydownunder.com/","steep_days":"1","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"updated_at":"2020-12-12T20:30:16.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"3774","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Cactus","flavor_id":"647","vendor":"INW","millipercent":250},{"name":"Peach White","flavor_id":"543","vendor":"FA","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Juicy Peach","flavor_id":"81","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Armenia (apricot)","flavor_id":"507","vendor":"FA","millipercent":250},{"name":"Sweetener","flavor_id":"1432","vendor":"FW","millipercent":500}],"reviews":[{"user":"goosegirl","text":"I have been testing different peach recipes to use in my Innokin Biip.  Initially this one tested a little harsh, but I let it steep a couple of weeks, and it held its flavor well and mellowed out.  I recommend trying this recipe if you are looking for a peach for an AIO.   Good fruit flavor and mouth-feel even at low wattage.","score":5},{"user":"Demented76","text":"This is a nice fresh peach tasting vape.  I let it steep for the recommended 24 hours and it practically drips from your chin while vaping it!  The Cactus and Armenia are barely there, they just add that nice juiciness and depth.  I am loving this one!   Even with irritated lungs from seasonal issues, I had no noticeable harshness bothering my throat or lungs.  I love this stuff!
