I had to look up what the stuff in the picture was because I had never seen a real passion fruit. I am really digging the combo of Devon Cream and Custard Premium for a really nice thick custard. Cap Passion Fruit is a very basey, syrupy sweet passionfruit and fa passion is very bright and tart so the two together make it a very well rounded passion fruit.","steep_days":"3 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-05T19:50:56.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"1295","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Custard Premium","vendor":"FA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Devon Cream","vendor":"CC","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Passion (passionfruit)","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Passion Fruit","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":2000}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"154038","name":"mlNikon's Passionfruit Custard"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
