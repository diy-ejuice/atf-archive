I had to look up what the stuff in the picture was because I had never seen a real passion fruit. I am really digging the combo of Devon Cream and Custard Premium for a really nice thick custard. Cap Passion Fruit is a very basey, syrupy sweet passionfruit and fa passion is very bright and tart so the two together make it a very well rounded passion fruit.","steep_days":"3 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-11T14:17:24.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"1304","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Custard Premium","flavor_id":"9118","vendor":"FA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Devon Cream","flavor_id":"4223","vendor":"CC","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Passion (passionfruit)","flavor_id":"585","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Passion Fruit","flavor_id":"93","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":2000}],"reviews":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"154038","name":"mlNikon's Passionfruit Custard"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
