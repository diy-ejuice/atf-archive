Hoop7, this strawberry lavender ice cream is for you. \r\n\r\nI decided to throw a twist into it, and if its not for you, you can remove it :) The black honey serves two purposes. It adds a hint of honey which pairs with the strawberry and the lavender, and it lends a small anise hint, which helps fill out the lavender a little more, gives it a full flavor. The strawberry cheesecake is there to lend a blend of strawberry to the juicy strawberry, and add a touch more cream to the ice cream. \r\n\r\nSweeten to taste, my range is .25 - .5% cap super sweet.
