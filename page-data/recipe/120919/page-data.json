I wanted to put a dessert into it (and have been digging Creme Brulee recently) so I made this. Using Yes, We Cheesecake with Creme was inspired by Ruderudi's Creme Brulee Cheesecake.  This is probably not a polished recipe, but the end result is a very thick and sweet dessert that's reminiscent of popcorn butter. \r\n\r\nWould recommend, I've been puffing on it for months and it's still good.\r\n\r\nedit: upped the creme brulee and sweetener, it's better","steep_days":"1 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":4,"updated_at":"2020-12-12T14:06:46.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"1759","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Creme Brulee (yc)","flavor_id":"894","vendor":"INW","millipercent":5500},{"name":"Yes, We Cheesecake","flavor_id":"9272","vendor":"INW","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Sweetener","flavor_id":"1432","vendor":"FW","millipercent":1000}],"reviews":[{"user":"thefogvlog","text":"Thanks for putting this recipe out there.
