Common as it comes on the shelves of a vape shop, but it was one of the flavor profiles that made me switch to vaping and I had to take a crack at it. This is the end result. A recipe that I don't feel needs any steeping, but for those sensitive to the pledgy side of TFA fruit circles, 7-10 days aughta knock that out.\r\n\r\nThere's nothing groundbreaking about the flavors I used here, but a quick breakdown anyway:\r\n\r\n**TFA and CAP silver line fruit circles** combine to make an overall more \"full\" fruit loops cereal base. CAP's offering doesn't bring the furniture polish with it and helps tame that aspect of TFA's. \r\n\r\n**FA meringue** is the fast track to selling cereal milk. Thinning out the cream base and adding a touch of a toasted/grainy note to the cereals.\r\n\r\n**TFA Bavarian cream and vanilla swirl** make up the rest of the cream base. Without the meringue this would be too thick, but the softening effect of vanilla swirl helps again to pare down the lemony sharpness of TFA's fruit rings and the overall combination is both tasty and well rounded without taking the recipe over.","steep_days":"0 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":4,"updated_at":"2020-12-12T20:31:09.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"1691","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Meringue","flavor_id":"530","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1800},{"name":"Fruit Circles","flavor_id":"139","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Fruit Circles","flavor_id":"8742","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Vanilla Swirl","flavor_id":"189","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Bavarian Cream","flavor_id":"145","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1500}],"reviews":[{"user":"hamglaze","text":"Solid Fruit Loops profile! This should be a nice easy mix, and the flavors are readily available and with the exception of Fruit Circles they'll work great in many other profiles. There's no alcohol/plastic off-notes that I have found in some other Fruit Loops recipes, and there is a rich, sweet flavor going on that I really enjoy. My only criticism would be that there is not a ton of \"milk/cream\" going on here - if you're looking for a \"milk and cereal\" vape you might have to add something in addition to the TPA Bavarian Cream. That said, mix it up as-is first and give it a shot! Great work, fo!","score":4}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"159002","name":"Gimme the Loops"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
