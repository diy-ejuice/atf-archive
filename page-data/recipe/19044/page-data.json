I really like FA Cuban for a cigar flavoring so I went with that. Later I added FA Hazelnut to give it a nuttier edge. The Torrone was added to give it a sweeter, thicker taste sensation while not killing the nutty aspects. You can leave it out and have a drier less sweet recipe that still works very well. I have also mixed this with either 1% of Vienna or Fresh Cream. Which are both nice but this mix is the one that I keep on hand and always in a mod.\r\n\r\n22mm Atties with more air will get more tobacco with the cream and nut notes in the back. Smaller chamber atties will get more of the creamy sweet taste of the CC and Torrone.\r\n\r\nThis can be SnV but really starts to come together after 3 days, I will also mention that it gets really, really good after 3 weeks. If you are into tobacco vapes. Friends that do not care at all for tobacco vapes love this mix.","steep_days":"3","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"total_reviews":5,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:48:53.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"9256","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Cuban Supreme","vendor":"FA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Catalan Cream","vendor":"FA","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Hazel Grove (hazelnut)","vendor":"FA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Torrone","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000}],"reviews":[{"user":"ID10-T","score":"5","text":"This man knows his tobaccos, I tell you hwhat! Excellent rich, creamy, nutty cigar flavor. I was scared of citrus notes popping up from all those FA flavors, or an unpleasant dryness that also plagues them, but I got none of that after a 3-week steep. So glad I bought the flavor pack from BCF and my only regret is not mixing more of it. Still not as amazing as Fear's ABUELA recipe, though.  UPDATE: Tried this again after just one week and wasn’t nearly as impressed. There’s a bell pepperish taste that I don’t remember getting after a three-week steep. If you try this and don’t like it because of that, let it steep longer. "},{"user":"TamVapes","score":"5","text":"So glad I took the plunge and mixed 120 ml.  This is delicious.  Thank you for sharing, and to BCF for selling flavor packs."},{"user":"lolwtf","score":"5","text":"Really good recipe.  I ended up using FA Nut Mix instead of Hazel Grove because the Hazelnut I've got is FW, and I wanted to use the same percentages.  Worked out nicely (Edit: since writing this review, I have tried this recipe exactly as written and it is equally delicious).  I'm thinking Almond would also be nice &amp; play well with the Torrone.  If I make this again, I will probably increase the Cuban Supreme to 2.5%.  Thanks! &#xD;\n&#xD;\nUpdate:  I actually went back and added another 1.0% Cuban Supreme to this mix, for a total of 3.0%, and I like it much more.   This is a great recipe, for anyone wanting to taste more of the tobacco I would recommend upping the Cuban and perhaps dropping the Torrone to .75% or even .5%.

Well done !"},{"user":"mgrimes","score":"5","text":"Rich, creamy -- citrus from Catalan Cream gets lost, vanilla holds, maybe the Torrone adds to the cream. The nut is prominent -- excellent after dinner vape!!&#xD;\n&#xD;\nYou can't go wrong with Cuban Supreme :&gt;"}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"19044","name":"The Creamy Cuban"}}}
