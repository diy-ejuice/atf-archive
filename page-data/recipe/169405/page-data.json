I could add more cookie but I kind of like it this way. Soft, sweet and slightly nutty.\r\n\r\nThe story behind this mix is simple, I was sick of the good recipes that I had managed to make and wasn't really interested in the \"what i can make\" list. I took my tester of wf sc almond cookie and started to vape on it but it needed something for body so in went some marshmallow. Then i felt like i almost lost the soft almond so I touched it up with a tiny bit of AP. Tried it some more and decided that it was exactly what I was looking for at that moment but I wanted a little sweetness but not a candy like sweetness that you get from cap super sweet alone. I'd say that the flavor of an almond sandy cookie is there but not the dryness and texture. Overall, it has a nice light flavor and a nice body. I can see how someone else might want to add some kind of cookie to this but it doesn't really need it.","steep_days":"0 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T15:21:52.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"962","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Almond Cookie SC","vendor":"WF","millipercent":500},{"name":"Acetyl Pyrazine 5%","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":250},{"name":"Marshmallow","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":750},{"name":"Sweetener","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":750}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"169405","name":"All My Sanity"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
