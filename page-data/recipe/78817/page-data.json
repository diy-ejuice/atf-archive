If you're looking for something like a Swisher Sweet, this base will make a great start. Just swap the grape for a different fruit or other flavor or your choice and rebalance it as needed.

I only realized halfway through vaping it that I hate swishers! But preference aside, it's exactly what it's advertizing, so it's 5 stars for me."},{"user":"Fear","score":"5","text":"This is an interesting mix. A grape cigarillo, no really, a GRAPE CIGARILLO. It has all the guilty fun of a bottom of the shelf along with the maturity and complexity of a mid tier cigarillo. Very well done, had it not been ID10-T I would have been prepared to be disgusted. This is WAY better than I expected it to be. Very well done."},{"user":"Loonicorn","score":"5","text":"Fantastic! Imagine a grape Swisher Sweet only with good tobacco; that's what this tastes like. ID10-T nailed this profile to perfection. Tobacco lovers and candy lovers alike will enjoy this one cuz it's a little of both. I was fortunate enough to get to try this for /r/mixersclub. It's not something I would have mixed on my own because I am not a tobacco person. But....I like big blunts and I cannot lie! And let's face it folks, blunts are the REAL reason people buy these little cigarillos. If you like grape blunt wraps, give this one a try. It'll make you go oooh, ahhh!"},{"user":"Jwdman","score":"5","text":"amazing, thanks dave for posting I will be mixing a lot."}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"78817","name":"Grape Escape"}}}
