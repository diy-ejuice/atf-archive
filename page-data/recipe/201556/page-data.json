This recipe is based on an Australian favourite confectionery that is simply delicious yet extremely complex to replicate in an eLiquid.\r\nThe name of the product called \"Resdskins\" apparently makes some people in the American culture scream \"That is just wrong!\".\r\nI won't lie, I don't understand what offense this causes nor have any knowledge of the sensitivities of native America. So as to not cause an unintended offense, I have called this recipe \"Red Faces\".\r\nI have called it that because maybe I should know more about the subject, but hey I'm never to old to learn right?\r\nIn saying that let's get on with the recipe that has been the most challenging yet in my 4 years plus of mixing.\r\n\r\nAfter 15 variations over the last few weeks and many many more over the years this is the nearest to justice I can do for this flavour profile.\r\nThe \"Allens Redskins\" is a legendary confectionery in Australia that is like a raspberry hard chew candy that is sweet, tart and little sour, slightly fruity but uniquely delicious.\r\nI have to hand it to the genius who first created this profile because cracking the code of flavour on this is near impossible.\r\nYou have to concentrate REALLY hard because there are artificial fruity back notes like apple and pineapple. The Raspberry is extremely distinctive and that was very difficult to nail down.\r\nHence I had to create a 321 confectionery Raspberry trilogy to get even close. Accenting that trilogy was a balancing act of attempting to replicate the same flavour and mouthfeel and has an 11/10 difficulty ratio.\r\n\r\nThe slight creaminess and smoothness is also difficult to pin down.\r\nThe lingering of the slightly sour & tart notes you get in the real thing is also amazingly difficult to get right without muting the overall base of flavour.\r\nThe flavour saturation of the real thing is insane!\r\n\r\nTo emulate that level of flavour saturation in a vape eLiquid would mean using at least using 30 plus percent of flavourings, while at the same time it would make it sickly sweet after a few short puffs.\r\nSo to make this an enjoyable vape I have taken the middle ground of enjoyable vape Vs over sweetened and exaggerated flavour.\r\nThis is the closest I can do to entertain this near impossible flavour.\r\nIt's delicious, but it comes with some pre-conditions to experience what I have done here:\r\n\r\n- it needs 3-5 days to steep.\r\n- there are NO SUBS\r\n- It needs to be mixed at 70VG/30PG\r\n- It needs to be vaped on a quality RDA with airflow semi restricted at least 75w-90w on a 0.10-0.15 ohm dual coils or similar set up with wattage/resistance allowed for on a single coil RDA.\r\n(You can vape it on another device and Wattage but it won't necessarily be the same - let me know what you tried it on)\r\n\r\n- You need to vape it through for at least 5-10 puffs to get the lingering notes that deliver all the nuances.\r\n\r\nI have set out, as I do with all my recipes to make this an enjoyable vape experience. Converting a real life confectionery into an eLiquid is difficult and this was seriously the most difficult recipe I have created ever!\r\nI could either write a 16 page PDF on flavour notes & on how I came to use all the flavours here the way I did ect., but let's keep this simple & enjoyable.\r\nI think this is a very good rendition of this much sought after recipe profile, but let me know what you think. :)\r\n\r\nEnjoy!\r\n\r\nIf this was a commercial or custom recipe I would charge heaps for it!\r\nI fully own this recipe and if I learn that you have used this for commercial use I will hunt you down because I DO NOT give permission for use of this recipe other than for private personal use only.\r\n\r\nI strongly urge you all to please advocate so that not just you and me can enjoy a smoke free future but also those who haven't experienced what we have yet!\r\n\r\nAdvocacy:\r\nYou aren't going to steal my RED FACES Mr Hunt!\r\nNot on my watch Mr. Hunt!\r\nAustralia is currently in a massive battle to save our industry from planned legislation that would effectively make nicotine almost inaccessible.\r\nWe only have til January 1, 2021 leaving us only a few months to try and turn this around.\r\nPlease stay informed and keep up to date with all the calls to action via the DIY Downunder FB page.\r\nhere: facebook.com/groups/diydownunder/\r\n\r\nSeriously if you like a solid recipe that works give it a go!\r\n\r\nCheers for reading this far, now go and get mixing!\r\nEnjoy!\r\n\r\n\"Together, Let's Discover!!!\"\r\n\r\nFacebook - https://www.facebook.com/groups/diydownunder/\r\n\r\nYoutube - https://www.youtube.com/c/diydownunder\r\n\r\nInstagram IGTV : @diydownunder","steep_days":"5","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"total_reviews":1,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T12:48:29.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"1416","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Cotton Candy","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":900},{"name":"Golden Pineapple","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":600},{"name":"Green Apple Hard Candy","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Raspberry","vendor":"INW","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Raspberry (sweet)","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Red Raspberry","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Sour Blue Raspberry Candy","vendor":"WF","millipercent":3300},{"name":"Sour Wizard","vendor":"FA","millipercent":300},{"name":"Super Sweet","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":600},{"name":"Vanilla Ice Cream","vendor":"LB","millipercent":1100}],"reviews":[{"user":"cxxxxp","score":"none","text":"I'm just waiting on WF Sour Blue Raspberry Candy to get here, I can't wait to mix this up, especially given all the effort that has clearly gone into this one Pippa!"}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"201556","name":"Red Faces"}}}
