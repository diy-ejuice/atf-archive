It's a little lacking in the fullness department, so I used the bold taste of Black for Pipe to boost it up. Clove isn't too strong at 0.5% and it adds a spice friend for the liquorice. \r\n\r\nINW Whisky is a flavor I've really fallen in love with. It's quite strong, so even at 0.75% it is very noticeable. I'm amazed at how Oak Wood seems to have \"soaked\" up the whiskey and created a booze-infused wood taste. \r\n\r\nBlack Fire and DNB add smoke and ash respectively. These two flavors pop up in tobacco recipes for a reason- they're delicious!","steep_days":"10","temperature":"0","recipe_score":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-12T08:12:56.000-05:00","best_vg":"50%","views":"1358","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Black Jack Tobacco","flavor_id":"714","vendor":"INW","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Classic For Pipe Black","flavor_id":"764","vendor":"INW","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Tobacco Dirty Neutral (dnb)","flavor_id":"2186","vendor":"INW","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Oak Wood","flavor_id":"470","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Whisky","flavor_id":"891","vendor":"INW","millipercent":750},{"name":"Black Fire","flavor_id":"458","vendor":"FA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Clove","flavor_id":"492","vendor":"FA","millipercent":500}],"reviews":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"63287","name":"Agent Peña"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
