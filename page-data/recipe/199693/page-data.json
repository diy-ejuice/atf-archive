Rich and creamy. Vanilla Ice Cream and Milky Undertone is the milkshake base. I chose FW graham cracker because I like the spice notes I get from it. Glamour chocolate with a hint of sweet coconut reminds me of a Hershey's chocolate bar. Toasted marshmallow because it's an accurate toasted marshmallow. Sweeten to taste and enjoy! I had a video shot for this mix but my dumb ass didn't hit record!","steep_days":"5","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:51:39.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"1170","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Cream Milky Undertone PG","vendor":"OOO","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Glamour Chocolate","vendor":"MB","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Graham Cracker","vendor":"FW","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Sweet Coconut","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":250},{"name":"Toasted Marshmallow","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Vanilla Ice Cream","vendor":"LB","millipercent":3000}],"reviews":[{"user":"RdaJunkie","text":"I’m a sucker for s’mores vapes. I’m already burnt out on summer fruit vapes and this definitely scratched that fall time itch. Perfect balance off the shake. Can’t wait to see how it develops. I think I’ll be mixing a bunch of this come fall. Nice work"},{"user":"lndscapr","text":"Looked really tasty, so I mixed up a batch before bed. Smells amazing. cant wait to steep it out! Update- I had to taste. Now can't put it down. wish I had made more in my first batch to see how it develops over a month or 6 weeks, but there is no way 17ml will last .
