It took about 60 or more attempts at getting this as close to the original as I could. If you mix this exactly as it's posted you will immediately recognize that familiar smell, but give it at least 5-7 days steep to really let the flavors come together.","steep_days":"7","temperature":"70","recipe_score":4.6,"total_reviews":9,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:49:21.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"24665","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Sweet Guava","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":7000},{"name":"Sweet Tangerine","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Dragon Fruit","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Passion (passionfruit)","vendor":"FA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Ethyl Maltol","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":400},{"name":"Super Sweet","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":600}],"reviews":[{"user":"Seakow","score":"5","text":"This is always my go to recipe to mix when I'm getting tired of heavy tobaccos or creams, damn good sir."},{"user":"MediocreVibes","score":"2","text":"POG is my ADV and unfortunately, for me, this doesn't taste like it. It's a decent mix but it isn't what I was expecting or wanted. 3 stars for me is finishing my 30 mL mix. I couldn't even do 20 mL of it. Might be great to some but to me, meh. I wanted other things and never even wanted to finish mine. 2/5"},{"user":"Deetzz","score":"4","text":"Awesome ADV, Epic Summer Vibe Juice"},{"user":"cincinnatiking","score":"5","text":"This is an excellent recipe. It is my first time trying a tropical flavored recipe, and this was a great start! The flavors blend great together. The Sweet Tangerine really comes through on the exhale. That's me trying to sound like I know what I'm talking about. Anyway, great tasting mix!

This is a damn addictive mix."},{"user":"MrBurgundy","score":"5","text":"I haven't had the original, but holy mackerel this is a tasty recipe. It's a wonderfully balanced vape that smells like pineapples. The flavor blossoms into a magnetic blend of P, O, and G. The Passionfruit has a slight floral note that really adds an interesting flair to the recipe. Excellent work, Gwandrei. Thanks for sharing!"},{"user":"SweetPoisonKim","score":"5","text":"Never had the original; and don't need to now. This is lovely. I did use TFA Dragonfruit as I didn't have CAP but it's still tasty. It's juicy and fruity, enjoying it very much! Good job sir üëç"},{"user":"Wodde","score":"5","text":"great Summervape, i enjoy it very much :)"}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"48703","name":"Hawaiian Pog Remix"}}}
