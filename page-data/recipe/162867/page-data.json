And i didn’t find it to be very cheesy or cheesecaked . so i added some flavors to make it more  “authentic “ all i did was add caps sweet cream at 0.25% and caps new york cheesecake at 0.5 % and it made it a whole lot better you can probably even bring new york cheesecake up to 1 % if you want more cheesecake .

Only a few days into the steep and I had to give it a couple drips and as it turns out, this is the second Golden Oreo Recipe that I really enjoy.  The other being \"Golden Oreo Pudding\" by @Deejay-mills . Not overpowering with the cheese.  Nice and balanced.  Good joB! Update.. *****this stuff is superb.  Keeps getting better and better.
