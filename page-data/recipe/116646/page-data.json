TPA-Hpno Type is the blue citrus foundation.  The FA-Jamaica Special is a delicious rum flavoring but it lacks the alcohol feel that the VT-Light Rum brings to the mix.   The FA-Coconut and INW-Pineapple add a tropical flare to it.  The TPA-Ginger Ale helps to lighten it up and then I threw in a splash of VT-Bitters for good measure.  \r\n\r\n***You can also add some sweetener and a cooling agent if you like.
