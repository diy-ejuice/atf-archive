I have chased the fruit punch recipe a few times, but always get side tracked.  I wasn't able to add TPA Champagne, but was a decent vape as S&amp;V.  Taste good as S&amp;V, will see what a few days does for it.  The fruit punch is not as up front as I am looking for, and sour may be a little high for me.  This definitely helps me, seeing the Citrus Punch . Sour added.  After the steep, I will try to update my review."}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"69570","name":"Moana fruit punch"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
