My recent obsession is Jammie Dodgers . . . jammy, gummy, raspberry filling between two shortbread cookies . . . kind of sweet and kind of savory.  This is my take on that with a mixed berry filling instead.  Good right away, but, given about seven days for the flavors to marry, it gets better with time.  Took a few cues from nickev's Jam'n'Cream (https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/153015#jam_n_cream_by_nickevz), but most of the inspiration was munching on the actual snack.  Enjoy!
