I made Pillow Talk, but I found the Peppermint too weak and did not like the cream flavor from the Vanilla Bean Gelato. I was looking for a light creamy vanilla with a firm peppermint flavor.\r\n\r\nTPA Peppermint is a much stronger and better tasting Peppermint IMHO - I tried different levels and settled on this as the best, but YMMV\r\nCAP Simply Vanilla and TPA Vanilla Swirl provides a very light vanilla creamy note to the recipe\r\nFA Meringue and FA Cream Fresh adds mouthfeel and bolsters the creaminess of the Vanilla Swirl\r\nTPA Marshmallow is used for sweetness and fullness with little to no Marshmallow flavor\r\nEM (Cotton Candy) adds a little more perceived sweetness. One could argue that TPA Marshmallow already provides enough EM, and that may be true and worth further investigation. I don't notice any off flavors with this EM addition\r\n\r\nI found steeping this for 7 days minimum works the best to smooth out the peppermint and raise the cream up.\r\n","steep_days":"7","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-05T04:16:18.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"1040","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Peppermint","flavor_id":"283","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Marshmallow","flavor_id":"332","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Meringue","flavor_id":"530","vendor":"FA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Cream Fresh","flavor_id":"540","vendor":"FA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Vanilla Swirl","flavor_id":"189","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Simply Vanilla","flavor_id":"111","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Ethyl Maltol 10%","flavor_id":"2311","vendor":"OTHR","millipercent":1000}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"69204","name":"P V & C"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
