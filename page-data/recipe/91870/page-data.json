This is the only juice my hubby will vape. He said he would only vape it if it was spot on. None of the remixes out there are even close. To my surprise chubby bubble doesn't have any bubble gum flavoring in it. I believe the boysenberry gives it a bubblegum feel.\r\n\r\nI realized after single flavor testing, chubby is made with FW flavors.\r\n\r\nFw Blue razz- kind of an unusual blue razz flavor to me very difficult to describe. More of a bright sweet raspberry with a very candy feel.\r\n\r\nFw Cotton candy- self explanatory. Adds sweetness from within.\r\n\r\nFW raspberry- this raspberry has slight floral notes. It is more of a candy raspberry flavor bright but not sweet.\r\n\r\nFW Boysenberry- I believe this adds a boost to the raspberry while adding a berry bubble gum flavor.\r\n\r\nIf you don't like sweetner don't add it. This is a remix of a commercial juice so guess what lots of sweetner.","steep_days":"5 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-06T23:07:42.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"3335","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Blue Raspberry","flavor_id":"1200","vendor":"FW","millipercent":6000},{"name":"Cotton Candy","flavor_id":"1259","vendor":"FW","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Raspberry","flavor_id":"1391","vendor":"FW","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Boysenberry","flavor_id":"1206","vendor":"FW","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Super Sweet","flavor_id":"2384","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1000}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"91870","name":"CHUBBY BUBBLE RAZZ #REMIX"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
