I'll come back after the steep......5 days later......&#xD;\noh man..I love the way these pair up. &#xD;\nIt/s been waaaay more than 5 days cause I've mixed this recipe at least 5 times now.&#xD;\nIt's really hard to let it steep to where it blooms let alone letting it go full term, I keep trying andf I also keep failing.&#xD;\nTRhis is definately one of my favorite recipes so far. I love it.&#xD;\nOh My God Dude..I thought I would try a sample after a 5 day steep and holy hell. I vaped through the whole 15ml test batch without putting it down until it was gone...&#xD;\nI wanted to put a nipple on it. It's really that good. Great recipe!!&#xD;\nNow I have to mix up some bigger batches and try to let it steep! I can't even imagine how good it would be after 2 weeks...I'll probably never know..&#xD;\n"}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"103167","name":"Pineapple Caramel Cheesecake"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
