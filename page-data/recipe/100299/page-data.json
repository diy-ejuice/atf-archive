That is pretty spot on. It's a really good sour green apple jolly rancher flavor, that I really like with a good bit of cooling. Feel free to omit the cooling for just a spot on swamp thang.\r\n\r\nIt's great on a shake and vape and pretty much no real changes to me after an overnight steep, only a tad smoother (though it is pretty smooth off the shake) due to the ethyl alcohol in tfa apple candy.","steep_days":"1 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-12T11:51:51.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"1748","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Apple Candy","flavor_id":"206","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":8000},{"name":"Hard Candy","flavor_id":"1308","vendor":"FW","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Sour","flavor_id":"336","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"WS-23","flavor_id":"8085","vendor":"OTHR","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Super Sweet","flavor_id":"2384","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":250}],"reviews":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"100299","name":"Swamp Thang Remix On Ice"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
