I added golden syrup, molasses, and flv caramel to make it dark and sticky sweet and wanted more of a caramel note so I added tfa caramel original which is a pretty rich tasting caramel. FA apple pie is the perfect flaky pie crust. The gingerbread adds another dimension with just a taste of spice. None of the real treacle tarts or crack pies have gingerbread but I felt like I needed another layer to make it not so flat and pastry zest did not work.
