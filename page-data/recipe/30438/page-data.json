The peanut butter TFA is a must have in this recipe as it is the best when making these nice peanut butter pastry or ice cream type of flavors. The Vanilla custard from Capellas V1 is great as it takes the place of TFA VBIC  as it fits better in this recipe bringing the the balanced vanilla flavoring to the recipe. The caramel from helps to make the PB really pop in this recipe. The Vienna cream really brings in that nice Vanilla taste and  Gives the recipe the perfect amount of sweetness. Last the Cream fresh is a must when making a milkshake it really blends that milkyness and malt together for the perfect Milkshake flavor. Perfect flavor when steeped 5-7 days.
