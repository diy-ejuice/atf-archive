Off the shake and on the inhale I'm getting a soft cake and some sweetness, the exhale seems to be slightly creamy with remnants of cake, I'll give it the recommended 5 day steep then try again, but it's a pleasant light cake n cream at the moment. Definitely worth mixing. ","score":5},{"user":"DIYDownunderPippa","text":"This looks lovely! I'm looking at this as a nice \"stone\" recipe to build off to taste. For example I could add some Lemon,Banana, strawberry, chocolate or other yummyness to taste! Nice job Mark! :) Thank You!
