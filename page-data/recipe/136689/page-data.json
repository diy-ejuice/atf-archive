It is a drink made of fruits and / or berries (fresh or dried) or a combination of both. \r\n\r\nTop: Dragon Fruit with its smooth and mellow flavor is paired with a dark but vibrant Pomegranate flavor. Together, they are the core this recipe is built upon. To add contrast to these dark red fruits, as well as add a level of brightness; Glazed Strawberry and Strawberry, Sweet (JF) were added. Together these two strawberries make for a fresh, sweet and sticky Strawberry flavor. \r\n\r\nBase: To give this warm, thick, and syrupy beverage body and weight - Quince and Pear were added. Quince and Pear, with their fleshy, smooth and dense texture stabilize and soften the tarter mixed fruits in this recipe; adding with them subtle notes of a Rome apple and a sweet cooked Red Bartlett styled pear. These two flavors also compliment the soft pear-like notes I find in the Dragon Fruit. \r\n\r\nTo finish off this fruity recipe and add a layer of juicy citrus zest, Sweet Orange was added along with a touch of Sweetener ‚Äì to help complete the sweet beverage profile.
