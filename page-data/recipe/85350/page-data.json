It's a damn good custard and I always wanted to try and make my own.\r\n\r\nThe flavor is described as \"Custard with a dash of custard. Flaunts layers of vanilla, cream, and subtle sweetness.\" it's also been said that there is a hint of chocolate detected. \r\n\r\nAfter many months of searching and my own testing this is where I have arrived at. On to the notes!\r\n\r\nHOLY JESUS THAT'S A LOT OF CUSTARD: Yes, that is indeed 6% custard you are seeing. It is the main note of the recipe and is definitely what takes command here. This is the main reason that the steep time is so long (That and CAP NY Cheesecake makes this a sitter as well). I also tried 4 and 5 percent but they really didn't give that in your face custard that No. 51 has. The \"Dash\" of custard is where CAP NY Cheesecake comes in. From my research and my own testing NY Cheesecake has some custard notes on it's own, and definitely creates that extra, but different, dash of custard taste (with a little bit of stank on it). All in all this is supposed to have a pretty dense mouth feel, so a combination of CAP Vanilla Cupcake and CAP Cake Batter help with that. CAP Vanilla Cupcake helps with the vanilla notes as well.\r\n\r\nVanilla & Cream: For the other recipes I found trying to create this they all seem to have some sort of French Vanilla added, since this recipe has a CAP theme anyway I decided to go with French Vanilla V1. It's definitely a great vanilla and was a standard of mine before Holy Vanilla came into my life. Holy Vanilla is more of a grainy vanilla though and we definitely wanted to stay more on the creamy side, so Holy Vanilla is not a sub for CAP. The cream really comes from the entirety of the recipe, all the flavors in this recipe have their own creamy note, so the combination of them creates that profile.\r\n\r\nSubtle Sweetness: I think this is where some people say they are getting a chocolate note. I tried a few different chocolates but I've really been enjoying FLV Milk Chocolate in this. Now this stuff is STRONG, it can easily take over the rest of the notes in a recipe, so the % you see is all you need (around 2 drops/30ml). 0.25% and above really just overrides everything else, and with 6% Vanilla Custard I didn't think that would be possible. at 0.15% it gives just that subtle chocolate note on the exhale.\r\n\r\nThis is how far I've come and I hope you enjoy it! This has by far been one of my favorites lately. Please be sure to leave a review. I always appreciate constructive criticism.","steep_days":"14","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:49:53.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"2139","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Vanilla Custard","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":6000},{"name":"French Vanilla","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":2000},{"name":"New York Cheesecake","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Cake Batter","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Vanilla Cupcake","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Milk Chocolate","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":150}],"reviews":[{"user":"Seakow","text":"Top notch, grade A, heroin right here!
