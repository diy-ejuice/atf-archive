They all kinda sucked. I stumbled upon a website called Ms. T's Bakery. Everything sounded great, but I only ordered their strawberry shortcake. About 2 months went by and I finally received my 10ml of strawberry shortcake. It blew my mind. I didn't think e liquid could taste this good. Naturally I went through this juice in a few day (on an eGo mind you). When I tried to reorder a message appeared telling me that Ms. T was temporarily closed. They never reopened. The market is much different now. They have everything. Except for what I would consider a solid strawberry shortcake. I was mixing some batches for friends last week when I decided to go for it. No thoughts, just pure impulse, as I picked ingredients that sounded right and percentages that made sense to me. \r\n\r\nHere we have what I consider to be as close to a strawberry shortcake vape as I have ever had. Sorry to other shortcake posters, as I have not tried your mixes. \r\n\r\nI was not going for an ice cream bar but more of a thick, spongy cake. I wanted it light and gentle. Words like \"delicate\" or \"fluffy\" come to mind. I wanted strawberry to sit in the middle to the background a bit. I went with more TFA Strawberry than TFA Strawberry (ripe) to maybe get a more pie filling/candy strawberry. As you draw in you get a bready, possibly cereal flavor. It slowly morphs to a cake then a smooth, sweet strawberry as it leaves you palate. It isn't quite intense enough to stop you from vaping it all day. The lingering strawberry makes you want more and more. Sometimes you can get an excellent strawberry cream cheese type of flavor. Other times it is more cake and cream. \r\n\r\nI think every friend and family member that tried it last weekend took a puff and said \"shit..that's good!\". And trust me when I say they will let me know if it needs to go in the garbage.\r\n\r\nGive it a try, I would imagine most people have these flavors in their arsenal after mixing up manson's pebbles and God Milk. At such low percentages too. It might not be the best recipe or a great one, but I feel like I nailed what I was going for and it is an all day vape for me. \r\n\r\nEdit: It may be more of a strawberry cake. Try it at 60/40. My 80/20 mix smells fantastic. It just needs more pg because of the low percentages in this mix. I think I like where it is at. \r\n\r\nI welcome any adjustments you guys feel it could use.
