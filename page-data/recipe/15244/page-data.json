I subbed the sucralose for Tfa french vanilla creme and TFA marshmallow. JF yellow cake to replace the FW yellow cake but still need EM to blend and sweeten all the creams. This is an awesome recipe that from the moment you mix it you CAN VAPE IT! And you wont stop until the bottle is finished, Enjoy this awesome recipe and know that it will NOT kill your coils or wicks. Keep in mind I vape max VG around 90 watts so if you need to turn down everything by 20% that's totally fine. ID10-T this ones for you my friend, Thank you for the Miami Vice I will vape that on my deathbed some day.","steep_days":"3","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:48:49.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"3916","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"French Vanilla Creme","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Marshmallow","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Sweet Cream","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Yellow Cake","vendor":"JF","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Vanilla Custard","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Cream Fresh","vendor":"FA","millipercent":750},{"name":"Ethyl Maltol","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1250},{"name":"Meringue","vendor":"FA","millipercent":750},{"name":"Vanilla Sponge Cake","vendor":"BF","millipercent":200},{"name":"Pandoro","vendor":"FA","millipercent":750}],"reviews":[{"user":"jyroe","text":"slight lemon note from pandoro but amazing none the less."}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"15244","name":"The safer Twinkie "}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
