This flavor also has a nice smoky flavor from the Ry4 double then add the graham cracker and biscuit to give it that nice flaky crust flavor to it. This is an ADV recipe for those Heavy Coffee Drinkers like myself. The Butter cream really rounds out this recipe giving it body and the perfect amount of sweetness without being to overpowering. The caramel just mixes so well with the RY4. You could substitute Caramel from FA as  well. I just prefer TFA in this recipe for me. The Cheesecake and vanilla custard round out this recipe to give that nice custard taste that many Vapers enjoy. Try this recipe, it might just be the all day vape your looking for.
