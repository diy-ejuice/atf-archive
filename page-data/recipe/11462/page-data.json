This one I mix thoroughly for at least a couple of minutes and heat up in the baby bottle warmer for 30 minutes.  Then I let cool topless.  Since it is a creamy vape I let this one sit in a cool dark place for at least a week before I vape.  The longer you wait the better I've let it set for 2 weeks and it is amazing.","steep_days":"0","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T05:56:47.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"1176","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Bavarian Cream","flavor_id":"145","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":5000},{"name":"Sweetener","flavor_id":"1508","vendor":"LB","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Cake Batter","flavor_id":"22","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":6000},{"name":"Dragonfruit","flavor_id":"226","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":4000}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"11462","name":"Sweet Dreams"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
