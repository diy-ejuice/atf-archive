Zeppola, Biscuit, Joy, and Sugar Cookie work great as the base of this doughnut recipe.  the Sweet Cream and Vanilla custard create the custard part of this.  Cream Cheese Icing, and Rick's Sugar Daddy is the sweetener.  Did I mention this is sweet?  Great doughnut to vape while drinking a cup of black coffee.  I vaped 120 mls of this fairly quickly after the steep, because it hit my craving for sweets.  A quick warning to let this steep, not only for the creamy custard, but that Joy because it will taste like stale beer if you don't let that Joy steep, trust me on this.
