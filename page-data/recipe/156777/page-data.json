We decided to make sweet rice the star as this is a rice pudding.  The VT Yoghurt drink makes adds a citrus cream to the rice and the bavarian cream gives it some thickness and mouthfeel.  Next up was the accents.  Needed a hint of vanilla, pistachio and cinnamon so I used those recipes a bit low for what they offer.","steep_days":"1 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:51:01.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"1415","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Sweet Rice","flavor_id":"7727","vendor":"FE","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Yoghurt Drink","flavor_id":"9901","vendor":"VT","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Armenia (apricot)","flavor_id":"507","vendor":"FA","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Bavarian Cream","flavor_id":"145","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Pistachio","flavor_id":"293","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Vanilla Swirl","flavor_id":"189","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Cinnamon Sugar","flavor_id":"8741","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":3000}],"reviews":[{"user":"ID10-T","text":"Can’t comment on authenticity to the actual food but this is interesting and delicious. Love the creamy rice pudding with hints of citrus and vanilla and a slight hint of cinnamon. Pistachio gets enhanced by the nuttiness of the rice and seems to be more than just a hint. It’s coming across as one of the main flavors to me, along with the rice and sweet apricot, but it’s lovely. &#xD;\n"}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"156777","name":"Lebanese Rice Pudding"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
