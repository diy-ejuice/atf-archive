I've been playing around with some combinations of Jango and other fruits off and on and this is the first one worth sharing. Sweet, ripe mango with bright, juicy watermelon.

UPDATE:  I finally got around to trying this, and I loved the original.  But somehow I've vaped through 10ml of this thinking there was FLV Cream in it when there shouldn't be.  I really don't think there's enough golden pineapple in this to send the whole thing wonky, but I'm sure it wasn't the watermelon either.  It's still a good recipe, but to me there was something in it that just seemed a little off.","score":3}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"60862","name":"Jango's Melons"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
