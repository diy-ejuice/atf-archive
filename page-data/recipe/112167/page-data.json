On the back end is when you get the moist cookie dough.  If you get nail polish from Vienna cream wait five days.  Thatâ€™s all I could give it.  Once I tasted it it was gone lol.

It is very cream forward, and that part is done well. I love Vienna Cream in all ice creams, just gives an almost authentic flavor to me, LB is an amazing ice cream as well. The issue I had with it, the pairing of Cookie Dough, and Cream and Cookies, turned into a very coffee-esque taste to me. I love cookie dough, solo and in mixes. I feel the addition to the cream and cookies turned it into a burnt coffee for me. The mix was a great ice cream though, and in my taste, if I enjoyed coffee vapes then this would be even better, but it missed the mark to me.
