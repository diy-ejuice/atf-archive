Kentucky Blend pairs really well with Red Burley. The Tatanka I used it for a every so slight sticky chewing tobacco type note.","steep_days":"10","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T20:32:43.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"1177","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Barrel Oak","vendor":"VT","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Black Fire","vendor":"FA","millipercent":250},{"name":"Red Burley","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Kentucky Blend","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Tatanka Tobacco","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":500},{"name":"Whiskey","vendor":"FW","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Cream","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1000}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"117502","name":"Banjo Music"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
