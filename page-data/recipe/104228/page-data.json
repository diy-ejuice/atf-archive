The Butter Pecan emphasizes the cereal texture and bends that corn flavor into the nutty side of AP. Salted Caramel and Creme Brulee combine for a subtle toasted caramel note that goes really well with the nutty cereal. It’s not a very creamy Creme Brulee, instead focusing on the Brulee aspect which makes it stand out from the crowd. It’s different, and I like that. Really tasty stuff, Mark!"},{"user":"TamVapes","score":"5","text":"Mixed this 10 days ago, I have been vaping on this for about 5 days, It only gets better.  Well done recipe.
