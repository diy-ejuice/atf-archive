Whiskey drinks are my favorite and since I can't go out for drinks right now this is my escapism\"\r\n\r\nAs a devout vodka guy (mostly), the closest I get to whiskey is jack and coke, or if the joint (or plane) is fancy enough, Jack and ginger (preferred with honey jack)...so I had to look around the net. \r\n\r\nThen I found the Whiskey Smash.\r\nThen I found a variant that was made with cucumber and mint muddled with a LOT of limeade, and garnished with lime wedges.\r\n\r\nWith all that green, and whiskey...30 more seconds on the internet of searching for an image, and I bring you the Smashed Hulk.
