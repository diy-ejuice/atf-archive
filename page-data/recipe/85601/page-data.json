The profile is an Iced Blueberry Lavender Tea Latte. It has taken A LOT of development to get to this final product, but I am finally satisfied with it. Mix and enjoy!\r\n\r\nFlavor Comments:\r\nBlueberry Wild (TPA): The perfect blueberry to pair with lavender. It is an earthy, floral and dry blueberry. At 3% it accentuates the lavender very effectively and adds a more subtle natural blueberry.\r\n\r\nCondensed Milk (PUR): After using Cream Fresh (FA) for all previous batches I found it worked but gave it a pretty noticable milk funk. So I finally decided to try Condensed Milk (PUR) and it was a perfect fit. Had all the notes Cream Fresh (FA) has without the funk. Perfect.\r\n\r\nLavender (FA): Probably the best lavender on the market. Very natural. Definitely the right choice for this profile.\r\n\r\nMarshmallow (FA): Been with this recipe since the beginning. Not sure why, but the authentic marshmallow root flavor works so well with the lavender. Also adds some thickness.\r\n\r\nMilk & Honey (FLV): I really don't know why I didn't think to use this cream sooner. It really gives it that latte heated milk taste. The honey adds plenty of sweetness and a nice floral note. The milk is authentic with no funk. Just perfect.\r\n\r\nPeppermint (TPA): Gives this recipe the herbal tea note and also adds a nice iced quality. This flavor can be pretty powerful so keeping it lower is key.","steep_days":"5","temperature":"0","recipe_score":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-10T16:00:33.000-05:00","best_vg":"80%","views":"759","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Blueberry (wild)","flavor_id":"215","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Marshmallow","flavor_id":"473","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Lavender","flavor_id":"510","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Peppermint","flavor_id":"283","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":400},{"name":"Milk & Honey","flavor_id":"609","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Condensed Milk","flavor_id":"7751","vendor":"PUR","millipercent":1000}],"reviews":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"85601","name":"Lavendum Borealis"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
