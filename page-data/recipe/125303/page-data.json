I just made 200ml of this so am sorted for a supply of this for now, time to make some 10ml experiments !\r\n\r\nI've been playing with adding some chocolate direct into a nearly empty tank of this to get a Bourbon Cream (similar biscuit but with cocoa), hasn't worked yet, I only have two choc flavours (TFA double chocolate & Chef's Vapours chocolate concentrate) and neither is even close, if anyone has any suggestions for a good choc/cocoa to use, I'll buy it and try it.\r\n\r\nVaping it on a Radar RDA dual alien .22 ohm setup, mixed at 50/50 with 3mg of Nic, though I make 50/50 with pretty much every recipe so it's not a specific recommendation for this recipe.","steep_days":"14","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"updated_at":"2020-12-12T15:40:15.000-05:00","best_vg":"50%","views":"2238","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Sweet Cream","flavor_id":"183","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Vanilla Custard","flavor_id":"131","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":6000},{"name":"Biscuit","flavor_id":"642","vendor":"INW","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Bavarian Cream","flavor_id":"2","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":500},{"name":"Acetyl Pyrazine 5%","flavor_id":"1709","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":500}],"reviews":[{"user":"mk36","text":"Very good recipe.
