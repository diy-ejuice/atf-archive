It's hard to put down! (I still had some old INW MC left hehe) "},{"user":"super8line","text":"I usually only ever mix any recipe a few times at most, even ones I really like.  I just can't stay interested in anything for very long.  This recipe is so good I've mixed it at least 6 times in two months now.  Not a fan of chocolate vapes but like the description says - even if you're not a chocolate fan give it chance. "},{"user":"HeadBlade911","text":"Very smooth.
