The chocolate and cream taste perfect, but the strawberry taste really green gonna see if it calms down with a longer steep. Maybe lowering the Cap SB and cream and adding a more syrupy SB such as INW Shisha Strawberry could help as well. &#xD;\n&#xD;\nEdit: I originally gave this 4 stars after trying it after a week steep, but now after 3 weeks steep it is definitely better all the notes I didn’t like from SB have faded out.
