A historical look at the recipe origins of this midwest favorite gives many clues as to the ingredients.  Bottom line, it is a raspberry and lemon profile.  It's not blue, but it sure makes you think it is.  No Name Craft Eliquids is a fan favorite line of juices, and for those that are familiar with the line know that Blue Moon is their most popular liquid next to SPF 15.  \r\n\r\nMost Remixs I consider as rock solid once they get to the 70% mark in terms of replication.  Nailing them down exactly is near impossible, but getting the profile right is most of the battle.  In this case?  I think I am at 90%!  This is the closest I have come to replicating an exact juice. It is hands down one of my favorites of all time, and I have gone through many iterations leading up to this recipe. \r\n\r\nThe base of this recipe is VBIC, and it stands out.  However, there is a creaminess beyond that with slight coconut undertones at higher watts.  Enter CGC.  The CGC adds a buttery richness that occasionally gives you the effect in the original liquid.  Adding some Biscuit to the mix moves the buttery cream effect even higher and closer to the original.  Vanilla Swirl pumps up the vanilla profile a bit to keep it from getting too cheesecake like. Additionally, it maintains the sweet and buttery effect the original recipe is known for.\r\n\r\nWhat is left is the blue effect, and was the most daunting part in creating this REMIX.  I went through all of the flavor houses finding the right main profile for this liquid.  Raspberry Sweet is it.  Combined with FA Strawberry makes it spot on.  The final piece of this mix was the percentage of Lemon to include and what brand.  While I don't think ECX lemon is the particular lemon used in the original, I do think it is the best lemon out there.  It is here with just enough of a percentage to make the raspberry \"blue\".\r\n\r\nWhile I have made many tasty variations of Blue Moon along the way in my journey, these are the percentages that make it a REMIX as close to replication as I could come. \r\n\r\nIf you have tried Blue Moon by No Name Craft Eliquids, sit back and relax. It is finally here in DIY form.  I am very proud of how close this is to the original.  As with all my mixes, this is an 80% vg liquid made using a dripper pushing 5.8 volts.\r\n\r\nCuda\r\n\r\n","steep_days":"1","temperature":"0","recipe_score":4.7,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:49:25.000-05:00","best_vg":"80%","views":"5119","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Raspberry (sweet)","flavor_id":"267","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Lemon","flavor_id":"1655","vendor":"FE","millipercent":350},{"name":"Biscuit","flavor_id":"642","vendor":"INW","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Cheesecake (graham Crust)","flavor_id":"152","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Vanilla Bean Ice Cream","flavor_id":"186","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Vanilla Swirl","flavor_id":"189","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Red Touch (strawberry)","flavor_id":"421","vendor":"FA","millipercent":2000}],"reviews":[{"user":"Trista_C","text":"Really enjoyed this one!

I Never had the real stuff but dont care this is super satisfying"},{"user":"SixStrings952","text":"I've not had the original brand name version. Nor have I ever had real Blue Moon Ice Cream. However, this recipe looked so damned good that I immediately made a 30ml when I saw your post. It was so great fresh. And now after the recommended steep, it's even better! I honestly haven't put this down. Your chosen concentrates and percentages are so perfect that I wouldn't change a thing. This morning I'm making a bigger bottle for my girl because she can't keep her hands off of it! You're amazing. And you should be very proud of your work on this. Definitely ADV worthy. Many MANY thanks for sharing! "}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"53058","name":"Blue Moon Remix of No Name Craft Eliquids "}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
