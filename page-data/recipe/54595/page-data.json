It's a sweet and creamy hazelnut donut. At first I was having a hell of a time getting the hazelnut where I wanted it. I wanted it to feel integrated with the donut instead of sitting on the side. After some trial and error, I found that TFA peanut butter was my answer. This made something closer to a hazelnut butter that give this recipe a feeling of a donut with hazelnut butter filling. I really can't put this one down, going to be one of my ADV from now on.","steep_days":"21","temperature":"0","recipe_score":4.3,"total_reviews":3,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:49:28.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"2869","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Bavarian Cream","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Hazelnut","vendor":"FW","millipercent":500},{"name":"Peanut Butter","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Sweetener","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Zeppola","vendor":"FA","millipercent":3500}],"reviews":[{"user":"BananaSlamma","score":"4","text":"This is a damn good donut. The peanut butter and hazelnut combination really make for a sweet and enticing profile. Zeppola drives it all home. Itâ€™s become my wake and vape and pairs really well with my morning coffee.

My testing notes say simply, \"Dunkin Stix\""},{"user":"Deftohms","score":"5","text":"This is really good. Ever since I've gotten zeppola I've been disappointed, felt it only fit a very specific profile. I mixed this about a week ago and let it steep so the pb and zeppola can calm down, this turned out to be something I'll definitely be mixing a lot of. Thank you for an awesome mix!"}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"54595","name":"Hazelnut Donut"}}}
