Super sweet is optional\r\nThis also really pops. With 1% fa sour wizard  \r\nI haven't single flavor test most of these flavors so i dont have great notes for them. I'm sorry. But here's what i do know. \r\n\r\nCap blue jam... is kinda gross. Pretty floral and just plain wierd. I normaly dont like the way regular blueberry turns out in a razz mix like fw or tpa blueberry  so i just randomly thought mabey cap blue jam could work. And to my suprise it did.. It's super strong and pungent and i though that might be pretty useful because.... \r\n\r\nInw  rasp. There is absuletly no doubt in my mind that it in blue jolly ranchers. I love it its good it smells amazing but anything over 1 percent will over power nearly anything imo. But i always long for more inw rasp in a mix  and thats where the blue jam comes into play. \r\nI wanted I kind of balanced the inw rasp and cap blue jam. Then built everything els apround them.. they work good together  since there both really strong and pungent.

I was really worried just reading the recipe.   That's a lot of Jam and INW raspberry.  But wow.  On a  SNV,  you can taste the blueberries fighting the raspberry for dominance on the inhale.  On the finish it really does come to together as a blue raspberry jolly rancher.  Its magical.&#xD;\n&#xD;\nCan't wait till I see how this steeps out!
