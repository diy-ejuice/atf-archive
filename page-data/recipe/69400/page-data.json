Taste is a ripened strawberry flavor.   balanced to perfection from what you from real Strawberries. If you decide to mix this wonderful Strawberry Cheesecake recipe up, you will probaly never want to mix another strawberry cheesecake recipe again. Itâ€™s that Good. Absolutely awesome after that three day Steep. Mixed at 60/40 Steep 3 days. You can sub DFS French vanilla with Cap French Vanilla, just steep a few days longer to get rid of the chemical taste Cap puts off to start. The raspberry sweet really makes the flavors of this recipe burst.
