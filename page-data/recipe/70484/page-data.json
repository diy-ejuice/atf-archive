This mix brings a creamy meringue base to the light citrus pop of the lime and golden pineapple.  Adjust the coconut down to .5% for a more rounded taste of the tropics however, at 1% it sits very well with me. \r\n\r\n1 drop of Erythritol Solution per 30ml and the Liquid Amber with the Sweet Lychee bring out the fruit notes which naturally compete with the coconut being such a strong flavor.  I feel this recipe is done as it's my third batch/tweak on my original idea.  Feedback is welcome :) \r\n\r\nGood as as shake and vape but better after a 3 day steep on the Meringue.","steep_days":"3 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T02:15:42.000-05:00","best_vg":"60%","views":"1097","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Golden Pineapple","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Lime","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Sweet Lychee","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":250},{"name":"Liquid Amber","vendor":"FA","millipercent":750},{"name":"Coconut Extra","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Meringue","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"70484","name":"Topical Merengue  Puncha"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
