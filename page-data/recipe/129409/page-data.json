It was really good but i adjusted the percentages and this is my final version that i have been enjoying alot lately. You can adjust the sweetener and WS-23 to your liking or substitute using other sweeteners or cooling effect flavors. I also gave it a 4 day steep just so the flavors could meld a little. Hope you enjoy.","steep_days":"4 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-12T18:30:10.000-05:00","best_vg":"75%","views":"2048","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Coconut Candy","flavor_id":"223","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Coconut Extra","flavor_id":"316","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":750},{"name":"Strawberry (ripe)","flavor_id":"271","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Sweet Strawberry","flavor_id":"121","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Watermelon Candy","flavor_id":"275","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Sweet Watermelon","flavor_id":"126","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Super Sweet","flavor_id":"2384","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":500},{"name":"WS-23","flavor_id":"8085","vendor":"OTHR","millipercent":1000}],"reviews":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"129409","name":"Tigers Blood Slushie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
