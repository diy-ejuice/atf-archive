It was really good but i adjusted the percentages and this is my final version that i have been enjoying alot lately. You can adjust the sweetener and WS-23 to your liking or substitute using other sweeteners or cooling effect flavors. I also gave it a 4 day steep just so the flavors could meld a little. Hope you enjoy.","steep_days":"4 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"total_reviews":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-06T10:38:16.000-05:00","best_vg":"75%","views":"2038","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Coconut Candy","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Coconut Extra","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":750},{"name":"Strawberry (ripe)","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Sweet Strawberry","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Watermelon Candy","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Sweet Watermelon","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Super Sweet","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":500},{"name":"WS-23","vendor":"OTHR","millipercent":1000}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"129409","name":"Tigers Blood Slushie"}}}
