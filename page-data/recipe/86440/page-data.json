I get the root beer up front as if it's dripping off, zeppola right in the middle, and a lingering frosting finish. It's interesting, and believe it or not, not in a bad way. I'd even call it hard to put down. Who even thinks of something like this? If I waste a donut dunking it in root beer because of this stuff, just to see if it works as well in food as it does in a vape, I'm going to be pissed.
