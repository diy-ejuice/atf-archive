Like a mimosa, but for men. A *man-mosa*, if you will.** \r\n\r\n**FLV Morning Mimosa's** fermented orange \"prison wine\" flavor is what inspired this. **Yakima Hops** is an obvious choice, a one-of-a-kind flavor without which this would not be possible. Thank you, Flavorah, for blessing us with the Hops. **FA Royal Orange** is one of my favorite orange flavors and it worked better here than FW Blood Orange (too bitter), FE Sweet Orange (too sweet), and FA Blood Orange (too earthy). For the yeasty wheat breadyness of beer, **FLV Lemba's Bread** worked best to tie it all together. RF Baked Bread combined with Morning Mimosa was nasty hooch.  And FLV Wheat turned this into barf-tastic bitter raw orange bread dough. Maybe a dilution-level amount of FLV's Sweet Dough or Fried Dough would have worked, but I didn't want to be stuck hate-vaping failed versions involving either of those, so I never attempted to use them here. From past experiences, I knew better than to even consider FA Joy. **TFA Orange Cream** is the reason why this thing needs the 10-day steep. That flavor takes its time getting where it's going but once it gets there, hoo boy, totally worth the wait. It rounds out the orange flavors and gives the tiny bit of frothy head on top of this Orange Shandy. **WS-23,** use to taste, or even leave it out. Personally, I don't care for warm beer or room temp OJ. But I also didn't want the nuances here covered up by cooling FX, so I like it at 0.3%, way down from my usual 0.75% that I'd use for an icy cold vape.
