[Revisited]\r\n\r\nA few months ago I shared a new recipe I'd been developing for a while,  a Portuguese Custard Tart. Having now received a few concentrates from Wonder Flavors, I decided to give this another crack.\r\n\r\nThis new revised recipe is a lot more with what I wanted, on the draw you get a face-full of rich custard; on the exhale you are met with a nice flaky, golden, buttery pastry that lingers on the tongue.\r\n\r\nI have included updated notes below.\r\n\r\nNOTES:\r\n\r\nTPA PIE CRUST / CAP FUNNEL CAKE / WF BUTTER TART / WF CREPE / INW BISCUIT\r\nThis is the base for the butter pastry cup.  The first batch of the new revisited recipe omitted the Funnel Cake, without it I found the pastry cup tasted raw and underdeveloped, The funnel cake adds a cooked and somewhat caramelized note to the pastry. The WF Crepe give the pastry dough more weight, it adds  a nice denseness without distracting from the flaky pastry you get from  WF Butter Tart. \r\n\r\nCAP VAN CUSTARD/ FLV RICH CINNAMON / FLV COOKIE DOUGH\r\nThis is obviously the custard filling, the vanilla custard and cookie dough create a nice dense custard with caramel notes, having the vanilla custard at such a high percentage means the eggy notes are pretty obvious and up there which is what I wanted, however adds a lot to the steep time.  In the original recipe I used CAP Cinnamon Danish Swirl to add a bit of a spicy note, this is now done with FLV Rich Cinnamon, which adds more authenticity to the profile and doesn't bog it down with too much of a bready note.\r\n\r\nTPA BROWN SUGAR / TPA TOASTED MARSHMALLOW\r\nThis works with the cookie dough and toasted marshmallow to create a caramelized and 'burnt sugar' taste to the custard, like it's fresh out of the oven. The toasted marshmallow was also added to fluff everything out and provide the nice mouth feel you get from the recipe.\r\n\r\nGive this bad boy at least a 10 day steep to let the custard really come together.\r\n\r\nAs always, constructive criticism is always welcome.\r\n\r\nIf you're interested in comparing at all, the original recipe can be found at https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/53890","steep_days":"10","temperature":"0","recipe_score":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-10T19:00:04.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"2646","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Vanilla Custard","flavor_id":"131","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":3500},{"name":"Brown Sugar","flavor_id":"313","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Super Sweet","flavor_id":"2384","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":500},{"name":"Cookie Dough","flavor_id":"4373","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":750},{"name":"Toasted Marshmallow","flavor_id":"340","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Pie Crust","flavor_id":"179","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Butter Tart SC","flavor_id":"8360","vendor":"WF","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Crepe SC","flavor_id":"8365","vendor":"WF","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Biscuit","flavor_id":"642","vendor":"INW","millipercent":750},{"name":"Rich Cinnamon","flavor_id":"638","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":250},{"name":"Funnel Cake","flavor_id":"4166","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1000}],"reviews":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"63758","name":"Pastéis de Nata [Revisited]"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
