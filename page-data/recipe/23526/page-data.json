The idea came from DrunkLord aka Jerry aka Barry aka Dairy's request for a strawberry-pineapple La Croix recipe. In here, I avoided the obvious idea of using TFA Pineapple because the mix of TFA Dragonfruit and CAP Golden Pineapple creates something far more sweet and rounded out. My use of TFA Strawberry Ripe, TFA Strawberry, and JF Sweet Strawberry creates a lovely strawberry note that has the best blend of authentic strawberry notes with that candied strawberry syrup. The use of FA White Wine imparts the mouthfeel, throat hit, and flavour of a sparkling water to further link it to the La Croix counterpart. Using the low percentages of FA White Peach, JF Juicy Lemon, and FA Lime Tahiti Cold Press just creates a bridge of citrusy notes that not only boosts the fruit notes into an even better place, but also gives a little more body to the sparkling water element. If you're missing summertime during this cold front of winter, mix this up, kick back, and remember the sunshine.\r\n\r\nArt by me.
