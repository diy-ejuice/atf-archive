But as the vanilla is a main component here, there is no better vanilla ice cream base than the one by @eyemakepizza. It's elegant and tasty, and by adding the elderflower it gives a new interesting dimension to that rich vanilla yummyness.\r\n\r\n**FLV Elderflower** is an amazing flavor that works well with both creams and fruits.","steep_days":"1 (SNV)","temperature":"420","recipe_score":5,"updated_at":"2020-12-12T20:31:09.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"2132","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Vanilla Ice Cream","flavor_id":"1511","vendor":"LB","millipercent":5000},{"name":"Vanilla Swirl","flavor_id":"189","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1500},{"name":"French Vanilla Icecream","flavor_id":"2129","vendor":"HS","millipercent":750},{"name":"Elderflower","flavor_id":"3518","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1000}],"reviews":[{"user":"ID10-T","text":"You might call this a lazy review, and it is, but mixing a flavor with the Trinity is a great way to either show it off or take it for a spin. The FLV Elderflower here definitely tastes like it’s very much in the showing off category. I’ve never had Elderflower ice cream, but if I did, I would hope it would taste something like this.

The elderflower pairs so well with the vanilla ice cream that I was shocked when I first vaped this. It may be my new favorite ice cream vape. Great job on this one!","score":5}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"158553","name":"Elderflower Ice Cream"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
