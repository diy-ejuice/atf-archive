I used it low because it is indeed very salty and can overtake the mix.  This low it adds a touch of saltiness to accent the sweetness.  It is a coil gunker at 1.5% and, straight up, too salty (I've got it in an old school RTA - the Ubertoot 2 Coppervape clone, and will update how gunky this gets after, at minimum, 15mL through the same coil/cotton).  I think you could do without it altogether and still thoroughly enjoy this recipe . . . or change it up entirely and make this to fit your palate.  It also use the now defunct Holy Vanilla . . . replace it with your favorite vanilla or leave it out . . .your call.  The Butter Pecan, Roasted Hazelnut, Butterscotch combo really sets off the RY4 flavor profile.\r\n\r\nAll Tan Everything by Das Racist was the inspiration for the name.\r\n\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XhIz8_-XbzQ\r\n\r\nTan John Belushi in Coogi, dipping in Coochie\r\nTan Chris Farley in Gucci smoking on doobies\r\nTan Three Stooges, your style amateur\r\nAll tan botanical fanatic; saboteur\r\nWith the Thandie Newton-type tan chick\r\nYour man sick, I'm known to eat a sandwich\r\nLast tan nobleman of the last apocalypse\r\nOn the acropolis, a metropolis , poppin' shit\r\nOut my esophagus, no, my voice box\r\nDas Racist, we kinda like rap noise pop\r\nMad rhymes, finna blow up like landmines\r\nAll tan everything, shout out to tanlines\r\nAll tan khaki king, last white mogul\r\nAll you see is rupees when you Google\r\nRubies in his doo-doo, emeralds in his turban\r\nNervous, swervin' in the Suburban in Durban\r\nAll tan mans, stay tangent to Tanzania\r\nWith a Mia Farrow-looking sparrow to help me re-up","steep_days":"1 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:51:26.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"721","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Butterscotch Cream Pie","vendor":"WF","millipercent":4500},{"name":"Butterscotch Ripple","vendor":"FW","millipercent":3500},{"name":"Butter Pecan","vendor":"FW","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Sweetener","vendor":"FW","millipercent":500},{"name":"Roasted Hazelnut SC","vendor":"WF","millipercent":1000},{"name":"RY4 Double","vendor":"JF","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Vanilla Ruyan Custard","vendor":"WF","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Holy Vanilla","vendor":"DFS","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Salted Caramel","vendor":"VT","millipercent":500}],"reviews":[{"user":"Deftohms","text":"This is a delicious deserty tobacco.
