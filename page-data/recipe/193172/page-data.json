I followed a drink recipe for this one and one of the main notes is the Captain Morgan Loconut which is described as a rum, coconut milk with spices (nutmeg for me and why I added the eggnog, FA Milk, rum and coconut ).\r\n\r\nThe next hint we get from the real recipe (https://mixthatdrink.com/loco-unicorn-loconut-cocktail/) is berry flavor grenadine (hence grenadine) and orange flavored blue curaco (hence Blood Orange FA) Another hint is it makes a great berry mix (Forest fruit) and then the glass is rimmed with sugar (Super sweet)\r\n\r\nThis is my take on the recipe :)","steep_days":"3","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T19:16:29.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"647","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Blood Orange","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1600},{"name":"Eggnog","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":600},{"name":"Forrest Mix (forest Fruit Mix)","vendor":"FA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Grenadine SC","vendor":"WF","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Light Rum","vendor":"VT","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Milk","vendor":"FA","millipercent":800},{"name":"Super Sweet","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":500},{"name":"Sweet Coconut","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1000}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"193172","name":"TOC'S Loco Unicorn Drank "}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
