I was impressed I tend not to care for anything until at least 3 to 5 days anyways I mixed mine with a little less cap SS as 1% seemed like it would be too sweet for my liking. I'm still going to let this steep for suggested 3 days before filling tanks and will add stars once it's been given it's fair tasting.&#xD;\n&#xD;\nUpdate: This is super tasty!! Only thing I may do differently is drop down the cap super sweet next time I mix this to about .5% I feel at 1% it takes away from the profile a little bit other then that though this is an amazing ADV mix!
