I started with CAP sugar cookie and Inawa biscuit to form the cookie part. CAP bav cream, vanilla custard and Inawara yes we cheesecake to form a nice creamy stuffing. Finally wanted some graham cracker, it was a tossup of CAP NYCC which added to the filling and TPA clear which is more grainy and not so much vanilla. Soo this is my version of canolli with graham and honey. Mx it, Vape it, and let me know please.\r\ntested on an Elder Dragon RDA with 2.5 stapled claptons .19 ohm pushing 65 watts.","steep_days":"5","temperature":"0","recipe_score":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-12T18:31:00.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"694","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Milk & Honey","flavor_id":"609","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Graham Cracker Clear","flavor_id":"325","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Super Sweet","flavor_id":"2384","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":500},{"name":"Sugar Cookie","flavor_id":"115","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Yes, We Cheesecake","flavor_id":"9272","vendor":"INW","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Vanilla Custard","flavor_id":"131","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Meringue","flavor_id":"530","vendor":"FA","millipercent":750},{"name":"Biscuit","flavor_id":"642","vendor":"INW","millipercent":750},{"name":"Bavarian Cream","flavor_id":"2","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":2500}],"reviews":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"203261","name":"Honey Graham Cannoli "}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
