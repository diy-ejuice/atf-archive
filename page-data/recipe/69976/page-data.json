There are quite a few vapers that do not like yogurt, coffee, or peppermint flavors so I don't anticipate a wide acceptance. If you are looking for something different, make a small batch and give it a try - it might surprise you. \r\n\r\nThe inhale has a smooth coolness to it. During the initial exhale I get slight hints of chocolate, coffee, vanilla, and cream. At the end of the exhale the yogurt twang fills in with a peppermint back note that lingers on the pallet. I find this formulation yields a very smooth (at least as peppermint can be) vape experience","steep_days":"7","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T02:15:42.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"941","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Peppermint","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Mocca (mocha)","vendor":"INW","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Graham Cracker","vendor":"FW","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Creamy Yogurt","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Super Sweet","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":250},{"name":"Vanilla Whipped Cream","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1000}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"69976","name":"Peppermint Mo-Yo"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
