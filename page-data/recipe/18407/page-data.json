Used it at a lower percent to give it a nice smooth cinnamon flavor like apple jacks cereal\r\n\r\nJF Fuji. Fuji goes very well with cinnamon danish swirl to give it that apple jacks feel to it. I like it at 1.25% but could be bumped up to 1.50% if you want more apple.\r\n\r\nTPA Strawberry Ripe.  Works really well in this very smooth and adds a little sweetness to the mix.\r\n\r\nTPA Vanilla Cupcake. Cupcake thickens up the cake a little more and adds to the yellow cake.\r\n\r\nFA Vienna Cream. Used it to add some creaminess to the cake.\r\n\r\nJF Yellow Cake. Has a very nice cake feel and taste to it.\r\n\r\nSteep Time - 3 To 5 Days","steep_days":"0","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:48:53.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"1707","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Cinnamon Danish Swirl","flavor_id":"35","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":750},{"name":"Fuji","flavor_id":"4488","vendor":"JF","millipercent":1250},{"name":"Strawberry (ripe)","flavor_id":"271","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":8000},{"name":"Vanilla Cupcake","flavor_id":"187","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Vienna Cream","flavor_id":"516","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Yellow Cake","flavor_id":"4560","vendor":"JF","millipercent":3000}],"reviews":[{"user":"cdaniell30","text":"I love the light hand with the cinnamon on this"},{"user":"ActionRalf","text":"This is really great...delicious!"}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"18407","name":"Apple Jacks Cake"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
