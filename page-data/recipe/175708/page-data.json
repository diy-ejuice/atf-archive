Think it is almost perfect.\r\n\r\nINW Raspberry - This adds the tart, almost saltiness that chubby bubble blue raspberry has.\r\nCAP Bubble gum - this adds a slight bubblegum base without overpowering the mix. I get a slight slight bubblegum from chubby bubbles mix, but its very light. This fits the bill perfectly.\r\nFW & FW Blue Raspberry - LB's blue raspberry on its own is really good, but FW's adds a bit more tarty blue to the mix.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Old Versions below.**\r\n**these versions were close, but just didnt have the right blue raspberry tang to them that chubby bubbles has, and some where to strong on the bubblegum. Actually dropped the bubble gum down a lot to just retain the texture of it.**\r\n\r\nBlue razzy goodness. - Pick which bubblegum you like best or that you have and enjoy!\r\n\r\n**v1.0**\r\n\r\nBlue Raspberry FW - 5%\r\nRaspberry INW - 1%\r\nSuper Sweet CAP - 0.75%\r\nBubblegum Fruity TFA - 5%\r\n\r\nDifferent version I've tried that work, but provide a slight variant in the bubblegum profile.\r\n\r\n**v1.1**\r\n\r\nBlue Raspberry FW - 5%\r\nRaspberry INW - 1%\r\nSuper Sweet CAP - 0.75%\r\nBubblegum CAP - 5%\r\n\r\nA bit lighter on the bubblegummyness mouthfeel, but still a solid flavor. Definitely worth a try if tfa's bubblegum is to thick texture wise for you.\r\n\r\n**v1.2**\r\n\r\nBlue Raspberry FW - 5%\r\nRaspberry INW - 1%\r\nSuper Sweet CAP - 0.75%\r\nBubble Gum FLV - 1.75%\r\n\r\nThe bubblegum here is less fruity and more of a mouth feel with that slight fruitiness. **This version is better after 1 week of steeping.**\r\n\r\n**v1.3**\r\n\r\nBlue Raspberry FW - 5%\r\nRaspberry FW - 1.25%\r\nSuper Sweet CAP - 0.75%\r\nBubblegum Fruity TFA - 5%\r\n\r\n**v1.4**\r\n\r\nBlueberry FW 2%\r\nRaspberry INW 1%\r\nBlue Raspberry FW 5%\r\nBubblegum Fruity TFA 5%\r\nSuper Sweet CAP 0.75%\r\n\r\nIf you want it super super blue mix this one.\r\n\r\nJust a slightly different tartness from the raspberry FW. Its comparable to the original mix, but slightly less floral.","steep_days":"7 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:51:14.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"1280","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Raspberry","flavor_id":"667","vendor":"INW","millipercent":750},{"name":"Super Sweet","flavor_id":"2384","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":500},{"name":"Blue Raspberry","flavor_id":"1479","vendor":"LB","millipercent":7000},{"name":"Bubble Gum","flavor_id":"21","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Blue Raspberry","flavor_id":"1200","vendor":"FW","millipercent":1500}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"175708","name":"Chubby Bubble Blue Razz Remix"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
