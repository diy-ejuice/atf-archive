It's a nice crisp acidic apple cream without the curdle that would happen in real life. Nothing beats a really good simple mix.  It's even wonderful as a shake and vape.

A little dissapointed. Still think u r one of the rullers in this game.

This is Simple but complex, strange and unusual but it works.&#xD;\nSimplicity is what gets me here"},{"user":"CkoAU","text":"So good and so easy to whip up a quick mix"},{"user":"Ebc88","text":"This is really tasty. Would of never thought that vbic and fuji would make such a great combo. Gonna have to try to create a 2 flavor recipe of my own. This stuff also burns really clean vaped the whole 60 ml and cottons still nice and white "},{"user":"BuryMeInSmoke","text":"Not a bad recipe per se but the apple and ice cream combo ain't working for me.  I'd imagine this combo is one you'd either love or hate."},{"user":"lococarnage","text":""},{"user":"matthewkocanda","text":"Over the last few days, everything I mixed up myself has been trash. Don't know why, but it's just been awful. Then Shin told me about this D Cream idea in Discord and I knew I'd have to give it a go. Mixed it up, and immediately felt better about vaping. This shit is bangin. As a shake and vape, it's a little separated, but still delicious. You get the nice slap in the face from FA Fuji on the inhale, then all the beauty of TPA VBIC comes through on the back end. After a few days, this shit melds together so perfectly, the same way Mustard Milk does. The acidity and fruity tartness of FA Fuji balances with the mouthfeel and thick sweetness of VBIC to create something perfectly balanced, and appropriate for any time of day. Pairs well with coffee because of the creaminess for the morning vapes, but it also kicks you back to reality when you had a few too many at the Friday night fish fry. A fucking banger of a recipe, and currently my go-to ADV. Great mix, give this one a go."},{"user":"Thadentman","text":"Great shake and vape as an ADV when your out of your favorite juice. Never thought to really do something like this profile, Great job!"}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"38862","name":"D Cream"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
