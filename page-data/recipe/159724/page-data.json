Being that this is only v1 and first attempt,  I feel that this is already spot on.  if you feel that you need more inw marzipan feel free to add another 0.25% to the mix. I was on the fence myself with this flavor but its up to you. Also as mentioned in the video I tried Capella's Vanilla custard v2 but it did not seem to sit right. @Tamvapes said she was getting a heavy butyric taste from the OG killer kustard so I gave it a go. I don't know maybe it me or my v2 is bad granted it is a couple years old.  @Daddykane91 subbed Inw marzipan with FA Marzipan 1:1  giving this a different twist on the original clone. Feedback always welcome. Enjoy!!!

I used to live on Killer Kustard cuz it was cheap and sold in big bottles.  Marzipan?  You gotta be shitting me.  .. Marzipan.  It's so subtle that it doesn't cross your mind until you think about it .  And when you do it's just chillin in the back of the room, minding its own business.  . That's what sets this clone apart from the others in my book.  Nice job.  It's good to go off the shake!  Looking forward to whats next!!"},{"user":"DaddyKane91","text":"I mixed this up, this morning prior to the video, and had to sub out the inw Marzipan for FA... so my version is slightly diffrent than 007s, but not by much im sure.. This IMHO is slightly better than the original.. Great job on this one David.
