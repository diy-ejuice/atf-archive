This creates a great framework to add florals as you like.\r\n\r\nFA Lavender and FA Violet: These two all star florals are present to boost the lavender and violet notes in INW Purple Rain.\r\n\r\nINW Purple Rain: Holy shit. This stuff is awesome, even standalone. A bright vanilla, with lavender and violet intertwined perfectly. At 1.5% it's the star of the show, and for good reason. \r\n\r\nThe goal of this recipe was to mimic Violet Pastille candies, which I think it excels at.","steep_days":"3","temperature":"400","recipe_score":4.8,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:49:28.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"2329","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Holy Vanilla","vendor":"DFS","millipercent":1750},{"name":"Cream Fresh","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Lavender","vendor":"FA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Purple Rain","vendor":"INW","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Violet","vendor":"FA","millipercent":500}],"reviews":[{"user":"308_hobbiest","text":"Odd but good. This is like nothing else I've ever vaped. Very interesting. "},{"user":"MotherPunker","text":"this is a gorgeously put together recipe, it just wasn't my thing though.  I love florals in real life, I make teas out of them, I even cook with them but Im having a hard time finding florals I like to vape though.  Why does no one make a chamomile? that would be the perfect bedtime vape :)   milk and honey and chamomile zzzzz        thanks kopel for the recipe!"},{"user":"Nil","text":""},{"user":"Loonicorn","text":"Great recipe! If this is your first floral vape you might find this a bit overwhelming. It is in-fucking-tense! But in a good way. I jumped right from using a little honeysuckle in this and that to this and it blew my mind. For me it needs a week or so to settle in. I am hooked on florals now and looking forward to trying more recipes from this floral genius!"}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"54618","name":"Jazz Hands"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
