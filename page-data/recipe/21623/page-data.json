I think I'm considering this a wrap. This is my strawberry milk recipe with an emphasis on the milk. It's full and round in the mouth. The cream is thick and sweet. The strawberry is mellow yet present.\r\n\r\nThe whole idea was a very milky strawberry and cream vape using FLV Cream and JF Sweet Strawberry. Those were the key ingredients that I had to use. Cream has this almost cool taste to it.. Not like Koolada or menthol at all. It isn't cool, but it kind of tastes so. Sweet Strawberry is one of few strawberries I can taste, and it's kind of syrupy. It isn't sickly like INW Strawberry Shisha though. Nor is it gross as all get out like FLV Strawberry. So that's that.\r\n\r\nFLV Cream has that heavy cream, almost milky thing going for it. It's a thick cream with an ever so slight spice. I used TPA VBIC to thicken the cream and pump up that vanilla note. I threw in just a splash of Meringue to sweeten the cream into something more like milk. The TPA Bavarian Cream is there to kind of warm up and fill out the cream. JF Sweet Strawberry is a new favorite of mine and I had to use it here for its sweet, nearly syrupy taste. I found a bit of TPA Strawberry took off the sharp edge of the Sweet Strawberry, making it a little softer. The TPA Dragonfruit is just there to help bring the strawberries out a bit. It makes for a thick, creamy, milky vape with a semi-sweet strawberry taste that isn't overpowering. It's been my ADV for quite some time now, and no matter how much I vape it I can still taste it. So, there you have it! Ron Burgundy's Milk Was a Rad Choice (something I sure hope you find yourself saying after trying it!). Please leave feedback; I welcome it good or bad! Happy mixing. ðŸ‘½","steep_days":"14 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:48:55.000-05:00","best_vg":"85%","views":"4480","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Bavarian Cream","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Cream","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Dragonfruit","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":750},{"name":"Meringue","vendor":"FA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Strawberry","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Sweet Strawberry","vendor":"JF","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Vanilla Bean Ice Cream","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2000}],"reviews":[{"user":"ID10-T","text":"Classy take on strawberry milk! Consider me delighted. Also, I wanted to see what RuntDastardly was on about so I tried it a few different ways and I agree 100% - however much airflow you usually have going, choke it a bit. However much wattage you're normally pushing, turn it down some. This recipe will reward you for it by changing from a thick vanilla cream with a little strawberry finish to a full-on extra-sweet strawberry milk that's so good you just wanna drink it. "},{"user":"Burritoclock","text":"Very good strawberry milk! And I've had a lot of them... also gave me a little extra kick of inspiration to complete a chocolate covered strawberry I'd all but given up on. Mix it, you'll like it!"},{"user":"RuntDastardly","text":"Mixed on 12/2 and vaped on 12/10. Excellent, excellent recipe! Right off the bat, this is a nice, full, satisfying vanilla-ish cream with a light, sweet strawberry exhale, but, if you dial down the wattage and restrict the airflow a little this sucker really comes alive! It pushes the strawberry a little more forward and turns every hit into a mouthful of delicious party-time strawberry frosting! Awesome recipe. Will definitely mix again!"}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"21623","name":"Milk Was a Rad Choice"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
