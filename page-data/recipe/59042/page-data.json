After trying tons of variation, I found this to be the closest to the real thing. I notice that the real thing has a slight taste of a blackcurrant to make it more of a strawberry jam. However, I decided to leave it out because I enjoy the recipe as it is. This recipe really remind me of a strawberry jam with butter where I usually put on my loaf of bread.  \r\n\r\nPlease excuse my grammar and ENJOY!
