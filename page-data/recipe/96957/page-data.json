Cap Butter Cream and FA Butterscotch are blended equal parts to make one play against the other adding the extra little bit of creamy buttery notes that FA is missing. FA does a good job bringing the melted brown sugar of real butterscotch but lacks a bit on the buttery aspect. Irish cream and Jamaican run are in the mix to give it a bit of a dark liquor type exhale. At 5.75% total flavor some people will think this cant possibly be tasteful enough but I am not a super sensitive vapor with extreme taste buds and I can guarantee this mix is a flavorful one. It taste good right out of the gate but it definitely benefits from letting it rest a week so that the Jamaican rum and Irish Cream fall in their place. \r\n\r\nThis recipe was uploaded on ELR on July/2017 and I transferred the info here so if you would like to see what others have been saying about it you can go check out the comments on ELR.
