Apple Jacks dry, it's just grain, frosting, and a little apple cinnamon finish. Most of my time on this recipe was spent trying to get the right type of grain. Corn flakes I've got down but there doesn't seem to be many  flavors that have the oat/wheat profile that I get from a lot of cereals. For this cereal the JF biscuit and Fuji almost get it there but the biscuit needs  help and the Fuji is too tart so I split the percentage 2:1 with double apple for more sweetness. If you want to up the apple stick to that ratio, but for authenticity I kept the apple subtle. The cinnamon at low % goes great with JF biscuit and just gives a light cinnamon aftertaste.  I was stuck at about 80% on this recipe until I got Flv Frosting. This flavor adds that perfect sugar glaze. And surprisingly I replaced rice crunchies with apple pie and it added the extra boost I needed in the grain and is a lot more enjoyable to vape.  If you like this cereal or just have a bunch of cds to use up (my original goal with this recipe) you should be all over this.... although it will take me 2.5L of this to use all my cds.... might need some other flavors first tho.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","steep_days":"5","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"total_reviews":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-02T15:33:22.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"1148","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Biscuit","vendor":"JF","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Fuji","vendor":"JF","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Double Apple","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":750},{"name":"Meringue","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Frosting","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Cookie","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Cinnamon Danish Swirl","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":500},{"name":"Apple Pie","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"35392","name":"Jack shack"}}}
