I'm finally content.  Yes, it's a massive amount of flavoring . . . yes, it's made up of 10 different flavors.  However, I've finally scratched that itch!  I approached this in much the same way as my Long Gone Lonesome Blues recipe, in terms of layers.  It's a custardy, strawberry cheesecake with a beautiful tobacco backdrop.  The Vanilla Ruyan, Graham Cracker, and Red Oak kind of serve the purpose of bridging the gap between the two flavor profiles.  When I look at where my recipes usually shine, in my opinion, I'm pretty decent at dessert tobaccos.  This is exactly where I want it to be.  It was okay as a SNV, but , man, 3 days later it was absolutely shining (according to my palate).  This was a labor of love . . . I hope you enjoy it as much as I do.","steep_days":"3","temperature":"0","recipe_score":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-10T16:01:49.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"750","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Custard Premium","flavor_id":"9118","vendor":"FA","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Native Tobacco","flavor_id":"4393","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1750},{"name":"Vanilla Ruyan Custard","flavor_id":"6066","vendor":"WF","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Yes, We Cheesecake","flavor_id":"9272","vendor":"INW","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Graham Cracker","flavor_id":"1297","vendor":"FW","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Strawberry Cheesecake SC","flavor_id":"10413","vendor":"WF","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Strawberry Jam","flavor_id":"10274","vendor":"OOO","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Sweet & Smokey Tobacco","flavor_id":"10085","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":250},{"name":"Acetyl Pyrazine 5%","flavor_id":"1709","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Red Oak","flavor_id":"375","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1000}],"reviews":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"191253","name":"stawberRY4cheesecake - Quarantine Shenanigans "}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
