I mixed this up today at about 25mg/ml to match the store bought stuff and this is way more flavorful. I need to try the non-pod recipe because I've had 0 luck with FLV Sour Apple in anything I've tried it was just a harsh mess but it tastes amazing in this recipe with the pod."},{"user":"ObiWanCannoli","score":"5","text":"Awesome flavor combo but far too weak for a pod system. I mixed this for my aspire breeze 2 and while I could taste the recipe a bit, it just wasn't saturated enough for my taste. That said, what I could taste was awesome and nicely balanced. I will be trying out the regular version of this one asap"}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"110874","name":"SIHTSTRII,IFIWPSTPEO for Pod Devices"}}}
