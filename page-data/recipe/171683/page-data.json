Coffee, some sweet tobacco, something just a little nutty, and enough maple to really hammer home the morning time nature of the whole endeavor. \r\n\r\nVT Caffe Latte is impressively functional for coffee to start, and doesn't need a whole lot of help there. It doesn't read as though there's as much milk here as a Latte would imply, but that's perfectly alright in this instance.\r\n\r\nFLV Tatanka and FLV Red Burley are an unreasonably complementary pairing in my opinion. The sort of well rounded tobacco base you can build in a lot of different directions. it's a little sweet and has enough body to it that it doesn't get buried in everything else going on here.\r\n\r\nTFA Pralines and Cream is adding some nuttiness, some body, and a little more sweetness\r\n\r\nTFA Maple syrup is the icing on the cake here to me. It is just the concentrated flavor of the major brand \"maple flavored syrup\"s, the little bit here goes a long way to make sure this mix doesn't get mired in the coffee and tobacco's lack of sweetness and adds just enough maple to come through and make things a little more interesting.","steep_days":"7","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"updated_at":"2020-12-12T14:07:37.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"1055","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Caff√® Latte","flavor_id":"9368","vendor":"VT","millipercent":1250},{"name":"Tatanka Tobacco","flavor_id":"4417","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1250},{"name":"Red Burley","flavor_id":"4355","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1250},{"name":"Maple Syrup","flavor_id":"331","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Pralines And Cream","flavor_id":"334","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1500}],"reviews":[{"user":"fieldgreens","text":"I don't know how Foment does it, but this is another recipe that brings a different component to the forefront with each vape.  One is the coffee, the next is the maple, the other after that is the tobacco.  This is a great morning vape, reasonably light, and a nice representation of the profile the creator was looking for.  Another great job here.  Mix without reservation.","score":5}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"171683","name":"Before first light"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
