I originally thought this might take some time and require more flavours than I originally used However that wasn't the case. I took the 3 main profiles at said percentages as a starting point and the rest is history.\r\nIt just works so well I thought should I improve on this but no fuck that why should I add 1% of this 0.5% of that it doesn't need it the 3 base flavours just gel together and blend beautifully it's actually pretty damn perfect.\r\nDefinitely mix this it whisks you away to what can only describe what is such a beautiful country with what some my day has strange culture and food profiles but I can't honestly thank them enough for ice cream flavours like this.\r\n\r\nTfa vanilla bean ice cream \r\n\r\nAt 4% it's the base for the other 2 flavours. Definitely the best ice cream flavour if you get pepper then sub for FW VBIC it still works but I found it lighter in its texture, TFA just does it for me and works so well in a thick creamy kind of way.\r\n\r\nFA Coconut \r\n\r\nBy far a excellent coconut flavour it's great used at low percentage otherwise it get weird and lends towards vaping sun tan lotion but at lower percentage it's authentic creamy adds some sweetness and pulls through the ice cream and caramel on the exhale.\r\n\r\nFA Caramel \r\n\r\nThis was the combo I didn't think would work but it just does it sits beautifully with the coconut and ice cream and meld the 2 profiles together. Fa caramel again is a fantastic flavour very real thick and creamy without being burnt in its texture.\r\n\r\nShake and vape certified but 3 days is its sweet spot","steep_days":"3 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":4.6,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:49:03.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"16925","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Vanilla Bean Ice Cream","flavor_id":"186","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Coco' (coconut)","flavor_id":"416","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Carmel (caramel)","flavor_id":"503","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1250}],"reviews":[{"user":"RhettsBeard","text":"Delicious and spot on recipe.
