After about 2 weeks, it goes through an interesting transformation. The vanilla notes in the marshmallow come out to play, and you get a vibrant, juicy, borderline candied, yet realistic watermelon. And this is in a pod system i'm tasting this!&#xD;\n&#xD;\nGreat stuff!"}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"97601","name":"TRUCKIN WATERMELON"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
