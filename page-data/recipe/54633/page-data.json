Creamy creamy smoothness with some amazing banana top notes, not at all the banana runt flavor. \r\n\r\nMy first run through with banana cream I used it at 4% and some CAP whipped cream to fluff it up a bit and I knew I was hooked. \r\n\r\nThis is more of a main profile base for me, meaning that I really love this flavor and texture and complex ways these flavors dance together, but I think with some experimenting I could add a supporting note or two that could really send this into a whole new dimension, and I actually think I can use this flavor base to go in two completely different directions. \r\n\r\nOne main note I get from this, and on the first night of mixing it Kelsey's first note noticed, is an awesome banana bread/banana twinky flavor and I can't stress how awesome it is. I'm thinking that if I play with some yellow cake or some other bakeries to continue bringing out that sweet moist bready goodness, or maybe even back to whipped cream to fluff this up some it would have a total realistic, slightly less sugary banana twinky vibe, but with some super sweet I'm sure it would be pretty close. \r\n\r\nThe other direction I'm thinking of is a slightly more complex one, adding in more subtle notes like almond or pistachio and playing with the sultry sweet nutty creaminess throughout. \r\n\r\nI'm honestly gonna experiment with both, so I'll either update here or add new recipes. \r\n\r\nOverall what I'm enjoying the most is the  pleasantly banana cream top note, as soon as you inhale, sweet ripe banana flavor, which stays constant throughout, then the vanilla creaminess leads into the butterscotchy, velour like body, mixing with the spicy, aromatic tobacco notes which are most present on the exhale, so it has this nice flow from banana to cream to butterscotch-tobacco and it's my current ADV (plus I mixed up 120 ml to have a go to base for batch testing)\r\n\r\nA great shake and vape but only gets better and better and the transition from flavor to flavor more interesting and smoother the longer it steeps.\r\n\r\nAlso I typically mix my flavors and then 10%PG, 3mg/nic and top the rest off with VG but that's just me, I'm not very well read in VG/PG percentages so whatever your preference may be. \r\n\r\nI've been mixing for a little over a year now and am recently feeling very comfortable with and enjoying my recipes but I'm still quite the novice so please any tips, tweaks, comments, critiques, remixes etc are most welcome.","steep_days":"7 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:49:28.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"3717","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Banana Cream","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Butterscotch Ripple","vendor":"FW","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Ry4 Double","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Vanilla Swirl","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2000}],"reviews":[{"user":"whatiswiththeworld","text":"Delicious. "},{"user":"Boomdog07","text":"Simple and delicious. Tried it right off the mix in an RDA and it is really good. I am going to update my review after 3-5 days of steep and see how and if things change. The banana is balanced and doesn't have a \"chemical\" flavor which is nice, the BR hits on the exhale nice and smooth, and of course the caramel from the RY4 is there on the way out as well.  UPDATE: After a 5-6 day steep this thing just keeps getting more and more awesome. I mixed up just a small 60ml to track its progress throughout the week. I just mixed up 600ml to keep some steeping for a while!! Gonna make this my ADV for a while I have a feeling. Great Job!!"},{"user":"ParkusMaximusIII","text":"Great recipe. Simple due to the fact it utilizes only 4 flavorings but complex at the same time. For me, I get mainly a sweet and delicate banana on the inhale, followed by a nice throat hit provided by the RY4D. On the exhale, I get such a rich almost smoked butterscotch flavor (which I am assuming derives from the RY4D,) that just completes this recipe. This is the first \"tobacco\" recipe I've mixed up and I have to say, although I was on the fence about tobacco flavorings, I am very impressed. I do believe that there is room for addition with this recipe, but I wouldn't add any sweetener or anything, the recipe is sweet enough and honestly definitely going into my rotation. Thanks for showing me how tobacco recipes aren't all stinky üòù"}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"54633","name":"Smokin' Banana"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
