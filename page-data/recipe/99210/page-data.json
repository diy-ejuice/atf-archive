I am a huge chocolate and banana fan so I might as well add it to a crepe recipe I had set up way before I even had the flavors.. Both Australian Chocolate and Glamour Chocolate make a nice base.. Glazed Donughnut adds a little depth to the Crepe.. Everything else just comes together..\r\n\r\nMany thanks to everyone from DIY Downunder FB group for the name of the recipe.\r\n","steep_days":"5","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-06T20:43:55.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"1701","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Crepe SC","vendor":"WF","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Banana Pur√©e","vendor":"WF","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Glazed Doughnut","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":750},{"name":"Glamour Chocolate","vendor":"MB","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Vienna Cream","vendor":"LB","millipercent":1250},{"name":"Australian Chocolate","vendor":"HS","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Sugar Daddy (TBV Rick)","vendor":"OTHR","millipercent":500},{"name":"Vanilla Swirl","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1850},{"name":"Meringue","vendor":"RF","millipercent":900}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"99210","name":"I Creped My Pants"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
