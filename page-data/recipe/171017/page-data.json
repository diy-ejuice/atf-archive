Created from the same recipe that my husband uses to make his famous moonshine for football nights.  Apple Stark/Fuji (At home it's straight Apple Juice) with the dragonfruit give this its great apple punch (we don't use cider in the real thing and didn't do it here).  Bourbon gives it the punch of liquor flavor and the Rum while not boozy adds a little something to that Bourbon.  We always use Sugar so it's present here in the sweetener and the brown sugar to give it a little depth.  And the last note is the cinnamon because we always put a few sticks of it in the 5 gallon drum.
