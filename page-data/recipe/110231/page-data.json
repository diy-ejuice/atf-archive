I thought I'd share with those of you looking for a solid grape lollipop.\r\n\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nNo thorough notes on this one really as this was done in just a few short revisions but....\r\n\r\n**FLV grape** is an awesome candy grape if you're looking to formulate your own. Also, It's very sweet so it carries the heft of sweetness in the mix.\r\n\r\n**TFA Grape Juice** pumps in the little lacking grape POP so to speak.\r\n\r\n**CAP Blueberry Jam** was a concentrate I hadn't found a use for yet but it serves well in this mix to provide a deeper candy \"effect\". Think of it as a \"texturizer\".\r\n\r\n**FA Meringue** isn't used as a sweetener here or even intended for a sugar effect, Instead it's meant to shave off any sharp notes you may perceive from the candy components. \r\n\r\n**FA Marshmallow** is used as an enhancer to serve to thicken up the mix.
