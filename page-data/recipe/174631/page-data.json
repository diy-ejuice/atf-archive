I get maybe a HINT of lemon and notes of the custard. But no blueberry, cereal or strawberry. I set it aside on the recommended steep time and opened it up today, but it’s offering very little sadly. I’ll try putting it aside a little longer and see how it is after a longer steep. &#xD;\n&#xD;\n//UPDATE//&#xD;\n&#xD;\nAfter steeping the mix a little longer, the fruits have started to come together. The milk and cream have started to accentuate everything very nicely and it has successfully pulled together into a very pleasant cereal vape. Unlike many, this cereal vape stands out on its own and delivers something more than the standard fare that other cereal vapes have to offer. It just needed a little longer to cure before it truly began to shine.
