INW raspberry is very potent of might change it to one drop per 30ml, but for now it lends a nice tartness to the vape. Cant decide if i'm going to add it to the rotation, but for now it itches that yogurt spot. thanks for the recipe"},{"user":"Ebc88","text":"brought this to work with me this week and it didn't disappoint. Although when i went to mix it the strange percentages threw me off a bit, but nonetheless it still tasted great.
