At the time, it really didn't do it for me. I was really into tobaccos and summer drinks, so in the box it went and I pulled it out last couple of days to see how it's come along and I was looking for something akin to this profile. Well, look who showed up to flavor town! I'm a fan of cap lemon lime and it really stands the test of time here (4 month steep!) and gives this a pleasant citrus flavor. (At 4% maybe it was a bit high at first, before the creams and stuff could tame it a bit?) The rest have settled into a thick creamy pie base with the lime infused throughout just like I like a slice of key lime pie. The crust is barely there and i like it like that. Any more and it wouldn't feel right to me but I could see wanting crust to offset the sweetness. It's a solid sweet creamy tart citrus pie made with flavors that have all kinds of uses. Worth trying. I suggest steeping it for a while if you don't like it at first. Maybe even making everything but the lime and then waiting a week or two and adding it(or a different lime that may tend to fade more) before vaping? Thanks for this."},{"user":"Anton_Prymak","score":"5","text":""},{"user":"tw2k","score":"5","text":""}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"34175","name":"Key To Success"}}}
