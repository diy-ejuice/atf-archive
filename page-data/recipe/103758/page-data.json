I know ya'll don't like to read, so keeping this short and simple.\r\n\r\nPeanut Butter / Sun Seed - Creates the outside nut cluster. The addition of Sun Seed boosts the fuck out of the nuts and blends perfectly with Peanut Butter for a raw, almost soft like peanut.\r\n\r\nButterscotch / Caramel - That layer protects the nuts from the white stuff while adding a creamy sweetness to the mix.\r\n\r\nVanilla / Marshmallow / Meringue - Needed to fill that soft, semi-flakey center of the roll. It sits in your mouth with a soft, almost chewy texture.\r\n\r\nGreat of a shake abit Sun Seed overtakes this recipe at first, better after about a day or two.\r\n\r\nCould have turned this into a fanfict, but fuck that. \r\nJust vape my nuts.","steep_days":"1 (SNV)","temperature":"420","recipe_score":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-12T10:15:15.000-05:00","best_vg":"60%","views":"1924","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Peanut Butter","flavor_id":"291","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Sun Seeds","flavor_id":"8718","vendor":"FE","millipercent":250},{"name":"Butterscotch (natural)","flavor_id":"1219","vendor":"FW","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Carmel (caramel)","flavor_id":"503","vendor":"FA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Vanilla","flavor_id":"2136","vendor":"HS","millipercent":750},{"name":"Marshmallow","flavor_id":"332","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Meringue","flavor_id":"530","vendor":"FA","millipercent":500}],"reviews":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"103758","name":"Nut Roll"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
