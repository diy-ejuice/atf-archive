It did everything as I wanted. The textures, mouthfeel and flavour id just on point! \r\nOh yeh! This is Cream Sha Boogie Bop! \r\n\r\n- off the shake the mouth feel of the cream seems lovely followed up with some of the textual notes of the bakeries but I  will have to wait a few days to see if this starts playing \"Cream Sha Boogie Bop\". All going to plan the FA Cookie will help to achieve a little grainy texture to the combination of the other bakery concentrates that I hope will deliver a mixture of authentic profiterole pastry style notes. So far so good though.
