This was a pretty simple profile to crack its layers are pretty simple and it doesn't try to be something other than its profile portrays. \r\nIf you like the original I feel this should fulfill your requirements without paying a premium, I've kept the flavours simple and they should already be in your arsenal or otherwise easily obtained.\r\n\r\nBest between 7-10 days the flavours really then come alive sweet berries and creamy banana with a graham cracker exhale.\r\n\r\nEnjoy xx\r\n","steep_days":"10","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"total_reviews":4,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:49:20.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"11278","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Banana Cream","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Cheesecake (graham Crust)","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Graham Cracker","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Sweet Strawberry","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Harvest Berry","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Bavarian Cream","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Super Sweet","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":500}],"reviews":[{"user":"redomegaz","score":"5","text":"Another excellent mix from dazcole, I've never had the original so I can't compare it but this is brilliant."},{"user":"loupe1","score":"5","text":"Very close to the original. This is going into the main rotation. Thanks dazcole!"},{"user":"kindground","score":"5","text":"This is a delicious clone. For me, It needs a little more airy dairy in the middle to fluff it up and mellow out the banana a little more to be spot on. I haven't had the real thing in a few months though. I'll still vape the crap out of this. Great job. "},{"user":"RdaJunkie","score":"5","text":"Delicious as always from Mr.Cole. Description describes it perfectly. Really does pop after a week.
