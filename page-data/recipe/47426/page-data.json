This was a pretty simple profile to crack its layers are pretty simple and it doesn't try to be something other than its profile portrays. \r\nIf you like the original I feel this should fulfill your requirements without paying a premium, I've kept the flavours simple and they should already be in your arsenal or otherwise easily obtained.\r\n\r\nBest between 7-10 days the flavours really then come alive sweet berries and creamy banana with a graham cracker exhale.\r\n\r\nEnjoy xx\r\n","steep_days":"10","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"updated_at":"2020-12-12T15:39:15.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"11298","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Banana Cream","flavor_id":"210","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Cheesecake (graham Crust)","flavor_id":"152","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Graham Cracker","flavor_id":"62","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Sweet Strawberry","flavor_id":"121","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Harvest Berry","flavor_id":"69","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Bavarian Cream","flavor_id":"145","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Super Sweet","flavor_id":"2384","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":500}],"reviews":[{"user":"redomegaz","text":"Another excellent mix from dazcole, I've never had the original so I can't compare it but this is brilliant.","score":5},{"user":"loupe1","text":"Very close to the original.

For me, It needs a little more airy dairy in the middle to fluff it up and mellow out the banana a little more to be spot on. I haven't had the real thing in a few months though.
