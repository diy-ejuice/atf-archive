I do really like the idea of combining lime and elderflower. However, and I know people have different tolerance levels when it comes to coolants, I have to say that this was almost unvapeable to me due to the freaking huge amount of Koolada. It was enough to sting the inside of my mouth and leave me feeling like I’d just eaten a bunch of frozen salt. Sucks because the floral-lime-apple thing leading up to that seems nice, but I just couldn’t enjoy it.
