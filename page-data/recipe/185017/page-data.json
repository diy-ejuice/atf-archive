Not to be confused with Pink Lemonade though ;). My GF requested this for her pod, and I had to oblige. After going through a few revisions, I've finally come up with this.\r\n\r\nTested on a Cthulu 1928 & Smoant Pasito, 2.5mm 6 wraps Round Wire SS @ 15w. 25mg/mL Nicotine Content\r\n\r\n#####**Notes**\r\n**LA Lemonade & FLV Lemonade** - I've done a few lemonade mixes for Pods / MTL devices - and have found these two to be an amazing combination for a more authentic lemonade. It doesn't stray *too* far from being a powdered lemonade, but it also doesn't straight up taste like it just came from a tub. I find it to be a really nice middle ground.\r\n\r\n**INW Raspberry WG & TFA Raspberry (Sweet)** - INW Raspberry WG is amazing, albeit can get a bit \"tart\" to me at higher %'s. A little goes a long way though, and when combined with a little bit of TFA Raspberry (Sweet) makes a really nice and sweet artifical / somewhat candied raspberry taste. This is perfect for a lemonade, especially in my case because my GF wanted a more \"Sweet\" lemonade. I do tend to find an off-note with TFA Raspberry (Sweet) but at this low % it doesn't really show itself.\r\n\r\n**CAP Super Sweet** - Normally I stray from using Cap SS in Pod setups, and this can be optional if you want. I found this really helped edge out the INW Raspberry though and definitely made it feel more like a raspberry lemonade that has a more artifical / sweetness to it than a real tart raspberry.\r\n\r\n**WS-23** - Lemonade needs to be cold obviously! You can adjust the % of this if you want, but I found 1% in my pasito / cthulu was enough for me. \r\n\r\nHope you enjoy!
