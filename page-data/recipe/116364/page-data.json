It's a weird one.\r\n\r\nI used what I had on hand and I think the root beer works REALLY well with the candy banana from the LA Banana Cream. I used the TPA VBIC to add a little bit more creaminess and sort of blend everything together and the FLV Vanilla Bean because I really like vanilla and wanted a little bit more.\r\n\r\nI recommend a 3 day steep to let the VBIC balance out a little and give the Banana Cream time to mellow out. I find it a bit harsh as a SnV but it's definitely vapeable immediately if you so choose. I'll probably adapt this a touch as I'd like some more of the root beer flavor but it's great as is.
