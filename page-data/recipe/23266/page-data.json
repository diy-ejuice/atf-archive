This was one step along the way. While it kind of falls short on the \"Peach Milk\" target it is a really good Peach Smoothie type vape.\r\n\r\nPeach Milk is still a target and I am closer than I was before. I also hit on two other peach cream type vapes that I will probably be dropping at some point along the way. Different enough to be interesting and stand on their own.\r\n\r\nOOO Cream Milky Undertones PG is a must have if you like milky recipes. By itself it is part way between Half and Half and Whole Milk\r\nFA Cream Fresh, to bring some \"even more dairy, and that specific cream note it brings on a steep\"\r\nShisha Vanilla, because I love vanilla and INW shisha vanilla brings even more creamy notes with it, and a good vanilla never did a peach, milk or cream wrong.\r\n\r\nThe combo of INW Peach and JF Peach team up for a really good syrupy note. A realistic peach, but not the fruit, more the organic peach reductions you can get in syrup form.\r\n\r\nSubs, yeah, none really.\r\n\r\nSteep time. I like to mix large and observe the changes in mixes even after I have been mixing it for a while. This is really best after 14 days when the creams do all their magix and come together completely. It is also nice after 6 days or so. FA Cream Fresh is an awesome flavor, but it is definitely \"odd\" when fresh is fresh. Placing the steep time at 7 days but do as you wish. If you are a peach fan mix large and test it along the way to observe the changes.\r\n\r\nFor that cold cold, add Koolada, WS-X of your choice or FA Polar Blast to taste. .5% FA Polar Blast is a very nice addition to this.","steep_days":"7","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:48:56.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"2738","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Honey Peach","vendor":"JF","millipercent":1700},{"name":"Shisha Vanilla","vendor":"INW","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Cream Milky PG","vendor":"OOO","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Cream Fresh","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1300},{"name":"Peach","vendor":"INW","millipercent":1200}],"reviews":[{"user":"Ebc88","text":"One the top peaches and cream style recipes Ive tried. Excellent job and thanks for sharing. "},{"user":"thecoffeemann","text":"I have made over 500ml of this and it is easily my ADV. I am all for exploring new flavors and recipes but i find I need a baseline to return to when stuff is off or weird or simply not my thing. This has a nice subtle flavor to it i have mixed it several ways. It just works and I love it. I've mixed this at 70/30 and 60/40, i mixed this with low nic and high nic. it doesn't matter. the biggest thing that will make a difference is you can SAV it but it really becomes something wonderful after 7 days. You don't have OoO Cream take the plunge buy it in the 4 oz bottle (only option I had when I bought it) and don't look back. Thank you Fear for another solid recipe. this needs to be sold as a flavor pack on BCF if they could get OoO Cream that is.&#xD;\n&#xD;\nUPDATE 11/26/19 This has been in my rotation for a couple years. Its so good. Thank you Fear "}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"23266","name":"Peach Smoovie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
