This is my take on them.  They were thin with crisp edges (INW Biscuit) and gooey centers (FLV Cookie Dough).  The lemon was bright and up front (FE Lemon) . . . riding on top of the sweet sugar cookie dough (CAP Sugar Cookie).  They were liberally dotted with white chocolate chips (TPA White Chocolate/LA Cream Cheese Icing) and dusted lightly with powdered sugar (FA Meringue).","steep_days":"1 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:50:15.000-05:00","best_vg":"60%","views":"1256","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Sugar Cookie","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Cookie Dough","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":2000},{"name":"White Chocolate","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Lemon","vendor":"FE","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Biscuit","vendor":"INW","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Cream Cheese Icing","vendor":"LA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Meringue","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000}],"reviews":[{"user":"HerrHut","text":"Wasn't SNV for me.
