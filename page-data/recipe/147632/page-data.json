I think the \"fluff\" is the perfect word to describe it, because it's definitely lighter than some of the other more popular SBCC recipes out there.  Definitely needs a couple of days steep if you ask me, but once it gets there, it's there.  Great recipe. "},{"user":"humanpuck","text":"This is a nice creamy strawberry cheesecake.  The Cap NYCC helps to add some creamy body to the LB and that sweet syrupy JF Strawberry is wonderful.  Excellent mix."},{"user":"Millions81","text":"Great stuff KB ðŸ˜€&#xD;\nReally enjoy this as is &amp; with my current favorite strawberry (RF sc).&#xD;\nMake yourself a decent sized batch, this steeps into even more awesomeness after a week or so. &#xD;\nHighly recommend mixing his shit ðŸ˜‰&#xD;\nThanks for this!"},{"user":"Zany","text":"When I was just a young boy ..

I saw something .. something..
