I can DL hit it in my Nord with very little throat hit.\r\nYou can actually taste the Orange and Nectarine that leads to a nice creamy finish.\r\nThe best part is that it's not harsh at all.\r\nPretty great for only 16% of the mix being the aromas. I'm very happy with it.","steep_days":"3 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-05T05:17:20.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"1876","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Tangerine","vendor":"FW","millipercent":6000},{"name":"Super Sweet","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Blood Orange","vendor":"FW","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Orange Creamsicle","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":6000}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"148403","name":"POD Tangerine Creamsicle!  18 mg/ml  NicSalt"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
