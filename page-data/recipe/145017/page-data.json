The jelly was tough to nail down. It says V2 because I've lost count on how many tries it took to get the jelly right. TPA sweet raspberry gives it the brightness and sweetness without any floral notes that I needed. Jammy berry brings out the jelly and adds a dark berry note like the real krimpet. Golden butter and vanilla cupcake authenticate the cake near perfectly. Apple and boysenberry assist the raspberry and is in the actual recipe so that's why they are there.","steep_days":"3 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T22:33:29.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"1739","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Apple Stark","vendor":"FA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Boysenberry","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":500},{"name":"Golden Butter","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":500},{"name":"Jammy Berry","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Raspberry (sweet)","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Vanilla Cupcake","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":3000}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"145017","name":"Jelly Krimpet V2?"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
