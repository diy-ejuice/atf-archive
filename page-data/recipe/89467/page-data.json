Strawberry forward. You can easily adapt this to bring the other fruits out more by substituting say blueberry or raspberry in place of the strawberry\r\n Honeysuckle here is optional. I used it here mainly for the sweetness is provides with the slightest floral at the end of the vape. \r\nArmenia or apricot used to lift the berries and help move them forward\r\nLemon Sicily.
