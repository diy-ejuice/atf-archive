Is fruity, bright, authentic. And the FA Blackcurrant just blends the fruit layer.\r\nIt wasnâ€™t easy no reach to a crumble, but Iâ€™m very happy with the final result. The TPA Pie Crust merges very well with the cookies.\r\nThe FA Nut mix is the final touch to the recipe.\r\nGive it 5 days steep.\r\nVisit DIY MIXERS CREW on Discord https://discord.gg/3K56qB\r\nFollow DIY MIXERS CREW on FaceBook https://www.facebook.com/diymixers/\r\nJoin DIY MIXERS CREW on Facebook https://www.facebook.com/groups/456512471380574/\r\nWatch DIY MIXERS CREW LIVE on YouTube every Sunday at 4:30 pm EST https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC1ENB0bSNrG_1KETYwZ154g\r\nPlease remember, smoking is dead, vaping is the present, mixing is the future ðŸ˜Š\r\n","steep_days":"5","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"total_reviews":1,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:49:33.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"3616","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Blueberry","vendor":"FW","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Bilberry","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Blackcurrant","vendor":"FA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Pie Crust","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Cookie","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Biscuit","vendor":"INW","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Bavarian Cream","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"wOw","vendor":"FA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Cinnamon Danish Swirl","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":500},{"name":"Nut Mix","vendor":"FA","millipercent":500}],"reviews":[{"user":"Mrmixer","score":"5","text":"Just mixed this up earlier this evening, trying it fresh Im getting a really nice blueberry/blackurrant on the front end, with some milder crumble notes through out. I'm really enjoying this mix. Well done. If it lasts long enough to steep, I look forward to vaping it then as well.
