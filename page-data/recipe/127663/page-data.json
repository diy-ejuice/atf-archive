I used FW yellow cake because i needed the tastiest yellow cake in this recipe.  you could sub Angel Cake WF if you prefer.   The pineapple is more of a baked pineapple in this recipe and adds sweetness.  The LMP gives it extra zest to the creamy thick moist butter cake.  I made this specifically for the DIY Down Under November challenge.  \r\nfyi\r\nthe pineapple sc does not fade, it gets more lucious!\r\n","steep_days":"7","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-05T02:13:58.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"1747","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Cake (yellow)","vendor":"FW","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Lemon Meringue Pie","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":500},{"name":"Cream Cheese Icing","vendor":"LA","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Golden Pineapple","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Vanilla Custard","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Butter Cream","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Pineapple","vendor":"SC","millipercent":4000}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"127663","name":"Pineapple Butter Cake #DIYDOWNUNDERNovemberChallange"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
