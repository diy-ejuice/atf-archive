If so try Sancho!  Don't know what Sancho is?!  Sancho is the extra fun VWB (vape with benefits) that gets your taste buds begging for more!  You will Forget all about your all day vape with every hit of Sancho, but no worries...  Sancho is worth it, it's fruit nachos!  On the inhale sweet strawberries, fuji apples, and peaches finely chopped.  On the exhale the fruit medley in a perfect caramel & honey glaze with crispy cinnamon tortillas!\r\n\r\n- Strawberry Ripe, Fuji, and Honey peach adds a brightly balanced fruit blend that doesn't get old.\r\n\r\n- Caramel Candy and honey (from the Honey Peach) gives a beautiful light glaze for the fruit to mingle with and adds sweetness to the mix without the need of sweeteners.\r\n\r\n- CDS and Cookie mimics the taste of baked cinnamon tortillas for the fruits to sit on.\r\n\r\n- Sancho is good after 24 hours, but a week steep is preferred to let the flavors meld together and soften any soft edges.","steep_days":"7","temperature":"0","recipe_score":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-12T14:04:54.000-05:00","best_vg":"84%","views":"1532","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Strawberry (ripe)","flavor_id":"271","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":6000},{"name":"Fuji","flavor_id":"506","vendor":"FA","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Honey Peach","flavor_id":"4561","vendor":"JF","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Caramel Candy","flavor_id":"1233","vendor":"FW","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Cinnamon Danish Swirl","flavor_id":"35","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Cookie","flavor_id":"490","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1500}],"reviews":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"18429","name":"Sancho"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
