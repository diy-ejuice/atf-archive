I added 2 drops of FLV per 10ml, and it's really helped the lime stick around. When I mix another bottle, I'll drop it down to 1d per 10ml, because at the current amount, it added almost a lime you get from the lime tootsie rolls. Either way, the strawberry has stuck around, and carries itself well against the lime-aid background.&#xD;\n&#xD;\nShake and vape was good, but did have that slight harshness from the FA cold pressed, but about a week later, this has turned into something beautiful. Thanks again,","score":5}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"6711","name":"Red limeade"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
