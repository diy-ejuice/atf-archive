Moving on, my memory fails me to wether there was any sort of ‚Äúberry crunch‚Äù aspect to the original juice in question but with only citrus being featured it seemed a bit one dimensional so DV berry crush was used to add that extra dimension I was looking for, I tried a few different berry concentrates including WF berry cobbler which was excellent as far as the berries were concerned but having to take it to such a level where the berries came through I was introducing too much AP so I tried FA forest mix and VTA forest fruits but finally settled on DV berry crush as it seemed to work with the cereal a bit better. The FLV milk adds just a touch of malt that I was looking for. Puff cereal is a good base but only low as it contains quite a bit of AP, FA cookie gives the cereal a sort of ‚Äúcooked/oven baked‚Äù tinge that I was looking for, The cream puff helps both sides out, the cereal side and adds a touch of butyric for that full fat milk taste, the Devon cream thickens it and adds a velvety touch. All in all it‚Äôs a different take on a classic and I‚Äôd love you to try it üòÅ\r\n\r\nIf you like what I do and this recipe then please rate and review accordingly ‚ù§Ô∏è","steep_days":"14","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T20:33:22.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"1140","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Carrot Cake SC","flavor_id":"10117","vendor":"WF","millipercent":1250},{"name":"Puff Cereal (Frosted) SC","flavor_id":"10268","vendor":"WF","millipercent":1100},{"name":"Milk","flavor_id":"4385","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":750},{"name":"Berry Crush","flavor_id":"5358","vendor":"DV","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Cookie","flavor_id":"490","vendor":"FA","millipercent":750},{"name":"Cream Puff SC","flavor_id":"10109","vendor":"WF","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Devon Cream","flavor_id":"4223","vendor":"CC","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Fruit Circles","flavor_id":"139","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2150},{"name":"Lemon Meringue Tart","flavor_id":"10071","vendor":"VT","millipercent":750},{"name":"Sweetness","flavor_id":"4413","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":500}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"187892","name":"Repool backwards"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
