When I tasted it I immediately thought it was everything WF Butter Pecan Pie was missing. A bakery type crust and some dark gooey-ness. Lucky Shot is basically a one shot and already pretty complex, so I wanted to keep the mix simple. I've been looking to make a bourbon pecan recipe for a while and TFA Kentucky Bourbon fits so well in this mix. \r\n\r\nThis recipe is easy to alter the percentages and customise to your own tastes. \r\nGive it at least 3 days steep.\r\n\r\nIf you mix it I hope you enjoy it!","steep_days":"3","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"total_reviews":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-02T15:41:46.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"440","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Butter Pecan Pie","vendor":"WF","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Lucky Shot","vendor":"OSD","millipercent":7000},{"name":"Kentucky Bourbon","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1250}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"195320","name":"Bourbon Pecan Pie - Simple Recipe"}}}
