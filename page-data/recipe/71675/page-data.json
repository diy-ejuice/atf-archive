Mixed with vanilla custard just to help mold everything together with the meringue for sweetness and the marshmallow for texture its a pretty solid ice cream stone\r\n\r\nStripple part - inw shisha strawb / jf strawberry sweet / fa blackcurrent / inw raspberry:\r\n\r\nShisha strawberry and jf strawberry sweet are the best strawberry combination and provide a sweet syrupy taste that you would find in a strawberry sauce mixed with fa blackcurrent just to make it pop a little bit more and only 0.6% of inw raspberry so that it doesnt over power the whole mix\r\n\r\nAnd biscuit because everyone needs a cone with the ice cream","steep_days":"7","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-06T20:43:28.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"1433","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Vanilla Ice Cream","vendor":"LB","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Vanilla Custard","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":500},{"name":"Marshmallow","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Meringue","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Shisha Strawberry","vendor":"INW","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Strawberry Sweet","vendor":"JF","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Blackcurrant","vendor":"FA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Raspberry","vendor":"INW","millipercent":600},{"name":"Biscuit","vendor":"INW","millipercent":250},{"name":"Super Sweet","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":500}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"71675","name":"The stripple effect"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
