I guess I'm kinda back, recipes will be spaced out a lot more than once a month like I used to.  I'll probably shoot for 4/year.\r\n\r\nFirst things first, I'm mixing this up after trying Toasted by @MrBurgandy and I hope you don't mind me throwing my spin on it.  I really enjoyed Toasted, but for my taste I wanted something a touch different.  Cinnamon Sugar mixed into a bowl of Corn Flakes with banana's in milk sounds phenomenal.  Since I'm currently on a Keto diet I can't eat it, so I want to vape it.\r\n\r\nSo I started with the Cinnamon part.  Cap Cinnamon Sugar with FLV Cinnamon Crunch just went so well in one of my favorite dessert recipes: \r\nhttps://alltheflavors.com/recipes/143468#there_can_be_only_one_hetch_a_churro_and_ice_cream_saga_by_diy_discord\r\nSo I decided to give it a go here to give me that cinnamon toast crunch type cinnamon flavor while adding a touch of graininess.\r\n\r\nThe Cereal 27 base is great for my cornflakes base, but I decided to crank it up a tiny notch by adding some of FA corn.  I wanted to add a touch of savory to this recipe and the FA Corn just did it so well when mixed with Cereal 27.\r\n\r\nPur Banana is such a great real banana flavor and you don't get any of that runts taste.\r\n\r\nI used the Marshmallow to give it some additional sweetness.\r\n\r\nThe OOO Creamy Underpants + FA Milk combo with FW Hazelnut as a bit of an emulsifier just work wonderfully.  It gives you a nice creamy drizzle of milk.  If you don't have FA Milk, which is likely, you could probably crank up the Creamy Underpants and ditch the hazelnut.

If you vape right off the shake, you're going to be overwhelmed by the taste of creamed corn (which some might like), but after the 7 day steep, it develops into a wonderful grainy cereal with the Cereal 27, far better than just the 27 on its own.  Just enough banana to taste like a fresh banana cut up in a bowl of cereal, and nice cinnamon undertone.  FA Milk and OOO Undertone provide the creamy milk base, and really bring this one home.  It's addictive to say the very least.","score":5}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"181762","name":"Cinnana Crunchies Cereal Drizzle(Toasted REMIX)"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
