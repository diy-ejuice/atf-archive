The JF is nice and natural but also slightly syrupy. I wanted to brighten this mix so I used the FLV Boysenberry which also accented the syrupy-ness of the JF Blueberry. FInally I have my lemonade base. Most of the heavy lifting is done by FLV Lemonade (Fucking love this stuff) which i accented with FA lemon Zest. This was kinda my tester for The Raspberry Lemonade (WHICH AGAIN IS NICOTINE RIVER/RIVER SUPPLY NOT OOO) i used it to kind bridge the berries and the lemonade base which worked out. SNV all day Would love to hear Feedback \r\n","steep_days":"1 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-12T02:46:06.000-05:00","best_vg":"72%","views":"864","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Mango Indian Special","flavor_id":"10439","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Mango","flavor_id":"3516","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Blueberry","flavor_id":"4741","vendor":"JF","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Boysenberry","flavor_id":"614","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":500},{"name":"Raspberry Lemonade","flavor_id":"10574","vendor":"NR","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Lemonade","flavor_id":"636","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Lemon Zest","flavor_id":"4854","vendor":"FA","millipercent":500}],"reviews":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"187373","name":"Mango Berries Lemonade "}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
