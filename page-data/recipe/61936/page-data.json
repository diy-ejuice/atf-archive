Definitely not an authentic fruit but delicious all the same. This Is a custard for those people that dislike capella vanilla custard v1 or those who don't want to wait the two weeks  for it to steep. This custard combination needs half the steep time of capella vanilla custard v1 at 7 days it. Is completely blended I love it after 3 days but I also like capella vanilla custard v1 after 7 days so its fair to say you may want the full 7 day steep???  This Is definitely one of my favorite mixes I have made to date its a  Sweet Creamy candy custard leaving only   one question KIWANA U WANA??????\r\n\r\nUse any VG/pg % you prefer it has plenty of flavor as a max VG but will be great at whatever % you prefer.","steep_days":"7","temperature":"420","recipe_score":5,"updated_at":"2020-12-12T10:33:41.000-05:00","best_vg":"85%","views":"4682","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Kiwi","flavor_id":"522","vendor":"FA","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Banana Cream","flavor_id":"210","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Armenia (apricot)","flavor_id":"507","vendor":"FA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Custard","flavor_id":"4210","vendor":"INW","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Creme Brulee (yc)","flavor_id":"894","vendor":"INW","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Holy Vanilla","flavor_id":"2385","vendor":"DFS","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Cream Fresh","flavor_id":"540","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000}],"reviews":[{"user":"Ebc88","text":"Tried after about a 3 week steep. Banana and kiwi came through perfectly. The cream/custard base is excellent very creamy and rich.

I mixed it up on a whim and vaped the whole 30ml in 2 days which is super rare for me. Gotta mix up a 120ml for this one. ","score":5},{"user":"R2ME2","text":"Just mixed this up out of curiosity and what a pleasant surprise! Banana cream and kiwi is a combination I never would have paired together, but it works.  Love the caramel undertone from the creme brulee and can't wait to see how this steeps. I can definitely see why this is your new ADV...I can't put it down. Delicious!","score":5}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"61936","name":"KIWANA  U WANA   CUSTARD!!!"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
