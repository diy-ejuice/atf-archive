Just kiddin Mr-G :D for me this beats out 95% of all chocolate vapes tried. Well rounded chocolate and cream flavor...no band aid flavor...well balanced with nice sweetness"},{"user":"Mr-G","text":"dont like it"},{"user":"MattSnyder","text":"Haven't tried it yet but banana sounds like a good add or maybe even berries strawberry etc...."},{"user":"louiesquared","text":"Very Good. I haven't tasted the original so I can not compare but it tastes like Nestle Quick to me."},{"user":"RobS","text":"great recipe, very close to original."},{"user":"YsarKain","text":"I think this tastes better than actual Metix Golden Ticket.  Great flavor but I get tired of it pretty fast, like the store-bought version it seems to leave you wanting something."},{"user":"LLcoolwhip","text":"Amazing recipe!"},{"user":"hashslingingslashur","text":"Subbed out EM and Sweetener for NN Monk Fruit (pg) at 1.5%&#xD;\n&#xD;\nWow great chocolate vape. Really loving this and tastes fantastic with the monk fruit. &#xD;\n&#xD;\nGiving this 5 stars because its simple to make but very satisfying as a shake and vape. "},{"user":"Peewee","text":"One of the top mixed recipes on site yet 1 review? So i will add my 1 cent since I'm new and don't get 2. I mix it up now and then its pretty good. Not a Nestl√© chocolate milk more of a yoohoo to me. Kinda goes good with my coffee in the mornings."},{"user":"BigMoose","text":"This is a pretty good chocolate milkshake vape. With the lack of good chocolate flavorings on the market, Wayne did a good job of hitting that chocolate shake profile with this recipe. The custard and EM do a good job of hiding the tootsie-roll flavor from double choc, while adding some body to the vanilla swirl \"milkshake\"."}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"3351","name":"Chocolate Milk: A Golden Ticket REMIX"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
