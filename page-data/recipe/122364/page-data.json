I've been vaping this, or small variations of this for around 2 years pretty consistently. I don't need to spend a long time explaining how 1,2,3 works it's just a simple format for making easy pairings.\r\n\r\nFA Raspberry: At 1% it's enough to come through the whole recipe, but without it's very prominent floral note taking over. You could easily use TPA (Sweet) Raspberry with slightly more, or INW Raspberry with half as much.\r\n\r\nTPA Key Lime: At 2% it's a bit strong after the shake but it does suffer from some fading as is common in most citrus flavors. You could sub this with another lime fairly easily, but the ranges in potency are much wider in citrus flavors so use cautious judgement in choosing which ones.\r\n\r\nFA Pear: at 3% this is really the main body of the flavor. It provides a juicy sweet centerpiece that carries both accompanying flavors easily without being forced out of the picture. I sometimes use an additional .5-1% of INW Pear if I'm really wanting a bit of extra flavor.\r\n\r\nAnd that's it! Quick and easy. If you like bold lime you can vape this fresh, but I usually leave it a day or two to let the lime settle a bit.","steep_days":"3","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"total_reviews":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-06T20:44:18.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"5240","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Berryl (raspberry)","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Key Lime","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Pear","vendor":"FA","millipercent":3000}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"122364","name":"Simple "}}}
