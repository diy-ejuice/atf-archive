A warm, baked apple filling with a touch of cinnamon, inside a light and flaky Danish pastry lattice, topped with a strawberry drizzle, accompanied by a malted cream.\r\n\r\nThe CDS speaks for itself as a base note here.  Used at a level where the pastry is prominent and the cinnamon noticeable.  Cinnamon is such a classic pairing with apple that I really feel this brings the apple filling and the pastry together as one.  Fuji is providing the apple filling here and Liquid Amber is helping to take it from a raw apple to a baked apple flavour.  The lemon is there to try and lift the top notes of the apple out of the muddiness that LA can create and also to bring a hint of citrus against the sweetness of the strawberry drizzle.  I used malted milk as an accompaniment to try and strengthen the bakery element a little whilst giving a suggestion of a cream finish. Besides, I LOVE malted milk :-)  Given the option of another ingredient I would have included some FLV Cream just to round it all out.\r\n\r\nTo me, this tastes great and certainly all of the basket ingredients can be clearly tasted throughout the vape, though the exhale should carry a sweetness that the inhale doesn't.\r\n\r\nI would recommend at least 5 days to steep but should be at its best after 7.","steep_days":"0","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"total_reviews":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-05T12:07:57.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"1125","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Cinnamon Danish Swirl","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Strawberry (ripe)","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Fuji","vendor":"FA","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Liquid Amber","vendor":"FA","millipercent":400},{"name":"Malted Milk (conc)","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Lemon Sicily","vendor":"FA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Ethyl Maltol 10%","vendor":"OTHR","millipercent":1000}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"15341","name":"Strapple Stroooodle"}}}
