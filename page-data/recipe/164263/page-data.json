So when Liquid Barn released White Chocolate and Peppermint as separate concentrates, I just had to see what they could do. This is my first attempt at using WC in a mix, and after a solo test I think there is a lot if potential here. It has the type of sweetness you would expect from a white chocolate and I get a sense of creaminess that I knew would pair with LB Vanilla Ice Cream. Strawberry was the obvious choice for fruit, so I used one of my favorite Strawberry combos and VIOLA!! A simple SnV S&C recipe that is a bit unique in profile and tasty as well. It does get better after a steep of about a week, but why wait. Mix 2 bottles, one for now and one for later.
