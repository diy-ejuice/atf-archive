The whole recipe was constructed while single flavor testing the INW Am4A. Am4A shouted for a FW Blood Orange. Blood Orange brought the FA Jamaica Special (Jamaican Rhum). Also, there are hints of cocoa in the exhale of Am4A. So, Double chocolate Clear TPA was in the game but I wanted it to be kind of bitter. I also wanted the alcohol notes of the rum to be absorbed by a cake. Chocolate Fudge Brownie CAP was the perfect solution. \r\nThe final result is a dark, bitter and sweet vape.
