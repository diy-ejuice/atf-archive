After all, being a basic white B*tch isn't always a bad thing.\r\n\r\nBrought out my Lotta Latte and Lucky Shot which makes a GREAT coffee vape, tossed in some Yam and Eggnog for the best dang Pumpkin Spice Latte you could ever want. I can't vape cinnamon so I used the eggnog for the nutmeg. If you can vape cinnamon .25 cinnamon ceylon would seriously kick this up to a better spice level.","steep_days":"7","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T17:36:08.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"633","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Lotta Latte","vendor":"OSD","millipercent":5000},{"name":"Eggnog","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Lucky Shot","vendor":"OSD","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Yam","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Sweetness","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":500}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"181286","name":"TOC'S Basic White B*tch"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
