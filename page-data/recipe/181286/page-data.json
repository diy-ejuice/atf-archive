After all, being a basic white B*tch isn't always a bad thing.\r\n\r\nBrought out my Lotta Latte and Lucky Shot which makes a GREAT coffee vape, tossed in some Yam and Eggnog for the best dang Pumpkin Spice Latte you could ever want. I can't vape cinnamon so I used the eggnog for the nutmeg. If you can vape cinnamon .25 cinnamon ceylon would seriously kick this up to a better spice level.","steep_days":"7","temperature":"0","recipe_score":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-11T14:09:40.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"641","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Lotta Latte","flavor_id":"4348","vendor":"OSD","millipercent":5000},{"name":"Eggnog","flavor_id":"4396","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Lucky Shot","flavor_id":"4349","vendor":"OSD","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Yam","flavor_id":"8575","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Sweetness","flavor_id":"4413","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":500}],"reviews":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"181286","name":"TOC'S Basic White B*tch"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
