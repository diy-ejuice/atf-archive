Adam was around the corner screaming use this Sour Apple as Eve handed me some raspberries bubbling in citrus (so they didn't make it to heaven apparently lol) \r\n\r\nWith these ingredients I went to work for the Devil. \r\n\r\nAre you pleased with what I have created I ask the Devil.\r\nHe replies \"we all have a bit of me inside us all ha hah,\r\nso let all those DIY'ers decide ! Whooo wooo ha wha wa ha aha ahhhh\" \r\n\r\nI dare you to mix this !!!! \r\n","steep_days":"666 (SNV)","temperature":"443","recipe_score":5,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:50:52.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"1807","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Blood Orange","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Citrus Soda","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Fire Cinnamon","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":250},{"name":"Heat","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":250},{"name":"Red Raspberry","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":250},{"name":"Sour Apple","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":500}],"reviews":[{"user":"ID10-T","text":"&#xD;\nWhat a fun little sort of abstract recipe. I could probably do without the extra throat hit from the FLV Heat, but maybe it drives home the cocktail profile, making it burn like strong liquor in a way that it wouldn’t with just the cinnamon &amp; sour apple? Regardless, the apple, raspberry, and citrus soda all come through and play well together, and the little bit of cinnamon on top makes it more interesting. If you mix this up, you’ll probably think as I do now that there should be more apple + citrus soda and raspberry + citrus soda recipes.  &#xD;\n"}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"147345","name":"You Devil"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
