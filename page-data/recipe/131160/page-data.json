Just going to go over the differences,and why I pick certain ingredients.\r\n\r\nThe first and most obvious got rid of the peach, and put in green apple. CAP  green apple hard candy, is a great green apple candy flavor, that pairs perfectly with, FLV fire cinnamon. Also added a little FA pair to accent the Apple and melon.\r\n\r\nReduced the amount of vanilla swirl in this recipe. I made 120 mil test batch of mrs. Claus dirty melon milk, and it's gone ðŸ˜‹ so obviously I really enjoyed it. That said,  I knew we should get away with reducing the vanilla swirl by a few percentage points.\r\n\r\nSincerely hope you enjoy, happy holidays!!!\r\n\r\nBonus recipe, this one was from last year, and still one of my favorites.\r\n\r\nhttps://alltheflavors.com/recipes/67091#tropical_eggnog_coquito_by_chrisdvr1","steep_days":"3 (SNV)","temperature":"420","recipe_score":0,"total_reviews":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T17:35:22.000-05:00","best_vg":"69%","views":"2377","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Wild Melon","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Vanilla Swirl","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":5500},{"name":"Cream","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1800},{"name":"Super Sweet","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":350},{"name":"Fire Cinnamon","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":350},{"name":"Green Apple Hard Candy","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Pear","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"131160","name":"The Grinch's fiery green melon goo"}}}
