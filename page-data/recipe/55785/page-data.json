Thanks Wayne!","score":5},{"user":"Asire","text":"Mixed 60/40 Tested in Hadaly SS316 Fused Clapton.  The first thing that impressed me about this recipe is the insanely delicous smell. It smells like a medium thick cream with extremely juciy slices of sweet and ripe peaches. On the inhale i get the sweet peach again which gets rounded out on the exhale by a very delightful cream. The cream still has this lingering taste of the peach with it. I'd really start vaping it after the 3 days steep since the flavor is fully developed and from then on the peach REALLY SLOWLY starts to fade into the cream. Really impressive recipe if you can get WF Peach Pie &amp; Cream which will be the rarest flavor in most arsenals definitifely mix this up!!! Keep mixing, much love","score":5}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"55785","name":"Peach with Almond Whipped Cream (Flavor Book Entry Recipe)"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
