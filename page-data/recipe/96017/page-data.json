(not sure when it's \"in season\") It's a creamy peanut butter pie that's very rich and uses Nutter Butter in their crust instead of graham. It's not 100% that... but it's very good.\r\n\r\nThis does become richer with a week+ steep but it's pretty good after a day. \r\n\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQ2Yg6tK0k&t=1s","steep_days":"7","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"total_reviews":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-02T09:26:25.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"1773","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Cheesecake","vendor":"VT","millipercent":1100},{"name":"Honey Roasted Peanuts SC","vendor":"WF","millipercent":500},{"name":"Peanut Butter","vendor":"LA","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Sugar Cookie","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1250},{"name":"Vanilla Custard","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1000}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"96017","name":"Peanut Butter Pie"}}}
