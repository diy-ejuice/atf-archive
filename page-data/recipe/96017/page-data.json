(not sure when it's \"in season\") It's a creamy peanut butter pie that's very rich and uses Nutter Butter in their crust instead of graham. It's not 100% that... but it's very good.\r\n\r\nThis does become richer with a week+ steep but it's pretty good after a day. \r\n\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQ2Yg6tK0k&t=1s","steep_days":"7","temperature":"0","recipe_score":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-10T17:57:26.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"1784","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Cheesecake","flavor_id":"9361","vendor":"VT","millipercent":1100},{"name":"Honey Roasted Peanuts SC","flavor_id":"8371","vendor":"WF","millipercent":500},{"name":"Peanut Butter","flavor_id":"962","vendor":"LA","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Sugar Cookie","flavor_id":"115","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1250},{"name":"Vanilla Custard","flavor_id":"633","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1000}],"reviews":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"96017","name":"Peanut Butter Pie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
