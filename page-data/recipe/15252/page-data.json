If it wasn't so good, I would have selected a different entry. This is a warm buttery fritter that is just in time for fall. Here in Canada we have Tim Hortons for our coffee stop and they make a very simple fresh (not overly sweet) apple fritter I really wanted to recreate. I mix this at 30/70 PG/VG and let it steep a week.\r\n\r\nCAP Cinnamon Danish Swirl- this has a rich spicy cinnamon base with it requiring a high enough percentage for all notes to come through against the buttery cream but not so much to get a mouthful of cinnamon. 3% was just right to get this. \r\n\r\nFA Fuji- at higher percentages this can be nauseating but is still a main note in the profile. 1% gives a greener apple without over powering the recipe. It holds on the steep and allows for a fresh apple note to ring through. \r\n\r\nTPA Strawberry Ripe- this will need a higher percentage than the apple to lend its sweetness and red strawberry back note. It gives us a bridge between the apple and danish swirl. \r\n\r\nFW Sweet Cream- this is imperative for our buttery creaminess in the recipe. It takes some steep time to shine through but when it arrives it creates a balance in the recipe. \r\n\r\nFW Salty Butter Balls- I have no idea what salty butterballs are but know this flavor well. It works very well with Cinnamon Danish Swirl and the very slight salty butter flavor adds a richness and spicy butter to the mix. There is also a brown sugar like note included with this flavor and does it without the burnt sugar taste found in other options. \r\n\r\nFW Butter pecan- what is lacking in the Butter balls and sweet cream is found here. The final butterscotch like flavor in the butter pecan tops it all off. There is a subtle pecan flavor that lends well to the other ingredients and rounds it all out.
