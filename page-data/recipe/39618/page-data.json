I'd say without the koolada it's dead on but I like the cool sensation koolada brings to the mix. The mix works great without koolada.\r\n\r\nObviously you'll want to use Lorann's Watermelon Clear.\r\n\r\nTPA Dragonfruit:\r\nUsed as a sweetener and blender to really pop out the candy watermelon.\r\n\r\nFLV Greek Yogurt:\r\nI spent alot of time over a few revisions trying to find the perfect concentrate to provide a slight tartness alongside a light cream to match Crush Fruit's Sweet Eliquid. It hit the mark for me at just a couple of drops.\r\n\r\nLA Watermelon (Clear):\r\nThe king candy watermelon (In my book), This is the shining light of the recipe.\r\n\r\nFLV Watermelon:\r\nA watermelon kick on the exhale was missing from the original mixes, After adding this as backup it completed the watermelon flavor throughout. It's a little bit candy (which helps in this mix) but is also a nice, sweet, rounded watermelon.\r\n\r\nCAP Jelly Candy:\r\nThis provides the mix with a candy texture. Any more and it would impart an unpleasant flavor. At 1% you get a nice texture with this ingredient.\r\n\r\nKoolada:\r\nOptional. I enjoy the cool sensation it provides, But the mix works well without it.\r\n\r\nI hope you enjoy it as much as I have been!","steep_days":"1 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"total_reviews":1,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:49:14.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"3840","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Koolada 10 Pg","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":250},{"name":"Dragonfruit","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":750},{"name":"Greek Yogurt","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":150},{"name":"Watermelon","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":300},{"name":"Watermelon","vendor":"LA","millipercent":4750},{"name":"Jelly Candy","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1000}],"reviews":[{"user":"gravi-tea","score":"5","text":"my girlfriend has been going nuts for this one.
