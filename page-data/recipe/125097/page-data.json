Much of this is to do with taming the accompanying citrus notes. To avoid this, FA Juicy Strawberry and TFA Meringue were marshalled as muting agents as well as for essential cereal sugar sweetness. \r\n\r\nFA Juicy Strawberry contains a truckload of Ethyl Maltol with caramel-like sweetness and cereal sugar texture. I found it works better in cereals than Strawberry Ripe. Just 0.75% Juicy Strawberry is enough to tame 2.5% FW Fruit Rings and provide a cereal sugar effect. (N.B.  If you prefer a little less Ethyl Maltol sweetness,  lower to 0.50%,  which does the trick too)  \r\n\r\nTFA Meringue is an indispensable and distinct cereal sugar (FA Meringue doesn't work as well so no subs), however, the downside is that it can high-hack a recipe if used too high. After various trials, the sweet spot was hit at 0.65% to get that frosted sugar sweetness and texture.\r\n\r\n1% FLV Cream was boosted with 0.75% TFA Bavarian Cream to make a light cream base. Not much Bavarian Cream was needed as I didn't want to overdo it with E.M. I forgot how useful Bavarian Cream is which adds creamy undertones as well as smoothen things out. 0.75% FW Hazelnut, a reliable workhorse, rounds out the cereal milk base and provides a creamy malt background. \r\n\r\nFinally, to boost the overall cereal sweetness, 0.50% FW Sweetener.\r\n\r\nAnd that's it. There's nothing new going on in this recipe; fruit loop profiles are ten a penny. Besides I didn't want to add to the already high cereal mortality rate on recipe sites. However, this simple recipe turned out so well I thought I'd share it as it might just float your boat. \r\n\r\nBetter as a S&V for that sweet crispy sugary coated taste. \r\n\r\nEnjoy!
