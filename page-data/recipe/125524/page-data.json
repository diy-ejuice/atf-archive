This base is great with other flavors as the top note as evidenced by Edible Malfunction's Backwoods Lemonade, some blackberry lemonades, and a few other variations floating around. I love FLV Boysenberry and think this mix is a potential ADV for me, and sits well alongside the rest of the lemonade arsenal I carry most days. I mix at 80/20 but feel free to run max VG if desired. \r\n\r\nDropped TFA Sweetener for .5% Super Sweet. EM is unnecessary. Sweeten to taste obviously.","steep_days":"1 (SNV)","temperature":"400","recipe_score":5,"total_reviews":2,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:50:31.000-05:00","best_vg":"80%","views":"2315","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Lemonade","vendor":"LA","millipercent":6000},{"name":"Lemon Sicily","vendor":"FA","millipercent":750},{"name":"Boysenberry","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Super Sweet","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":500}],"reviews":[{"user":"VenSyBoy","score":"5","text":""},{"user":"ID10-T","score":"5","text":"So this just swiped the lemons from the legendary Best Damn Pink Lemonade... and created a new and even better (!) recipe by replacing TFA Strawberry Ripe and TFA Sweet Raspberry with FLV Boysenberry. For the most part, the Boysenberry combines with the lemon, with little separation between the two. Really makes the case for how well this Boysenberry tastes with lemons. There might be some room for improvement with other lemons or backing up the berry. But for three common (or should be common) flavors in a quick little perfectly shake-and-vapable recipe? This is amazing.   "}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"125524","name":"Boysenberry Lemonade"}}}
