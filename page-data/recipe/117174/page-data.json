Especially when their ripeness is on point. I've been playing around for some time\r\nwith all different mangoes. Although it seemed so easy at the start, I really had a hard time nailing this profile.\r\nIt became a mission with a lot of back and forth, and lot's of different approaches.\r\nSo my journey to my perfect mango started. I know I'm a little lyrical about it but hey it was a lotta fun ;)\r\nFrom the start my favorite mango combo was 4% VT Shisha Mango with 1% FLV Mango. It looked as if they were made for eachother, but it wasn't a happy marriage. I needed to find a marriage counselor and if not this was going to end up in a divorce. That's when I met CAP Sweet Mango 1% the perfect marriage counselor for my unhappy couple. After some sessions and working on their relationship they finally came together as one. However this all came with a cost. CAP Sweet Mango may have been the best she wasn't cheap. The price I had to pay was 100 overripeness, some weird currancy used in the medieval Bahama's. I didn't have the money, so the next month I spend with Sweet Mango being her slave, harvesting her CAP Golden Pineapples 2% and CAP Sweet Guava's at 1%. I finally payed my depth but you know what they say \"it's hard to fix a problem without causing another\". And so it happened. All the hard work harvesting the sweet guava's caused \"harsh\" pain in my back. The only thing that could help me in the middle of the forest whithout a druid or medicine man within thousands of miles, was the fruit garded by a dragon, also known as dragonfruit. Everybody talked about it but not a lot of people have actually seen it. Most of the people that went search for it have never been returned. What choice did I have, put away my dream finding my perfect mango or push through. I went with the last option and a couple miles further I was getting close. Burned trees everywhere. The dragon and his fruits had to be close. Not that much later I noticed a snoring sound in front of me. There he was, in all his glory laying in the middle of an open spot having a nap. The trees around him were loaded with his fruits. So I started filling my backpack but the moment I picked the second fruit the dragon got restless  and I decided to make a run for it. A close call but I made it. No doubt the most scary, but probably the easiest obstacle upon my road. After a few miles and in safe distance for the dragon I took one of his fruits .5% out of my backpack, started eating it and right away the \"harsh\" pain in my back disappeared. \r\nWhat was that, listen.............. there was something in a near distance whispering my name. I got attracted to it, I had to move on. And at last there it was, my perfect mango right in front of me. I finally could see it, I could even smell it. As I was about to get ready for my final sprint, my last problem showed up. After being on a quest for so long, and all those obstacles I had to overcome, I was so thirsty. I needed to do something about it before I could reach my goal. Thank god I still had a Philipine Mango 2% Lemonade 1% in my backpack. That was just the \"juicy\" lifesaver I needed in order to reach the finish. While crossing the finishline I had my last dragonfruit .5% what made the slight \"harshness\" my lemonade left, disappear in the blink of an eye. \r\nFinally I had her in my hands, my perfect mango. She looked delightful, her smell made my mouth water. I took a bite and ........... I only have one word left \"HEAVEN\"\r\nI hope you enjoyed my journey as much as I did. I can promise you, you will enjoy this juice even more.\r\nAs always Super Sweet is optional, but here the recipe benefits from it, it doesn't only sweeten the juice but it also makes it brighter.","steep_days":"2 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"updated_at":"2020-12-12T11:52:13.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"4336","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Mango","flavor_id":"3516","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Philippine Mango","flavor_id":"258","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Sweet Mango","flavor_id":"120","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Shisha Mango","flavor_id":"8964","vendor":"VT","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Sweet Guava","flavor_id":"118","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Dragonfruit","flavor_id":"226","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Golden Pineapple","flavor_id":"61","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Lemonade","flavor_id":"636","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Super Sweet","flavor_id":"2384","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":300}],"reviews":[{"user":"TheJuiceJackBuilt","text":"What a great mango recipe.
