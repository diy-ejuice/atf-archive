I started with just the west coast punch and the Hawaiian drink, but the pineapple needed to be a little stronger in the combo so I added the pineapple juicy for the punchy pineapple flavor it brings. It still needed to be juicy and wetter so I went .5 cactus and pear to up the wet without too much flavor in the mix from either. I made this for another friend with 1% SS and she loved it as well- She said it is very distinctly the blue flavor of koolaid. The wife likes it right off the shake, but says it does something nice after a few days in the bottle if she can make it last that long.
