I used Strawberry Harvest  JF for the main strawberry note. It's a clean candyish strawberry that is similar to Juicy Strawberry FA, but I personally like strawberry harvest more. I boosted the strawberry with Red Touch Strawberry FA.\r\n\r\nThe kiwi note is candyish and slightly tart. I used Kiwi FW for the candy note, and layered Kiwi FA for its tartness.\r\n\r\nI wanted to add some Vanilla since it goes so well with fruits. I decided to use Vanilla Bean Ice Cream by FW, because it's a plain vanilla that does not add alot of weight at this percentage.\r\n\r\nI added Whipped Cream by TFA to blend all the flavors together.\r\n\r\nTo sweeten it up, I added 0.50% of Super Sweet. This is optional. It's pretty sweet without any added sweetener.\r\n\r\n####Feedback is welcomed. If you mix up my recipe and review it, in return, I will mix up a recipe of yours and give you an honest review. \r\n\r\nI tested many different variations of flavors and percentages, and I'm finally happy to release this one\r\n\r\nThis is a shake and vape, but the flavors pop after 2 days. I vape this in various rda's and rta's, and usually mix it at 60-70VG. Enjoy!\r\n\r\n*I initially posted this recipe with Red Touch Strawberry FA @ 2% instead of Strawberry TFA.","steep_days":"2 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T19:15:23.000-05:00","best_vg":"60%","views":"1177","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Kiwi","vendor":"FW","millipercent":3500},{"name":"Strawberry Harvest","vendor":"JF","millipercent":2750},{"name":"Strawberry","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Vanilla Bean Ice Cream","vendor":"FW","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Whipped Cream","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Super Sweet","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":500},{"name":"Kiwi","vendor":"FA","millipercent":2250}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"87206","name":"Septet : Strawberry Kiwi & Cream "}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
