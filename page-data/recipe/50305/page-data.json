I wanted to keep the banana the main focus and build some gentle bakeries around it. I get a soft, ripe banana and a little graham on the inhale, the strawberry cream on the exhale with a hint of chocolate dusting right at the back. \r\nEDIT: Adjusted Shisha Strawberry and Vanilla Whipped Cream slightly to keep the strawberry from getting lost in the cream. After 1 day the banana settles in nicely. Smooth and delicate desert vape. \r\nHonestly can't stop vaping this right now. \r\nThoughts and comments welcome! \r\n","steep_days":"1 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T17:34:08.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"1752","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Banana","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1250},{"name":"Banana Cream","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1750},{"name":"Cheesecake (graham Crust)","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Shisha Strawberry","vendor":"INW","millipercent":600},{"name":"Strawberry (ripe)","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Vanilla Whipped Cream","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Cocoa","vendor":"FA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Super Sweet","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":250}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"50305","name":"Banana Split Cake"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
