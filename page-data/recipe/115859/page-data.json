Don't be alarmed by the flavor percentage. The TFA I'm using here is super weak (especially Sweet Tea).\r\n\r\nWhen ID10-T turned me onto TFA Sweet Tea I knew that I had the base for this remix. It's really weak and you can probably push it up to 15% solo. The generic watered down restaurant iced tea it pushes is light and doesn't bully a mix like FA Black Tea would here. \r\n\r\nTFA Honeysuckle/Cherry Blossom brings the cherry with some floral brightness. The Honeysuckle pushes it a little sweeter and adds some depth to the florals. I tried it without the Honeysuckle but something just seemed to be missing. \r\n\r\nCAP Hibiscus is here to add a bit of it's renowned sticky mouthfeel and add to the sweetness. \r\n\r\nThe small amount of FE Lemon brightens things up just a little bit and isn't really noticeable in the recipe. Can't have iced tea without just a little lemon.\r\n\r\nINW Natural Mint adds just a touch of cool natural mint to the profile. It's sits way on top and is just noticeable.\r\n\r\nAdd coolant if you wish. I like this with just the mint. It's a pretty delicate vape even with the high flavor percentage.

Anything with TFA Sweet Tea is right up my alley, and this is certainly no exception. The way Cherry Blossom, Hibiscus, and Honeysuckle are balanced into this recipe is brilliant. The FE Lemon works in the background beautifully, and INW Natural Mint is never a bad choice for some mint.  ","score":5},{"user":"Demented76","text":"This is delightfully different!  Admittedly it might not be a flavor for everyone but it was right up my alley!  Some people like florals and some don't.  If you like floral teas then you should really give this one a try!  I thought it was going to be much more floral heavy than it turned out to be.  It reminds me of an oriental type of tea.  Love it!
