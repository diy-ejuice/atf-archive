Feel free to swap it out with your favorite raspberry just know it won't be the same. I also don't expect any one to go out and order MF Raspberry Wild since it's so fucking expensive. Originally I was going for a raspberry shake with chunks of chocolate, but it ended up leaning more towards an actual ice cream. The first few days its vanilla ice cream with chunks of raspberry flavored dark chocolate, around a week it becomes ice cream with ripples of raspberry and chunks of dark chocolate. So basically vape this whenever and you choose what stage you like it best at.\r\n\r\n","steep_days":"1","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"total_reviews":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-06T20:43:38.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"994","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Cream Milky Undertone PG","vendor":"OOO","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Cream","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":500},{"name":"Wild Raspberry","vendor":"MF","millipercent":750},{"name":"Super Sweet","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":500},{"name":"Marshmallow","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":250},{"name":"French Vanilla Icecream","vendor":"HS","millipercent":500},{"name":"Australian Chocolate","vendor":"HS","millipercent":500}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"82476","name":"Raspberry Chunk"}}}
