Originally I put 0.25% FLV Pastry Zest and FLV Basil in it...but I don't know if it is just me not liking pastry zest or if it really was clashing with another note in the recipe, so I altered the recipe slightly and it definitely tastes better to me without those two, though I am tempted to add Basil back in, but I'll leave this recipe as is and if you feel adventurous you can give it a go with the basil and pastry zest if you want to. \r\n\r\nCheck out Episode 94 of the Mixin Vixens to see the full run down of what I get out of this recipe.
