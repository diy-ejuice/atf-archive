I really liked the vanilla wafer, and while I was working on a strawberry yoghurt recipe I thought why not combine them?\r\n\r\nThe wafer: WF Crispy Wafer SC + WF Sugar Cone SC + INW Biscuit. This stone is based on a slightly higher than usual percent of WF Crispy Wafer, which gives a thin and really crispy wafer. Adding WF Sugar Cone SC makes the wafer a little bit fluffier, while still mantaining the crispiness, and the INW Biscuit makes the whole wafer stone seem more prominent and robust. \r\n\r\nThe Yoghurt: Cap Creamy Yogurt + FW Yogurt + VT Sweet Cream is one of my favourite yoghurt combinations, and usually works with most fruit toppings. The low percentages are not able to completely create a nice bodied yoghurt, but for this recipe i kept them low so that the yoghurt doesnt overpower the wafer. VT Yoghurt Drink was added because I find the lemony notes to greatly accompany strawberries, giving a great sweet-n-sour taste.\r\n\r\nThe Strawberry: I wanted a sweet, slightly artificial strawberry that is incorporated in the yoghurt, and not a topping. For these reasons I picked the TPA Strawberry + JF Sweet Strawberry + INW Shisha Strawberry combo, which feels a little \"dark\" for a strawberry, but is tasty and syropy and worked out great.\r\n\r\nBecause of the not so bright strawberry combo, a hefty amound of Super Sweet is needed, adjust to taste but I wouldn't reccomend less than 0.4%.
