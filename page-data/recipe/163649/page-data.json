JF Sweet Strawberry lends a light syrupy strawberry to the mix and helps once again with the overall sweetness of the vape.  Cap Sweet Currant brightens the strawberry and pushes it out away from the yogurt base to let it stand alone while adding a lovely tartness towards the backend of the vape.\r\n\r\nFW Graham Cracker is FW Graham Cracker.\r\n\r\nSweeten to taste as per usual.","steep_days":"3 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-05T16:44:18.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"1240","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Strawberry","vendor":"RF","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Strawberry Sweet","vendor":"JF","millipercent":1250},{"name":"Sweet Currant","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":250},{"name":"Yogurt","vendor":"FW","millipercent":4500},{"name":"Bavarian Cream","vendor":"FW","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Graham Cracker","vendor":"FW","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Marshmallow (Vanilla)","vendor":"OOO","millipercent":1000}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"163649","name":"Strawberry Yogurt S'More"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
