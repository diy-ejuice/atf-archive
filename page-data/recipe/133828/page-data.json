You do amazing blueberry custards.  I am so glad that I ordered the ingredients to make this one.  "},{"user":"Gachatay","score":"5","text":"I'm really liking this. It's the first time I tried VTA Blueberry Jam and I gotta say it might be my new favorite BB. Paired up with the FLV really sells that baked quality and sits nicely in the back. The cream hear is thick with a light buttery note and some vanilla sprinkled in. This isn't a complex mix, it's just what it says...a blueberry cream, but it's balanced well and done right. Easily in the top 3 of the best BB cream mixes I've had. Definitely mixing this again. Great job!"}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"133828","name":"mlNikon's Blueberry Cream"}}}
