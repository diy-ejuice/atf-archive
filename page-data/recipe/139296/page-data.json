I was almost there but wanted another layer of apricot. Needs 4-5 days steep. Light cream, nice balanced apricot, and a nice tobacco note. \r\nPretty simple break down, Apricots, creams, tobaccos.\r\nFLV and FA Apricot make up a nice apricot, sorta sweet. FLV apricot brings the top end and FA brings more body.\r\nFLV Milk & honey and FLV Cream create a nice light cream thats subtle but there and placed well in the mix.\r\nFlv Kentucky Blend and FLV Red burley bring in a earthy dark notes. Red burley is just a tobacco i always come back to and enjoy every time.\r\n\r\nTested in Kayfun 5 MTL. \r\n","steep_days":"5","temperature":"430","recipe_score":4.5,"total_reviews":2,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:50:44.000-05:00","best_vg":"50%","views":"1698","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Apricot","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Kentucky Blend","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Red Burley","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":800},{"name":"Milk & Honey","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":200},{"name":"Armenia (apricot)","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Cream","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":600}],"reviews":[{"user":"ID10-T","score":"5","text":"Rather than an apricot pipe tobacco, this is more of a fruity dessert tobacco with apricot happening to be the fruit, like an Apricot RY4. It’s rich and satisfying, with thick, dark, brown sugar-like sweet cream blending with the tobacco and fruit notes. I’ve tried a few peach tobaccos that I’ve liked and even created one, but I like this one even more.
