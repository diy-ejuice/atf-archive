One of the my OG vape liquids...This is a remix of GLV's El Kamino! It's a dark Tobacco recipe with a lil Banana and CDS thrown in to take it to the next level.\r\nI found this a long long time ago on Reddit when I first started mixing... It's in a thread of solid clones that came from u/icecreamterror over at Planet of the Vapes (is what the thread says). Other than that I don't know who to give credit & thanks to.\r\n\r\nFor all I know this might not even be a remix but the Real Deal it tastes that good... ðŸ¤¤","steep_days":"5 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-06T12:54:51.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"565","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Black Mile","vendor":"FE","millipercent":5000},{"name":"Captain Flavor","vendor":"FE","millipercent":5000},{"name":"French Pipe Flavor","vendor":"FE","millipercent":5000},{"name":"Cinnamon Danish Swirl","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Banana","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"61623","name":"El Kamino"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
