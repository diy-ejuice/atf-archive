LB and OSSDIY are clearly the best Blue Razz flavors, but even combined at a high percentage need a little support, which is why added in the INW Rasp.  I love using INW rasp low to bolster the Blue Razz flavor and make it pop.\r\n\r\nI didn't want to cheat this recipe and build on my puckenade, so I took a shot at using some other lemons.  I really like the VT Lemonade clear its a nice lemonade with a touch of fizz, I don't really get the fizz in this, but that's because I didn't want this to be fizzy.  The vt sour lemon is extremely potent and adds some of that fresh lemon pucker and the FW Lemonade is just a lemonade support.\r\n\r\nI used the TFA Pear as a bit of sweet blender along the cactus to round some of the sharp edges.  For you cactus haters out there I can't taste any cactus since it's used so low.  The WS-23 and Cap SS can be used in whatever quantity you prefer.  For a simple recipe this took 2 additional revisions after I first mixed it, so this was nice little challenge.","steep_days":"0 (SNV)","temperature":"350","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T22:34:08.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"1270","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Blue Raspberry","flavor_id":"1479","vendor":"LB","millipercent":5000},{"name":"Blue Raspberry Slush","flavor_id":"2970","vendor":"OSD","millipercent":8000},{"name":"Lemonade","flavor_id":"1336","vendor":"FW","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Sour Lemon","flavor_id":"8971","vendor":"VT","millipercent":250},{"name":"Lemonade Clear","flavor_id":"8916","vendor":"VT","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Raspberry","flavor_id":"667","vendor":"INW","millipercent":500},{"name":"WS-23","flavor_id":"8085","vendor":"OTHR","millipercent":150},{"name":"Pear","flavor_id":"257","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":850},{"name":"Cactus","flavor_id":"647","vendor":"INW","millipercent":200},{"name":"Super Sweet","flavor_id":"2384","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":200}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"191442","name":"Smurfenade (Blue Raspberry Lemonade)"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
