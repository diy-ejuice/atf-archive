The obvious choice would be a spot of pear or even quince but they did not quite do the job. I opted for FA Peach White which is a delicate and complex fresh peach with just a tad of tartness to round out the recipe.\r\n\r\nThe FA Cream provides the necessary body to avoid a \"flat\" feeling in the mouth, synonymous with many (single) fruit vapes\r\n\r\nWS23 cools everything down without detracting from the star of show.  Feel free to start the WS23 off at 0.25% and adjust up if required.\r\nSub WS23 with Koolada at your preferred % if preferred.\r\n\r\nGive this one 2 days and she is perfect!\r\n\r\n","steep_days":"2 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-10T13:44:51.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"2541","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Apple Fuji","flavor_id":"4886","vendor":"FA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Apple Stark","flavor_id":"4887","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Double Apple","flavor_id":"45","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":2000},{"name":"WS-23","flavor_id":"8085","vendor":"OTHR","millipercent":500},{"name":"Cream Fresh","flavor_id":"540","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Peach White","flavor_id":"543","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000}],"reviews":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"55334","name":"Icee Apple"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
