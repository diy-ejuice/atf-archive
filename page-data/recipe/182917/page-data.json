I've always liked Hawaiian Pog, but for some reason got an off note from the original, probably just me!! Anyhoo, this is my take on it and it came out pretty dang delicious! Awesome off the shake, and even better after a couple days...\r\nHAPPY MIXING, AND HAPPY VAPING!!!","steep_days":"2 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:51:22.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"1248","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Blood Orange","vendor":"FW","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Papaya","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Pink Guava","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Sweet Guava","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":5000},{"name":"Sweet Tangerine","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Super Sweet","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":750}],"reviews":[{"user":"Xist","text":"Very nice.  Been getting sick of bakeries and craving some fruit lately... I really like this right off the shake, it is quite balanced, but still a bit funky which I love.  I think I may add some Aurora or a bit of Lime Tahity on the next mix to give it that tangy zest I desire.  Well done Soulchkn!"}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"182917","name":"Notorious P.O.G."}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
