The caramel is created by using both caramel and butterscotch, a delicious combination. To create a bit of sweeter wood smoke type flavor to this combination I use Smoked Butterscotch. Add some Cream to this, and it creates a beautiful smooth texture to this mix. The vanilla I use is Vanilla Bean. This is going to give the perfect vanilla to go with the woodsy tobaccos and caramel layer. \r\nThis has steeped for 8 days, and is just delicious. \r\nEnjoy.\r\n**Ωhm Grown Alchemy** https://www.facebook.com/groups/ohmgrownalchemy/\r\n**Mixing in the Kitchen** https://www.facebook.com/groups/425650464915364/\r\n\r\nYouTube\r\nMixing in the Kitchen:\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCpzG9vsIgaCUzHVrUMHiV_g\r\nΩhm Grown Alchemy:\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCDi_UubimriLWjel5Hr0pIA\r\nFB Flv Fan https://www.facebook.com/FLVFan/","steep_days":"10","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"total_reviews":1,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:51:05.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"2005","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Butterscotch","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":600},{"name":"Caramel","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":600},{"name":"Cream","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":800},{"name":"Red Burley","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":400},{"name":"Smoked Butterscotch","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":400},{"name":"Vanilla Bean","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":200},{"name":"Virginia Tobacco","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":800}],"reviews":[{"user":"Deftohms","score":"5","text":"Off the shake I already taste everything as described, this recipe is absolutely delicious and I can’t wait to see how it is in a week.
