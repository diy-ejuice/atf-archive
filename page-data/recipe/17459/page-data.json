I can't taste strawberry very well, so if someone could mix this up and let me know, I would appreciate it. It's a strawberry apple streusel, or at least as close as I can get. I can't taste strawberry's but I have had people test this on my behalf and got it as close as I could. I'm like Beethoven creating music while deaf. Only I'm not talented. Or obsessed with poop.\r\n\r\n\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nYou are free to\r\nShare — copy and redistribute the material in any medium or format\r\nAdapt — remix, transform, and build upon the material\r\n\r\n(The licensor cannot revoke these freedoms as long as you follow the license terms.)\r\n\r\nUnder the following terms:\r\n\r\nAttribution — You must give appropriate credit, provide a link to the license, and indicate if changes were made.
