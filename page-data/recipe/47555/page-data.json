Here is  adore's description \r\n\"Picture a bowl of fresh picked blueberries mixed with a base of fresh baked vanilla cookie crumble and drizzled with a rich vanilla pudding. Now that would be something.\" \r\n\r\nWell I thought it would be something so I made my rendition.\r\n\r\nBlueberries: flavor west blueberry  is what I chose go figure. I personally think flavor west blueberry tastes like when you mix blueberries and sugar and mash. Well I think it tastes like the syrupy blueberry flavored liquid left behind if that makes any sense to you.  \r\n\r\nVanilla cookie: I used a combination of Capella sugar cookie and inawera biscuit. With a little help from vanilla swirl by the flavor apprentice.\r\n\r\n\r\nRich vanilla pudding:  I used a combination of Flavorah vanilla pudding and Flavorah vanilla custard keeping the vanilla custard low so the custard and egg notes don't invade the pudding flavor.\r\n\r\nWell that's it my take on adore e liquids blueberry something.  Again this is Not a clone just a remix.\r\n\r\nSteep time: well this one is a strange one its a good tasting almost blueberry and cream at 5 days  but if you want the cookies to come out and play you will have to let it steep for 10 days or more. This is a good one to make a big bottle of so you can taste it at all the different steep times this is a flavor that gets better and better with a long steep I personally like it best at around 14 days but it is perfectly good at 5 days. I am putting a 10 day steep because that is when I feel you can taste the cookies but it gets better and better every day you can let it steep after day 10.\r\n\r\nSweeten to taste with your favorite sweetener. I personally like Flavorah sweetness in my recipes but feel free to use whatever you have on hand.","steep_days":"10","temperature":"420","recipe_score":0,"total_reviews":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T20:32:02.000-05:00","best_vg":"75%","views":"4112","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Blueberry","vendor":"FW","millipercent":4500},{"name":"Biscuit","vendor":"INW","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Sugar Cookie","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Vanilla Swirl","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Vanilla Pudding","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Vanilla Custard","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Sweetness","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":250}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"47555","name":"Blueberry Something \"REMIX\""}}}
