This is version 1 and I may still tweak it in the future but its damn tasty now and the 30ml I made will be gone soon. Hope you enjoy! \r\nCan be a shake n vape but it really comes together after about 5 days.\r\n(I added 1 drop Cap Super Sweet per 10ml)","steep_days":"5 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-11-28T20:16:08.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"889","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Glazed Strawberries","vendor":"VT","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Shisha Strawberry","vendor":"INW","millipercent":750},{"name":"Strawberry Sweet","vendor":"JF","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Chocolate Mousse","vendor":"VT","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Lava Cake","vendor":"LB","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Custard","vendor":"INW","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Cream Fresh","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"139070","name":"St. Valentine"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
