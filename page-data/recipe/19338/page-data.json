This is my best representation of Gingerbread Cookies. The combination of Cap Sugar Cookie, FW Graham Cracker, and TFA Butter create that cookie base with a hint of cinnamon. The Cap Gingerbread is a great flavoring that plays with the hint of cinnamon very well and is in here for obvious reasons. Cap Toasted Almond I feel brings authenticity to the flavor profile and TFA Sucralose sweetens the recipe as a whole. This vape would pair very well with many holiday beverages such as egg nog, boiled custard & spiced rum, or a cider. I really hope you all enjoy this recipe, if so comment and rate it. Thanks!!!!","steep_days":"6","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-06T20:38:55.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"1645","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Gingerbread","flavor_id":"58","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":3500},{"name":"Butter","flavor_id":"147","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":750},{"name":"Graham Cracker","flavor_id":"1297","vendor":"FW","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Sugar Cookie","flavor_id":"115","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Toasted Almond","flavor_id":"128","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1000},{"name":"sweetener (sucralose)","flavor_id":"2313","vendor":"OTHR","millipercent":1000}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"19338","name":"KRUCIAL ***Gingerbread Cookies*** "}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
