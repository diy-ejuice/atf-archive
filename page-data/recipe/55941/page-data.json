Pur cookie really is something special to behold and the dentman never ceases to amaze. This isn't the in-your-face experience you come to expect with a cereal. It's far more subtle and accurate while having a nice all-encompassing sweetness that makes it easy to all day vape. Job well-done buddy."},{"user":"lmhobbs","text":"Seems like a very well put together recipe but as a Shake and Vape I was disappointed- I think this is due to the low flavoring percentage. I'll give it a few weeks and give it another try! Thanks for sharing :-)"}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"55941","name":"Good Ol' Days"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
