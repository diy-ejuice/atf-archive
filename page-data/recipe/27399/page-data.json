I started with just the Harvest Berry at 3.5% and the CAP NY Cheesecake by itself at 4%. With just those two flavors it was satisfying to me as a new mixer and I relied on this staple mix for 6 months as I developed my skillset and collected new flavors. The 2 flavor version of this is still something I go back to when I am short on time on mixing day and I just want to get something bottled up.\r\n\r\nThe Cheesecake base: Equal parts CAP NY Cheesecake and TFA Cheesecake (Graham Crust) gives a perfect balance of cheesy filling and adds a starter base for the graham cracker crust crumble. CAP Sweet Cream finishes our cheesecake base with a little added \"cheesy\" cream depth to finish the profile. TFA Graham Cracker (Clear) adds some depth the crust base started with TFA Cheesecake (Graham Crust)\r\n\r\nThe Berries: CAP Harvest Berry is the real star here. A bright mix of blackberry, blueberry, raspberry and strawberry. I get mostly the blackberry and raspberry from it, but others perceive more strawberry. I found that with the bulked version of the cheesecake base that even at 3.5% Harvest Berry just wasn't showing through as much as I wanted, so it's bolstered by it's FA counterpart Forrest Mix. Another berry blend with a very similar profile it's a perfect fit. At 1.25% it's just enough to drive those berry notes to the top, but without getting muddy or perfumey, which is what I got if I started taking Harvest Berry up to the 4% or higher range. If you want a little more variety you can easily sub the Forrest Mix for FW Blueberry, your favorite Strawberry, FA Raspberry, or a splash of citrus like TFA Key Lime, INW Lime, INW/FE Lemon, or FA Lemon Sicily.","steep_days":"7","temperature":"0","recipe_score":4,"updated_at":"2020-12-12T18:29:02.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"5092","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Harvest Berry","flavor_id":"69","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":3500},{"name":"New York Cheesecake","flavor_id":"90","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Cheesecake (graham Crust)","flavor_id":"152","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Forrest Mix (forest Fruit Mix)","flavor_id":"453","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1250},{"name":"Graham Cracker Clear","flavor_id":"325","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Sweet Cream","flavor_id":"117","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1500}],"reviews":[{"user":"ancient7","text":"","score":3},{"user":"Ebc88","text":"Outstanding job kopel really enjoy the cheesecake note.
