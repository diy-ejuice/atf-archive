This juice has a very velvety and smooth mouth feel. It is SNVable but the lime really tames out and the whole juice emulsifies after 3 Days. This recipe was designed for my Breeze 2 and should work for all like devices. Feel free to leave out the icy elements if you are not a fan! I am interested in any reviews and opinions. \r\n\r\nP.S. this is my first public recipe and I would like feedback on my recipe and the write up","steep_days":"3 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":3,"updated_at":"2020-12-10T16:01:05.000-05:00","best_vg":"65%","views":"1763","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Raspberry (sweet)","flavor_id":"267","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Berryl (raspberry)","flavor_id":"412","vendor":"FA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Kiwi (double)","flavor_id":"242","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Kiwi","flavor_id":"522","vendor":"FA","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Lime Tahity Cold Pressed","flavor_id":"581","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Apple Fuji","flavor_id":"4886","vendor":"FA","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Green Apple","flavor_id":"232","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1500},{"name":"WS-23","flavor_id":"8085","vendor":"OTHR","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Aroma Arctic Winter (menthol Artic)","flavor_id":"514","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1500}],"reviews":[{"user":"YippYo","text":"Wow this is actually a great MTL recipe here! The fruits are all present and bright. They are a bit too artificial though. I would do without the Kiwi Double, I can really pick that out here  Plenty of sweetness. The coolant is WAY too much for me so I just put in 1% arctic. Enjoying out of my KF Lite 2019. Cheers &amp; thanks for sharing!","score":3}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"132711","name":"Ra-Ki-Lap (MTL/Pod)"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
