I hope you enjoy it in an endless loop.\r\n\r\nMB Cheesecake was selected to avoid unwanted coconut notes (Gamma-octalactone) as well as making use of the lemon notes to assist the weak but non-pledgy CAP Silverline Fruit Circles. WF Lemon Orange Rice Candy has some nice cereal notes. The WF Flapper pie plays a dual role by adding a little more biscuit base and meringue to enhance the fruity cereal notes.  The OOO Vanilla Custard Cheesecake and VT Creams sweeten and fill out the body.  The FW yogurt provides some diacetyl and aiding the cheesecake note. Optionally you can add a small amount of WF Strawberry Cheesecake if you want.\r\n\r\nI use an RDA single coil about 0.16-0.20 ohms and 50 Watts.\r\n\r\n**Feel free to check out my one shots available here https://www.diyflavorchaser.com/lukeloop**\r\n","steep_days":"7","temperature":"","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T17:36:19.000-05:00","best_vg":"75%","views":"1863","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Cheesecake","flavor_id":"1564","vendor":"MB","millipercent":5000},{"name":"Lemon Orange Rice Candy SC","flavor_id":"10103","vendor":"WF","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Fruit Circles","flavor_id":"8742","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":5000},{"name":"Flapper Pie SC","flavor_id":"10106","vendor":"WF","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Vanilla Custard Cheesecake","flavor_id":"6532","vendor":"OOO","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Sweet Cream","flavor_id":"8979","vendor":"VT","millipercent":800},{"name":"Vanilla Cream","flavor_id":"8992","vendor":"VT","millipercent":600},{"name":"Yogurt","flavor_id":"1471","vendor":"FW","millipercent":1000}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"190699","name":"Loopy Cake "}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
