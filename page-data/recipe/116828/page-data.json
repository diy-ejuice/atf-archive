Still, this turned out pretty good.  I may circle back around to this later and add maybe half a percent of cap peanut butter to add a little more peanut to the mix.  Not that I find your recipe lacking, rather, better recipes always make me want to play around and see what else can be done."}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"116828","name":"Buckeye Shake"}}}
