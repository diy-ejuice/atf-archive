Its Gold in here! There most be some mixers in the atmospher! \r\n\r\nHere's another mix with my favorite tobacco, Gold Ducat. At 2% you get a dry, honey esque, dark tobacco flavor. Any higher and it starts to take over the mix and gives notes of clove/plum/raisin, which I didn't want here. \r\n\r\nKentucky Bourbon/FLV Bourbon- The Kentucky isn't here for its alcoholic qualities, but more for its warmth. It sits in the background, where the FLV bourbon works with the top notes of Gold Ducat. It adds charred oak top notes and a nice sweetness to the overall vape. It's not overtly sweet, but it works in the here to moisten things up a little.\r\n\r\nFLV Red Burley- One of the most versatile tobacco's I know of. It's purpose in this mix is to add a tobacco base/accent. At 0.5% it's slightly leafy and woody. The \"stick\" note goes perfectly with FLV Bourbon to create something that is reminiscent of an oak barrel.\r\n\r\nThis is good as a S&V, but there will be some separation of flavors. By day 10 everything settles down and becomes one. \r\n\r\nI want to shout out @Fear, @ID10-T, @Kopel, and @Concrete River. I'm truly thankful for the reviews and notes these guys have given the community and wouldn't have had the knowledge to make this mix possible. âœŒ","steep_days":"10 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-10T14:52:16.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"1418","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Gold Ducat","flavor_id":"783","vendor":"INW","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Kentucky Bourbon","flavor_id":"361","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1750},{"name":"Bourbon","flavor_id":"4411","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":750},{"name":"Red Burley","flavor_id":"4355","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":500}],"reviews":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"64534","name":"Burr!
