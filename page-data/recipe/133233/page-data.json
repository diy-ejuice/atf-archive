Aperol Spritz is a very famous italian cocktail based on Aperol bitter, champagne and sparkling water. Of course the star of the show is the Aperol with it's orange and aromatic herbs in it. The champagne in this cocktail it's mainly the stage where Aperol will act.\r\n\r\n<h1>ORANGES</h1>\r\nIn order to create the right orange mix I tried really a lot of them in the market, but at the end, not a coincidence IMHO,  the italians oranges of FA( FA orange and FA tanger) where the most similar to the orange flavor of Aperol.\r\n\r\n<strong>BITTER</strong>\r\nI tried a lot of herbs too, but all they would distract the nose. So I started searching for bitter notes and of course I found the FA bitter wizard, but it has an off note in it, so I searched for other flavors with a bitter in it to pair with FA bitter wizard. At the end the best answer was FA bergamot in order to remain in citrus area and get a bitter note to pair to FA bitter wizard.\r\n\r\n<strong>SWEET</strong>\r\nBut the very fascinating and strange thing in Aperol Spritz is the combination of bitter and sweet. Of course I used a bit of CAP super sweet, but a bit of vanillin was really necessary here to give a sweet contrast to the recipe.\r\n\r\n<strong>CHAMPAGNE</strong>\r\nFor champagne I used TPA champagne both for calm down the cost of this recipe with something cheap and because this is not a bully wine flavor like others. \r\n\r\n<strong>SPARKLING</strong>\r\nAt the end I worried about how to give a sparkling esperience to this recipe. I watched a lot of Noted episode in youtube to find inspiration and at the end the answer came from @ID10T and his endorcement of  VT fizzy sherbet.\r\nNow guys I really ask you from the bottom of my heart  to review this recipe in order to give me a partial compensation for all this work on it.\r\nEnjoy!\r\n\r\n","steep_days":"0 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:50:38.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"1182","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Orange","flavor_id":"500","vendor":"FA","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Champagne Type (pg)","flavor_id":"347","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Bitter Wizard","flavor_id":"464","vendor":"FA","millipercent":250},{"name":"Vanillin 10% (pg)","flavor_id":"190","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Tanger (mandarin)","flavor_id":"547","vendor":"FA","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Super Sweet","flavor_id":"2384","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":500},{"name":"Bergamot","flavor_id":"469","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Fizzy Sherbet","flavor_id":"8878","vendor":"VT","millipercent":1000}],"reviews":[{"user":"Zazie","text":"First recipe I ever mixed.
