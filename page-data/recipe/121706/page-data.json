I was after a more sugary soda mix, where Fantastic had some authentic notes to it. Originally \"Fanta\" that started in europe had a bit of orange juice in it, however today's recipe contains no orange juice. Fun lil fact for you right there. \r\n\r\nThis is smack you in the face orange - kind of like a malaysian style mix. If you mix this up, please let me know how you feel about it. \r\n\r\nBlood Orange FW + Tanger FA + Shisa Orange INW - This is my orange base, and it creates a delicious sweet blood orange\r\nStrawberry TFA - I used this here to help blend the fruits together\r\nWS-23 - (20% Dilution) Cools everything down, gives you the sense that there is some fizzyness also \r\nJelly Candy - To help out with the body of the soda, and also sell a more candylike orange flavour\r\nCactus - Adds some wetness to the mix","steep_days":"1 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:50:28.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"5148","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Blood Orange","vendor":"FW","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Tanger (mandarin)","vendor":"FA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Cactus","vendor":"INW","millipercent":300},{"name":"Strawberry","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":300},{"name":"WS-23","vendor":"OTHR","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Super Sweet","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":400},{"name":"Jelly Candy","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":700},{"name":"Shisha Orange","vendor":"INW","millipercent":300}],"reviews":[{"user":"beeker","text":"I mixed both this and Fantastic in the same session, so I could compare the two. They're both delicious, but this one definitely gets the nod. It really nails the orange soda profile, and the differences between this and Fantastic are all noticeable improvements. My newest ADV, it's made me totally forget about the lemonades I used to love. Thanks for the amazing recipe!"},{"user":"iDad","text":"I am a big fan of Fantastic, so this is pretty much right in my wheelhouse (as the mixer would say). Compared to the South African version of Fanta, definitely very close to the real thing. I had a bottle of ice cold Fanta next to me when I tested this, and very close to spot on. Funta has a bit more citrus flavor than Fanta, but that is not a problem at all - maybe more of a problem to the Coca Cola company - they should take notes here. Great juice mate - well done üëç "},{"user":"LaJuanaPipa","text":"Sounds and reads fantastic I will give it a try"}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"121706","name":"Funta (Orange Soda)"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
