I used FW Butterscotch Ripple to support it and make the body a little bit round and caramel-y.\r\n\r\nThe slice: FLV Pink Guava is a pretty straightforward guava / grapefruit, and it will fight the brulee-caramel body in your very mouth. Which is good, because this is what I aimed for. A drop of TPA Orange Cream to make it even more sour and flashy.\r\n\r\nThe accents: Vanilla Custard v1 makes the whole bouquet a little more buttery and creamy, without extending it into even more caramel-y zone. And TPA Peach (Juicy) helps with a tricky aftertaste: I've found that this pairing (flv pink guava + inawera creme brulee) gives some almost-peachy aftertaste, so I used some TPA Peach (Juicy) to make that ghost a real thing. Because it was annoying to almost taste peach but not taste it at the same time.\r\n","steep_days":"14","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"total_reviews":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T12:45:44.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"974","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Butterscotch Ripple","vendor":"FW","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Creme Brulee (yc)","vendor":"INW","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Orange Cream","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Peach (juicy)","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Pink Guava","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":2750},{"name":"Vanilla Custard","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":500}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"35936","name":"Brullissimo"}}}
