I don't necessarily get a cookie vibe through the whole vape. On the inhale it seems to come off more like a lemon limejuice kind of flavor and texture. But then at the last little bit of the inhale and as I exhale, I get a light shortbread kind of white cookie flavor. Overall it's quite an interesting experience in a good way. I personally would like more bakery/grainy notes, but that's just me. If i had to guess, the TFA sweetener might be kind of watering down the flavor possibly. im going to mix it agian and try a different sweetener. Solid 4 star imo. Would mix again.
