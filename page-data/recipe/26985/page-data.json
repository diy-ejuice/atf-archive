As written, it is extremely creamy, but for my taste, lacked the spiciness from the cap rootbeer. I lowered the CAP Rootbeer to 4.5% and added TFA Rootbeer at 2.5% and this satisfied MY taste buds. This is definitely a well put together recipe, with a small tweek for me. Give it a try!"}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"26985","name":"A&W rootbeer float"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
