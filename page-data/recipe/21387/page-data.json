The TFA Banana Cream, and Banana Nut Bread create a great base for this profile. The JF Bavarian Cream is in there first of all because it has to be for competition requirements and to create that soft moist center. The FA Liquid Amber helps add a yeasty fermented flavor helping on the barkery side and the FA Vanilla Bourbon with the alcohol notes. The vanilla from the FA Vanilla Bourbon and FA SOHO work very well together to add  a nutty, caramel, almost brown sugar vanilla aspect to the bakery notes and the SOHO seems to work well in sweetening recipe as well. Mix at (((70/30 with a 6 day steep)))Thanks guys I hope you all enjoy it.","steep_days":"6","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-05T09:50:42.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"2548","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Banana Cream","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Bavarian Cream","vendor":"JF","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Soho","vendor":"FA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Bourbon (vanilla Bourbon)","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1750},{"name":"Liquid Amber","vendor":"FA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Banana Nut Bread","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":4000}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"21387","name":"》RIP HARAMBE《"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
