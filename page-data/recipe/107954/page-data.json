I made this because mlnikon made a strawberry watermelon lemonade a few days back but i didnt have a few of the ingredients so i decided to make something similarly profiled. Now the strawberry in strawberry lemonade is more of a lemonade than it is a strawberry and rather than build on the strawberry i decided to leave it as is. I really like the lemonade base of flv lemonade at 3% and strawberry lemonade at 2% it works  most everywhere and with almost any fruit added.  I enjoy this directly after mixing with or without sweetener your choice?\r\n\r\nThis is am extremely delicious recipe. So if this sounds even remotely good to you give it a whirl. You won't be disappointed!!","steep_days":"1 (SNV)","temperature":"420","recipe_score":5,"updated_at":"2020-12-12T18:29:55.000-05:00","best_vg":"75%","views":"2965","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Wild Melon","flavor_id":"619","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Lemonade","flavor_id":"636","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Strawberry Lemonade â€“ Super Concentrate","flavor_id":"7993","vendor":"RF","millipercent":2000}],"reviews":[{"user":"NonStopMix","text":"Gave this a mix and was very happy I did. It's simple yet so good. It's not strawberry forward which was the intent of the creator. You don't need any added sweetener. I did try adding some WS-23 @ 0.25% after I went thru my 1st batch and it works great in this recipe. Great work on this lemonade!","score":5},{"user":"KRUCIAL","text":"This is a great combo of flavors and awesome in its simplicity. It has a slight throat hit off the but settles out after an overnight steep. I venture to think this would be a Great candidate for .50% of WS23. Great job homie!!!","score":5}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"107954","name":"Straw melon lemonade"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
