This one is interesting. I've had someone say it tastes like some sort of Japanese candy that I've never heard of. Someone has said it tastes like Skittles. I don't know about that. All I know is that it is tasty. I wasn't going for candy at all. I wanted, first and foremost, a peachy recipe. What I ended up with is fruity bliss.\r\n\r\n\r\nFirst off, the stars of the show are INW Peach and TFA Juicy Peach. TFA at 3 for the in-your-face peachy goodness we all know. INW Peach at 0.5% to add a more artificial peach (this is what contributed to the candyness, as it tastes a lot like peach rings by itself). Put together, they do make an awesome combo. \r\n\r\nNext up, FW Orange and FW Blood Orange at 1 and 3% (respectively) add to the punchiness. I typically associate a good fruit punch with a decent amount of citrus, with more exotic notes in the background, and the oranges along with FA Lemon Sicily add the right amount of citrus to the mix. The big issue here, though, is that this shit is going to hit the back of the throat like a Mack Truck if we don't do something else.\r\n\r\nThe big winner here, in my opinion, is TFA Cantaloupe. Not only does it sweeten the entire mix, but it also adds an excellent exotic note, AND gets rid of the harshness of the juice nearly entirely. At 5%, TFA Cantaloupe might not be the main note, but I believe it is the star of the show. Without it, I don't think the recipe would be nearly what it is. It was an oddball thing that I just decided to throw in while testing the recipe out, and it worked very well.\r\n\r\n\r\nI shake and vape this, but if you let it steep a few days everything comes together a little more.","steep_days":"3 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-11-30T04:42:13.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"1013","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Blood Orange","vendor":"FW","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Cantaloupe","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":5000},{"name":"Lemon Sicily","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Orange","vendor":"FW","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Peach","vendor":"INW","millipercent":500},{"name":"Peach (juicy)","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":3000}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"34359","name":"Falcon Puuuunch!"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
