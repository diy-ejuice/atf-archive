I've made a lot of coconutty recipes and I think has to be one of my favourites. Bourbon and coconut is such a delicious combination. I'd put bourbon and/or coconut in everything if I could! \r\n\r\nCustard: with this being an all FLV mix the obvious choice was Vanilla Pudding. Cream adds creaminess and mouthfeel. A little Coconut adds a ton of richness. White Chocolate works really well in this mix. It seems to be acting as a kind of bridge between the coconut and custard. I tried consolidating the number of flavours in the custard layer, but it just wasn't as good. \r\n\r\nFLV Bourbon has a nice touch of booziness and darkens the whole mix. It works really nicely with Sweet Coconut. \r\n\r\nBest after 14 days. \r\n\r\nTested on Hadaly, 0.6 ohms","steep_days":"14","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"total_reviews":1,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:51:47.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"435","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Vanilla Pudding","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":2000},{"name":"White Chocolate","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Sweet Coconut","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1750},{"name":"Coconut","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":200},{"name":"Bourbon","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":600},{"name":"Cream","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":500}],"reviews":[{"user":"fadedjay1","score":"5","text":"Awesome recipe, had to sub coconut and the white chocolate for fa candy coconut and hs Australian chocolate.
