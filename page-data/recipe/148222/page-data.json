I think it still need some work and it will be great if you guys let me know your thougts about it.\r\n\r\nThis is my first original recipe so I hope you guys enjoy it the way I did creating it.\r\n\r\nCan work as a shake and vape but you will notice the bakery notes after 3 to 5 days.","steep_days":"3","temperature":"0","recipe_score":3,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T23:37:34.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"1737","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Cake (yellow)","flavor_id":"1222","vendor":"FW","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Raspberry (sweet)","flavor_id":"267","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Strawberry (ripe)","flavor_id":"271","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Sweet Strawberry","flavor_id":"121","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Vanilla Custard","flavor_id":"131","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Vienna Cream","flavor_id":"516","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Super Sweet","flavor_id":"2384","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":500}],"reviews":[{"user":"Hetch","text":"AS a new mixer myself I have to say this looks great.
