In order to really stand out in this initial mix round, I went after the most difficult fruit I could think to create and still be complete with only three ingredients. Originally I was thinking of a perfect mango and I know how to get it but really to do it right it takes 4 ingredients. Then Cherry came to mind. I feel it gets a bad rap because there are so many trash cherries out there. Sippin on some syrupppp. Fruit. It needed to be something difficult. I worked through a mango, but eventually set on an Inawera only mix. Then from there I wanted to showcase the INW Cherries as a star that it is. A real delicious cherry flavor with other spiced notes and a sweetness that helped due to the 3 flavor limit. The back notes of Raspberry and Two Apples are showcase amazing Inawera flavorings. The percentage had to be super low to work with these damn strong flavors. Most recommended pure INW mixes at 5 but I feel the cherries can hang higher than previously attempted USA public recipes. Why these 3? They are by far some of the most intriguing flavors I have encountered and they are so easy to mess up. Harshness and perfume are both fears of over-mixing these ingredients and I feel I have danced the limit of these while keeping the total flavouring on these sound. This mix is good day one, AMAZING day 3. \r\n\r\nSo in the end here were my personal limitations for this mix: \r\n1. Inawera Only \r\n2. No Sweeteners or EM etc. \r\n3. No Easy Fruits \r\n4. Cherry - A very hard flavor to mix well\r\n5. Hitting a real ideal inw total mix that is neither harsh or too perfumey\r\n\r\nFlavor Selection\r\n\r\nINW Cherries: This is my star. For multiple reasons I selected this cherry. It is sweet. It still holds a real cherry note, it just doesnt work in the same zone as other cherry flavors. It ranks only second to my favorite cherry, Cherries in Liquor which is the most amazing add in for any fruits. So its just an awesome cherry hands down. 3.25% is awesome gives enough sweet to finish while keeping a nice sharp cherry note as the lead. \r\n\r\nINW Raspberry: The real king of Raspberries of our 5 brand options. This is by far the most complex, floral, and intriguring raspberry. It is a killer good and killer strong flavor. Where most won't go out of the 1% limit, in some instances it actually can blend in better above that. I kept it under control and somehow these three just work together in such a great way perfume issues never appeared which helped things. \r\n\r\nINW Two Apples: Why this vs. Fuji? It is a more motts apple flavor to me, and hangs in there with a different fruit note that stands out among the strong raspberry and cherry notes. This is kept lowest just because it is harsh above 2% and really just is enough at lower to give it a better note. If Fuji flavor and Two Apples flavor were compared id prefer an apple that tastes like two apples so I went with that over say the Anton Apple which was also an option. Still feel Two Apples was best choice for finishing the mix. \r\n\r\nFinal Thoughts: Thanks for taking the time to mix this. I hope that you enjoy the flavors of it. 60mls into it myself and enjoying it personally as an adv. \r\n\r\n\r\n","steep_days":"3 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":4,"updated_at":"2020-12-12T18:29:01.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"8258","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Raspberry","flavor_id":"667","vendor":"INW","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Cherries","flavor_id":"757","vendor":"INW","millipercent":3250},{"name":"Two Apples","flavor_id":"671","vendor":"INW","millipercent":1000}],"reviews":[{"user":"Katumbas","text":"I don't usually vape candy profiles since is not my thing but I definetly enjoyed this one!

Just 3 ingredients! Kudos. As soon as I saw the Two Apples/Raspberry combo I knew this was going to be a keeper. The Cherries sits on top and gets a slight candy darkness from the raspberry. The candy aspect of two apples lays a solid base and adds sweetness. This is one of those perfect combos highlighting awesome flavorings. I've been using this is a Kayfun Mini v3, and the cherry is bold on the inhale, while the raspberry comes in to sweeten the exhale. Competition over in my opinion. This mix may be the closest reminder of FLV Bing Cherry, and will no doubt be copied. Much respect.
