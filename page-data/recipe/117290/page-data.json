Exploring an apple base, my favorite is clearly Fuji and LA at 2:1 ratio. When other flavors are layered, I find that tweaking needs to happen to boost the apple and how the flavors play so I decided to play with some different bases to keep it simple. One experiment came to be a nice subtle balance for me with the addition of Bourbon. I never did try it with any others and you may find that they work better, differently and more to your liking. Here's a nice, simple, light vape that allows room for growth and play. Enjoy! (Fuji needs 3 days min to meld with the LA and settle IMO. I had this from then to after a two month steep and enjoyed it as it mellowed. YMMV)","steep_days":"5","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"total_reviews":1,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:50:26.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"1496","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Fuji","vendor":"FA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Liquid Amber","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Kentucky Bourbon","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":3000}],"reviews":[{"user":"UnappreciatedRobot","score":"5","text":"I really enjoyed this 1-2-3 recipe. The combo of FA Fuji and FA Liquid Amber is really nice and I am definitely going to be trying it with other recipes.
