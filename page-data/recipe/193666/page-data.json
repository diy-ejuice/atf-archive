Just something that'll finally give me an excuse to start killing the hell outta this that's yummy.\"\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, I don't own TPA Mocha yet so my only option was the latter while keeping in mind that one could add Mocha later on to end up with something similar to a tiramisu. Or vape it on it's own.\r\n\r\nUpdate: After Kitus' review I decided to add the agreed upon 1% tpa mocha.
