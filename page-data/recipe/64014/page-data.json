I had tried other tobaccos that I thought would work well for this profile, but none of them hit the flavor I was looking for. Ozone is a slightly floral tobacco and it helps to carry the Cherry Blossom and Cherries.\r\n\r\nCherries/Cherry Blossom - Cherries is by far the best cherry flavoring out there, this was the most difficult portion of the profile. I wanted it to be prominent, but not overpowering and 2% works here. The Cherry Blossom adds a nice sweetness and blends perfectly with the Ozone.\r\n\r\nRed Oak/Holy - Red oak adds a bit of earthiness and Holy Vanilla works as an emulsifier.\r\n\r\nThis can absolutely be a shake and vape, but also doesn't hurt to have a few days steep. The floral isn't a super prominent note in this but it works great.
