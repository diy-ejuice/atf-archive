I decided that over INW Biscuit, as I find INW Biscuit to be just a tad too dry for what I wanted to achieve here.\r\nTo add a little pow-wow to the biscuit, I paired it up against a slight touch of AP, which helps the biscuit to feel a little bit more crunchy.\r\n\r\nFor the nuts, I went for my go-to FA Hazel Grove as I really enjoy the nuttiness it brings to the table and the slight taste of praline really works well in a nutty bakery type. I added in some WF Butter Pecan Pie to do a little dance with the hazelnut and it brings a warming creamy element to the mix along with some buttery and creamy notes, that goes really well with the biscuit.\r\n\r\nLastly, a finishing dash of FLV Cream and FA Carmel to add a further round touch, some rich mouthfeel and to help the warming touch.\r\n\r\nLet it steep for a minimum of 2 weeks to get this recipe to reach its full potential.\r\n\r\nEnjoy!","steep_days":"14","temperature":"0","recipe_score":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-10T13:46:15.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"853","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Hazel Grove (hazelnut)","flavor_id":"417","vendor":"FA","millipercent":750},{"name":"Acetyl Pyrazine 5%","flavor_id":"1709","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Butter Pecan Pie","flavor_id":"6044","vendor":"WF","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Carmel (caramel)","flavor_id":"503","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Cream","flavor_id":"604","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Biscuit","flavor_id":"4487","vendor":"JF","millipercent":1750}],"reviews":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"164282","name":"Nut Again"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
