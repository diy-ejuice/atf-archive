I used flavor west blueberry because I  think it is the best blueberry flavor I used it at 6% so you can actually taste the blueberries almost like you poured blueberries   over a fresh zeppy with powdered sugar. Then I made the powdered sugar. I did this with 1% meringue  and .3 torrone  both by flavor art this combination  makes a perfect powdered sugar. Then last but not leist the zeppy of the flavor profile I use flavor art zepolla for this at 5% it seems to work in this recipe at that percentage. Don't get me wrong  i know that zepolla by flavor art wasn't even available when the zeppy  line came out so there is no way it tastes the same as the original but it does taste like the profile at hand. It tastes good almost immediately but is at its best after 4 days. It is a simple recipe that really works.","steep_days":"4 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-11T14:15:48.000-05:00","best_vg":"75%","views":"1788","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Blueberry","flavor_id":"1201","vendor":"FW","millipercent":6000},{"name":"Zeppola","flavor_id":"6312","vendor":"FA","millipercent":5000},{"name":"Meringue","flavor_id":"530","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Torrone","flavor_id":"550","vendor":"FA","millipercent":300}],"reviews":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"26928","name":"Blue zepolla"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
