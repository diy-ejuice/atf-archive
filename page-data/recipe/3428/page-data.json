Good flavors from this recipe but having the LA Banana Cream so high definitely gives a lot of throat tickle on the inhale. If you don't have this issue it will be delicious, but if you are like me it's almost unvapable. 4 stars for flavor, would be 5 stars if not for the throat hit."},{"user":"rockwise","text":"Fantastic! Thanks for shareing"},{"user":"diesel223","text":"I'm only a month into vaping and even less in the DIY scene so my review won't sound quite so poetic as some of the masters among us lol. That being said I'm a healthy sized country boy and I know what good banana pudding is. This is it. I saw this recipe last week and ordered the ingredients i needed and just finished up a 30 ml batch of this. Excellent banana flavor that i really pick up as the top note on my inhale, followed by a nice finish of vanilla wafer. Nice thick mouth feel that really drives home the pudding aspect of the profile. And I am left with a soft cookie and mild banana aftertaste. No off notes on SNV and I imagine it to only get more defined and delicious as time passes. Thank you so much for this recipe and allowing me to make 30 ml for 91 cents instead of paying 15 bucks at the local shop. Must try recipe for all banana lovers!!!"},{"user":"corvape","text":"Excellent simple, Well balanced recipe! Thanks for sharing. Its delicious"},{"user":"lolwtf","text":"This recipe is spot-on and doesn't really require a steep!  That's right up my alley.  All things considered, including accuracy and simplicity, defintely five-stars.  But I do want to mention that I have noticed a stronger throat hit with this recipe than with others I'm currently vaping, using the same PG/VG at 30/70 and Nude Nic in PG for all of the juices.  It is something I got used to after a few hits, but felt like I should mention it.

It almost tastes like fresh sliced bananas have been turned into a pudding and then layered over vanilla wafers. It's absolutely incredible and it's my new ADV. Thank you!"},{"user":"Fiftytrent","text":"After a heaping plate of General Tso's and lo mein, everyone needs some dessert from their favorite shady Chinese restaurant.  The one in my town happened to always have a tray of banana pudding with vanilla wafers.  This is that minus the day of regret that comes from consuming the rest of the food.
