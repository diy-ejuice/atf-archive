On a secluded stretch of road, there is a beautiful little diner that pays homage to the old trucker stops where weary travelers can get a nice home-cooked meal. This diner is called Loveless Cafe, and it is one of the greatest places on Earth. With homemade biscuits made fresh every day, delicious coffee, and some of the greatest breakfast I've ever had, this diner is the greatest example of southern hospitality I've found during my trips to Tennessee. While I am not a fan of dairy milk, Loveless creates a variety of different flavoured milks that are all absolutely delicious. Obviously as mixers, we constantly see those strawberry milk, banana milk, and blueberry milk recipes almost every other day on ATF. However, Loveless stands out with something a little different, an orange milk. Of course, orange cream recipes are nothing new, but they tend to focus more on the orange note, or creating something like an Orange Dream ice cream bar. This recipe is a straight up dairy milk with orange accents, and it's one of my favourite recipes I've come up with, and the product of a few weeks of meddling.\r\n\r\nTPA Orange Cream / FA Blood Orange / CAP Juicy Orange - TPA Orange Cream is a great concentrate, but one that is easy to fuck up. With too little, we won't taste much of anything, and with too much, we're stuck with some really bitter and unpleasant off notes of orange rind and soured milk. At 2.5%, we are getting close to this concentrate's ceiling, but it works beautifully. Here we get a nice base to build the orange milk off of. Slightly sweet orange flavour, heavy cream notes, and just a touch of sugar. Using FA Blood Orange at 1.25%, we get a nice punch in the mouth of tart oranges. This helps push the fruit notes through the remaining cream concentrates, and leaves us with something that hits those orange notes on the inhale, but fades away to give room for the sweet creams on the exhale. Finally, CAP Juicy Orange is one of my favourites, for it tastes EXACTLY like orange juice. It's a tough flavour on it's own, for it has a slight waxiness on the mouthfeel. But with all of the other oranges in here, it just gives us a little extra wetness to the fruit notes.\r\n\r\nFLV Cream / FA Vienna Cream / FW Hazelnut - these three concentrates bind together to help us get a pretty accurate dairy milk base. The FLV Cream is one of the best cream concentrates on the market. Neutral, inoffensive, and full of mouthfeel. We get subtle notes of dairy maltiness in FLV Cream, but we're mainly using it here to create a nice, thick, unsweetened milk. The use of FA Vienna Cream brings some added sweetness to the mix, while suggesting the malt note we need to say this is a dairy milk recipe. Finally, the use of FW Hazelnut is in here to push that accurate nuttiness into the milk profile. Take a sip of plain dairy milk, and then take a whiff of FW Hazelnut, and try to tell me you don't need this concentrate in a milk recipe. I love this combination of flavours, and I think it creates something absolutely perfect for any recipe calling for dairy milk.\r\n\r\nCAP Vanilla Bean Ice Cream - while this isn't an ice cream recipe, I don't find CAP VBIC to be an ice cream concentrate. For this recipe, the inherent vanilla notes found in this concentrate play better than using something like INW Shisha Vanilla, or really anything that is specifically JUST vanilla. With those concentrates, we get too much vanilla infused into the recipe, and it begins to take over the subtle orange notes. Instead, using CAP VBIC adds some more mouthfeel to the mix, while giving us just a touch of vanilla extract that complement the oranges so well.\r\n\r\nTPA Honeysuckle - this was a bit of a stretch, for the original orange milk from Loveless does not have any floral notes or anything like that. But, TPA Honeysuckle is something special, and while I can't entirely pinpoint WHAT the flavour itself is, I notice how it helps keep the creams separated from the oranges, and it helps us achieve that goal to have a citrus fruit inhale, and a heavy sweet milk exhale. Honeysuckle seems to help this separation remain even after a steep.\r\n\r\nSteep Time - delicious as a shake and vape, you know me, that's how I like my recipes. After about 4 days, everything gets to the best it'll be. The oranges meld together to create a bright, juicy, and slightly rind-y orange profile. The creams reach their peak and have a bold flavour, rich vanilla note, and delicious sugary sweetness. Overall, 4 days is where this recipe hits it's stride, but again, you can get in on it straight away.\r\n\r\nIf you've been to Loveless Cafe, you know why this place feels like Heaven, and I truly hope I've done justice to it's delicious orange milk.\r\n\r\nCheers.","steep_days":"4 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":4.7,"total_reviews":7,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:49:22.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"7277","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Orange Cream","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Blood Orange","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1250},{"name":"Juicy Orange","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":750},{"name":"Cream","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Vienna Cream","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Hazelnut","vendor":"FW","millipercent":750},{"name":"Vanilla Bean Ice Cream","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Honeysuckle (pg)","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2000}],"reviews":[{"user":"goosegirl","score":"4","text":"Tasting this during allergy season, so I am not really picking up all the flavors, but I appreciate a dairy mix that is light and refreshing for the warmer months.  Will make this one again."},{"user":"Asire","score":"4","text":"Wow to combine intakte and diary was really not something I would have thought of. Very well executed though. To me the honeysuckle acts like a bridge between the orange and the milky part. The orange sits a bit underneath it all but I think that’s what makes this delicious combinaton possible so well. I hoped the orange would be slightly more prominent though I don’t know if that’s possible without it getting weird. Still very smooth to vape recipe and very delicious . Tried after 4 days let’s see how this one steeps out"},{"user":"Marnu","score":"5","text":"An orange and dairy is tough if you need the milk to not get gross. This nails perfectly. &#xD;\nI don't get much of the honeysuckle from it and might turn it up in a future run. &#xD;\nI actually enjoyed it more at day 7 than after 3. &#xD;\nWe'll done, and thank you for sharing "},{"user":"cdaniell30","score":"5","text":"This hasn't gotten the attention that it deserves.
