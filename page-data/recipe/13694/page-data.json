This mix is delicious as a shake-and-vape, and  light and refreshing as far as cakes go after a steep.\r\n\r\nThe base of this recipe is obviously the Yellow Cake.  Say what you want about the sugar in it, it is still the best out there imo.  Marzipan adds a sugary sweetness to it without adding too much of a pronounced nut (candied almond) flavor we usually use it for.  It's enough here to change that cake flavor ever so slightly.  Vanilla Classic is here to bring out that vanilla flavor from the cake even more.  Fresh Cream smooths it all out and helps nicely to take the edge off of Juicy Peach and to make sure the tartness of Cranberry does not overtake everything. \r\n\r\nCranberry is low here, but pronounced without getting too much of the tartness as a shake and vape.  It's noticeable, but fades some with a steep; obviously because of its low percentage.  \r\n\r\nTogether, this is a light cake mix that I enjoy more as a shake and vape.  I still use it after steeping, but just my preference.  My mixing has advanced a ton since I made this recipe, but it still remains one of my favorites and I wanted to share it.  I will likely do a spin on this recipe as a V2 someday.\r\n\r\nKeep in mind that this mix was designed for a dripper outputting 5.8 volts and high VG.  Dual 2mm micros at around .9 ohms.  Try it as a shake and vape first, then give it a go with a steep.  After trying it as is, adjust the cranberry to 1% if you like the flavor.  I personally like it as posted.\r\n\r\nHappy mixing\r\n\r\nCuda","steep_days":"0","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"total_reviews":1,"updated_at":"2020-11-30T20:57:10.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"1164","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Peach (juicy)","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Marzipan","vendor":"FA","millipercent":250},{"name":"Cream Fresh","vendor":"FA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Madagascar (Vanilla Classic)","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Cake (yellow)","vendor":"FW","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Cranberry","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":500}],"reviews":[{"user":"Mr-G","score":"none","text":"its ok"}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"13694","name":"Peach Cranberry Cake"}}}
