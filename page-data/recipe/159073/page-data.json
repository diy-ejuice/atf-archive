This was tested on a Hadeon @.18 ohms 50 watts, and I have been vaping this on my topside with a recurve single coil @.25 ohms 50 watts.  \r\nEnjoy.\r\nFB FlvFan Page https://www.facebook.com/FLVFan/\r\nΩhm Grown Alchemy https://www.facebook.com/groups/ohmgrownalchemy/\r\nMixing in the Kitchen https://www.facebook.com/groups/425650464915364/\r\n\r\nYouTube\r\nMixing in the Kitchen:\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCpzG9vsIgaCUzHVrUMHiV_g\r\nΩhm Grown Alchemy:\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCDi_UubimriLWjel5Hr0pIA\r\n","steep_days":"5","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"total_reviews":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-06T22:03:33.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"2532","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Alpine Strawberry","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":200},{"name":"Bourbon","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":400},{"name":"Boysenberry","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":200},{"name":"Cream","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":800},{"name":"Jammy Berry","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":400},{"name":"Pound Cake","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Frosting","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":600},{"name":"Cupcake batter","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":400}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"159073","name":"Bourberry  Pound Cake"}}}
