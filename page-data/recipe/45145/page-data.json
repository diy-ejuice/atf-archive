If you like your sour a little sweeter like me, add .3% of Cap Supersweet. \r\n(You can substitute with osdiy blue Rasberry slush as well. Also you could use Sour wizard at 1% in place of sour candy. I just prefer this version more.)","steep_days":"3","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T17:34:03.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"1497","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"AR Blue Raspberry (PG)","vendor":"DFS","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Sour Candy","vendor":"DFS","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Apple (green)","vendor":"FW","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Strawberry (ripe)","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Raspberry (sweet)","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Cherries","vendor":"INW","millipercent":500},{"name":"Blackberry","vendor":"FW","millipercent":500}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"45145","name":"Pucker Up"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
