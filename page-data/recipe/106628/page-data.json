Yes that's intended to mean an \"all year vape.\"\r\nI love custards, and so I started with some key aromas, added one variable at a time, and came up with this.\r\n\r\nCap Vanilla Custard - No intro needed\r\n\r\nDIYFS - Holy Vanilla - If you haven't tried it, do not pass go, do not collect $200... JUST BUY IT.\r\n\r\nRY4 Double & Caramel Candy - Add a sweet, thick note.\r\n\r\nTFA Vanilla Cupcake - The variable that I ended with, I kept coming back to this one. I tried other vanillas, Cap Vanilla Cupcake, and a few others. This one just makes the recipe what it is. \r\n\r\nMix it. Steep it (at least 3 days). Comment/Review.\r\n\r\nThank you.","steep_days":"3","temperature":"0","recipe_score":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-11T14:04:01.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"2042","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Vanilla Custard","flavor_id":"131","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":3500},{"name":"Caramel Candy","flavor_id":"1233","vendor":"FW","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Ry4 Double","flavor_id":"379","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Super Sweet","flavor_id":"2384","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":600},{"name":"Vanilla Cupcake","flavor_id":"187","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Holy Vanilla","flavor_id":"2385","vendor":"DFS","millipercent":750}],"reviews":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"106628","name":"Va(Nilla Cupcake Custard)"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
