(edit: I bought this down by half....)\r\nTPA  VBIC - This does two jobs here, it adds the vanilla to the fritters, but also starts off the ice cream with the thickness and creaminess one craves.\r\nFA Meringue - Taking a cue from Wayne Walkers (ENYAWREKLAW) Cuprian here. The Meringue adds a thickness to the ice cream, and adds buttery notes to the fritters.\r\nTPA Marshmellow - Thanks again Wayne! Gives the recipe a nice Ice Cream mouth feel, at 1% allows the Funnel Cake to do it's thing.\r\nCAP Bavarian Cream - Mixed at 1% gives the ice cream a nice creamy boost.\r\n\r\nPretty great as a shake n' Vape, but even better after 7 days steep.\r\n  ","steep_days":"7 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-12T00:40:12.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"1845","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Banò (banana)","flavor_id":"501","vendor":"FA","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Funnel Cake","flavor_id":"4166","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Vanilla Bean Ice Cream","flavor_id":"186","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Meringue","flavor_id":"530","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Marshmallow","flavor_id":"332","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Bavarian Cream","flavor_id":"2","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1000}],"reviews":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"22292","name":" Bunyols de Plàtan (updated)"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
