Was actually found by mistake when the missus said she liked the smell of FA Almond. Sweet, slight nutty coconut. Originally made at all one percent flavourings with no sweetener on stapleton coils in a Govad RDA. Kinda needed the extra flavourings on my claptons in my OBS Engine, so really up to personal preference. Cheap and easy. Id give it a solid 6/10.
