The strawberry doesn't fade off and it has that thick malty taste you get in a milkshake (not a S&amp;C) only thing that I think needs to be done is lower the Dulce de Leche just a tad bit as it's really overpowering at first and even after a month or so steep it's still a prominent flavor in the mix. It's needed to get the malty aspect but imo it's a touch too high for my taste otherwise I'd give it a 5... Nice job tho indeed! üëçüëç"}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"17946","name":"Strawberry Milkshake "}}}
