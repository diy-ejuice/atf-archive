Chocolate flavors have always been a difficulty for me, and this nails 90% of what I have been looking for. I am going to play around with adding some Double Chocolate (Clear) in my next batch to see if I can get a slightly richer chocolate tone. Thanks!"},{"user":"Thanrak","score":"5","text":"Every so often I get a craving for chocolate milk and I'll buy a pint while grocery shopping.  I know I shouldn't because of all the fat and sugars, but I buy it anyway.  This is that chocolate milk.  It comes out just like store bought.  I'm on my second batch of it now"},{"user":"WhatTheFront","score":"5","text":"My first chocolate recipe and i cant stop mixing it up! It's cost effective and tasty.
