I've tried lots of flavors.  I still have lots of flavors I haven't tried.  Yogi is one of my favorite liquids of all time.  All that being said this isn't a clone.  I use flavors I think are in Yogi as a starting point, but I wanted to make a granola with a more of a nuttiness quality.    Let's start.\r\n\r\nThe oat note fell into step with RF Oatmeal Cookie.  I'm pretty sure this is the oat flavor in Yogi. It is a fantastic oat flavor.  I added the WF Oats and Cream to support it.\r\n\r\nIn another support role is WF Honey Roasted Peanuts, it boosts the oat flavor with that peanut skin taste, while adding some honey coating,  \r\n\r\nOne of the other key flavors is the WF Brown Sugar Cookie.  Essential in providing that brown sugar depth with a tad of mouth feel.\r\n\r\nFA Honey for the honey note.\r\n\r\nFA Maple for the maple note, supported by FW Maple Pecan to try and some additional depth and nuttiness.\r\n\r\nTo add a richer dark sugar note and some additional nuttiness FW Butter Pecan.\r\n\r\nI played with the percentages and this is where I landed.  I'm happy with this as an all day vape.  The super sweet just to boost everything.  This will change as I get around to it.  Suggestions welcome.  At the end of the day, I get different flavors at different times, which is what I like in my vape.  I vape this mostly on a series mech and enjoy the changes as my battery starts to weaken.
