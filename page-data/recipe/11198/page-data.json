The Jungle lemon really boosts the tartness of the lemonade dramatically and rounds out the vape. I can't seem to put this one down during the summer months. Very sweet and refreshing. \r\n\r\nCan be vaped after 24 hrs with decent results, but I recommend letting it sit for a week to really meld that raspberry into its intended balance.
