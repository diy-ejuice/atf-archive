This is a stout and creamy cup of mocha with the caramel mostly just sweetening the mix a bit and helping to pull the coffee and chocolate notes together.   It is strong without tasting burnt.  My husband tasted more of a hot cocoa with hints of coffee and I was the opposite, but we both agreed it was delicious lol.
