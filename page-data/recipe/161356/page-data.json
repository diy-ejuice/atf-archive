My recipe is inspired by his creation. You can find it here: https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/127046#camp_tigerclaw_by_concreteriver\r\n\r\nMy reasons for making an iteration are following: I do not like the Sour Apple by FLV and I think that the general % is too high for current gen of RDAs.\r\nGAHC doesn't do anything right yet it is such a nice flavour. But it needs a help. FW Hard Candy is here to boost the hard candy effect. Now the apple - on my journey to find the right one that I will like and will blend well with the GAPC I have tested following apple flavours: FLV Apple, Red Apple, Green Apple, Granny Smith, INW Shisha Apple, Two Apples, RF Apple SC, FA Fuji, Apple Stark, Cap Double Apple, Fuji, TPA Tart Granny Smith, JF Fuji, FW Green Apple, LB Green Apple. For me the winner is the Green Apple by TPA. I do understand that this is usually not the first choice of apple flavouring, but it works so nice with the GAHC. You will need a touch of Super Sweet by Capella. How much it depends on you - use as much as you like.\r\n\r\nIt is a SNV, but for a better experience let it rest at least 5 days. \r\n\r\nThats it. I hope you will enjoy this recipe.\r\n\r\nTested on NarCA RDA, 42W, 0.3 Ohm, Framed Staple Ni80.","steep_days":"5 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T17:35:51.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"1218","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Green Apple","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Green Apple Hard Candy","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":8000},{"name":"Hard Candy","vendor":"FW","millipercent":500},{"name":"Super Sweet","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":250}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"161356","name":"Camp Lionclaw"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
