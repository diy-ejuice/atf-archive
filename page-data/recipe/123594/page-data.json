The custard base used in this recipe is Fresh03's quick base using LB Vanilla Ice Cream, and Flv Vanilla Pudding. I do enjoy a good tobacco vape, but to me the Holy, Holy Grail RY4 flavoring is more of a subtle caramel, and the FA Butterscotch helps enhance that caramel note. I use TPA Kettle Corn, and Flv Popcorn for the corn notes. I don't have FA Corn, but I think these two do a decent job for a very subtle corn note.\r\nYou can enjoy this after a 7 day steep, but I recommend a full 2 weeks.
