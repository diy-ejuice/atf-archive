I used a different Honeydew and Cantaloupe last time, and it was alright, but Wayne is ALWAYS correct when he says the flavors he uses produce a very distinct flavor. This last batch I used exactly what was on here and the flavor was day/night difference. I Love this flavor and will be ordering a larger quantity to maintain my stock. I can vape this ALL day and it never gets old.&#xD;\nThanks for the Recipe.","score":5},{"user":"rockwise","text":"Bangin!!!  12 outa 10&#xD;\n","score":5},{"user":"Chewymidget","text":"Not a huge fan of TFA Honeydew but this mix really is great with it.","score":5},{"user":"super8line","text":"Somehow over the past two months I've went from someone who hated melon juices to loving stuff like this.  I was worried the honeydew would be too strong but the honeydew blends with the FA whipped Cream to create a smooth creamy deliciousness.

But what I can say is that this is REALLY good stuff. I love the balance of flavours. I love the texture. I love how refreshing and smooth this stuff is. It's a simple recipe that I keep returning to. It deserves a bit more love on here. ","score":5},{"user":"Pilgrim","text":"This is one of the few recipes I can vape all day and all night, wonderful. With Flavour Art Kitchen available in the UK now it means I don't have to ration my whipped cream anymore.","score":5},{"user":"ChefJohn","text":"One of my all time favorites from Wayne. &#xD;\nNicely sweet and well balanced. &#xD;\n&#xD;\n4 stars due to using FA Whipped cream, while good is quite difficult to find.
