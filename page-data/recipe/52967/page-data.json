My creation is not meant to be a replication of either of the aforementioned.  Rather, it's just a darn good cookie!  Inspiration is much better than replication sometimes ;)\r\n\r\nSugar Cookie is what it is.  The base of most cookies out there.  To bring on oatmeal cookie qualities, ya gotta do something to it lol.  \r\n\r\nBiscuit- Buttery, and cookie like in it's own profile, it adds to the Sugar Cookie base.\r\n\r\nCGC-  Adds more buttery notes and a vanilla note to the cookie profiled base.\r\n\r\nBrown Sugar-  Darkens the cookie profile and adds a depth from the classic vanilla most basic cookies have.\r\n\r\nButterscotch-  Butterscotch Natural when mixed at roughly a 5:1 ratio with Butterscotch Ripple has it's place in several other mixes I make, and allows you to make other adds to your mix to work in the appropriate level of sweetness depending on the recipe. It's a perfect combination that allows you to play around with additional sweetener or other flavorings to match what you are going for.  Butterscotch is a staple in many oatmeal cookie profiles and recipes.\r\n\r\nCreme De Menthe  Just a touch here folks, we're not making a mint cookie lol.\r\n\r\nSweet Cream-  Used to add to the sweetness of the butterscotch.  We could have accomplished this by upping butterscotch ripple a bit more, but that would have changed the butterscotch flavor I was going for.  Flavor and sweetness are not the same thing.\r\n\r\nTry it shake and vape so you can see what the creme de menthe tastes like right out of the gate.  BUT, let it sit for a few hours and come back to it.    The next day?  The magic has already happened and the effect the creme de menthe gives to this recipe is in full swing.  \r\n\r\nThis creation is meant to be a light cookie recipe at 80% vg, and was made for a dripper.  Try it as such.  I hope you enjoy it!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","steep_days":"1 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-12T10:14:35.000-05:00","best_vg":"80%","views":"1305","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Brown Sugar","flavor_id":"313","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Biscuit","flavor_id":"642","vendor":"INW","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Cr√àme De Menthe","flavor_id":"1266","vendor":"FW","millipercent":250},{"name":"Cheesecake (graham Crust)","flavor_id":"152","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Butterscotch (natural)","flavor_id":"1219","vendor":"FW","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Sugar Cookie","flavor_id":"115","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Sweet Cream","flavor_id":"183","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Butterscotch Ripple","flavor_id":"1217","vendor":"FW","millipercent":750}],"reviews":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"52967","name":"Scout Cookie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
