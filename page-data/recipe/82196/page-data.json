This flavor is wildly complex, and those with well developed palates will really appreciate all the subtleties from it. But you can also just enjoy this vape without much thought as the flavor profiles fit perfectly together. Take your time and enjoy this vape, don't rush it, or you'll miss what it has to offer.","steep_days":"1","temperature":"0","recipe_score":2,"total_reviews":1,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:49:50.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"4200","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Raspberry","vendor":"INW","millipercent":500},{"name":"Apple Fuji","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Cookie","vendor":"FA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Meringue","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Cream Fresh","vendor":"FA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Almond","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Torrone","vendor":"FA","millipercent":250},{"name":"Bavarian Cream","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Cake (yellow)","vendor":"FW","millipercent":1000}],"reviews":[{"user":"bjorama","score":"2","text":"As with most things taste is subjective and this is quite bad.  The raspberry is just overpowering and I can't vape it.  Yuck.  For all your masterpieces I finally found one I didn't like.  Two stars one for each W.
