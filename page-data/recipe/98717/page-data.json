I'm really enjoying vaping this in the sunshine! I'm more of a creamy dessert type vaper and this juice gives a nice creamy yogurt flavor  while also providing some bright summertime citrus  notes as well.  added a drop of super sweet just to give the flavors a bit more of a \"pop\" and yeah, simple and tasty stuff! If anyone has any thoughts or suggestions on improvements or changes please let me know, always looking to learn from others! \r\n\r\nProbably best to steep this one for at least a week.
