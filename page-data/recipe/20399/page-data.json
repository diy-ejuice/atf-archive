Whipped cream may also help.","steep_days":"5","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T22:31:48.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"2256","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Cereal 27","flavor_id":"4163","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Sweet Cream","flavor_id":"117","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Cream Fresh","flavor_id":"540","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Meringue","flavor_id":"530","vendor":"FA","millipercent":500}],"reviews":[{"user":"CloudChef","text":"just let that cap cereal 27 shine huh?
