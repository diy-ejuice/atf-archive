This is a winning take on an unusual profile. For some inexplicable reason, I‚Äôve never been able to stomach FW Butter Pecan, but I still enjoyed this. My personal approach with my second mix was to remove Butter Pecan and replace it with FA Hazelnut at 0.5%. Delicious either way. Fine work. "},{"user":"Burritoclock","text":"Made it correctly. This is my brothers favorite recipe of the 100's I've tried. Great work!"},{"user":"dazcole","text":"A nicely done conception of this popular Austrian dessert it blends together beautifully. Prominent apricot encrusted inside vanilla ice cream with back notes of a nutty outside shell. I didn't have tfa apricot so upped the fa apricot and I also left out the sweetener which imo it doesn't need but credit where credit is due I'm really enjoying this so go mix it up."},{"user":"Deschain","text":"Oida!"}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"23290","name":"üç¶ Eismarillenkn√∂del.
