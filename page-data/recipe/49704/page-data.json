I basically made a baby with all of the other milk recipes out there and took some of the best parts and combined them all into one milk. \r\n\r\nI am a huge S&C fan and as a new mixer wanted to make up my own iteration of an S&C to see how it goes. You can pretty much vape it right away but i do suggest at least 3-5 days of steeping to give the flavors time to bind and settle some.\r\n\r\nUpdate: Dropped the Dragonfruit 1% just for better overall balance but you can still keep it at 6% if you liked the extra kick the dragonfruit gives the profile. \r\n\r\n\r\nInspired by God Milk, Mother of God's Milk and Dragon's Milk\r\n\r\n***If you mix this, please leave a review and let me know what you think or if you think there is something that could be changed to make it better!***","steep_days":"7 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":4,"total_reviews":1,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:49:22.000-05:00","best_vg":"65%","views":"6815","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Dragonfruit","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":5000},{"name":"Strawberry (ripe)","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Bavarian Cream","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Cheesecake (graham Crust)","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Vanilla Custard","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":2000}],"reviews":[{"user":"cdaniell30","score":"4","text":"As described, it's a basic S &amp; C...maybe a little thin in the age of Rose Milk and the like, but it's definitely got a crisp and vibrant strawberry flavor.
