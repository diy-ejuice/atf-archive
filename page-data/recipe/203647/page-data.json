I was really going for “ew”s and “AHHH”s.\r\n\r\nA watermelon lollipop with a scorpion inside. \r\n\r\nThe lollipop was the easy part. MB Watermelon is my favorite candied watermelon and the FW Candy Watermelon brought the body to it. WF Sour Ball helped sell lollipop instead of just candy. \r\n\r\nLate edition of WF Watermelon (Yellow). It brought a little more juiciness and green/rind to this.\r\nNow, FLV Milk & Honey + AP don’t bring as much dirt to this as I wanted, but it definitely feels like there’s a protein in this mix that. They offset the other flavors just enough to make you think you took a bite where the lollipop was thinning and got some scorpion too.\r\n\r\nI do suggest adding nic to this. It helps fill out the scorpion body.","steep_days":"2","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"total_reviews":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T21:33:29.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"409","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Super Sweet","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":750},{"name":"Sour Ball Candy SC","vendor":"WF","millipercent":1750},{"name":"Milk & Honey","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1250},{"name":"Acetyl Pyrazine 5%","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Big Watermelon","vendor":"MB","millipercent":4500},{"name":"Candy Watermelon","vendor":"FW","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Watermelon (Yellow) SC","vendor":"WF","millipercent":1000}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"203647","name":"Scorpion Lollipop - Watermelon"}}}
