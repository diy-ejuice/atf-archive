I occasionally bake a mean new york chessecake topped with fresh & cooked blueberries and a drizzle of strawberry sauce. After adjusting the recipe for a while I'm quite satisfied with the result. \r\n\r\nThis recipe needs at least 2 weeks steep time to come together and be super delicious. \r\n\r\nAny comments, suggestions and additions are highly appreciated. \r\nHave fun!
