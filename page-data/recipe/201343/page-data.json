All of the things about it are quite familiar but not necessarily something that's commonly put together. On the inhale you get that nice fresh juicy peach flavor and as you exhale you get that creamy texture with mingling notes of crisp crust and hazelnuts.\r\n\r\nWF Peach Pie and Cream is a really really good peach and cream but there's not a whole lot of crust going on in there. That's why I've added the OOO Pie Crust.\r\n\r\nFA White Peach to add some juicy authenticity to the peaches and make sure that note is right up front.\r\n\r\nI chose FW Hazelnut here because it has more of a dirty creaminess that is important in this recipe. I wanted it to be hazelnut flavored cream as opposed to actual hazelnuts just sprinkled on top of the pie.\r\n\r\nI sweeten this recipe with 0.5% CAP Super Sweet.\r\n\r\nWatch the Video Here:\r\nhttps://youtu.be/IwWPRKILp1Q","steep_days":"3","temperature":"0","recipe_score":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-12T14:08:09.000-05:00","best_vg":"80%","views":"388","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Peach Pie & Cream","flavor_id":"6058","vendor":"WF","millipercent":5000},{"name":"Pie Crust","flavor_id":"2010","vendor":"OOO","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Peach White","flavor_id":"543","vendor":"FA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Hazelnut","flavor_id":"1312","vendor":"FW","millipercent":1500}],"reviews":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"201343","name":"Well, Bless Your Heart (Peach Pie / Hazelnut Cream)"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
