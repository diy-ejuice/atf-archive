I appreciate all the compliments & constructive feedback on Mixin Vixens Ep.5. I will start by dropping the JF Yellow Cake by 1/3 to equal 2%. I will also try some other variants; like the addition of Chocolate. (^_^)\r\n\r\nNotes\r\n\r\nA light, sweet and soft banana chiffon cake topped with macadamia nuts and nutty bakery styled tobaccos.The tobacco flavors contained in this recipe are \"non-tobacco tobaccy\" flavors. To me they are rich bakery accents - sweet, nutty, hints of vanilla; with little to no discernible ash, dry leaf, woody or leather flavors. This is a mellow, soft nutty bakery recipe made for the newbie tobacco enthusiasts in mind. I hope you enjoy it.\r\n\r\nTop: \r\nINW's nutty, biscuit like 555 Gold tobacco flavor combines with VTA's creamy and rich Macadamia Nut to create a flavorful roasted nut at the top; accented by Sweet Tobacco (PUR) - a sweet, nutty, bakery like non-tobacco tobaccy flavor.\r\n\r\nBase: \r\nJF's Yellow Cake combined with Banana (Hangsen) Ripe Banana (FR), & Banana Sweet Cream (OOO) create a light, sweet, smooth and fluffy banana chiffon cake at the base.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nRecipe Illustration by Leilani H. 2018\r\n♥️ Created for #MixinVixens - Mixin Vixens Ep.4 (YouTube)","steep_days":"7","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"total_reviews":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-05T11:05:29.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"1385","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"555 Gold","vendor":"INW","millipercent":750},{"name":"Banana","vendor":"HS","millipercent":750},{"name":"Banana Sweet Cream","vendor":"OOO","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Macadamia Nut","vendor":"VT","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Banana Ripe","vendor":"FR","millipercent":500},{"name":"Sweet Tobacco","vendor":"PUR","millipercent":500},{"name":"Yellow Cake","vendor":"JF","millipercent":2000}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"92290","name":"Macabana Chiffon Gold "}}}
