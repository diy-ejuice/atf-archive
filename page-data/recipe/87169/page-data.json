So after a quite a few versions I came up with this delicious berry vape that really tilts towards the purple side.\r\n\r\nThe Purple - INW Plum is a new concentrate for me and it is surprisingly great, It seems to get bullied by HS Blueberry so I really had to take down the blueberry. TFA Blackberry is my favourite blackberries and at this %, it adds just a touch of bitterness that works well here.\r\n\r\nThe Red - Somewhat hidden in the background are the tasty FA Juicy Strawberry & INW Raspberry. They seem to add a bit of brightness to the dark berries and gives it a bit more body with some subtle tasty accents.\r\n\r\nINW Pineapple is there just to add brightness and tame some of the bitterness from the Plum & Blackberry.\r\n\r\nFLV Milk & Honey is used to give a hint of cream while also sweetening the mix.\r\n\r\nVery good off the shake. Give it a mix and I'm sure you'll enjoy!","steep_days":"1 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-06T08:37:08.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"1638","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Plum","vendor":"INW","millipercent":750},{"name":"Blueberry","vendor":"HS","millipercent":500},{"name":"Juicy Strawberry","vendor":"FA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Pineapple","vendor":"INW","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Blackberry","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":750},{"name":"Milk & Honey","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Raspberry","vendor":"INW","millipercent":1000}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"87169","name":"Very Berry Fruit Salad"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
