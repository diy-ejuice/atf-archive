Flv lime is the perfect candied lime for this mix. Oba Oba adds a nice candied sweetness to help sell the slushy feel as does cap hibiscus. Fa mandarin just ads an extra dimension of citrus. Fa sour wizard adds a bit of tang and helps make the lime pop.","steep_days":"3 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":4.8,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:49:24.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"5654","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Lime","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1250},{"name":"Oba Oba","vendor":"FA","millipercent":750},{"name":"Hibiscus","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Koolada 10 Pg","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Super Sweet","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":750},{"name":"Tanger (mandarin)","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Sour Wizard","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000}],"reviews":[{"user":"Jthectic","text":"Perfect recipe to highlight flv lime. I did use ws23 instead of koolada, just to go with the times. Tasty mix."},{"user":"Billywilly","text":"This is perfect to me. I did used tpa sour in place of fa sour wizard but don't think it matters much."},{"user":"Deweysuds","text":"One week steep.  Heavy lime slushy syrup.  Very authentic just maybe a bit strong.  Spot on flavor though and quite pleasant.  The mouth feel is great.  The only thing I would change is just drop down the volume from a 10 to an 8.  "},{"user":"NonStopMix","text":"Nice job on this!
