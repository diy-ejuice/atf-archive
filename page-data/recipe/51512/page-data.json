Flv lime is the perfect candied lime for this mix. Oba Oba adds a nice candied sweetness to help sell the slushy feel as does cap hibiscus. Fa mandarin just ads an extra dimension of citrus. Fa sour wizard adds a bit of tang and helps make the lime pop.","steep_days":"3 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":4,"updated_at":"2020-12-12T17:10:50.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"5664","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Lime","flavor_id":"634","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1250},{"name":"Oba Oba","flavor_id":"480","vendor":"FA","millipercent":750},{"name":"Hibiscus","flavor_id":"72","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Koolada 10 Pg","flavor_id":"280","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Super Sweet","flavor_id":"2384","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":750},{"name":"Tanger (mandarin)","flavor_id":"547","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Sour Wizard","flavor_id":"4354","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000}],"reviews":[{"user":"Jthectic","text":"Perfect recipe to highlight flv lime.

I did used tpa sour in place of fa sour wizard but don't think it matters much.","score":5},{"user":"Deweysuds","text":"One week steep.  Heavy lime slushy syrup.  Very authentic just maybe a bit strong.  Spot on flavor though and quite pleasant.  The mouth feel is great.  The only thing I would change is just drop down the volume from a 10 to an 8.
