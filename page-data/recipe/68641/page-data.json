Do not vape this right off the scale, it will be too raw and bitter because of the butter pecan.. Tfa yam and HS pumpkin pie come together to make the yams in this recipe. Molasses is a must have ingredient and can not be subbed. It is such a nice dark, sweet flavor. I like putting marshmallows and pecans in my candied yams.

HOW the hell am I the first person to review this?!?&#xD;\n&#xD;\nHooooly hell. It's the ass end of January, and I'm back at the Thanksgiving dinner table. Yam is top notch, the pumpkin pie adds in the texture, and smallest hint of pumpkin, which is not so odd to go along in here, so not considering it an off note. The marshmallow is actually discernable as such without muting things.  The butter pecan is a touch i'm not used to, but damn me if it ain't delicious. And the molasses...jesus, the molasses ties it all together, adding in the sweetness that absolutely should be in this, and combining with the buttered part of the butter pecan to just nail that sorta caramelized sweetness you get out of this dish. Absolutely spot on and utterly ADV country.&#xD;\n&#xD;\n Good lord, if you even remotely like candied yams with your holiday meals, get you some!"}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"68641","name":"Candied Yams"}}}
