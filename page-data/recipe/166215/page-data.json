This trumps all custard also-rans and is packed full of flavor, and then some. \r\n\r\nOOO Corn Bread is fast becoming my go-to cake base & provides a perfectly sweet & dense cake with very little corn notes after a steep. Most recipes containing Corn bread calls for the addition of corn, popcorn, etc to boost the corn note but it is not necessary here as I did not see out to create a traditional corn per se. \r\n\r\nThe caramel butter takes this to the next level by adding an authentic, creamy caramel boost to the custard whilst thrusting its inherent butteriness. \r\n\r\nGive this baby at least 5 days to settle and enjoy!\r\n\r\n\r\n","steep_days":"5","temperature":"0","recipe_score":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-11T02:38:35.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"2873","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Corn Bread","flavor_id":"2007","vendor":"OOO","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Creme Brulee (yc)","flavor_id":"894","vendor":"INW","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Custard","flavor_id":"4210","vendor":"INW","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Caramel Butter","flavor_id":"6046","vendor":"WF","millipercent":1500}],"reviews":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"166215","name":"Trump Custard"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
