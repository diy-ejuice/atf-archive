It's got a light fried note, and I believe it's the most palatable of donuts. Boosted by FA Joy. Gives it a fuller, more doughy quality.\r\n\r\nFA Meringue/FA Torrone: Sugar glazed effect. The nutty qualities of Torrone also compliment the Zeppola really well. \r\n\r\nFA Caramel/FA Maple Syrup/CAP VCV1: This makes for a lovely sugary syrup, the Maple is well under control, blends into the caramel. The custard butters them up nicely and also helps to bind the whole recipe together. \r\nI think the Supersweet is a necessary evil to achieve an authentic sugary syrup and 0.5% feels perfect here, not too much. \r\nNot a shake and vape! Joy/Torrone/ Custard need time to do their thing ðŸ˜‰ \r\nBang on after 1 week.\r\nOpen to constructive criticism.
