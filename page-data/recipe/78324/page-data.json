In the US, much of the crop comes from California and late summer to early fall is their peak season.\r\n\r\nThis lightened up version of a dessert panna cotta uses  Greek yogurt for a great tang that pairs well with the milk & honey. The creamy texture is a nice treat with raw figs and it's easy to mix. A perfect light treat for your vaping pleasure.. this was inspired by listening to luis aka Luadr speak on figs.. i just want to be clear that i have never tasted a fig outside of fig newtons (lol)..so i hope it turns out to be as tasty a vape as it looks as a dessert...\r\n\r\nMy thought process :\r\nI wanted a nice creamy base to place the figs on ,so i chose FLV Milk and Honey along with FLV Greek Yogurt and Paired those with MB epic Vanilla and MB Panna Cotta for what i hope will turn into a nice and delectable Panna Cotta style delight for this recipe and The honey and super sweet will compliment the tangy and slightly sweet fig. As always Vape Happy Folks.... And Enjoy ","steep_days":"14","temperature":"70","recipe_score":0,"total_reviews":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-06T07:15:22.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"923","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Super Sweet","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":500},{"name":"Epic Vanilla","vendor":"MB","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Fig","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Milk & Honey","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Panna Cotta","vendor":"MB","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Greek Yogurt","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":750}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"78324","name":"#DMC  December Challenge Panna Cotta w/ Figs and Honey "}}}
