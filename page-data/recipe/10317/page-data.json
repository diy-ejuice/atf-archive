I didn't want to upload it till I got it totally right...and here it is... definitely my best. Give it a couple weeks to get all the creamy goodness. I mix it at 70VG/30PG and the LA banana cream I use is the clear version. \r\n* update- for a creamy banana Pudding add 1% Vape Wizard-yummy\r\n","steep_days":"7","temperature":"390","recipe_score":4,"updated_at":"2020-12-12T11:50:16.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"36501","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Banana Cream","flavor_id":"210","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Marshmallow","flavor_id":"332","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Sweet Cream","flavor_id":"183","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Cheesecake (graham Crust)","flavor_id":"152","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Banana Cream","flavor_id":"916","vendor":"LA","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Butter Cream","flavor_id":"3","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Sweetener","flavor_id":"339","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":750}],"reviews":[{"user":"Jroc","text":"I meant to review this long ago. This is a must have for anyone who enjoys a banana vape. I make sure to keep a bottle available at all times. Not vaping it this very moment, so I donâ€™t want to lie to you about the specific flavor notes. But I wanted to be sure to add a rating right now before I forget again. May come back and edit with more details later. Phenomenal flavor profile and very well balanced. Flavor only intensifies over time. Unbelievably creamy as well. ","score":5},{"user":"ianerb","text":"Love my banana and love this recipe. Good on a rotation and let it steep","score":0},{"user":"CatWillMew","text":"The banana is right front and center here, but it comes off as a very sweet, artificial banana taste, kind of like Runts candy.  Doesn't do it for me.","score":4},{"user":"RancidPandemic","text":"Awesome recipe. I may be a new mixer, but this recipe is the first i am adding to my list of DIY ADV's. The taste is very close to The Sauce LA's Banana Cream, which was one of my favorite premiums. This, however, doesnt have all the added sweetener and is a much better flavor. Kuddos to you, sir/madam.

Well done!","score":5},{"user":"HerrHut","text":"This is a lot of banana.  I loved it the first week, but now after 3 weeks, the banana is a little too much for me.  Will certainly try it again with a few percentages from the banana creams cut off.  Thanks for sharing!

Everyone that has tried wants me to make some for them. I think it taste just like a store bought premium ejuice. I didn't even know I liked a banana vape. I am very impressed with your mixing skills!  5 STARS!!!!!","score":5},{"user":"corvape","text":"Excellent recipe! Perfect combination of candy banana and authentic banana.&#xD;\nGreat right away! Looking forward to it after a good steep! If it lasts that long!","score":5},{"user":"Exercyst","text":"A solid Banana Milk but, a little too much banana for it to be an ADV for me.","score":4},{"user":"Friction2600","text":"I made this and have only let it steep 7 days and it is fabulous, the banana is just right in my opinion and i can really taste the \"milk\" in it. I always mix recipes exactly as the author prescribes and i did the same here. In my opinion it is spot on for a banana milk. I can only imagine what it tastes like after a few weeks steep. I think i'll make another 60-90mls of this to let steep for a few weeks and come back with my opinion on it then. Thanks for the great vape!","score":5},{"user":"Nugget40","text":"Very rich, creamy, authentic ripe banana...I personally enjoy the pudding version with 1% vape wizard added....can't get enough of this recipe, one of if not the best banana liquids I have ever had","score":5},{"user":"Peewee","text":"This is some good stuff.

This will be my goto juice when I have a banana craving for sure.","score":5},{"user":"RuntDastardly","text":"Gooooood stuff! My first job was at an ice cream shop. My 2 favorite treats there was a single scoop of their peach melba ice cream, or a banana milkshake. This is a dead ringer for the latter. Can't believe how rich and creamy this is without a custard flavor. Killer job, man! Will definitely mix again. ","score":5},{"user":"WhoIsJayson","text":"This is really nice man!
