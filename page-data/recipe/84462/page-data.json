The general idea was to create a tobacco vape that had cactus flavor. A primary concern was to use the INW Cactus concentrate in a way that tasted good, while still keeping the character of a tobacco vape. Weird, fruity, deep, aromatic, and satisfying, I think I got it.  \r\nTo quote the storied wordsmith /u/ID10-T: \"It's sort of like opening a fresh pack of fancy cigarettes and taking a deep whiff, while drinking a cactus beer.\"\r\n\r\nFLV Native Tobacco--Oh yeah, baby. It took me a while to get around to ordering this, but once I did I knew I would be using it in this. A bit of spice, plenty of body, and just enough sweetness make it click with its prickly dancing partner. \r\nINW Cactus -0.75%-I chose this percentage because I wanted it to be noticed, informing the vape, and lending fruity flavor without making it soggy or turning it into an aloe-tobacco (ew). It works, but it needs some help getting integrated into the profile without soaking it so..\r\nFLV Yakima Hops--I use this here to bind with the Cactus and introduce it to the tobacco in a way that avoids soaking it. The brightness pairs well and it provides bit of a buffer in flavor and mouthfeel with its dry, earthy tones.\r\nINW Dark for Pipe--This is in a support role to the Native Tobacco with the function of filling out the base notes. It is also the reason why the recommended steep time is 4 weeks here. It provides a heavy richness that fills out a bit after steeping and completes the package. I am tempted to try to work Black for Pipe in here instead, but that is only because it is my favorite tobacco ever, if I am being honest. Black for Pipe competes a bit too much elsewhere in the recipe. \r\n\r\n*credit to the stolen artwork here: http://www.marcjohns.com/blog/2011/07/12/pipe-smoking-rabbit","steep_days":"28","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"total_reviews":3,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:49:52.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"4474","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Native Tobacco","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Classic For Pipe Dark","vendor":"INW","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Yakima Hops","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Cactus","vendor":"INW","millipercent":750}],"reviews":[{"user":"nowar","score":"5","text":"This is a special blend of awesome. I was waiting until I finished my 60ml of this before I wrote this review. Unfortunately (for me) my friend's mom loved it too and got the rest of my bottle! This is all the very best things about an unusual vape. If you like tobaccos, fruits, beers and/or weird amazing combinations, go for it. If you are disappointed, you will still be intrigued. I thought this was amazing."},{"user":"Ebc88","score":"5","text":"This was a really long steeper, but in the end its worth it give the For Pipe plenty of time to come to life. At first I thought this was really really werid, but the more vaped it the more I liked it. The dark fruit note from the For Pipe really shines through. The Yakima Hops give it an IPAish vibe. And the cactus juices everything up, but with making the tobacco seem like the end of a chewed up cigar. "},{"user":"ID10-T","score":"5","text":"I was previously certain that any attempt to make an identifiable amount of Cactus work in a tobacco was going to come out tasting like grasshopper spit. I was wrong. It's odd, but it's fun and I definitely dig it. Cactus in a tobacco, and it actually works. Mind blown. I love how you get the cactus juiciness sort of separate from the tobacco, so there's mouthwatering juiciness here but yet it somehow still feels like a dried tobacco.  It's not soggy like I'd expected. I don't want to even think of the abominations that must have been tried over the past year or so leading up to this wonderful, weird little recipe.
