I just wanted a vape that hit similar notes.  I went through 12 different iterations of this recipe before I thought it was finished, and I think the end result is great.  The caramel and coconut notes really mix excellently.  I can't decide if I like the Brown Sugar or not, so consider it optional.  You could also probably bump up the caramel a bit, but the Lotus caramel is pretty strong.  Acetyl Pyrazine and TPA Marshmallow are there for mouthfeel.  Meringue is just a sweetener.\r\n\r\nYes, this recipe does absolutely require Lotus (aka Medicine Flower) Caramel, and it can't really be subbed for anything else.  It's the only caramel I've used that tastes anything near the real thing.  You can get it at ecigsexpress.\r\n\r\nBe patient and let this steep for at least a week.  Two is probably better.","steep_days":"10","temperature":"500","recipe_score":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-12T02:44:35.000-05:00","best_vg":"86%","views":"1259","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Vanilla Custard","flavor_id":"188","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":5000},{"name":"Coconut","flavor_id":"37","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Caramel","flavor_id":"1116","vendor":"MF","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Meringue","flavor_id":"176","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Marshmallow","flavor_id":"332","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Acetyl Pyrazine","flavor_id":"1709","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Brown Sugar","flavor_id":"313","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":500}],"reviews":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"42926","name":"Brû-La-La"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
