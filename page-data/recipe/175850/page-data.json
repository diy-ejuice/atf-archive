Nothing better than a nice bag of doughnuts with sweet strawberry glaze from the corner store, to cure that sweet tooth!!\r\nThis is my take on just that.\r\nTHE INGREDIENTS:\r\n-Cap, Glazed Doughnut: This is the base of the recipe. A chewy, not to heavy doughnut flavor as accurate as it is delicious. It gives the recipe depth and body, which is why I chose it.\r\n-Tpa, Meringue: I chose this because it is a sweet glaze like flavor. It merely enhances the frosting/glaze of the doughnut. It also acts as a base for the strawberry to sit on top of, and separates the doughnut from the frosting so it doesn't get to muddled.\r\n-J.F, Sweet Strawberry: I wanted to create a glazed doughnut, instead of a cream filled. Out of the strawberry flavors I had this one seemed the best option. It is sweet and forgiving, a great choice for that artificial but accurate strawberry flavor I needed. And at 1.75% it doesn't overpower the chewy dough flavor of the Cap doughnut.\r\n-TPA, Strawberry: Another great strawberry. However better as an enhancer to the Jungle Flavors strawberry sweet IMO. it's just enough to bring out that sweet flavor without totally burying the doughnut.\r\n-TPA, Sweetner: While I would of preferred super sweet... I dont have any right now. Sooo tfa sweetner has to do. And I think at three quarters of a percent it does just fine.\r\n\r\nWell there you have it. My take on a sweet strawberry glazed doughnut. Like the little debbie ones haha.\r\nPlease let me know what you guys think. I'm always looking for honest reviews, comments and ratings!\r\nThanks everyone! Keep mixing much love!","steep_days":"2","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-01T11:49:41.000-05:00","best_vg":"40%","views":"1046","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Glazed Doughnut","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":5500},{"name":"Meringue","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Strawberry Sweet","vendor":"JF","millipercent":1750},{"name":"Strawberry","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":750},{"name":"Sweetener","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":750}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"175850","name":"Strawberry Glazed Doughnut"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
