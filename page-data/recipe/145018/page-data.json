The FLV lemonade gets really juicy after a few days and still has that tart kick.  Electric blue is my favorite blue raz candy flavor, but it has no body whatsoever which is why I add a touch of INW Raspberry concentrate to add a bit of body to the Blue Razz flavor without taking anything away from it.
