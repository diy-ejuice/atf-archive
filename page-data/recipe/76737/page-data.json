Its not offensive dirt but it is unquestionably, dirt. FE Sweet Rice to me is good but lacking that rice feel where VT nailed it so the pairing is perfect. \r\nFA Red Bean also has some earth going on and is less dirt than VTs Rice Base also lending a hand to blend that off note. The profile was packed with flavor with just the 2 Rice flavors and the Red Bean but it was linear, lacking body and mouthfeel. I wanted a little vanilla to help round this out and FLV Vanilla Bean works well as a top note without pushing other flavors around. Toasted Marshmallow gives this some body and adds some additional background notes. \r\n\r\nI've really been enjoying this mix and hope to get some feedback, enjoy!\r\n","steep_days":"3 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"total_reviews":null,"updated_at":"2020-11-30T17:51:46.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"1285","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Rice Base","vendor":"VT","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Sweet Rice","vendor":"FE","millipercent":5000},{"name":"Red Bean","vendor":"FA","millipercent":200},{"name":"Toasted Marshmallow","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Vanilla Bean","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":500},{"name":"Super Sweet","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":250}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"76737","name":"Azuki Mochi"}}}
