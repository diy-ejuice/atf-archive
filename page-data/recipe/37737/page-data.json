So I used INW biscuit, Cap vanilla cupcakeV2, and CAP vanilla custard to simulate the cookie dough. I think it's pretty close. I also wanted to add a side note. Instead of using chocolate for a chocolate chip cookie dough, I used banana and banana cream. I think it's a well balanced pairing, although unusual, with a cookie dough taste.  Banana is not over-powering and that's the way I like it, hope you do as well :) \r\nMaxVG\r\nShake and Vape","steep_days":"3 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"total_reviews":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T20:31:57.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"2358","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Vanilla Cupcake V2","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Biscuit","vendor":"INW","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Vanilla Custard","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Sweetener","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Banana Cream","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Banana","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":500}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"37737","name":"Creme Jeans"}}}
