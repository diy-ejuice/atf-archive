Been working on this one for a while now, and I feel like it's ready to share. Enjoy the rich, sweet, and tart combinations of cherry and lime in all it's Sonic loveliness.\r\n\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n**Recommended for**: High Wattage Drippers / RTA's\r\n\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n**What I vaped it on during development:**\r\n\r\nDually RDA\r\n80 Watts\r\nRambo's Wire Art Coil:\r\n3mm .16\r\n28g Stainless Steel Frames, .3 Ribbon 3ply 316L Nichrome80 Fralien Single Coil\r\n\r\nElfy RTA\r\n35 Watts\r\nMini Staple Single Coil\r\n3mm 6 wrap\r\n.3 N80 / 40g N80 .25 Single Coil\r\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n**ＦＬＡＶＯＲ ＮＯＴＥＳ**\r\n\r\nSee video: https://goo.gl/Ld6EBC\r\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n**Steeping recommendations**:\r\nI would recommend letting this formulation sit for at least 3 days to allow the notes to properly meld together and the inherent alcohol and throat hit to dissipate. Don't expect a super smooth draw from this one as authentic citrus recipes should inherently carry a slight throat hit.\r\n\r\n----------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nFollow for more creations:\r\nhttp://www.youtube.com/c/SteamCraft","steep_days":"3 (SNV)","temperature":"420","recipe_score":4,"updated_at":"2020-12-12T10:34:01.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"4586","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Blackcherry Jelly Bean SC","flavor_id":"8359","vendor":"WF","millipercent":500},{"name":"Cherry Extract","flavor_id":"222","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Cactus","flavor_id":"647","vendor":"INW","millipercent":250},{"name":"Lemon Lime Soda SC","flavor_id":"8372","vendor":"WF","millipercent":1750},{"name":"Lime","flavor_id":"634","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":250},{"name":"Super Sweet","flavor_id":"2384","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":350}],"reviews":[{"user":"Woody0707","text":"This is great when fresh.
