We're using it here as the main note at 4%.\r\n\r\nI wanted to really crank up the graham cracker note so I added 2% TFA Cheesecake (Graham Crust) it's a really great buttery graham crust that pairs nicely with the INW. \r\n\r\nI didn't the lime to be sharp or the main note but I wanted to be able to taste it. VT Persian Lime is a solid zesty lime juice. I've used it at 1% here, that's just enough to make itself known but not dilute or overpower the mix. \r\n\r\nIt was important for me for this recipe to have a vanilla note, as I'm (loosely) attempting to recreate the juice I used to quit smoking. OOO Marshmallow Vanilla is a good sticky, little sweet vanilla note here at 0.5%. \r\n\r\nSweeten to Taste.\r\n\r\nWatch the Video Here:\r\n\r\nhttps://youtu.be/iFmltXIR4iM","steep_days":"7","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:51:46.000-05:00","best_vg":"80%","views":"423","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Cheesecake (graham Crust)","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Yes, We Cheesecake","vendor":"INW","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Persian Lime","vendor":"VT","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Marshmallow (Vanilla)","vendor":"OOO","millipercent":500}],"reviews":[{"user":"lionhrt9","text":"Introduced to you via Developed guys.
