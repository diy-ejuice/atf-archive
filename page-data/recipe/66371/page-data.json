Watched this back in 2016: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7noLAUMuosg. The names unicorn puke and dragon jizz sent me on a research bender. Nope. No dragon jizz to be found anywhere, other than in google image search.\r\n\r\n Damn furries. ;P \r\n\r\nOddly enough, found an image belonging to a commercially available juice called Unicorn Jizz.  http://stores.goodasgoldpremium.com/unicorn-jizz-ejuice/.\r\nCouldn't bring myself to try it. Too tropical in my head for unicorns.\r\n\r\nSo, after a long discussion with friends of mine who are furries, started joking about making some. This is not the Dragon Jizz (that's still a WIP). But, since my 'sona is a cross between a kitsune, and a unicorn, and has a candy corn horn? Started noodling out what the hell that'd taste like. So here we are:\r\n\r\nOrange, creamy as hell, and a hint of candy corn.\r\n\r\nNow I just gotta find a dragon. It's for science >.>","steep_days":"14 (SNV)","temperature":"440","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-06T12:54:54.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"1208","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Orange Cream","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Dx Sweet Cream","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Orange Dream Bar","vendor":"FW","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Butterscotch (natural)","vendor":"FW","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Dx Bavarian Cream","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2250},{"name":"Honey","vendor":"FA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Blood Orange","vendor":"FA","millipercent":2000}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"66371","name":"Kitsucorn Cream"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
