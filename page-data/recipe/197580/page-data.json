For the base i used TPA Pie Crust with INW Biscuit . I also added a touch of VT Butter Base for a richer buttery taste and to add mouthfeel to the recipe . VT Banana Custard has become a real favourite of mine . I do find that in bakeries the Banana can seem quite weak and so i have added some FLV Banana to help push it more to the front . I have added FA Custard Premium and FLV Vanilla Pudding to increase texture and mouthfeel . The Vanilla Pudding also helps with vanilla notes . I have added sweetener but this is optional depending on personal preference ","steep_days":"5","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"total_reviews":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T23:39:01.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"1008","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Banana","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Banana Custard","vendor":"VT","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Biscuit","vendor":"INW","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Butterscotch","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":750},{"name":"Custard Premium","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Pie Crust","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Vanilla Pudding","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":700},{"name":"Sweetener","vendor":"FW","millipercent":500},{"name":"Butter Base","vendor":"VT","millipercent":600}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"197580","name":"#Developedpie Banana Custard Tart with Butterscotch"}}}
