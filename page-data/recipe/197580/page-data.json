For the base i used TPA Pie Crust with INW Biscuit . I also added a touch of VT Butter Base for a richer buttery taste and to add mouthfeel to the recipe . VT Banana Custard has become a real favourite of mine . I do find that in bakeries the Banana can seem quite weak and so i have added some FLV Banana to help push it more to the front . I have added FA Custard Premium and FLV Vanilla Pudding to increase texture and mouthfeel . The Vanilla Pudding also helps with vanilla notes . I have added sweetener but this is optional depending on personal preference ","steep_days":"5","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T23:39:01.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"1008","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Banana","flavor_id":"603","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Banana Custard","flavor_id":"8825","vendor":"VT","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Biscuit","flavor_id":"642","vendor":"INW","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Butterscotch","flavor_id":"613","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":750},{"name":"Custard Premium","flavor_id":"9118","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Pie Crust","flavor_id":"179","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Vanilla Pudding","flavor_id":"4433","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":700},{"name":"Sweetener","flavor_id":"1432","vendor":"FW","millipercent":500},{"name":"Butter Base","flavor_id":"8843","vendor":"VT","millipercent":600}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"197580","name":"#Developedpie Banana Custard Tart with Butterscotch"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
