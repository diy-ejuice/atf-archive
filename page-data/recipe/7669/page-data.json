The licorice flavor is red and its a very thick liquid.. I thought it was funny. Sorry.\r\n\r\nI thought the red licorice flavor was a little too pungent, even though I liked the flavor. This tones it down a bit and adds a smooth well-rounded mouth feel with a hint of cream and very slight kick from the marzipan that makes up for the light throat hit. Very twizzlery. I'm currently enjoying this with dual claptons at 60W. This is a shake and vape.\r\n\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nYou are free to\r\nShare — copy and redistribute the material in any medium or format\r\nAdapt — remix, transform, and build upon the material\r\n\r\n(The licensor cannot revoke these freedoms as long as you follow the license terms.)\r\n\r\nUnder the following terms:\r\n\r\nAttribution — You must give appropriate credit, provide a link to the license, and indicate if changes were made.

This is an odd one to explain definitely. It tastes like a Twizzler milkshake. The Smooth blends everything a bit while also helping the VBIC to thicken the vape up. Marzipan makes it a bit malty. Definitely a nice recipe to try out, especially if you have TFA Red Licoroce and don't quite know what to do with it."}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"7669","name":"It's me, Margaret"}}}
