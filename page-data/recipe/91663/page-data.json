Not too creamy not too tart. Green apple puts a little sour note in the mix while Dragon Fruit adds a juice or wet mouth feel. Meringue blends the fruits and balances out the Greek Yogurt. I use this recipe for a quick mix when i don't feel like spending too much time mixing or waiting for juice to steep. Add sweetener if you prefer. This is not entirely original as the concepts are borrowed from the mixing community.
