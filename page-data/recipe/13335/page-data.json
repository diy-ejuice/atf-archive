I don’t know about the “reminiscent of Summer” part - the eucalyptus in it reminds much more of spring and fall, the seasons when I tend to need cough drops. Fuckin allergies. But I’m definitely down with it being described as a cool, refreshing vape that’s perfect for summer. Plenty flavorful without being overwhelming, decidedly floral without being at all perfumey, sweet but not too sweet, and very juicy. All these flavors work together so well to make something super easily ADV-able and even palate cleansing. Maybe even spirit-cleansing: there’s something soothing and calming about this - it tastes like the picture in that sense. I think I might need to have some of these made up at all times, especially in the summer, as it’s like an anti-anxiety breathing exercise or a yoga stretch in a bottle.  A moment of Zen in an RDA.
