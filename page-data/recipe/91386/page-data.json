The first half dozen or so draws were marred by whatever that weird rubbing alcohol note is that I seem to get from every fresh redrip of anything with FLV Candy Roll in there. After that wears off, it’s a nearly perfect purple pixie, a great grape candy. Just to be a little nitpicky, it doesn’t feel quite as powdery or granulated as a fresh hit of grape pixie stick, though, it gets a little bogged down with syrupy candy, like right after the pixie dust melts in your mouth, assuming you’re not some heathen who swallows it while it’s still sugar.
