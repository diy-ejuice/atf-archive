Tatanka has a nice Dark and nutty Tobacco note, butterscotch has a Dark buttery caramel and the smoked butterscotch gives it a touch of smoke which i wanted in this mix. \r\n\r\nRainer Cherry, Cavendish: This i my kinda top note of my Tobacco. Rainer cherry is a very candy cherry flavor, and not a cherry i would recommend, but in Tobaccos it just shines through he whole mix. Itâ€™s comes through as a soft and Bright cherry which blends lovelely with the ry4 base. The Cavendish Creates the bridge between the the ry4 and adds a touch of floral cherry to the Tobacco.\r\n\r\nSmooth Vanilla: 0,5% is HIGH. Dont go there, but in this mix, it is perfect. I wanted the floral note from the smooth vanilla and the vanilla and i get both at this %.\r\n\r\nMocha, Sweetness:  Adds a Deep Rich chocolate note and a slight sweetness which keeps the mix for being TOO dry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","steep_days":"3","temperature":"0","recipe_score":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-11T15:03:59.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"482","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Smoked Butterscotch","flavor_id":"8569","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":500},{"name":"Tatanka Tobacco","flavor_id":"4417","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Cavendish","flavor_id":"4422","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":500},{"name":"Butterscotch","flavor_id":"613","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Smooth Vanilla","flavor_id":"8570","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":500},{"name":"Mocha","flavor_id":"617","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":500},{"name":"Sweetness","flavor_id":"4413","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":250},{"name":"Rainier Cherry","flavor_id":"4305","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1500}],"reviews":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"201864","name":"Rain FLV4est"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
