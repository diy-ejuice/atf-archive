Tatanka has a nice Dark and nutty Tobacco note, butterscotch has a Dark buttery caramel and the smoked butterscotch gives it a touch of smoke which i wanted in this mix. \r\n\r\nRainer Cherry, Cavendish: This i my kinda top note of my Tobacco. Rainer cherry is a very candy cherry flavor, and not a cherry i would recommend, but in Tobaccos it just shines through he whole mix. Itâ€™s comes through as a soft and Bright cherry which blends lovelely with the ry4 base. The Cavendish Creates the bridge between the the ry4 and adds a touch of floral cherry to the Tobacco.\r\n\r\nSmooth Vanilla: 0,5% is HIGH. Dont go there, but in this mix, it is perfect. I wanted the floral note from the smooth vanilla and the vanilla and i get both at this %.\r\n\r\nMocha, Sweetness:  Adds a Deep Rich chocolate note and a slight sweetness which keeps the mix for being TOO dry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","steep_days":"3","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"total_reviews":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T14:14:43.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"472","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Smoked Butterscotch","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":500},{"name":"Tatanka Tobacco","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Cavendish","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":500},{"name":"Butterscotch","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Smooth Vanilla","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":500},{"name":"Mocha","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":500},{"name":"Sweetness","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":250},{"name":"Rainier Cherry","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1500}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"201864","name":"Rain FLV4est"}}}
