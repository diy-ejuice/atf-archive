Tastes more like that ice cream with fresh mango puree and crushed canned pineapple, but I'm happy with it. I'll call it a work in progress and see how it steeps out. \r\n\r\nSwiped The Trinity Vanilla Ice Cream by Eyemakepizza; it's a deeply satisfying shake and vapeable vanilla ice cream base and I never thought to change it. \r\n\r\nVT Shisha Mango and FLV Mango. Muah! Perfection. Ripe sweet mango right on top. \r\n\r\nThe pineapple part was a bit trickier. WF Pineapple Candy is a flavor I opened for the first time today and haven't tried as a single flavor. It smells like a kinder, gentler TFA Pineapple. But I remembered that one of the first things I ever made that I liked when I started mixing was a pineapple ice cream that was mostly TFA Pineapple and Vanilla Bean Ice Cream, with a little marshmallow to soften that sharp pineapple. I was advised to use it between 2 and 3% and back it up with another pineapple that would give it some body because it's a bit thin. I first tried it at 2.5% with 0.75% FLV Pineapple, but it tasted like pineapple candy in my ice cream, with some bits of underripe banana as well.  This version with the Pineapple Candy down at 2% and swapping out the FLV Pineapple for CAP Golden Pineapple worked much better. I love it so much I set off my smoke alarm sucking it down greedily. \r\n\r\nDon't hesitate to give the Trinity Vanilla Ice Cream a try, let Eyemakepizza know what you think, and pile your flavorite fruits or other ice cream toppings on it. \r\n\r\n","steep_days":"1 (SNV)","temperature":"420","recipe_score":5,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:50:48.000-05:00","best_vg":"75%","views":"6464","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Vanilla Ice Cream","vendor":"LB","millipercent":5000},{"name":"Vanilla Swirl","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1500},{"name":"French Vanilla Icecream","vendor":"HS","millipercent":750},{"name":"Golden Pineapple","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":750},{"name":"Pineapple Candy SC","vendor":"WF","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Shisha Mango","vendor":"VT","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Mango","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Sweetener","vendor":"FW","millipercent":750}],"reviews":[{"user":"eyemakepizza","text":"An awesome tropical twist on a delicious vanilla ice cream. As a shake and vape the mangoes are super forward and dominate the pineapple. Give it a week and the pineapple punches forward to make this excellent s&amp;v an even more tasty recipe! A+ "},{"user":"AlfredPudding","text":"I'm pretty much drinking it at this point. This is such an incredible use of the ice cream trinity. I was honestly hesitant to make a recipe with it because of the insanely accurate ice cream mouth feel, but this actually manages to bolster it. The amazing creaminess of FLV Mango and the thickening properties of WF Pineapple Candy accent the already awesome ice cream base perfectly. The Shisha Mango manages to make the mango component both syrupy and creamy, which is probably why I love this recipe so very much. Thank you for making and sharing this beautiful creation.
