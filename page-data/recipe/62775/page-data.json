It's a light, soft and sweet with a hint of cherries in the aroma. It has a slight black tea bitterness which I like in a tea. Inewera cherries just make up the body with a sweet cherry flavor without the medicinal off note. I like a bit of cream and sugar with my tea hence the rest of the ingredients. I love Cherry's and this is a nice easy tea recipe with a fantastic aroma. Regards all. (Hangsen vanilla is a better vanilla in this recipe imo. Increased the cherries to 2.5 and added inawera marzipan at .5 to fill in the base with an extra cherry note) Regards all","steep_days":"5 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T23:35:56.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"1158","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Cherry Blossom Tea","vendor":"OOO","millipercent":3500},{"name":"Cream Fresh","vendor":"FA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Italian Lemon Sicily","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":250},{"name":"Vanilla","vendor":"HS","millipercent":250},{"name":"Super Sweet","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":750},{"name":"Cherries","vendor":"INW","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Marzipan","vendor":"INW","millipercent":750},{"name":"Tea Black Water Soluble","vendor":"FA","millipercent":750}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"62775","name":"Cherry blossom tea"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
