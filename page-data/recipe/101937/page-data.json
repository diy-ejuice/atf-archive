Didn't have everything I needed for ID10-T's Lucky's Charm, so I just went for a creamy, strawberry cereal profile with some added Milk and NY Cheesecake (the missing concentrates from Lucky' s are on my to buy list).  I also really wanted something kind of solid to use my Cake Batter Dip in.  Cereal vapes take me right back to the days of yore when Saturday morning meant Cartoon Day (along with Soul Train, Kung Fu Theater, and local wrestling on into the carefree afternoon).  This is a super creamy milk over slightly soggy strawberry cereal . . . like the last few bites before guzzling every last drop of the ambrosial, sugar-thickened, pink nostalgia . . . it's waiting just a spoon's length away.\r\n\r\nI enjoyed this as a SNV, but it really came together after 3 days.  Mixed 60vg/40pg.\r\n\r\nMuch thanks to ID10-T for doing the legwork with Lucky's Charm!","steep_days":"1 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-06T20:43:57.000-05:00","best_vg":"60%","views":"1394","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Breakfast Cereals","flavor_id":"8810","vendor":"FA","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Juicy Strawberry","flavor_id":"8779","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Shisha Strawberry","flavor_id":"1711","vendor":"INW","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Cereal 27","flavor_id":"4163","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Milk","flavor_id":"523","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"New York Cheesecake","flavor_id":"90","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Meringue","flavor_id":"530","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Cake Batter Dip","flavor_id":"1223","vendor":"FW","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Cream Milky Undertone PG","flavor_id":"6539","vendor":"OOO","millipercent":1500}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"101937","name":"Strawberry Saturdays"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
