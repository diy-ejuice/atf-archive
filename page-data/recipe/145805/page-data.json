This has been a staple in mixing for me since I began mixing. \r\nWhen I think I can't get this profile any better something else comes along which isn't a bad thing.\r\nThis is the dream, a rich full berry Jammy forward Donut with all the delicious mouthfeel and flavor you can enjoy. I don't want one of those Jam donuts where you search for a drop in the middle, this is jam in your face & \"Dripping\" off your lips the way it should be!\r\n\r\nThe Donut Base\r\nWF Glazed Donut & FW Cake Batter Dip offer IMO the best donut base available. \r\nThe contrast between them help give you the lovely soft doughy mouthfeel with authenticity.  \r\n\r\nCaps Cinnamon Sugar is perfect for a profile like this where is pleasant and able to be pushed around a bit by percentage into a place that works.\r\nLA Cream Cheese Icing is a little hidden gem here, it sweetens, it textures & helps to contrast the tones of the berries\r\nCaps Golden Butter really assists with some further gloss to the overall mouthfeel and depth of flavor here. \r\nCaps super sweet is that hint of sweeteness that helps at the end of the exhale in this to sell that sugar mouthfeel.\r\n\r\nThe Dripping \r\nAfter much experimentation this is my jam!!\r\nThe Jam Stone used here consisting of FLV Jammy Berry, Raspberry Jam, JF Sweet Strawberry and the amazing FA Candy/Jammy Wizard is what drips over your lips. This combination of delectable syrupy and jammy berry concentrates along with a little assistance of the jammy wizard is the headline act here. This combo took some getting right for my pallet but was well worth the effort.  \r\nI call this my \"Jammy Berry Trinity with wizardry!\" because its magical! \r\n\r\nI am very proud of this recipe, it's well worth the short wait to steep. \r\nThis is seriously up there with one of my all time best recipes yet, enjoy! \r\n\r\nLet me know your thoughts and most of all just enjoy mixing!!\r\n\r\n\"Together, Let's Discover!!!\"\r\n\r\nFacebook - https://www.facebook.com/groups/diydownunder/\r\nDiscord - https://discord.gg/kH4Fqbc\r\nYoutube - https://www.youtube.com/c/diydownunder\r\nWebsite - https://www.diydownunder.com/\r\nInstagram IGTV : @diydownunder\r\n\r\nI enjoyed this at 60W on a WOTOFO Recurve RDA ","steep_days":"7","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:50:50.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"6824","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Cake Batter Dip","vendor":"FW","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Jammy/Candy Wizard","vendor":"FA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Cinnamon Sugar","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Cream Cheese Icing","vendor":"LA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Glazed Donut SC","vendor":"WF","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Jammy Berry","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":500},{"name":"Raspberry Jam","vendor":"VT","millipercent":500},{"name":"Strawberry Sweet","vendor":"JF","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Super Sweet","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":500},{"name":"Golden Butter","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":500}],"reviews":[{"user":"Denske","text":"Good job girl can definately tell a lot of work wont into this.
