Not really, but, I swear it tastes like I should be. \r\n\r\nThis is a mango lemonade with booze, now I don’t drink anymore, so I cannot tell you how authentic it is to the actual one that is sold, but that is ok, because I am not trying to make it taste like that. I am making it taste good for me. \r\nSo, that is why the name is Tam’s. \r\n\r\nThe base:  This is Lemonade, VT Lemonade Clear, this is a solid lemonade to use as a base lemonade flavor, added to this is VT Mango Juice and VT Passion Fruit and Mango. \r\nTo add the boozy aspect, I used VT Russian Vodka. What can I say, but this is something VT has nailed, booze.  \r\nvT Fizzy Sherbet is used to add a bit of a wow effect to the drink. \r\nThe sweetener is optional,\r\nEnjoy\r\nThis is good as a shake n vape, but is better after 3 days.
