My first iteration wasn't what I wanted it to be.  It was kicking around my head today on our last day of school before Christmas break (trying to stay focused while monitoring about 400 kids watching The Polar Express in the gym . . . about 200 stayed home since it was a short day), and I started thinking about using Caramel Butter and Soho for the RY4.\r\n\r\nThe strawberry: A mix of JF Strawberry Sweet, INW Shisha Strawberry, and (the relatively new kid on the block) FA Juicy Strawberry.  I wanted a sweet, jammy strawberry to play nice with the caramel and creamy aspects of the RY4 I was attempting.  Off a shake, this seems to be sitting at just the right level.\r\n\r\nThe custard/cream:  The automatic custard, INW Custard, with LA Cheesecake and WF Vanilla Ruyan Custard.  I wanted the slight tang of cheesecake with the custard to mix with the strawberries.  WF Vanilla Ruyan Custard seemed like the obvious choice to bridge the custard to the dessert tobacco of the RY4 . . . kind of acts as a double dip for custard and RY4 purposes.\r\n\r\nThe RY4:  FA Soho, FLV Cured, WF Vanilla Ruyan Custard, and WF Caramel Butter . . . these concentrates make up the caramel-vanilla-tobacco RY4.  I didn't want to go too tobacco heavy and draw away from the strawberry and custard aspect (and RY4 is not really a full-on tobacco anyway).\r\n\r\nI'm going to vape through this 10mL tester within a day which will make it tough to see if/how it changes . . . but as a SNV it is pretty darn tasty!  Need to make a bottle to let it steep and possibly try it out with FLV Native.  I went with Cured because it's great off the shake, even though it suffers from dying out more than the other FLV tobaccos . . . knowing this was just a trial, and it wouldn't have to stand the test of a long steep.  I initially tried DIYFS Holy Grail RY4 and Red Burley in place of Caramel Butter, Soho, and Cured but wasn't pleased with it.  I'm sure somebody can make it work . . . but it, in my opinion, was too bold for the strawberries (or I was too ham-handed).\r\n\r\nI mixed it 60vg/40pg.  I marked it as a one day steep out of necessity but will mix at least a 30mL tomorrow and let it sit for awhile to see how it changes.  As is . . . I'm digging it.","steep_days":"1 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:49:48.000-05:00","best_vg":"60%","views":"2433","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Caramel Butter","flavor_id":"6046","vendor":"WF","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Soho","flavor_id":"413","vendor":"FA","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Cheesecake","flavor_id":"930","vendor":"LA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Custard","flavor_id":"4210","vendor":"INW","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Shisha Strawberry","flavor_id":"1711","vendor":"INW","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Strawberry Sweet","flavor_id":"4745","vendor":"JF","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Juicy Strawberry","flavor_id":"8779","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Cured Tobacco","flavor_id":"630","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Vanilla Ruyan Custard","flavor_id":"6066","vendor":"WF","millipercent":1500}],"reviews":[{"user":"Bjorncoetsee","text":"Looks really good "}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"79933","name":"Strawber-RY4"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
