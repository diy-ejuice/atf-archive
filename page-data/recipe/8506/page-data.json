And I was only mixing for a few months before I came up with this. When I released it on all the flavors a while back its just how I created it back then. \r\n\r\nI mixed it a couple weeks ago and it was terrible. Not as in gross but just way to much of everything. I messed around with it and cut the percentagesame way down. So try if you like. \r\n\r\nIf you get just a dry soilish flavor add TFA sweetener at 1% or CAP Super Sweet at 1 drop per 10 ml. \r\n\r\nThe only reports of that I've gotten are from people who are used to shelf e-liquid, once sweetness is added they liked it alot more. \r\n\r\nBut yeah. This was my very first recipe and I'm glad I could cut it back to make it enjoyable again.\r\n\r\n","steep_days":"7","temperature":"400","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-10T17:56:04.000-05:00","best_vg":"75%","views":"1714","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Banana Nut Bread","flavor_id":"1184","vendor":"FW","millipercent":1250},{"name":"Bavarian Cream","flavor_id":"145","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Brown Sugar","flavor_id":"313","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Cinnamon Roll","flavor_id":"1249","vendor":"FW","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Cinnamon Churro","flavor_id":"1246","vendor":"FW","millipercent":4000}],"reviews":[{"user":"Mr-G","text":"its ok","score":0}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"8506","name":"Cinnamon Banana Bread"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
