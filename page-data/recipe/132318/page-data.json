I also messed around slightly with the grainy notes to hopefully counteract FE sticky rice's shortcomings after a steep. \r\n\r\nTasting notes: \r\n\r\nShake and vape - this one seems like it isn't the best for shake and vape. I was actually kind of disappointed when I first tried it after mixing. It was very evident that the flavors weren't meshing together nicely. \r\n\r\n3 day steep - whew, it's crazy what a few days steep can do for a juice. It is tasting a hell of a lot better now. Basically how you would imagine shyndos mango sticky rice would taste but with honeydew. Might wanna change the coconut notes around and maybe add in some tfa coconut candy. Honeydew notes might be a bit on the stronger side, i personally enjoy it like this, but maybe JF honeydew melon could be lowered slightly. Will probably come out with a v2 of this recipe idea. \r\n\r\n","steep_days":"5","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-06T23:08:06.000-05:00","best_vg":"75%","views":"1076","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Cereal 27","flavor_id":"4163","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Coco' (coconut)","flavor_id":"416","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1750},{"name":"Cream Fresh","flavor_id":"540","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Honeydew","flavor_id":"1492","vendor":"LB","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Honeydew Melon","flavor_id":"4577","vendor":"JF","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Super Sweet","flavor_id":"2384","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":250},{"name":"Sweet Rice","flavor_id":"7727","vendor":"FE","millipercent":4000}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"132318","name":"Honeydew Sticky Rice [inspired by shyndo]"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
