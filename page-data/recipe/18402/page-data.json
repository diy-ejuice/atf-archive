Similar to a banana nut bread or zucchini bread. A fluffy, cake like, cinnamon danish swirl and sugar cookie. Liquid amber and fuji create an applesauce note that adds moistness and richness to the bready notes, this also borrows from the cinnamon danish swirl to spice the applesauce and drive home the authenticity of the style of bakery I tried to achieve. Straw ripe sweetens the entire product as well as making the applesauce pop slightly and adds an interesting back note that is present at a higher temp. To finish the whole thing off I added a yogurt glaze much like a yogurt glazed pretzel thick and sweet yet not overpowering I thought this would be the perfect finish and pair well with the sharper notes of the fuji.
