As expected it helps here a lot to make this profile shine. \r\n\r\nYou don't have to be a ginger ninja to mix this nor enjoy it. \r\nAll you have to do is let it steep for 3-5 days, enjoy :) \r\n\r\nI enjoy this at 60W on a Single 0.15 ohm SST coil on a Recurve RDA.\r\n\r\nI hope you enjoy this just as much as I enjoyed creating this recipe, but let me know what you thought in the comments below.\r\n\r\nSeriously if you like a solid recipe that works give it a go!\r\n\r\nCheers for reading this far, now go and get mixing!\r\n\r\n\"Together, Let's Discover!!!\"\r\n\r\nFacebook - https://www.facebook.com/groups/diydownunder/\r\nDiscord - https://discord.gg/kH4Fqbc\r\nYoutube - https://www.youtube.com/c/diydownunder\r\nWebsite - https://www.diydownunder.com/\r\nInstagram IGTV : @diydownunder\r\nhttps://i.imgur.com/3dVds50.jpg","steep_days":"5","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-05T11:06:53.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"932","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Buttercream Frosting SC","flavor_id":"8361","vendor":"WF","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Ginger Snap","flavor_id":"2594","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":250},{"name":"Gingerbread","flavor_id":"58","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Graham Cracker","flavor_id":"62","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Powdered Sugar","flavor_id":"6522","vendor":"OOO","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Super Sweet","flavor_id":"2384","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":500}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"173130","name":"Ginger Ninja"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
