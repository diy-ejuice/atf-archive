A great vape to compliment your cup of coffee in the AM, something to kick that sweet tooth in the afternoon and nice way to cut out dessert in the evening.... For dayz!!\r\n\r\nGive it at least a week, better after two, if you can make it last a month you wont have to stuff your face with a box of a dozen glazed donuts,.. until your bottle is gone, then just mix up some more!
