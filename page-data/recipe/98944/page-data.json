This is exactly what I get and enjoy with my version here. I will go a step further and say this is \"Yummy AF\". The sugary note and sweetness from the OOO Powdered sugar and VT golden Syrup to the squeezed Lemon coming together from Caps Juicy Lemon & FE Lemon with the pancake effect by bringing WF Crepe & FA Zepolla together provides all together a simply gorgeous vape. The mouthfeel is authentic as those sprinkles of sugar work over your tongue with a little lemon juiciness while you get the pancake underneath. It's just a lovely vape that would go well while sipping on your favorite cuppa I think. Enjoy! \r\n","steep_days":"3","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-11-28T23:36:43.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"1958","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Crepe SC","flavor_id":"8365","vendor":"WF","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Zeppola","flavor_id":"6312","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Lemon","flavor_id":"1655","vendor":"FE","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Juicy Lemon","flavor_id":"79","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Powdered Sugar","flavor_id":"6522","vendor":"OOO","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Golden Syrup","flavor_id":"8887","vendor":"VT","millipercent":1000}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"98944","name":"Squeeze My Hot Cakes"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
