Check out his **[Tenacious T](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/87595#tenacious_t_live_mixing_02_09_by_skiddlzninja)** recipe. It was the inspiration for this though I haven't tried it yet; I just wanted to try a simpler mix of papaya and tea first. When I saw Tenacious T, the combination of TFA's Sweet Tea and Papaya looked like a stroke of genius, just imagining the way they'd taste together. But possibly a mild challenge to pull off, since one of those is a brutal bully that can easily get way too funky and the other is a shrinking violet. This is just a simple recipe that celebrates that combination.  \r\n\r\nI'm surprised there aren't more recipes using **TFA Sweet Tea** out there. Is my taster broken? As best I can tell, it does a fine job of emulating that sort of fast food drive thru sweet tea flavor. The only problem is that it's ridiculously weak in more ways than one. First, it takes about 6 or 7% of it to taste like much of anything at all. I could easily see needing 15% in a recipe. But at TFA prices, I'm not terribly worried about that. A bigger problem is that it can easily get almost completely obliterated in a mix. \"I know I put a ton of Sweet Tea in here, where'd it go?\" Accoutrements must be added carefully .\r\n\r\n**TFA Papaya** is the opposite, much stronger in concentration than most TFA flavors and prone to pushing other flavors around. And getting violently FUNKY. Just like a real, ripe, papaya. Careful not to spill it on anything. Papaya for weeks if you do. Starting at 1% and working up 0.1% at a time until it's too much, then backing down, is my approach to taming this beast. Even at 1.4% it mostly overpowers the tea, but so would putting papaya syrup in a tea unless it's a hearty brew. \r\n\r\n**FA Apricot** does a fantastic job of propping up the Papaya fruitiness without increasing the funk or calling too much attention to itself. **FA Pear/INW Cactus** 0.25% each just a touch of sweet and wet juicy goodness, but not too much of either. \r\n\r\n**Optional**: Add **Sweetener** and/or **Coolant** to taste. I've been enjoying this with 0.25% **FW Sweetener** but I live in the southern USA where sweet tea is SWEET. Speaking of the South, **WS-23.** It's so hot and I needed another cool, refreshing recipe. I like it with this at 0.75% as an \"over ice\" type versus \"frozen solid\" amount of coolant, but coolant tolerance varies from one person to the next. \r\n\r\nGive a mix and let me know what you think **Or better yet,** use a ludicrous-looking amount of TFA Sweet Tea and relatively small dose of your fruit of choice and make your own fruity sweet ice tea to help get you though the rest of summer.

This is an excellently balanced vape. I originally thought I had FA papaya and only after i went to go remix this did I realize I had mixed it up as is. (What a difference one T makes.) Mix at least 30 of this. You will finish this easily."},{"user":"Marnu","text":"Oh wow, this is incredibly good! Very papaya forward, underpinned with a great tea. Without any astringency from the tea or a bad funk from the papaya. &#xD;\nA delicious and unique recipe. &#xD;\nGood job @ID10-T"},{"user":"AlfredPudding","text":"The fact that you can find the sweet tea flavor in the same bottle as papaya deserves a 5 star review alone. There is much more going on here though. As the description says, the apricot does a fantastic job of bringing out the fruit without adding any more papaya to bully the sweet tea. I will say that I can still find the cactus in the profile, but it is definitely not a hindrance. The cactus adds something to both the papaya and the sweet tea notes that I think is essential in making this a complete recipe. The addition of WS-23 adds a nice ice characteristic without being overpowering or unpleasant.  If anything I would say you can add more sweetener to this recipe, because if you've ever been to a southern fast food drive-through on a good day, you'll know the level of sweetness that can be achieved in a drink. I was obligated to try Tenacious T before leaving this review because SkiddlzNinja did it first, and this is definitely the recipe you should go with if you want a papaya sweet tea.
