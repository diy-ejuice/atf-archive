Mouthfeel is full and a rich vanilla custard is the initial flavor with the vanilla sweetened strawberry on the exhale and a tasty treat when you open your mouth and let it breathe. This needs a 2-5 day steep. When it turns a rich rose color it is ready. Lovely CAP Vanilla custard for that rich base and FA Red Touch to give it a nice strawberrylicious balance. This is another of my ADV's. Easy and delicious, but it needs the steep!","steep_days":"5","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-06T20:44:25.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"2051","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Vanilla Custard","flavor_id":"131","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Red Touch (strawberry)","flavor_id":"421","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000}],"reviews":[{"user":"LaJuanaPipa","text":"There are no flavors posted .&#xD;\nPlease update it"}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"127051","name":"Rip Van Twinkle"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
