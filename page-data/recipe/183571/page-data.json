There was one original recipe I remember vaping when I first started DIY, so I decided to take that and work from there - considering even the author said it could definitely be worked on more. This is one of my more complex recipes especially for a Pod / MTL setup. SnV Certified\r\n\r\nTested on a Cthulu 1928 & Smoant Pasito, 2.5mm 6 wraps Round Wire SS @ 15w. 25mg/mL Nicotine Content\r\n\r\n#####**Notes**\r\n**OSD Blue Raspberry Slush & LB Blue Raspberry** - OSD Blue Raspberry slush came from the original recipe I built from. It's a pretty damn good blue raspberry flavour, and I highly recommend anyone who loves blue raspberry to get it. I did think it needed a bit of support though, especially in lower power devices, so thats where LB Blue Raspberry comes in. These two together make a really nice and sweet Blue Raspberry taste that is pretty upfront, and OSD Blue Raspberry Slush also somewhat brings in the slush mouthfeel.\r\n\r\n**INW Raspberry WG & INW Lemon Mix** - Foment has always commented on how INW Raspberry WG really brightens and ties together OSD Blue Raspberry slush. That is the main point of being here, it also brings in a bit more sweetness that was definitely needed. I also added in a bit of INW Lemon Mix considering it was in the previous recipe (but using Lemon sicily which just faded too quickly) and I found without it, there was a slight citrus tone missing that really made things feel like an artificial blue raspberry. \r\n\r\n**CAP Hibiscus** - I stole this idea from @Apexified. He used it in his Blue Frost recipe and I was hooked from there. CAP Hibiscus at this % really brings in a sticky and sweet mouthfeel that just really makes things stick in your mouth even after vaping. This is perfect for representing a slushy for obvious reasons, and works very well even in a pod / MTL setup.\r\n\r\n**WS-23** - Slushies needs to be cold obviously! You can adjust the % of this if you want, but I found 1% in my pasito / cthulu was enough for me. \r\n\r\nHope you enjoy!

The combination of my two favorite blues together blends well! The lemon mix is just enough to almost give the tart feel on the tongue without turning it into a blue lemonade liquid!
