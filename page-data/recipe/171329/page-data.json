Freshly mixed, the recipe vapes a bit harsh for my taste.\r\nI use this recipe mostly in an MTL DotAio Setup.\r\nIt's just a simple tropical vape without overpowering your sense of smell for a long time","steep_days":"3","temperature":"0","recipe_score":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-10T14:53:27.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"613","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Cherimoya","flavor_id":"4434","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Wild Melon","flavor_id":"619","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":300},{"name":"Yellow Passion","flavor_id":"9367","vendor":"VT","millipercent":300},{"name":"Snake Fruit","flavor_id":"8969","vendor":"VT","millipercent":300},{"name":"Quince","flavor_id":"264","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":600},{"name":"Super Sweet","flavor_id":"2384","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":500}],"reviews":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"171329","name":"Cherimoya Melange"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
