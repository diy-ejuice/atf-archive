Freshly mixed, the recipe vapes a bit harsh for my taste.\r\nI use this recipe mostly in an MTL DotAio Setup.\r\nIt's just a simple tropical vape without overpowering your sense of smell for a long time","steep_days":"3","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-01T07:52:26.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"604","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Cherimoya","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Wild Melon","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":300},{"name":"Yellow Passion","vendor":"VT","millipercent":300},{"name":"Snake Fruit","vendor":"VT","millipercent":300},{"name":"Quince","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":600},{"name":"Super Sweet","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":500}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"171329","name":"Cherimoya Melange"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
