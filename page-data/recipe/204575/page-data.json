TFA Berry Crunch is packed full of Strawberries and Raspberries. It definitely has that corn element that comes with CaptNCrunch  Cereal. I paired VT Milk Fresh with FA Marshmallow. The marshmallow enhances the VT Milk and gives the dairy a little more body and brightness. CAP Cereal 27 is my go to cereal. What can I say about this flavor? It's Corn Flakes with a touch of butter. It emulates cereal perfectly. The star of the show is FW Wild Berry Cobbler. I know it sounds weird in a cereal recipe but it's perfect. The berries in FW Wild Berry Cobbler mixed with TFA Berry Crunch is a perfect marriage. There's a definite cereal aspect to Wild Berry Cobbler and it's nice and buttery. \r\n\r\nPlease enjoy and share your feedback.","steep_days":"5","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"total_reviews":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-06T20:46:07.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"643","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Berry Crunch","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Cereal 27","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Marshmallow","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Milk Fresh","vendor":"VT","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Wild Berry Cobbler ala Mode","vendor":"FW","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Super Sweet","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":500}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"204575","name":"A Very Berry Cereal"}}}
