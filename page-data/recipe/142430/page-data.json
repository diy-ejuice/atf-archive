The berry flavor is well supported by the vegetal notes provided by ripe, the mouth feel is dense and almost chewy. I mix mine at 65/35 Cos squonk lyfe. \r\n\r\nA sweet candy profile is brought in with sweet strawberry. Cap whipped marshmallow is a great compliment to tfa sweet cream. It’s fantastic right off the shake and doesn’t fade. It changes some, but it only smooths it out. \r\n\r\nEnjoy.
