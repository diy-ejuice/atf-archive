I remember cherry and blueberry specifically. So I wanted to create that idea of a fruity tobacco in a vape. I went blueberry because it can be sticky and sweet and yet have a darkness and richness that would be enhanced with the tobacco. This is really one of my first start to finish recipes building on each flavor. I also worked in layers to source out the combinations that worked. You will get a deep dark blueberry on the inhale and main note, riding on a body of RY4 and custard with a nice tobacco finish. \r\n\r\nThe first experiment was the RY4C (Ruyan Caramel Custard Tobacco) I mixed Holy Holy V1 (and V2 - both work if you don't have any OG left) and Ruyan Custard and was blown away by how well these two play off each other. That layer by itself is a great vape. They create a really well balanced Tobacco, graham, caramel custard. It is dark and yet kind of dreamy to vape and linger in the sinuses.\r\n\r\nNext was the Blueberry Juicy and Gummy Candy - I remember Wayne or Noted - somewhere that Blueberry Juicy was a decent stand alone blueberry... but when I tested it... it was juice but not really \"sticky\" enough, so I added the Gummy Candy and really love how they play off each other. It has a great richness that plays well with the above base layer.\r\n\r\nLastly, I have been using FLV sweetness a lot lately - but I also made batches with Super Sweet and no sweetener. It really needs the sweetener to pull back the tartness of the berry and also it helps the overall quality of the texture. I actually prefer the Sweetness over the SS in this recipe as it supported the flavor better in the steep.\r\n\r\nBuilt on a Hadaly with Ni80 Fused Clapton - Dual 26ga / 40 wrap @3mm - at .30 / 45 watts.","steep_days":"5","temperature":"0","recipe_score":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-10T19:01:50.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"534","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Blueberry Gummy Candy SC","flavor_id":"10405","vendor":"WF","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Blueberry Juicy Ripe","flavor_id":"10437","vendor":"FA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"HOLY HOLY GRAIL RY4","flavor_id":"5037","vendor":"DFS","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Sweetness","flavor_id":"4413","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":500},{"name":"Vanilla Ruyan Custard","flavor_id":"6066","vendor":"WF","millipercent":3000}],"reviews":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"201654","name":"Blue Ballz (Blueberry RY4C)"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
