Then Shyndo gave me the idea to try out apple here: \r\nhttps://alltheflavors.com/recipes/38862#d_cream_by_shyndo\r\n\r\nComes out to a really nice BlueBerry Ice Cream with the nice sweet/tart kick of apple.

Thankyou so much for sharing. Ive now found my new adv after having the same one for a year as nothing else came close to beating it. And you've inspired me to experiment with blueberry a bit more!! Oh and this was only after a 24 steep so i cant wait to see how it develops!"},{"user":"Thadentman","text":"This recipe is really good, for me it's more of a bubblegum ice cream but who cares? Very tasty vape!"}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"42954","name":"Blapplebean Ice Cream"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
