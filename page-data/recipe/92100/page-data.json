This was pleasantly different!!  It's a soft light citrus with a full mouth feel of wonderful flavor!  It's great as shake n vape!  My Son who is very picky and normally buys vape shop juice loved it!! He had to have a bottle and actually filled his tank n vaped it over his new store bought bottle.  \r\nI will be steeping a bottle just to see how it develops, and get back here to update.  \r\nHave a happy vape day today!! May all your juice be amazing!!!\r\nDay 2-this is really fantastic!  Very bright with a creamy light lemon tartness.  Not tart like a sweet tart, tart.  If light lemon cream ice cream could be sherbet.  This would be the flavor.  I hope you enjoy it as much as i do.","steep_days":"3 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"total_reviews":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:50:01.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"1475","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Cream","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Fizzy Sherbet","vendor":"VT","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Lemonade","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Marshmallow","vendor":"PUR","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Orange Cream","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Raspberry (sweet)","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Vanilla Ice Cream","vendor":"LB","millipercent":3500}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"92100","name":"Babys Breath  "}}}
