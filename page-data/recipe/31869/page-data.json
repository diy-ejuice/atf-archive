Which is a shame, because there seems, as best I can tell, to be a fantastic donut underneath an unfortunately floral berry. I would like to try this again with either the raspberry reduced or removed and replaced with something else, or the huckleberry and raspberry both reduced to let the bakery aspect shine through more.
