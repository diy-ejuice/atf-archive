It's a subtle change, but definitely gives you that classic bubble gum taste accompanied by the fruits. I was going to drop down the Bubble Gum to 1.5 as it's strong shake and vape, but after around 3-4 days the flavor seems to fall off and take it's place in the mix. Not too far off from the original, just more of a bubble gum take on it.","steep_days":"4 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"total_reviews":1,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:49:11.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"3856","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Fuji","vendor":"FA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Red Touch (strawberry)","vendor":"FA","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Red Summer (watermelon)","vendor":"FA","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Bubble Gum (yc)","vendor":"INW","millipercent":2000}],"reviews":[{"user":"ID10-T","score":"5","text":"This is awesome! It turns Strap-on into a tasty chewy fruity bubble gum and I love it. This is a recipe I could easily see myself coming back to.I don't have any constructive criticism because I wouldn't change a thing here. I do have some curiosity about ways it could be played with, though. What if something like 5% VBIC and 1% Cream Fresh were added? Would it taste like one of those ice cream truck fruity ice cream treats shaped after cartoon characters, complete with gummy eyeballs? Are ice cream truck ice cream treats with gummy eyeballs something that would be fun to vape? If you wanted to sell drugs and/or kidnap children, would an ice cream truck be a great cover?"}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"35867","name":"Blow my Strap-On"}}}
