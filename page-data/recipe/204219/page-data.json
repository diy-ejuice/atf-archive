In a custard?\r\nYou’re god damn right...\r\nThis is perfect, it’s thick, buttery and the citrus from the passionfruit cuts through all of that to give a nice tangy but deep, smooth vape. \r\n\r\nThere was something itching my brain whilst vaping this, I couldn’t pin point where I tasted this certain combination before, then it clicked... Solero ice cream! Now this isn’t a solero recipe but it will tickle that part of your brain.\r\n\r\nThis is just a good combination of custard (and sugar cookie 😏) that will surely satisfy you, wether you’re a fruit fanatic or a custard cunt this will probably scratch that itch for you (ok that‘s enough of the itchy scratchy adjectives) \r\n\r\nIf you’re sensitive to CAP V1 then give this 2 weeks, which is where it really excels but I’d be lying to you if I told you I didn’t cain this off the shake, infact I had to make another 30ml just for it to reach that 2 week mark. \r\n\r\nMix it, shake it, vape it.\r\n\r\nSweetener: optional \r\nSugar cookie: not optional\r\n\r\nIf you like this recipe and what I do then rate and review accordingly or I’ll tell you the ending to Netflix’s/BBC’s “The fall”","steep_days":"14 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":4,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:51:43.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"1477","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Yellow Passion","vendor":"VT","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Legendary Custard","vendor":"MB","millipercent":5000},{"name":"Custard Premium","vendor":"FA","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Vanilla Custard","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":4500},{"name":"Sugar Cookie","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Super Sweet","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":500}],"reviews":[{"user":"BRDZ","text":"This is a nice custard base with the passionfruit bringing in a little extra something to the mix. I find the passionfruit present but a little subtle in a good way as it doesnt take anything away from the custard. Seems to feel quite saturated, not in a wicking kind of way but in the mouthfeel. Very nice vape, might remix and increase the passionfruit slightly and see how it goes. &#xD;\nThanks Nick 👊"}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"204219","name":"Passionate Custard"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
