It's just a very sweet candied artificial grape, which is what i was going for.\r\n\r\nThen the bubblegum... Another pain in arse. Bubble gum concentrates are generally very dry and powdery, so a gain just the one wasn't enough. Fw jawbreaker really helps bring it all together.\r\n\r\nI can't recommend or vouch for any substitutions in this recipe, as I've probably tried them all anyway. \r\n\r\nIf you like any kind of bubble gum, especially grape. You'll love this.
