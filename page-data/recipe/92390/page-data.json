But yeah how can one go wrong with these ingredients right?  LOL  I put in country apple for a more baked apple flavor and the double apple to make it juicy then put in both tpa and cap custards just for the heck of it really and the tahitian vanilla cream because it is very good and then sugar cookie and biscuit for the crust - the vanilla and cinnamon should make it a bit more sharp I think we'll see.  And the super sweet just to bring the flavors out.","steep_days":"10 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-11-30T21:57:58.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"989","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Country Apple","vendor":"PUR","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Double Apple","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Vanilla Custard","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Vanilla Custard","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1250},{"name":"Tahitian Vanilla Cream","vendor":"WF","millipercent":1250},{"name":"Sugar Cookie","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Biscuit","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":750},{"name":"Cinnamon Ceylon","vendor":"FA","millipercent":250},{"name":"Madagascar (Vanilla Classic)","vendor":"FA","millipercent":250},{"name":"Super Sweet","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":500}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"92390","name":"Juicy apple tart"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
