Off the shake it offers more of a sweet honey vibe yet as it steeps it moves towards more of the crunchie candy bar center vibe. To sell that center to my pallet it needs a little extra something though. Then boom it came to me like bolt of lightning, Cap Cereal 27 kinda has a slight honey aroma while also providing a pleasant texture. My intuition and experience using this flavor in various applications over the last few years paid off as this worked out to be on point for what was needed here. The only concern was which chocolate combo was I going to be able to 1. avoid a dry vape & 2. not mute over the honeycomb. The combination of Molinberry Glamour Chocolate &  VTA Dark Choc kissed with a touch of sweetener works well here to coat the honey comb and really assists to offer the help needed I was after. \r\n\r\nIt's simple, it's not to sweet, it's balanced, it offers authentic mouthfeel but only better I think. A profile like this would normally be a sometimes dessert vape but this is easily all day vapable. \r\nThis is the Bomb!\r\nThe Honeycomb Bomb!\r\nEnjoy!\r\n\r\nLet me know your thoughts and most of all just enjoy mixing!!\r\n\r\n\"Together, Let's Discover!!!\"\r\n\r\nFacebook - https://www.facebook.com/groups/diydownunder/\r\nDiscord - https://discord.gg/kH4Fqbc\r\nYoutube - https://www.youtube.com/c/diydownunder\r\nWebsite - https://www.diydownunder.com/\r\nInstagram IGTV : @diydownunder\r\n\r\nI enjoyed this at 65W on a WOTOFO Recurve RDA \r\n\r\nMinimum Steep 3 days, best after 5 days yet shake and vapable.\r\n","steep_days":"5","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"total_reviews":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T17:35:37.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"3175","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Honeycomb","vendor":"VT","millipercent":3500},{"name":"Cereal 27","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Glamour Chocolate","vendor":"MB","millipercent":5000},{"name":"Dark Chocolate","vendor":"VT","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Super Sweet","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":500}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"146582","name":"The Honeycomb Bomb"}}}
