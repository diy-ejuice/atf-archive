I wanted all I could get from the Strawberry Ripe, Then I wanted to lay in Just a Slight note of bananas and a slighter note of chocolate. All done to enhance the Strawberry Ripe note(s) and not break through as side notes. I think you will like it.  As a Further Note:  At the end of day two the chocolate and banana edge their way into the picture and the exhale of this vape becomes the most delicious strawberry. I have the coconut there for 1- the creamier body effect and 2- it helps keep the other three notes independent of each other  so we can taste all three and not an amalgamation or blend of the three.. If you like strawberry I really think you will enjoy this.
