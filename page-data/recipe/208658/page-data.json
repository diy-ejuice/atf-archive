I love FA Raspberry as it is the flavor of one my favorite candies, but I wanted to use it in a supporting role.  Build a more comprehensive flavor.\r\n\r\nRaspberries, the NF Raspberry Syrup at 2% is actually SSA Raspberry Syrup.  My first time using it, and it is fantastic.  I added a little of FA Raspberry to boost the note on the top.  I must say I really love it.\r\n\r\nI added a bit of FA Forest fruit just to deepen the berry.  Give it a little variety and depth.\r\n\r\nThe Gummy bit.  I really like Sour Gummy Candy by WF and have used it quite a bit at this point.  I don't have many gummy candies that don't have a particular fruit profile already in place.  So I may grab another and try it at some point, but for now WF seems to fit the bill.  I added a bit of CAP Strawberry Taffy to give both a taffy mouth feel and to add a bit more contrasting candy red fruit flavor.  I like it for that.\r\n\r\nA bit of Super Sweet pulls things together nicely.  Still a work in progress, but I really like this right off the shake.  Duel coil Kennedy on a stacked mech is how I vape.  So usually starts around 250 Watts.\r\n\r\n","steep_days":"0 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-12T15:41:18.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"285","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Berryl (raspberry)","flavor_id":"412","vendor":"FA","millipercent":750},{"name":"Sour Gummy Candy SC","flavor_id":"9047","vendor":"WF","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Strawberry Taffy","flavor_id":"4164","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Super Sweet","flavor_id":"2384","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":500},{"name":"Forest Fruits","flavor_id":"4890","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Raspberry Syrup","flavor_id":"7121","vendor":"NF","millipercent":2000}],"reviews":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"208658","name":"Raspberry Gummy"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
