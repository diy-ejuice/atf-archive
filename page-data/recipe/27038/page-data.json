Your palate will crave the actual dessert when you get notes of rich custard, burnt sugar/caramel, and a spritz of orange.\r\n\r\nINW Creme Brulee: This ingredient is quite magical. You get a hint of vanilla, a rich custard taste that is sweet, but not overly sweet while also getting this amazing burnt sugar/caramel on top. Typically, I'd keep this ingredient in the 1-2% range in a custard recipe to create some complexity, richness, and to add to the overall custard vibe. It definitely plays well with custards since creme brulee is essentially a custard itself. I wanted this flavor to shine through the CAP Vanilla Custard to distinguish itself from a basic custard so I used it at 3%. Creme Brulee is one of those ingredients that grows on you and keeps you coming back for more due to its complexity and the fact that you can get the sweet custard, rich egginess, and burnt sugar tastes at different levels throughout the vape.\r\n\r\nCAP Vanilla Custard V1: This bad boy bullies me into adding it in almost all my recipes for damn good reasons. It's thick, has a great vanilla, and can mesh with nearly anything as long as you know how to use it. At 3.5% I use it as more than just an ingredient to give body to a recipe. It's here to to carry INW Creme Brulee to victory on its highly praised foundation. I needed a bit more of a custard base to complete the creme brulee vibe.\r\n\r\nFW Blood Orange: Now, this is the difficult part of the recipe. However, taking a big risk can lead to a great reward. On the other hand, the risk you take can ultimately lead to failure. I needed an orange to take this recipe from \"meh just another custard\" to \"damn this is an original idea that can be built upon and taken to new levels\". I wanted the orange to be present, but not to take over the entire profile. This ingredient is extremely difficult to fine tune and dances on the line of taking over and being an accent to others. My selection of FW Blood Orange at 2% adds just enough orange to freshen this recipe up and take it to another level. This flavor is almost a quintessential representation of an actual orange in vape form. It has that sweet, fresh, and juiciness that one would expect from an orange along with this ever so slight rind taste. To me, 2% of this flavor in my recipe portrays what you would get if you blended in the juices of a fresh squeezed orange along with the custard ingredients used in creme brulee. The slight rind taste really reminded me of a dessert garnished with orange slices.","steep_days":"10","temperature":"0","recipe_score":4,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:49:00.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"5995","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Creme Brulee (yc)","vendor":"INW","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Blood Orange","vendor":"FW","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Vanilla Custard","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":3500}],"reviews":[{"user":"iDad","text":"The perfect combination between custard and orange - definitely one of my regular rotations."},{"user":"gamebeatter","text":"Had INW creme Brulee sitting around thinking I was going to create something with it or use it as a stand alone, but then one day during the DIYorDie mixing competition I saw this recipe my jaw hit the floor and I ran to go make a 30ml... drained that in a couple days and instantly made a 120ml and this is always in my rotation.
