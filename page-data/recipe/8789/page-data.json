The sweetener can easily be omitted, and the strawberries can be subbed and miss matched all you want. Shisha strawberry has to stay to get that candy/jam like flavor going. Dragonfruit adds a touch of sour or citrus flavor to give the strawberries a little somethin' somethin'.

Excellent recipe. "},{"user":"Untitled","score":"5","text":"Good one."},{"user":"BuryMeInSmoke","score":"5","text":"My favourite strawberry vape.  Definitely in the top 5 recipes that I've ever mixed.  Needs a couple of days for the CAP Sweet Strawberry to chill out but it's amazing after that.  Reminds me of when you put icing sugar over fresh strawberries and let it sit overnight in the fridge to get those sweet syrupy strawberries.  Creams sit quite far in the back and just give it some body and hold it together.  I've been meaning to try switching up the strawberries like mentioned in the blurb but honestly, this is so good I doubt changing it up would make it any better."},{"user":"HerrHut","score":"5","text":"Absolutely delicious!
