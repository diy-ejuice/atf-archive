Thank you SubstanceD for the reference food :) \r\n\r\nCAP Chocolate Fudge Brownie makes up the majority of the chocolate outside cookies of the fudge round. It is a very potent flavor so .5% is a good amount to use and still have it be the main profile.\r\n\r\nFlv Frosting/Fa Meringue/Bavarian Cream/FW Double Dutch Chocolate - these flavors make up the chocolate icing in the middle of the two chocolate cookies.\r\n\r\nFlv Cookie Dough/CAP Funnel Cake are used to add a bit of processed flavor. Without them in this mix it seemed too gourmet tasting, it was good but not what I was going for. \r\n\r\nFA Meringue/Cap Super Sweet are used to sweeten up the entire mix since these snack cakes are full of sugar.","steep_days":"7","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T23:35:33.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"7101","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Bavarian Cream","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Chocolate Fudge Brownie","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":500},{"name":"Cookie Dough","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":350},{"name":"Double Dutch Chocolate","vendor":"FW","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Frosting","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Funnel Cake","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":250},{"name":"Meringue","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Super Sweet","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":500}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"40216","name":"Fudge Round"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
