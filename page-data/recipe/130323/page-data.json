Or just leave it out if that's not your thing. \r\n\r\nFLV Rich cinnamon, there are a number of cinnamons that could work here, FLV fire cinnamon is next on my list to try, I think it just might fit the profile better. If cinnamon is not your thing, nutmeg, cardamom, Ginger, and clove should all provide a nice contrast to the recipe.\r\n\r\nFLV cream- 000 creamy milky undertones \r\n\r\n","steep_days":"3 (SNV)","temperature":"420","recipe_score":5,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:50:36.000-05:00","best_vg":"69%","views":"3625","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Wild Melon","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Vanilla Swirl","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":8000},{"name":"Cream","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Super Sweet","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":250},{"name":"Peach","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Rich Cinnamon","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":250}],"reviews":[{"user":"RainbowDragon","text":"I found this to be fantastic.
