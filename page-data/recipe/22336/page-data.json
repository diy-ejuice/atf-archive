Everything else though, if you can include it, or can get hold of it on order it's worth it.\r\n\r\nCan be a shake and vape, but this recipe only gets better with time, I left a bottle for 3 weeks and it was in my own inflated opinion truly awesome. It develops into a golden beauty of a specimen.\r\n\r\nFA Meringue / FA Caramel - This combo helps give that caramelized/frosted flaked taste and helps boost the sweetness in the apple a little. The Meringue is higher than traditional usage but at high percentages helps give a sweet subtle dairy note.\r\n\r\nFA Cream Fresh / TPA Dairy Milk - This is the milky cream note, it's not swimming in milk but it's all softened by it, it fills in the gaps of this overall profile.\r\n\r\nFA Fuji / CAP Cinnamon Danish Swirl-  FA Fuji speaks for its self, one of the best apples around and helps give that apple juice taste in your mouth, then you've taken a scoop of cereal and omnomnomnom. Cinnamon Danish just adds a little extra richness to the flake glaze and a bit of traditional spicing to the apple, just a hint though.\r\n\r\nCAP Cereal 27 - In my opinion, this is the KING of the cereal concentrates, tastes exactly like it is supposed to. It's a corn flake. \r\n\r\nCAP Super Sweet - If you don't have it, aim for about 1,3-1.5% Sucralose as super sweet is double strength so better bang for your buck.\r\n\r\nIf you mix this and you like it please rate / review it.","steep_days":"14 (SNV)","temperature":"450","recipe_score":5,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:48:55.000-05:00","best_vg":"80%","views":"11261","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Cereal 27","flavor_id":"4163","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Cinnamon Danish Swirl","flavor_id":"35","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":500},{"name":"Cream Fresh","flavor_id":"540","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1250},{"name":"Dairy/Milk","flavor_id":"2164","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":750},{"name":"Carmel (caramel)","flavor_id":"503","vendor":"FA","millipercent":750},{"name":"Fuji","flavor_id":"506","vendor":"FA","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Meringue","flavor_id":"530","vendor":"FA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Super Sweet","flavor_id":"2384","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":750}],"reviews":[{"user":"WhatTheFront","text":"My new ADV.
