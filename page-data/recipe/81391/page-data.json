(Starbucks' style)\r\nThis is how I like my coffee, not too strong, with a little milk, sugar and caramel. \r\nEven adding some drops of my flavor concentrates to my every morning coffee, duh.\r\nThis Koffie Karamel you can shake and vape but will even get better after a few days... The caramel gets more forward.\r\nAdd Sweetener - Super Sweet to your preference, albeit a bit sweet as is.\r\nI'm using a handmade slow vortexer (about 2 hours does the trick here) and heat it up to 45°C (113°F).\r\nIf you haven't got Kawa by Inawera, get it, you will not regret it.\r\n\r\nBavarian Cream (TPA) 1%\r\nButterscotch Ripple (FW) 0.5%\r\nCaramel (FA) 0.75%\r\nCaramel (Original) (TPA) 1.25%\r\nCoconut (FA) 0.75%\r\nCoffee Kawa (INAWERA) 1.25%\r\nCream Fresh (FA) 1.5%\r\nFrench Vanilla (CAP) 1%\r\nMeringue (FA) 1%\r\nRY4 Double (TPA) 0.5%\r\nVanilla Shisha (INAWERA) 1.5%\r\n(Super Sweet (CAP) 0.5%)\r\n\r\nEnjoy enjoy,\r\nScrewdriver","steep_days":"7 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"total_reviews":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T02:15:55.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"722","recipe_flavors":[],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"81391","name":" Koffie Karamel"}}}
