I thought I’d switch it up a bit! \r\n\r\nFW Hazelnut does amazing things to the strawberry. It really ripens and deepens it (there is no actual hazelnut flavour). \r\n\r\nIt needs 5 days steep minimum. At 4 days or less the hazelnut is still evident. \r\n\r\nI’d really appreciate any feedback. Thanks!","steep_days":"5","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"total_reviews":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T10:44:53.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"1001","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Ripe Strawberries","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Sweet Strawberry","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Hazelnut","vendor":"FW","millipercent":600},{"name":"Bavarian Cream","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Vanilla Custard Cheesecake","vendor":"OOO","millipercent":500},{"name":"French Vanilla Deluxe","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Super Sweet","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":400}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"195321","name":"Strawberry Cream"}}}
