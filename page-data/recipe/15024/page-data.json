Their website describes their eliquid as \"That down home southern style banana pudding with vanilla wafers.\" She liked it so much I had to buy a bottle to give it a go and really liked it. Decided to attempt a remix of it.\r\n\r\nI got inspiration for this, especially the banana portion from Vurve's recipe\r\nhttps://alltheflavors.com/recipes/3428#vanilla_wafer_banana_pudding_by_vurve\r\n\r\nBanana \r\nWhen I started with this I didn't have any banana flavors at all so I started with tfa banana ripe, tfa banana cream, and la banana cream. After flavor testing I couldn't stand the ripe and knew it wasn't in there. The percentages I used  blend to a good combo but definitely needed some more cream to subdue the runty flavor.\r\n\r\nPudding\r\nObviously stole the cream from the banana creams. Added the tfa vanilla custard to thicken up the cream and add a bit of spices. Also stole the cream from the vanilla swirl here.\r\n\r\nVanilla Wafer \r\nI knew from the beginning CAP Sugar Cookie had to be in here. Had to beef up the sugar cookie to keep it from hiding behind the bananas thus the 5.5%. Also used the vanilla from both the VC and vanilla swirl to round out wafer.\r\n\r\nI know it's not spot on but I wasn't going for a 1:1 and I actually like this version a lot more. This works after 5 days but really comes together at the 2 week mark.","steep_days":"14","temperature":"0","recipe_score":4,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:48:49.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"2449","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Banana Cream","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Banana Cream","vendor":"LA","millipercent":4500},{"name":"Vanilla Custard","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Vanilla Swirl","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Sugar Cookie","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":5500}],"reviews":[{"user":"billyphase","text":"FYI get crazy muting with this recipe.
