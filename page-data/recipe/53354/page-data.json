Smooth and tasty, Light flavorful not overbearing. The Blood orange sits on top of nice mellow and sweet. The Butterscotch Ripple adds in a bit of mellow sweetness. The Marshmallow and Meringue adds to the middle with a creamy smooth, fluffy candy like flavor. The Vanilla Swirl fills out the bottom. When I remix this i think the Vanilla Swirl could use a bump of a 1/2% to give just a bit more body. Did't try a shake and vape with this pretty sure it would be acceptable. Sat in the drawer for 15 days before I broke it out and vaped it. Pretty tasty but I will try it with another 1/2% of Vanilla swirl or French Vanilla for that extra richness I think this needs. Give this one a whirl, I think you will enjoy it.
