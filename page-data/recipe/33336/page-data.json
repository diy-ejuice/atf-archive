My. \r\nThis mix was for lack of better words \r\nA happy accident.. you dont know what velvety is until you taste this after a 10 day steep. I know this seems super simple. Well it is. But my goodness is it good. \r\nBase.. just started with a really simple base\r\nSupporting notes. The strawberry ripe i put in at 2% to really brighten up the black berry. But turns out it just sweetened the black berry and gave it a much more complex flavor. Fuji apple is there because its awesome. Nuff said. \r\n","steep_days":"10 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T03:30:40.000-05:00","best_vg":"80%","views":"1789","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Vanilla Bean Ice Cream","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Vanilla Custard","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":500},{"name":"Blackberry","vendor":"FW","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Strawberry (ripe)","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Bilberry","vendor":"FA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Apple Fuji","vendor":"FA","millipercent":250}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"33336","name":"velvet berry icecream "}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
