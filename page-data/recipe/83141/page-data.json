I am very pleased with how this recipe turned out. I really like this recipe and I hope you do too!!!!There are many types of trifles this one is layered with blueberries, vanilla pudding, whipped cream and pound cake. How can you go wrong??? \r\n\r\nThe blueberry:\r\nI love this blueberry combination I have been developing a few recipes lately and this combination of flavor west blueberry and Flavorah blueberry muffin  is the perfect blueberry for me. I love it.\r\n\r\nThe pudding and whipped cream:\r\nObviously I used Flavorah vanilla pudding for the pudding.  For the whipped cream I used a combination of Bavarian cream by tfa and vanilla cream extra by wonder flavours. The Bavarian cream helps the vanilla pudding a bit as well.\r\n\r\nThe pound cake:\r\nI used Flavorah pound cake and real flavors sc sugar cookie. I will say it again real flavors sugar cookie is awesome with or in any cake. It brings out a fluffy cakey goodness like no other.. If you don't have or haven't used it you should be using it and or getting some.\r\n\r\nSorry for the brief description I have been so busy at work with broken frozen plumbing pipes I can't see straight and I am surprised I wrote anything.😉 I really liked this on day 3 but its slightly better by day 5 but  anyway I really enjoy this and thought you would too. So her it is my blueberry trifle.\r\n\r\nFlavorah sweetness is just my choice of sweetener use whatever brand you prefer or none at all totally your call!!!","steep_days":"5","temperature":"420","recipe_score":4,"updated_at":"2020-12-12T18:29:38.000-05:00","best_vg":"75%","views":"2546","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Blueberry","flavor_id":"1201","vendor":"FW","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Blueberry Muffin","flavor_id":"608","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Pound Cake","flavor_id":"4306","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1250},{"name":"Sugar Cookie – Super Concentrate","flavor_id":"7999","vendor":"RF","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Vanilla Pudding","flavor_id":"4433","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Vanilla Cream Extra SC","flavor_id":"8382","vendor":"WF","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Bavarian Cream","flavor_id":"145","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Sweetness","flavor_id":"4413","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":500}],"reviews":[{"user":"chief63","text":"Pretty tasty mix.
