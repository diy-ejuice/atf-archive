The only area where it falls a hair short for me is that tastes like it almost but doesn't quite escape TFA Lychee's floral tone's tendency to run a bit perfumy. Floral is an essential and wonderful part of lychee but it shouldn't cross the line into perfume. This only mostly avoids that for me., and this profile deserves 100% perfection. I'd love to see it crafted out of a more candy-like lychee flavor, such as FE's. Or barring that, maybe lowering the cactus would clean it up... or maybe it's the cactus doing the cleaning, I don't know. There's some magic going on here for this to be as good as it is despite TFA Lychee's issues.
