The meringue adds fullness and fluffiness, as well as a little sweetness and (to me) a strong toasted note. The Bavarian Cream is richer than just a milk, like Cream Fresh or OOO Milky Under - but I want decadence in this. I use FW Bavarian because I get the pepper notes from the TPA version \r\n\r\nCereal 27/Hazelnut \r\nThese are staples for a cereal base. Cereal 27 is the tastiest cereal in my opinion, and besides the high AP content, no off-notes in there. It's a generic cereal, but definitely a darker and toasted grain. The Hazelnut brings a rich nutiness that backs the cereal up beautifully.  It also bridges the gap between cereal and creams with its smoothness. \r\n\r\nEM/Super Sweet \r\nEM is my sweetener of choice, but cereals are pretty sugary in general so the \"sugar on top\" sensation that comes from the Super Sweet is useful in this recipe. \r\n\r\n","steep_days":"4","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"total_reviews":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T14:13:16.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"1707","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Meringue","vendor":"FA","millipercent":750},{"name":"Hazelnut","vendor":"FW","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Bavarian Cream","vendor":"FW","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Cereal 27","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1200},{"name":"Ethyl Maltol","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":250},{"name":"Super Sweet","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":250}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"106707","name":"CerealStone "}}}
