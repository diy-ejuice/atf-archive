I like this recipe almost as much as the Dr. Phil &amp; Jesus: A Love Story video. "},{"user":"dougc","text":"This is a great mix, showcasing the perfect pairing of WF Papaya and VT Persian Lime. VT Yogurt Drink is a great flavor, but for me, at 4% it was overpowering the mix, making it harsh and muting the other flavors, even after a 2 week steep. I mixed it again with 1% VT Yogurt Drink and I think it's more balanced, letting the papaya and lime really shine. Thank you Developed, for both a great show and great recipes!"}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"144316","name":"Mega Fruit Smoothie | Developed"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
