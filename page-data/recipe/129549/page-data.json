Well then take your bubbly to the next level and stay home... problem solved!  Not only will your taste buds thank you but you will not have to worry about those pesky police officer's passing out DUI's either!  This is a seriously upgraded glass of bubbly.  Just add some pineapple juice, and coconut rum then voila!  It is just that easy!  This is a creamy, sweet, coconut champagne spritzer with hints of rum and pineapple.  It is like a vacation in a glass... err vape!  \r\n\r\n***If you want more fizz in your bubbly you can add 1-2%  of RF-Soda Base as well (depending on how fizzy you would like it) although you may want to omit the sweetener if you do.***\r\n\r\nPhoto and inspiration:  https://www.pineappleandcoconut.com/recipes/pineapple-coconut-champagne-cocktail/","steep_days":"3","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-05T19:50:36.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"1158","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Wine Champagne","flavor_id":"457","vendor":"FA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Butter Rum","flavor_id":"925","vendor":"LA","millipercent":400},{"name":"Cream","flavor_id":"604","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":800},{"name":"Coconut Rum SC","flavor_id":"10012","vendor":"WF","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Sugarloaf Pineapple","flavor_id":"8978","vendor":"VT","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Light Rum","flavor_id":"8918","vendor":"VT","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Sweetener","flavor_id":"1432","vendor":"FW","millipercent":400}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"129549","name":"Staycation"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
