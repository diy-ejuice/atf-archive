I already made a batch of this last week, did came out really nice after one week of steeping. On the inhale you will taste this typical sugarwaffle that they make here and on the exhale a nice creamy strawberry icecream. Have fun with trying it out and please give me some feedback.\r\n\r\nWith greetings from belgium   Chefproject","steep_days":"21","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"total_reviews":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-06T12:54:11.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"2402","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Strawberry (ripe)","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Dx Bavarian Cream","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Vanilla Bean Ice Cream","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":3500},{"name":"Carmel (caramel)","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Graham Cracker Clear","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Sweet Strawberry","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Sweet Cream","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":500},{"name":"Super Sweet","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":500},{"name":"Vanilla Custard","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Waffle (belgian)","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Strawberry","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Waffle","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1500}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"19511","name":"Belgium sugar waffle with strawberry icecream"}}}
