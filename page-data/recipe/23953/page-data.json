Also added some AP to bring out the nuttiness of the Butter Pecan and Torrone a bit.\r\nI felt that the mix wasn't sweet enough so added 0.25% sweetener.\r\nI'm happy with where it is now as a shake and vape, Will let it steep for 7 days and come back with my findings\r\n\r\n14/01/2017\r\nI gave the juice 2 weeks to mature as a week wasn't enough.\r\nIt's a rich custard with burnt sugar and bourbon undertones with a noticeable nuttiness on the exhale. The liquid amber carries the bourbon flavour nicely at 0.3%.\r\n\r\nAll in all I'm very pleased with the results. I don't see this as an ADV just because of how heavy and rich it is, but it's a satisfying vape.\r\n\r\n\r\n","steep_days":"14","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:48:57.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"2066","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Butter Pecan","flavor_id":"1212","vendor":"FW","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Creme Brulee (yc)","flavor_id":"894","vendor":"INW","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Kentucky Bourbon","flavor_id":"361","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":3500},{"name":"Liquid Amber","flavor_id":"476","vendor":"FA","millipercent":300},{"name":"Torrone","flavor_id":"550","vendor":"FA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Vanilla Custard","flavor_id":"131","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":6000},{"name":"Sweetener","flavor_id":"339","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":250},{"name":"Acetyl Pyrazine","flavor_id":"1709","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":250}],"reviews":[{"user":"RedHerring","text":"This is definitly an ADV for me when i'm working night shifts!
