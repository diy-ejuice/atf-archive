I used the lavender for the booster like notes that it can provide and it really gives a nice zing to the citrus so it didn't disappear. After that I wanted more citrus without rind so I added the lime, orange and lemon all in small amounts to just help give it a more rounded citrus flavor. The marshmallow vienna combination is used for that nice light creamy like backnote it has and helped tie it together.\r\n\r\nAdd a touch of pomegranate for some extra fun.
