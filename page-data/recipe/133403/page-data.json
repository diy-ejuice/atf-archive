The harvest berry is bright and juicy, and is brilliant aided by the creams it's swathed in. Between the Fresh Cream and the Vanilla Whipped Cream, you get a rich, vibrant sweet cream bed for those berries to lay in. The addition of super sweet is just enough extra to make every aspect pop.&#xD;\n&#xD;\nA simple yet elegant juice that just really shines. Nicely done!"}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"133403","name":"Whipped harvest"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
