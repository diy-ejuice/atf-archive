I do not like cooling.\r\n\r\nI have finished this recipe just when they have discountinued the Red Soda flavour. According to the RF website Red Soda is 60% of Cream Soda and 40% Strawberry.\r\n\r\nTested on NarCA RDA, 42W, 0.3 Ohm, Framed Staple Ni80.\r\n","steep_days":"3 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"total_reviews":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-06T20:45:00.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"1008","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Fizzy Sherbet","vendor":"VT","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Raspberry","vendor":"INW","millipercent":300},{"name":"Red Soda â€“ Super Concentrate","vendor":"RF","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Strawberry","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":3000}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"160345","name":"Red Soda"}}}
