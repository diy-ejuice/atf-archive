The body is provided by the VBIC all the wholesome goodness you need in a milkshake. Malted Milk gives us a solid maltiness where we need it, and fresh cream lends a great dairy booster. Vienna Cream really brings the whole thing together like magic.\r\n\r\nYou can sub FW Hazelnut for the TFA Malted Milk in a pinch at 0.75%. Feel free to add a bit of FLV Rich Cinnamon and/or Koolada if that is your kinda thing.","steep_days":"7","temperature":"0","recipe_score":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-12T01:40:30.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"1124","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Vanilla Bean Ice Cream","flavor_id":"186","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Vienna Cream","flavor_id":"516","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Malted Milk (conc)","flavor_id":"175","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Cream Fresh","flavor_id":"540","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Masala Chai â€“ SC","flavor_id":"7514","vendor":"RF","millipercent":2000}],"reviews":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"41134","name":"Chai Milkshake Brings All the Boys to the Yard"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
