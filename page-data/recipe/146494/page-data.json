For me, childhood summers always meant creamsicle ice cream, and this recipe replicates the flavor perfectly.  Nice cold sensation and creamy orange, with a light tangerine to really bring it out.  It's perfect for summer, and I'm sure I'll always have a bottle ready to go in the warmer weather.  Really a great job. ","score":5},{"user":"Scism","text":"Overall, This has been one of my favorite recipes since I've started mixing.  I've went through bottles of it and it's pretty much spot on.  Not sure if it's vapors tongue or the WS-23, but I tend to get immune to the flavor pretty fast.

After a day of steeping this is incredible, it does a very nice job on blending those sharp citrus notes into a very pleasant ice cream vape. Immediately had to mix a bigger batch, this is going into my rotation!","score":5},{"user":"eyemakepizza","text":"Spot on Orange Dreamsicle. Perfect amount of chill and while fantastic as a S&amp;V, give it a day for the Blood Orange to mellow out and it is absolutely perfect.","score":5}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"146494","name":"Dreamsicle"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
