This vape is smooth. This vape is decadent. These three things ring true. Mix, steep it, vape it, love it, rate it. I hope you enjoy it. \r\n\r\nAfter getting my hands on the necessary flavors to implement the beloved cheesecake trinity, I had an idea about throwing together something involving cereal and cheesecake. A frosted flake infused cheesecake came to mind but what ended up happening was something not entirely different, but something even better. The percentage of cereal 27 used infused the cheesecake base with something more akin to a combination of oats, nuts and honey. It created a luxurious blend that was both rich and decadent. FLV cream made it SUPER creamy, and shisha vanilla enhanced everything by giving it an enriching vanilla kick to create nothing short of what I could describe as a honey and oat cheesecake.

It's actually very enjoyable after only 1-2 days steep but on coming back @ 2-3w this shit is DIVINE and appropriately named as such. I appreciate a recipe that has different flavours present on the inhale, middle and exhale and this one does it beautifully. At the same time the flavours are really well combined and all I can tell you is I pick out different pieces that are all delicious and luxuriously rich and creamy. If you have the flavours mix this up, this is not a cereal vape, it is a dessert vape, I can't explain it, creator explains it well. Really really nice juice well done ðŸ‘Œ"},{"user":"Avsha531","score":"5","text":"This has become one of my top 3 recipes.
