I think it's quite lovely and I recommend 1 drop of saline per 30 ml to make it all pop however I will add further notes on the recipe later as it steeps. (I'think it's gorgeous so far).  \r\n\r\nUpdate: IMO it just just gets better! The flavors have melded together beautifully in this and the cream froth from the top to the lovely dark smooth coffee through the middle is just on point. \r\nAlthough I made this \"on the spot\" it has taught me that there is no substitute for flavor testing and experience when creating a \"great\" e-liquid. A massive props goes to VT (Theo) for bringing these flavors to the market when creating an e-liquid like this prior would be seemingly impossible at this standard. \r\nI will flavor note all the flavors contained here in this recipe individually soon and after you read them will you be able to truly understand why and how I layered these flavorings the way I did and balance them with the right amount of creams as I also brought that authentic salted caramel into the mix as well.  I can only encourage you to freshly wick your RDA before trying this after at least 2-3days to truly appreciate the textures here. Most of all Enjoy :) \r\n\r\nSee it being mixed here: https://youtu.be/kmUJs8YZs6I?t=3421\r\n#DIY Downunder","steep_days":"3","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T20:32:27.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"1831","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Coffee Milk Froth","flavor_id":"8858","vendor":"VT","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Creme Caramel","flavor_id":"8865","vendor":"VT","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Caramel Mocha","flavor_id":"8846","vendor":"VT","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Brown Sugar","flavor_id":"313","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Milk Fresh","flavor_id":"8926","vendor":"VT","millipercent":500},{"name":"Coffee Base","flavor_id":"8856","vendor":"VT","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Saline (0.9%)","flavor_id":"5960","vendor":"OTHR","millipercent":100}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"89479","name":"Coffee on Collins "}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
