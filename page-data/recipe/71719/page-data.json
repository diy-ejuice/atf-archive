It's so thick and creamy and best of all is it has that iconic strength we know INW for along with being good right off the shake without weeks of steeping.\r\n\r\nFLV Coconut is spendy but here, and most every where else, you're going to use drops at a time as it's incredibly strong. Here I used 1d/10ml. It just boosts the creamy and thick pudding base we are after.\r\n\r\nFW Butter Pecan rich and buttery. Has only a slight aftertaste of pecan but it is realistic. This is actually my first time using it and I'm impressed by it.\r\n\r\nThe actual pudding base is worthy of a shake and vape but the pecan needs some time to show it's face so give this 5-7 days before basking in it's glory.\r\n\r\nGive anyone of his pudding mixes a shot; you won't be disappointed!\r\n\r\nhttps://alltheflavors.com/recipes/32622#creamy_vanilla_puddin_by_deejay_mills","steep_days":"5","temperature":"0","recipe_score":4,"total_reviews":1,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:49:41.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"2691","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Custard","vendor":"INW","millipercent":750},{"name":"Vanilla Pudding","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":3500},{"name":"Butter Pecan","vendor":"FW","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Coconut","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":200}],"reviews":[{"user":"Ebc88","score":"4","text":"This has a good taste to it and the taste reminds me of butter pecan pudding.
