FA Vanilla Gelato for the ice cream topping, with white chocolate chips sprinkled on top with a drizzle of butterscotch and maple.   Straight forward.  This is pretty sweet on it's own, but you can easily add a touch of sweetener to taste so that the level of sweetness reflects what you like.  I'm on an anti sugar diet kick right now so I can't do sweet juice for very long, and this is super sweet to me without sweetener.
