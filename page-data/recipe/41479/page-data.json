I started building on this after I tried Cheeba Steeba's excellent recipe Summertime.\r\n\r\n\r\nFLV Pink Guava: The main body of this flavor is FLV Pink Guava. At 1% it comes through more grapefruit than guava.\r\n\r\nFLV Lychee: My earlier versions used this higher but I found it was adding a bit of an astringent back note. Dialed back to .75% it gives the FLV Pink Guava a nice sweet back note, while still letting the Lychee stand out just a little.\r\n\r\nTPA Honeysuckle: 4% here gives a nice, juicy backdrop to support the FLV Guava and FLV Lychee. Earlier versions left this lacking a little at 3-3.5%\r\n\r\nFLV Sweet Coconut: At .25% this gives us a slight candy finish that helps to sweeten and soften the somewhat sharp Lychee and Guava notes.\r\n\r\nFLV Elderflower: A touch of floral elderflower to finish the recipe off. At .25% it doesn't stand out very much, it's just enough to give some depth the the TPA Honeysuckle.

The elderflower is very subtle, but it pairs beautifully with the sweetness of the lychee and honeysuckle. The lychee is at a perfect level here, it can easily become funky when you use it too high, but the funk here is working to its advantage. This is going in to my ADV rotation. Thanks for the great recipe!","score":5},{"user":"BigCloud","text":"It's a great recipe, well ballanced. Didn't think the pink guava and lychee were going to work with honeysuckle at these percentages. I'm pleased with the result. The honeysuckle is still in there. I'm digging the floral notes from the elderflower as well. It's subtle but it's there. For me the pink guava is still pink guava and no grapefruit. But hey, I love it. Great job.","score":5},{"user":"Ebc88","text":"Watched a rerun of the noted floral episode and decided i would try some recipes. This is excellent with only a day steep the floral notes are coming through and that pink guava (grapefruit) is an amazing addition","score":5},{"user":"CheebaSteeba","text":"This is a wonderfully balanced floral recipe and I think one that will be a great introduction to florals for those who don't venture in to that genre often. The main note here is the Pink Guava handling the show with it's bright, citrusy, slightly funky flavor with some lovely floral accents with the sweet elderflower, bright lychee, and subtle honeysuckle, all being complimented by a creamy mild coconut. &#xD;\n&#xD;\nIt's wonderfully refreshing and the floral notes are bright and pleasant and in no way obtrusive or distracting, making for an easy ADV. One of Kopel's greatest skills IMO is balance and this recipe sure as shoot does not disappoint.","score":5},{"user":"jbird","text":"Pink Guava is very upfront for the first few days. Then it mellows just a enough to let the honeysuckle and the elderflower break through. While you still get the upfront pink guava (which is great ), it's followed by the florals. The Sweet Coconut is a very nice addition, that I'm picking up on the exhale. Making this a pretty complex recipe for only 5 flavors. Awesome job! And a perfect vape for the \"Springtime\"!
