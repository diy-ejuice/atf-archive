Personally, I would like the lemon to be a little bit more forward and make a boysenberry lemonade rather than just a bit of lemon behind this melon-forward recipe, but all of these things taste like they belong together. I love Wild Melon but it sometimes gets a teensy bit soapy on me at 2% and higher, depending on what it’s mixed with, and it does here, but I’m not holding it against this recipe because because there are a lot of people who don’t have that issue. I’d like to mix it again with half a percent of the Wild Melon replaced with half of a percent of a more assertive lemon.
