I had to really come out of my comfort zone as i despise apple vapes or I should say despised them. This is my take on something i've never seen but sounds delicious. \r\nCAP- CDS- I used this to do a few things to get my churro just right at this % I get all the cinnamon and sweet with just the right doughy ness.\r\nFA- Nonna's cake- this builds on the authenticity of the churro and at this low of a % it seems to just add to the flavor instead of being a flavor.\r\nTPA- Straw Ripe - One of my Favorite flavors at this % it starts the strawberry and adds more sweetness to the churro\r\nFA- Fuji- adds that hint of apple that i wanted and blends with the cinnamon very well.\r\nCAP- Strawberry Taffy- Finishes the strawberry and adds the chewy sweetness i wanted.\r\nFA- Joy- I have a love hate with joy sometimes its amazing others not so much. This % finishes the Churro and adds a lil more depth to the actual churro\r\nTPA- Bavarian cream- This adds body and weight and kinda bonds everything together.\r\n\r\nFinally either way this goes I had a blast and pushed myself way out of my comfort zone and my other mixes have benefited as well. Hell just today i joined the Best NEW RECIPE club and have had my chest out since..LOL But Thanks guys you are all awesome and a inspiration","steep_days":"5","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"total_reviews":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T22:31:45.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"1229","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Strawberry (ripe)","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Nonna's Cake","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Cinnamon Danish Swirl","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Fuji","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1300},{"name":"Strawberry Taffy","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Joy","vendor":"FA","millipercent":750},{"name":"Bavarian Cream","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2000}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"18243","name":"RED OCTOBER"}}}
