FA Coconut at 2 percent to push the coconut note in the Pur Toasted Coconut Cheesecake (which is an excellent cheesecake). Caps NY Cheesecake and Custard V1 to give some extra body and mouthfeel. Add sweetener to your own preference. i mixed this and tossed it in my steep box but didnt get around to it for 3 weeks. It is very good. If i make any change at all i may push the coconut a tad more. I may order coconut candy or some other sweet coconut for this in the future.\r\n\r\n*Ive edited this recipe a little....i dropped FA Coconut to 1 percent and added 1 percent of TFA Coconut Candy. I love this version better. It tastes so good, its my current ADV.*","steep_days":"16","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-05T06:48:26.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"1264","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Raspberry","vendor":"INW","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Raspberry (sweet)","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Coco' (coconut)","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Toasted Coconut Cheesecake","vendor":"PUR","millipercent":4000},{"name":"New York Cheesecake","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Vanilla Custard","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Super Sweet","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":500},{"name":"Coconut Candy","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1000}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"113330","name":"Raspberry Zinger Cheesecake"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
