This is a great fruit flavor but it can get funky fast. In this recipe I found that when paired with Flavorah mango and a touch of Inawera cactus it turns into its own fruit flavor. The flavor it turns into is sweet and juicy. In my opinion this delicious fruit combination just belongs in a yogurt. I love fresh fruit yogurt for breakfast and this flavor is a great example of just that a fruity yogurt. I made my yogurt with a combination of Capella creamy yogurt and Greek yogurt by Flavorah and a touch of cream by Flavorah. The last ingredient is Flavorah marshmallow I added this for a little sweetness and a little mouth feel I feel it thickens up the texture just enough. I enjoy this recipe almost immediately but I am sure its not at its best until after 3 days giving the yogurts and cream time to blend together.
