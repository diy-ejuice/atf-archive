It's pretty much all I vape.  This recipe here is fucking delicious and only steeped for a week..  Smooth, thick, creamy and full of flavor.  I have about 20 different custard recipes in 15ml bottles.  Some I finish off, some I give away.  Some find a bigger bottle to live in if its really good. I don't know if it's The Game Changer (its definately Top Shelf), but I do know that there will be a dedicated 120ml bottle of this stuff around for the forseeable future.  You're on a roll here @furiousmixer.  &#xD;\n**Note:  I had to sub FW Graham Cracker for the FLV.******* Edit - 11.03.19. This has taken over as my go to custard.  I find myself polishing off bottles and just here giving credit and respect where it's due.  Being a custard snob, this is a rare feat indeed.
