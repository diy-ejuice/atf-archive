If you were looking to mix a samoa, this is literally it, except with ice cream. Eat one and vape it, it'll keep you up at night...great job as always guys!","score":5},{"user":"Vape2Live38","text":"Excellent ADV! After a 7 day steep, this is one of the best recipes I've tried. a very accurate shortbread cookie with texture. I really don't get a seperate layer of a chocolate drizzle or coating, the chocolate feels more incorporated into the cookie layer, making this more like a chocolate shortbread cookie . The ice cream layer is a fantastic ice cream made with vanilla coconut milk and swirls of toffee, very thick 'n creamy. This could easily be added to the Legacy line of one shots. On my 2nd 60ml  and realizing I should've made a 120ml. ","score":5},{"user":"kitu5","text":"This one is something else. The shortbread, cookie bite, and butter base make for delicious buttery shortbread cookies. The Bounty adds in the chocolate and coconut. The simple genius move of adding in the toffee ice cream gives the caramel note that perfects the samoa cookie side, and enriches the vanilla ice cream. Honestly, and I freely admit it's the Samoa junkie in me, wishes there was a touch more chocolate, but that'd wreck the balance of this absolutely excellent treat. Vape your calories indeed!&#xD;\n&#xD;\nNicely done all!","score":5},{"user":"BadaG","text":"Absolutely love it, after only a one day steep and it’s  Creamy, buttery, chocolaty, biscuity, soft and chewy&#xD;\n&#xD;\nIt’s a complex one but all the elements are there","score":5}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"185160","name":"Samoa Sammies | DEVELOPED"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
