I have been using this base for a very long time and tend to never bore of it. I occasionally have it ‘straight’, without any additional flavouring, to remind me of its magnificence! Simply put, it is decadent vanilla custard crowned with caramlised sugar.\r\n\r\nFA Fuji is the undisputed king of apples and here, it does all the heavy lifting on the apple front. Sweet, crispy and uber realistic, FA Fuji précis a Fuji apple uncannily. The INW apple brings a sweet apple juice type vibe to the party and boosts the Fuji’s sweetness to create a stunning apple combo. \r\n\r\nFLV apple filling is a McDonalds apple pie in a bottle and serves its purpose very accurately. It provides a bakery cinnamon flavour with a wonderfully rich, baked apple sweetness. Do not venture any higher here as the cinnamon will dominate but not as aggressively as FLV Rich Cinnamon. Used sparingly, this will add a new dimension to your bakeries and perhaps tobacco?\r\n\r\nGives this baby 5 days or so to settle in.\r\n\r\n","steep_days":"5","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-11-30T02:43:09.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"1660","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Creme Brulee (yc)","vendor":"INW","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Custard","vendor":"INW","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Shisha Vanilla","vendor":"INW","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Apple Filling","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":750},{"name":"Apple Fuji","vendor":"FA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Two Apples","vendor":"INW","millipercent":1500}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"143002","name":"Apple Brulee"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
