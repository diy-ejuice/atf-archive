Not an exact match for orange crush, but super solid for a quick and simple orange soda. It vapes a little warm though, as oranges tend to do. I want to try it again with some cooling and with following the creator’s suggestion of using a tiny bit of CAP Super Sweet to bridge that very slight separation between the orange essence top note and a little tangerine poking through underneath. There’s also some throat hit that coolant might help with, but none more than would be expected from a citrus soda vape.
