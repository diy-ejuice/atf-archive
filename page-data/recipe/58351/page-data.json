This is my first share here on ATF because this is the first recipe I've created that I place enough confidence in to share publicly. Just a simple combination that's been running around my mind the last 3 days that pulled at my curiosity enough to have me finally sit down and at least give it a one shot attempt. Turns out that's all it took for myself to be satisfied with the flavor of this mixture. \"Chocolate-Hazelnut-Almond\", and that's the just of it. That rich, robust, authentic, somewhat tart body you get from a good dark chocolate all the way through initially, and on the back during the inhale. Then an even more rich, \"cocoish\", sweet chocolate still holding on to its authenticity along side a dark, roasted, nutty aroma that both the hazelnut and almond create; but hazelnut lingers its unique and prominent impression here and throughout the exhale.\r\n\r\nI'm very much an entry level novice and would very much accept and encourage criticism and guidance. You kinda have to enjoy hazelnut to find this mix desirable but when considering its simplicity the hazelnut could more then likely be tweaked to sit not so potent. Mix it up, remix it up, and build upon. Please let me know how you've enjoyed this and what changes you possibly made to further enhance it. I have mixed this both max VG and 70/30 it was enjoyable on both attempts right off the scale.
