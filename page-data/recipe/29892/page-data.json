In this mix the nuttiness blends with the base making it milkier while at the same time, it adds to the top of the accents.\r\nI am pretty sure the end result will be deficient without it.\r\n\r\nDue to the layers in this recipe, this needs a minimum of 3 weeks to blend properly. It's pleasant surely in the meantime, but the thick end result needs these 20+ days.\r\nFinally, the 70/30 ratio also adds to the thickness intended.\r\n\r\nEnjoy.","steep_days":"20","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-06T11:39:18.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"1407","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Juicy Lemon","flavor_id":"79","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Lemon Sicily","flavor_id":"524","vendor":"FA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Meringue","flavor_id":"530","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Sweet Cream","flavor_id":"183","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Torrone","flavor_id":"550","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Vanilla Bean Ice Cream","flavor_id":"186","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":4000}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"29892","name":"Condensed Lemon Milk"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
