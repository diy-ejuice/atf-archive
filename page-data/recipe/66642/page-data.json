I added a touch of soho to warm up the mix and give it a bit of caramel flavor. Don't be scared, it tastes NOTHING like tobacco. If anyone would know its me (I can't stand any hint of tobacco). Fw blood orange is the perfect warm, earthy orange flavor to use in this perfect muffin base of flv lembas bread and flv pound cake. Lembas bread will be available from BCF in a couple of days. Give this a few days to a week to steep. The cranberry comes out a little more and the breads get more, well, bready.","steep_days":"5","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"total_reviews":2,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:49:37.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"2955","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Blood Orange","vendor":"FW","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Cranberry","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Lembas Bread","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Pound Cake","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Soho","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000}],"reviews":[{"user":"kitu5","score":"5","text":"The muffin is...well, a muffin. I can't wax too poetic about what is essentially an unsweetened cupcake, now can I? That said, it is spot on, nice and doughy. The orange provides its usual tart sweetness, and is nicely balanced by the cranberry. Just a delightful PROINK of tasty tartness that nestles in very well. The surprising note for me is that caramel note from the soho. It gives things that well baked sweet note you get out of a good muffin. This stuff is banging.&#xD;\n&#xD;\nNow for the fun bit. I know Emily hates tobaccos, buuuut. Yeah, I cranked this bad boy to 430f while playing around tasting the various flavors, and it shifted from muffin to \"Huh, sweet orange cranberry tobacco...interesting\". Basically, the muffin fades to a low roar, and the nutty/woody notes you get in a tobacco show up, backed by caramel, orange and cranberry, with a faint hint of a cake baking.&#xD;\n&#xD;\n2 for 1 deal. Awesome!&#xD;\n&#xD;\nKiller stuff!"},{"user":"Illegal_Immigrant","score":"5","text":"This is a delicious mix! But holy moley, is that Lembas Bread's expensive. The orange and cranberry combo work really well together, not too citrusy and just enough tartness from the cranberries. I was hoping that the muffin part would be a bit more prominent, but that's not a negative. I let it steep for a week and vaped half my sample. I'm curious if it'll change after another week of steeping. With how smooth it is and the mouthfeel I can see this being an ADV. Thanks for the great recipe Emily! :D"}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"66642","name":"Cran-Orange Muffin"}}}
