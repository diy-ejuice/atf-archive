No? Well go do it now. For real. Both versions are seriously amazing. I'll wait. \r\n\r\nHere, I'll help https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/125500#grango_1_2_3_by_alfredpudding . \r\n\r\nWelcome back! Anyway. Both variations of this deliciousness sparked a newfound love for grape in INW Grape. With Alfred's blessing, I wanted to do a spin off.  I was looking through my flavors and Watermelon popped out at me. \r\n\r\nAdmittedly, LA Watermelon was my first try with this, but there's literally no better choice for it.  The natural yet slightly candied watermelon of LA, compliments the \"purple\" flavor of INW Grape super well.  All of that with a hint of Mango and its heaven.  Other than that, 3 flavors and 6% of flavoring, there ain't all that much to say about it.....just mix it!","steep_days":"3","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:50:39.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"2215","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Watermelon","flavor_id":"984","vendor":"LA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Grape","flavor_id":"784","vendor":"INW","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Mango","flavor_id":"3516","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":3000}],"reviews":[{"user":"AlfredPudding","text":"I thought making the duo of Mango and Grape work together was mind-blowing enough, but here comes the fruit master again showing off. This recipe manages to make a grango into a watergrango seamlessly. If you're asking yourself if you're even going to like a watergrango right now, I can assure you it's the business. It's a thick, juicy, tropical fruit blend that shows off the power of weird combinations.  "}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"134255","name":"Grango Unchained"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
