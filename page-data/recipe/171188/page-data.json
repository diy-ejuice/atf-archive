However my coils tell me the OG liquid has a lot more sweetener in it.\r\nIt's pretty good after a good shake, I prefer mine after a couple days steep.\r\nDon't let it sit for 6 months because I noticed the strawberry starts to fade after 3 months, but as I stated this combo was closest to the OG.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you like Strawberry by The One you will definitely love this one as well.\r\nGive it a try and enjoy!","steep_days":"5 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-06T04:12:06.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"1504","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Cereal 27","flavor_id":"4163","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Cream","flavor_id":"604","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":700},{"name":"Milk","flavor_id":"523","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1200},{"name":"Berryl (raspberry)","flavor_id":"412","vendor":"FA","millipercent":100},{"name":"Sweet Strawberry","flavor_id":"121","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Super Sweet","flavor_id":"2384","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":700},{"name":"Marshmallow","flavor_id":"332","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Zeppola","flavor_id":"6312","vendor":"FA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"New York Cheesecake","flavor_id":"90","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Cream Milky Undertone PG","flavor_id":"6539","vendor":"OOO","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Acetyl Pyrazine 5%","flavor_id":"1709","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":100}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"171188","name":"That One Strawberry (Strawberry by The One #Remix)"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
