It is a great single flavor. It was missing something. I wanted a bit more tropical feel so I threw some CAP Golden Pineapple on top and it. Thought about trying to layer more flavors into it. You know, it needs at least 5 more flavors to be legit. After vaping it for awhile I realized it was great as is. It is tasty off the shake and melds together a bit more the longer it steeps.","steep_days":"7 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"updated_at":"2020-12-12T11:51:43.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"1119","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Tropical Blend","flavor_id":"7793","vendor":"PUR","millipercent":5000},{"name":"Golden Pineapple","flavor_id":"61","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Super Sweet","flavor_id":"7787","vendor":"PUR","millipercent":500}],"reviews":[{"user":"Ceedge","text":"My wife loves this one.
