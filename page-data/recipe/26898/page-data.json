I find that it helps keep the raspberry balanced from being either too authentic or too artificial with its tart and sweet properties.\r\nonce again fa custard used for its slight lemon note that helps keep fruit flavors prominent even after a steep especially helpful in heavier cream type recipes. fw lemon meringue pie also helps to add to the texture and sweetness while assisting the raspberry brightness. if you do not yet have cap vanilla whipped cream just get it. it has replaced fa whipped cream not only because I think it tastes better but also because it is very readily available. i like whipped cream on any and all desserts and cap whipped cream gives me that dollop of sweet fluffy dairy goodness.","steep_days":"7","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"total_reviews":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T00:07:04.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"2179","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Raspberry (sweet)","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Raspberry","vendor":"INW","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Dragonfruit","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Vanilla Cupcake","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Cheesecake","vendor":"FW","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Graham Cracker","vendor":"FW","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Custard","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Vanilla Whipped Cream","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Lemon Meringue Pie","vendor":"FW","millipercent":1000}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"26898","name":"Raspberry Cheesecake"}}}
