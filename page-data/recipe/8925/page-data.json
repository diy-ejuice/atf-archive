This is a cheap, good cherry limeade. I tried many variations of this and it is the closest I could get it to a sonic cherry limeade. That is regular lime tahity not cold pressed.

I don't often say this, but I think it actually needs to go heavier on the flavor percentages. I'd personally go with 1% Cherry, 2% Lime, and .5% Super Sweet. Failing that, I think this might also be an excellent recipe for TFA Sweetener, at 1% to sweeten and cut the edges off the lime."}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"8925","name":"Sonic Cherry Limeade"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
