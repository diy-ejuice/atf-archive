Recently had beer from a local brewery, inspired me to create a profile similar.\r\n\r\nDrekker - Struggle Bus\r\n\"Struggle Bus combines orange, maple syrup, cinnamon, vanilla, lactose, and brown sugar for a flavor that’s familiar, yet pretty out there, and well... goddamn delicious. ⁣\" \r\nThis is very refreshing dessert/breakfast sour beer. \r\n\r\nDeveloping this recipe, I went through many different version from using funnel cake to finding RF French Toast. While drinking the beer, you get orange juice up front with a French toast cereal soon after. There is the bubbly/tartness of the Sour Beer to finish. \r\n-WF Orange Juice is spot on for what I was looking for.\r\n-RF French Toast/FA Breakfast Cereal has the cinnamon/brown sugar note and some doughy/cereal I was seeking.\r\n-OOO Creamy Milk Undertone PG brings in a slight dairy note.\r\n-FLV Citrus Soda brings in another bubbly note with some more high end. \r\n\r\n\r\nTested on a mech with the Goon 24mm","steep_days":"1","temperature":"0","recipe_score":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-10T14:53:30.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"637","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Orange Juice","flavor_id":"6057","vendor":"WF","millipercent":1400},{"name":"Cream Milky Undertone PG","flavor_id":"6539","vendor":"OOO","millipercent":2000},{"name":"French Toast","flavor_id":"2256","vendor":"RF","millipercent":2700},{"name":"Citrus Soda","flavor_id":"10083","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":400},{"name":"Breakfast Cereals","flavor_id":"8810","vendor":"FA","millipercent":900}],"reviews":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"175538","name":"Struggle bus "}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
