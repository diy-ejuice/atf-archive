The Hangsen Gold & Silver and Inawera Am4a fill in some tobacco notes and brings this recipe more cherry forward. The room note is a bit strange, but not unpleasant. I'm still tweaking the Cavendish level as it might be a bit too much, but I'm liking it so far. I upped the Nicotine to 10 mg/ml because I mouth-to-lung this recipe and it needed a bit more of a kick","steep_days":"14","temperature":"68","recipe_score":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-10T14:52:16.000-05:00","best_vg":"50%","views":"1663","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Tobacco Cavendish Type","flavor_id":"733","vendor":"INW","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Am4a By Inwera","flavor_id":"748","vendor":"INW","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Gold & Silver","flavor_id":"2040","vendor":"HS","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Black Cherry","flavor_id":"212","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Mts Vape Wizard","flavor_id":"482","vendor":"FA","millipercent":500}],"reviews":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"65525","name":"Black Cherry Cavendish"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
