Its Delicious and I have made and vaped a couple of 100ml bottles of this ... But, I do find it has a little bit of harshness to it. I think its the 27 Bears, which I have not single flavour tested yet (soon), so I have made some changes to tweak it to my preference and help with the harshness. Only minor changes and your recipe still provided the base that Im working on ... Great work!!"},{"user":"ooooNaSuGamisoooo","score":"5","text":"Very good!!!&#xD;\nafter 3-4 days of steeping everything comes together nicely!&#xD;\nwell done mate!!!"}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"92526","name":"BEARS.
