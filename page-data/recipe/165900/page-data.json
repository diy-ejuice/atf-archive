The custard  gives it some body and fills in middle and adds some volume and mouth feel .  Tried on a reload S at 70 watts  with a alien coil  @.16 .  really solid at 3 days , flavors settle even more and round out a bit  by day 5 \r\n\r\ncereal 27 it is the best corn flake cereal out there but is a bit darker  then actual corn flake and needs a little help with \"corn\"   - so 1 drop of  FA corn  can do that .   Corn grows a bit so   1 drop / 30 ml is really all I needed, but wait a day or so before fore you add  more to your liking  - or  use a 10% dilution \r\nThe pie base is  mix of pie crust and sugar cookie  -   ooo pie crust is  the closest I have found to actual flaky dry pie crust, sugar cookie adds some buttery body  to the crust that I find is needed and like the way  it works with the custard\r\nMaple syrup by fa   is a  solid maple and I  really enjoy it;   but some  do not, if you are not a fan of maple feel free to add  more  golden syrup.   I do find the  maple syrup will fade a touch  so  try as is   but you may end up wanting more  \r\nRed currant adds some brightness to the  strawberry that works in this application .   \r\n\r\nI like this SWEET so I added .30 of cap super sweet   - but the golden syrup and maple syrup  really do add a nice amount a sweetner ","steep_days":"5","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-06T14:08:46.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"1489","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Cereal 27","flavor_id":"4163","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Corn","flavor_id":"563","vendor":"FA","millipercent":20},{"name":"Custard Premium","flavor_id":"9118","vendor":"FA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Golden Syrup","flavor_id":"8887","vendor":"VT","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Maple Syrup","flavor_id":"509","vendor":"FA","millipercent":750},{"name":"Pie Crust","flavor_id":"2010","vendor":"OOO","millipercent":1750},{"name":"Strawberry Jam","flavor_id":"10274","vendor":"OOO","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Sugar Cookie","flavor_id":"115","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Sweet Currant","flavor_id":"10171","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":500}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"165900","name":"OLDSKL Cornflake Tart and Custard"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
