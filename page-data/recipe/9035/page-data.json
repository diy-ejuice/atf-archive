It’s worth noting that it was made way back in July 2016 and we’ve all grown and improved quite a bit since then. This recipe delivers a pistachio with cream, but not quite a pistachio ice cream. It’s just not thick and creamy and sweet enough for ice cream, there’s a separation between the nutty pistachio and the cream, and the bakeries used for the cone flavor (particularly the Biscuit, I think), ramp up the dryness in that forward roasted nut note. It’s not terrible or anything like that, but it seems to have a lot of room for improvement. I think the next time I feel like vaping pistachio ice cream, I’ll make my own using the Eyemake Ice Cream base and TFA Pistachio. Maybe some FLV to make it like the pistachio ice cream that has bits of real pistachios in it, but TFA Pistachio for the main flavor of the ice cream and that lovely Eyemake base for that sweet, thick, rich ice cream flavor. Cone optional.  "},{"user":"TheDrStore","text":"I love the way this all plays so well together. The pistachio comes through nicely and works well with the sugar cookie and biscuit, cone base. The caramel is fantastic with the vbic. Awesome stuff!"},{"user":"Smoky","text":""},{"user":"Thadentman","text":"Wow flv pistachio ages nicely!
