It's sorta sweet and plays well with others, which had made it extremely forgiving to tie it into recipes.\r\n\r\nRed Burley is just such a mutable base that it felt like the \"right\" place to go to tie in with the tatanka tobacco in an agreeable way.\r\n\r\nConnecticut shade is an odd duck to me, there's a ton of depth there, but every time I use it, I feel like I've gotta take a leap of faith with it because the smell totally hides how tasty it can be when used to accent a mix.\r\n\r\nWith that, the horchata was chosen to help add the cinnamon spice notes and a touch of body in tandem with the magic that is sweet coconut, which was chosen for both the flavor and the density of it. I wanted a bit of weight to the mix along with that sweet coconut flavor. \r\n\r\nFinally FLV smooth vanilla acts as something of a bridge between the tobaccos and the coconut-horchata mixture.","steep_days":"7 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"updated_at":"2020-12-12T17:12:57.000-05:00","best_vg":"50%","views":"1877","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Tatanka Tobacco","flavor_id":"4417","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1250},{"name":"Red Burley","flavor_id":"4355","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Connecticut Shade","flavor_id":"4365","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":200},{"name":"Horchata","flavor_id":"4439","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Smooth Vanilla","flavor_id":"8570","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":250},{"name":"Sweet Coconut","flavor_id":"605","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1250}],"reviews":[{"user":"fieldgreens","text":"This was recommended to me in the DIY Discord, and boy am I glad I tried it.  There's so much going on here it's hard to describe, but in the best possible way.  Each vape of it brings hints of something different, from vanilla, to coconut, to a beautiful tobacco blend.  It's really something I can't get enough of, and it's great no matter what time of the day.  If you're into tobaccos, but looking for something a little different, you need to try this one.  It won't disappoint. ","score":5},{"user":"nowar","text":"I was a blind tester for this mix and immediately insisted this one go public asap. This mix is a great spiced tobacco blend. Sometimes you will get hints of vanilla, some spicy creaminess, but all over this uniquely balanced blend of tobacco that is never quite anything at once. It morphs quickly from one flavorful morsel to another. If i had bought this as a juice, I probably never would have gone DIY. It's that good. For fans of dessert tobaccos with a medium body and a range of accents that never overpower, shift and morph. Good luck getting tired of this one. I wish I could explain it better, but I can't. Mix this.","score":5}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"177643","name":"coco-bacco"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
