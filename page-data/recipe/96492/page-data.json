Throwing a touch In with classic cap vanilla custard V1, produces a very milky, buttery, deep, and rich vanilla custard base, to build off of. The serial note I mentioned, really get a boost by the hazelnut accent in this recipe.\r\n\r\nTOP NOTES \r\n\r\nHS & FW  blueberry + TPA sweet cereal flakes + TPA marshmallow\r\n\r\nHS & FW  blueberry\r\n\r\n This is my go to blueberry combo, I ‚ù§ FW blueberry, one of the first flavoring I added to my collection. Adding just a touch of HS blueberry, gives it a slightly Jam like flavor,and turns yumm into Wow.\r\n\r\nTPA sweet cereal flakes\r\n\r\nThis is fastly becoming, my favorite cereal flavoring.  I've used it almost everything I have mixing lately!!!. Fit right in without any fuss versatile and extremely useful, it sweetens the profile, ( so no need for sweetener ) and gives it its amazing, flaky, delicious cereal flavor.\r\n\r\n TPA marshmallow\r\n\r\n Not a lot to say about marshmallow, that hasn't been sent before. Pairs perfectly with the vanilla in CAP vanilla custard, and it just seems to absorb the blueberry, becoming a  perfect blueberry marshmallow. On top of all of that adds a little extra fluff to the mix.\r\n.\r\n\r\n ACCENT\r\n\r\n FW hazelnut\r\n\r\nFlavor West hazel nut, does a perfect job of blending everything together, giving you just that extra edge of malt, helps boost the creams, and provides great contrast for the vanilla. \r\n\r\nSubstitutions\r\n\r\nFirst and most obvious you could substitute TFA marshmallow for fa marshmallow. TFA is a bit on the cheaper side and in a side-by-side comparison I can barely tell the difference. But if you have flavor Arts offering it will substitute in at the same percentage nicely.\r\n\r\nAlthough I highly recommend, picking up HS blueberry, it really is Flavor West blueberry  best friend, If you don't have it you could leave it out.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you'd like to participate in the Year of Mixing find the Flavor-Pro group and join us for our weekly challenge - all mixers welcome - and there will be some prizes.
