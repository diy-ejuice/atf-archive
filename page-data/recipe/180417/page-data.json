I'm an educator, so, coming off the break, I needed something for the ride to and from school.  I had not had much time to try some of these new flavors and just went for it.  I'm extremely pleased with how this has come out . . . smooth, thick, rich, sweet vanilla custard.  This is a new take on an old classic . . . fluffy custards, buttery bakery notes, creamy cheesecake, and extra vanilla.  I'm mixing up another 30 of this for the coming week!  If you mix it . . . I hope you enjoy it!!!","steep_days":"1 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"total_reviews":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-02T07:32:47.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"1713","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Vanilla Custard SC","vendor":"WF","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Custard Premium","vendor":"FA","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Vanilla Custard 2","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2500},{"name":"French Vanilla","vendor":"FW","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Sweetener","vendor":"FW","millipercent":500},{"name":"Cookie Butter SC","vendor":"WF","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Sugar Cookie","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Cheesecake","vendor":"LA","millipercent":1500}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"180417","name":"Lonesome Custard"}}}
