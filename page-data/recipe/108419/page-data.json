Really happy with the way this turned out! \r\n\r\nFA PEAR- This is the only pear I have right now and it does a great job of giving you that juicy and sweet inside of a pear while also giving a subtle note of the skin and texture of the outside. \r\n\r\nFW GUAVA- This concentrate is so versatile. I have actually never tasted real guava, but i love the way that this helps gives the strawberry a different dimension.\r\n\r\nTPA STRAWBERRY- Probably my all time favorite flavor. A sweet candy like strawberry that works almost anywhere.\r\n\r\nRF STRAWBERRY- A softer candy strawberry that gives the TPA Strawberry a juicier, chewier quality that I love.\r\n\r\nLB VANILLA ICE CREAM & TPA VANILLA SWIRL- These 2 ice creams together add the perfect creamy vanilla finish, while also helping to blend everything together and smooth them out.\r\n\r\nIf you havent checked out BADESIGN over on ELR yet you are missing out. He showed me the ropes of DIY and helped me really come to enjoy mixing my own recipes.\r\n\r\nLemme know what you all think!","steep_days":"1 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"total_reviews":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-06T20:44:06.000-05:00","best_vg":"80%","views":"1175","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Pear","vendor":"FA","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Strawberry","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Strawberry","vendor":"RF","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Vanilla Ice Cream","vendor":"LB","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Guava","vendor":"FW","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Vanilla Swirl","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":3500}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"108419","name":"GPS (Guava, Pear, Strawberry)"}}}
