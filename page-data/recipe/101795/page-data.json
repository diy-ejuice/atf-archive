If you wonna get closer to the Galago juice you might wonna bump it up to .50%\r\n\r\nI'm mixing for a few years now. Most of my mixes are based on premium juice profiles.\r\nMy recipes are remixes and not clones. In my attempts to remix these juices I'm always trying to make\r\nit as good as, or even better than the commercial juice without the loads of sweetener these companies throw in.\r\n\r\nGive it a try and enjoy................","steep_days":"3 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-05T13:09:16.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"1984","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Lychee","flavor_id":"628","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Grape Concord","flavor_id":"554","vendor":"FA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Tart and Sour","flavor_id":"2520","vendor":"LA","millipercent":150},{"name":"Bergamot","flavor_id":"469","vendor":"FA","millipercent":250},{"name":"Super Sweet","flavor_id":"2384","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":250}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"101795","name":"Grape that Lychee (Galago Remix)"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
