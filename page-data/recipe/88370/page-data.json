After deliberating on which flavor to use i chose FLV Peach gummy due to it having a better peachiness IMHO , i know alot of ppl swear by Cap JP, i just didnt feel it or taste what i was looking for.. i then chose FA Cinn Ceyl as my spice and dulled that down with Cap Super sweet ... this is a pleasent vape to me ..enjoy\r\n","steep_days":"2 (SNV)","temperature":"65","recipe_score":2,"updated_at":"2020-12-12T10:34:00.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"941","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Peach Gummy","flavor_id":"4313","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Cinnamon Ceylon","flavor_id":"497","vendor":"FA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Super Sweet","flavor_id":"2384","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1000}],"reviews":[{"user":"ID10-T","text":"I love the idea of a candy cinnamon with a candy peach almost as much as a realistic cinnamon with a realistic peach, but this is a bakery cinnamon with a candy peach and it’s kind of weird and, to me, a little gross. If only the Super Sweet and Peach Gummy lent the cinnamon their candyiness, but they don’t. You might put cinnamon gummy bears and peach rings candy in your mouth at the same time, or at least I would, but you probably wouldn’t take cinnamon out of the cabinet and sprinkle it on peach rings candy, which is what this tastes like. Also, that’s too much Super Sweet for me, it leaves a strong lingering sucralose aftertaste here.
