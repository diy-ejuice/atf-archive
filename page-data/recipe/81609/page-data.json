The main layer of course is the ice cream, I went with LB Vanilla Ice Cream and HS French Vanilla.  This makes a awesome creamy Ice Cream base.  The middle layer consists of FW Butterscotch Ripple with FA Butterscotch, this gives the ice cream a great butterscotch taste.  The FA Joy combined with FA Breakfast cereal, gives the perfect texture and taste for the fried outer layer of the ice cream.  Then top with some caramel from WF,  Caramel Rice Crispy Treat, this adds more to the texture needed.  Delicious ADV!\r\nIf you want some sweetener, feel free to add, I prefer it without.  If you do want sweetener, Super sweet is going to give you more of a donut glaze taste in this recipe, so I don’t recommend Super Sweet.
