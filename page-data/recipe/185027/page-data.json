If you want to mix it up feel free to add and adapt then comment what you did and what it changed.\r\nOn the inhale its a cooked apple and cinnamon like you got a piece of apple in the muffin. The exhale is a fluffy light muffin with very slight traces of the apple and cinnamon.\r\nOff the shake the cinnamon is in your face, after 3 days is mellows out and play well with the apple for me. I haven't tested it past 4 days because it was all gone.\r\nI Vaped this on a Citadel RDA - .25 @ 50w\r\n\r\n","steep_days":"3","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-05T19:51:18.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"729","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Apple Filling","flavor_id":"4376","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":3500},{"name":"Cinnamon Crunch","flavor_id":"611","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Rich Cinnamon","flavor_id":"638","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Vanilla Pudding","flavor_id":"4433","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":500},{"name":"Pound Cake","flavor_id":"4306","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1500}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"185027","name":"Apple Cinnamon Muffin DIYDownunder FLV Feb 2020"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
