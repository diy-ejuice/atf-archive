It's not exactly 1:1, but I am very pleased with the way that this turned out. It's a flue cured tobacco with vanilla milk and a caramel drizzle. Two week steep required.\r\n\r\nHS Flue Cured - This is really the star of the show, it has a fantastic smokey/woody flavor and it's exactly what I was looking for. The other flue cured tobaccos that I tried were ok, but this is the flavor for this juice.\r\n\r\nINW Vanilla for Pipe - I put this in to help to blend the vanilla milk and the tobaccos together and it does just that.\r\n\r\nTFA RY4 Double - I needed caramel, but didn't want to muddle the HS Flue Cured. RY4 Double has very subtle tobacco and a wonderful caramel after steeping, so just like the Vanilla for Pipe this is to help blend the caramel in with the tobaccos.\r\n\r\nFA Cream Fresh - This is part of the milk base and it works perfectly for that. With the added vanillas from the other flavors it turns into a light creamy milk.\r\n\r\nCAP Vanilla Custard v1 - This was put in to add richness to the milk, as well as help to meld everything together to make it one cohesive flavor.
