They describe this as a caramel, ice cream custard. This is version 1. It is pretty close to the overall profile. maybe a few tweaks but very good as is.

I mixed this up because i had all the needed flavors. Its good off the shake and gets better with the suggested steep. Nice work!"},{"user":"bjorama","text":"Dillinger was my original commercial ADV.  It was kinda expensive and when funds were tight Killer Kustard came to the rescue.  Loving the clones being put out by these guys.  This is as great recipe and pretty damn close to the original.  REALLY GOOD OFF THE SHAKE TOO"}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"161712","name":"Villain Vapors Dillinger v1: Cloning With the Crew"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
