That being said there is no alcohol/tequila or salt effect/taste. All of these flavorings work very well together. My experience with beverage vapes is limited at best but I think I really hit a homerun with this recipe. I have had margarita vapes in the past but none have been as tasty as this one. If you enjoy it please rate and comment.

I'd describe it as a virgin strawberry Margarita that's been sitting in the sun (just because the lack of coolant). It's sweet, fruity, and unique. The first solid ADV I've ever had. &#xD;\n&#xD;\n&#xD;\n&#xD;\nTesting was done on multiple coils, including Vaporesso CCell ceramic coils (0.5ohm 25w) and ni80 4 core fused claptons (0.18ohm 90w)&#xD;\n&#xD;\nSteeped: 0 days, true SnV&#xD;\n&#xD;\nSweet syrupy strawberry upfront, complimented by a sweet lime on the exhale. After vaping nothing but this for over a week, I've noticed a ton of \"off-flavours\" that actually go very well with the 3-strawberry blend. Some of these flavours include spearmint, chocolate, and pineapple. These flavours may or may not be present, I believe it's just my mind playing tricks on me. &#xD;\n&#xD;\n&#xD;\nFlavour Notes&#xD;\n&#xD;\nTFA strawberry, TPA strawberry (ripe), CAP sweet strawberry - these three strawberry flavours together create a realistic tasting strawberry syrup. They perfectly compliment eachother. I imagine they would work as a base for other fruits. &#xD;\n&#xD;\nFW Blood Orange &amp; FA Lime Cold Pressed - These two flavourings compliment eachother to create a lime flavour, with the rind. The bitterness of BO at 1.5% tastes like a generic citrus rind, and with the added lime it turns into a delicious lime. &#xD;\n&#xD;\nI chose not to add any Ethyl Maltol as suggested in the original recipe as the three strawberry flavours contain EM already and there were comments about the strawberry tasting muted. &#xD;\n&#xD;\nInstead, I used Rick's Sugar Daddy sweetener. It's the best sweetner I've used. I go with 1g of sweetner per 30ml when I'm mixing by weight. &#xD;\n&#xD;\n&#xD;\nOther Notes&#xD;\nThis juice is very enjoyable. For me, being able to vape something for this long is pretty unbelievable. I normally switch flavours at least once a day. Lately I've been finding myself mixing up another big bottle before I even run out. &#xD;\n&#xD;\n"},{"user":"kroganeater","score":"5","text":"awesome recipe!!! just like the real thing!!!!"},{"user":"Kudo","score":"5","text":"This is definitely one of my favorites, as soon as I replenish my stock of TPA strawberry another batch of this is getting made ASAP. I like to add 2% WS-23 to this recipe to give it a nice cool and refreshing vibe. The use of blood orange and lime tahity give this a nice \"twang.\" Spectacular vape"},{"user":"adio","score":"5","text":"Great as a shake n vape - and I am one to struggle to taste strawberry usually. I LOVE this one - great for summer! 5/5&#xD;\n&#xD;\n"},{"user":"SamKayla","score":"5","text":""},{"user":"ID10-T","score":"5","text":"Two days steep - spot on to one of those cheap \"just add tequila\" strawberry margarita mixes.. which is actually super cool. Sweet and refreshing with just enough citrus. Highly recommend vaping with shots of tequila! "},{"user":"Noodles1972","score":"4","text":"Very tasty refreshing Margarita, surprising how the strawberry isn't too strong as i was a little concerned about that much strawberry but with the EM, lime and blood orange it all blends together nicely. I added 5 drops of koolada in 30ml just to make it more of a frozen margarita. Well worth a mix."},{"user":"Jthectic","score":"5","text":"Tastes like a strawberry margarita with fresh lime. Easily shake and vapeable, but you really get sweetness from the strawberries complementing the lime after about a week. Great mix 5/5."},{"user":"LocoMojo","score":"4","text":"Really great mix! Freshly mixed this reminds me HEAVILY of Placid by Adirondack. The Lime Tahity and Blood Orange go well in creating the alcoholic margarita note. The Strawberry is definitely there but it is no where near as strong as you would be led to believe by the ingredient list. I think this is mainly due to the amount of EM from the strawberries and the EM add in as well working against each other and muting the flavorings a bit. I'll definitely mix this one up again (its a great \"quick fix\" recipe that requires no real steep) but next time I think I will omit the extra EM to see if I cant taste more strawberry. "},{"user":"Draktyn92","score":"4","text":"Delicious recipe. I made a second batch  and dropped the cold pressed down to 1.5% and added 1% koolada and for me it pushed this recipe into my adv rotation. I also might try messing around with JF sweet strawberry since i have trouble tasting most strawberry vapes. Well done indeed."},{"user":"Reldof","score":"4","text":"Ever thought of putting TPA Champagne in?"},{"user":"triangulatethisdick","score":"4","text":"I really like the use of Fw blood orange here, seems to add a 'alcoholic' feel to the mix in a mysterious sort of way. That being said the lime seems to be a bit too different from a Margarita for me. I'm gunna play around with key lime and possibly distilled. Another possible tweek would be to cut a quarter of the cold-pressed with cap lemon lime or fa lemon Sicily for more of a citrus kick. Also the strawberry doesn't feel very pronounced. Love the profile though. Will update if I find any useful adaptions"},{"user":"6retro6","score":"5","text":"This was really nice, well done!"}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"19343","name":"KRUCIAL ¡¡¡¡Strawberry Margarita!!!!"}}}
