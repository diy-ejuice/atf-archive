Here is what I used and why:\r\n\r\nThe crust: I used cheese cake graham crust tfa and cookie by flavor art for the tart crust.\r\n\r\nThe fruit toppings: I used a combination of flavorah strawberry cream I absolutely love this strawberry its extremely strong and a great strawberry flavor if you don't have this give it a try you won't be disappointed. It is the one must have strawberry  by flavorah I also used a little strawberry \"red touch\" by flavor art it helps mark it a more authentic strawberry flavor. The kiwi I used kiwi double by tfa this isn't a very authentic kiwi flavor but what it lacks in authenticity it makes up in just a good tasting flavor it's kind of kiwi and kind of not but it's definitely delicious.\r\n\r\nThe cream cheese custard filling:\r\nI used a combination of cream cheese icing by loranns  and cvanilla custard v1 Capella and vanilla whipped cream by Capella and it seems to give it an almost perfect creamy custard cream cheese type filling.\r\n\r\nIn my opinion this is one of my best recipes to date. I literally have vaped this for three days in a row and I almost never vape the same flavor for more than one day. I will say the kiwi is not the most authentic kiwi available but it just turns this into a work of art I don't know what it is about kiwi double that I like so much it just works in this recipe.  So at the end of the day if you have all the ingredients then you need to mix this up and give it a shot because I think your going to be pleasantly surprised.
