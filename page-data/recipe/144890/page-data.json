If you like peanut butter, then this classic is for you. I set out to create a favorite childhood treat of peanut butter and coconut treats which we dipped in cooking chocolate, as upmarket chocolate was a scarce luxury in my neck of the woods. The OG includes chopped nuts but I decided to omit these as a true nut texture and flavor is virtually unachievable...\r\n\r\nThe TPA and FLV Peanut Butter combo works wonderfully well to create a very authentic, pukka peanut butter. Combined, this duo delivers a smooth, nutty and roasted (thanks to FLV) peanut butter with a dense & mysterious grainy mouth feel. The slight saltiness which FLV brings adds to the \"nut\" element of the OG concept.  A word of advice on the TPA PB - give it a good shake BEFORE mixing as it commonly separates when not in use for extended periods. \r\n\r\nThe coconut layer was a no-brainer...FA Coconut and FLV Coconut was born for this type of profile = dinkum, lightly sweetened , desiccated coconut. No more , no less. No mess, no fuss.\r\n\r\nI opted for the magnificence of HS Chocolate cream and the resulting masterpiece which is Mayan Milk. It effortlessly checks all the boxes for a world class chocolate and requires virtually no assistance to shine, as it does that naturally.\r\n\r\nThe butter does what it is designed to do and adds a bit of buttery goodness to the mix whilst the marshmallow helps stick all the bits together and add a bit of body and sweetness.\r\n\r\nGive this baby 7 days or so...\r\n","steep_days":"7","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T00:08:16.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"1458","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Peanut Butter","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Peanut Butter","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Sweet Coconut","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Coco' (coconut)","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Chocolate Cream","vendor":"HS","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Butter","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Marshmallow","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"144890","name":"Yummies"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
