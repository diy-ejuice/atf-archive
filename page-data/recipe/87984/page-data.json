The tpa pistachio brings a nice creamy base which is deepened by the flv pistachio and then this is perfectly contrasted by the persian lime which is an outstanding citrus aroma. Together it brings a nice balanced combination of citrusy and bakery kinda. Definitively worth a try","score":5},{"user":"CygnusY1","text":"This is my first venture into pistachio and love this recipe. It's so different to the bakery profiles I've been using and has opened up my vaping taste buds to new aromas. Would need to be a gastronomer to describe the taste from this. All i can say is, Amazing. Thanks a mill for sharing such a complex-tasting yet low ingredient recipe. Don't know how you guys do it. ","score":5},{"user":"shyndo","text":"This is absolutely lovely.
