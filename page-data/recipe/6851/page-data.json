I don't find the illustration of this fictional character sexist. A sexual / sensual characterization of a Mother Dragon, sure. "},{"user":"coilspotting","score":"4","text":"This recipe is delicious, and since I breastfed all three of my children I’m definitely in favor of breastfeeding; but is the sexism really necessary? C’mon, Dave. At least pretend there might be female (and enlightened male) DIYers who are offended by the sexist description? Not everyone who vapes is a bro.

Its still part of my daily rotation!&#xD;\nPerfectly rounded and delicious!"},{"user":"sc0lm00","score":"4","text":"At 1 month this is a pretty nice blend of strawberry and dragon fruit. The dragon fruit is pretty evenly matched with the strawberry. The strawberry cuts down on the DF dryness and punch at the end. The cream is mellow and sits behind the strawberry and DF. I don’t get a lot of definition with the cream. The fruit flavors are the star here. The cream adds some depth and a nice mouthfeel. If you like God Milk but want a bit more DF or less of a cream focus then this is for you."},{"user":"RemoveHasperat","score":"4","text":"Juicy and flavorful for a simple recipe. Its not mind blowing but for the profile it does it better than most. "},{"user":"koldfusion","score":"5","text":"Smooth and creamy. Mouth watering with a vanilla kick. I can sort of taste the Strawberry and the typical Stems and plastic isn’t so bad. After a month the vanilla takes a back seat and becomes a whisper in the background. Which is pretty perfect."},{"user":"skineedog","score":"3","text":"Good but definitely needs a lot longer than 7 days to steep.

Big mistake! I ended up mixing this just for the simple fact that ID10-T is one favorite mixers and everything he touches turns to gold. This recipe is no different. Layered beautifully, and very well balanced. Dave just knows what he’s doing, and continues to kill it in the DIY scene. Another banger from ID10-T that will go in my rotation!

Absolutely perfect."},{"user":"Lupeie","score":"5","text":"I liked this recipe quite a bit. great use of dragonfruit!"},{"user":"Goldfish18","score":"5","text":"I'm not really a fruit recipe kind of guy, though I have been venturing into more fruit profiles lately, but I really enjoy this recipe. It's extremely simple and I think that's my favorite thing about it. I was a bit hesitant using so much dragonfruit, but the way it plays with the bavarian cream and vanilla swirl to give you this fruity creamy combo is amazing! A simple yet delicious and very well balanced recipe. Great job!"},{"user":"xela","score":"5","text":"Great recipe, great vape."},{"user":"ConcreteRiver","score":"5","text":"I'm super into this idea.  It's a unique profile that uses just 4 ingredients that everyone already has.  I get a smooth, creamy (but non-dairy) mouthful of white haribo gummy bears.  It's sweet with just a tiny hint of bitterness from the high percentage of dragonfruit.  It's well balanced.  I'm a non-strawberry taster, so factor that in.  Works better for me in a tank than dripping. It's ADV territory if the flavor is your thing, as it doesn't have any sharp edges to burn you out on the flavor.  Good idea, good execution."},{"user":"KenWhitfield","score":"5","text":"Very nice and balanced. A very clean and refreshing vape."},{"user":"zwermp","score":"5","text":"I'm really enjoying this recipe.  Nice and balanced.  Also interesting to have the strawberry supporting the dragonfruit, vs the other way around.  Thanks for this!"},{"user":"Thadentman","score":"5","text":"After 2 weeks aging I finally gave it a go. It seems to have a creamy bubblegum effect to it. Different...Never used tfa dragonfruit at this high of a % and it works well with this one, Very smooth vape"},{"user":"HowieDIY","score":"5","text":"Very nice flavor profile.  Very bright.  The vanilla swirl sits nicely in the background (overnight steep).  This should develope nicely with a longer steep.  The strawberry and dragonfruit are very well balanced.  Thanks ID10-T!&#xD;\n&#xD;\nUpdate:  amazing after a week steep.  The dragon fruit is still bright and sweet, but the vanilla swirl developed into a great balanced vape."}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"6851","name":"Mother of Dragons' Milk"}}}
