It's also just simply better than CAP and TPA. 🤷‍♂️\r\n\r\n■ **CAP Sugar Cookie**\r\nOriginally trialing FA Cookie I felt it was leaning a little too far into the \"dry\" category, so I landed on CAP's offering. It's a sweet moist cookie that feels like it melds better into the profile.\r\n\r\n■ **WF Vanilla Cream Extra**\r\nThis is a vanilla milkshake, what would it be without a thick creamy vanilla booster? WF's VCE at 2% offers a slight malt note to the profile, but it also contributes to the body with a creamy finish.\r\n\r\n■ **RF Deep Fried Cookies & Cream**\r\nI've been SFTing this concentrate for a long few months. It's very enjoyable but can be tedious to formulate with. CAP Sugar Cookie helps lift the crunch a bit because this concentrate has very, very little. What it does do well is compliment a chocolate Oreo note.\r\n\r\n■ **INW Shisha Vanilla**\r\nDeepens the vanilla complexity of the shake by lending creamy emulsifying vanilla notes. Transforms the cream into a sweet ice cream.\r\n\r\n■ **CAP Super Sweet**\r\nAn axiomatic fact SS imparts sweetness. So yeah, that.\r\n\r\n■ **Make it Better**\r\nI like adding WS-23 @ .1% to add just a touch more cooling realism and a drop of saline .9% solution to help authenticize the cream.","steep_days":"10","temperature":"420","recipe_score":5,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:50:30.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"4923","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Super Sweet","flavor_id":"2384","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":500},{"name":"Vanilla Bean Ice Cream","flavor_id":"1451","vendor":"FW","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Vanilla Cream Extra SC","flavor_id":"8382","vendor":"WF","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Sugar Cookie","flavor_id":"115","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Deep Fried Cookies and Cream – Super Concentrate","flavor_id":"7881","vendor":"RF","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Shisha Vanilla","flavor_id":"841","vendor":"INW","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Acetyl Pyrazine 5%","flavor_id":"1709","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":150}],"reviews":[{"user":"ambzizbanannerz","text":"Forgot to review this one it is very worth ordering real flavors for this one we love it.
