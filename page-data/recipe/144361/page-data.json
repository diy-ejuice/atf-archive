I hate it on it's own but there's something interesting about it. I've tried adding biscuits and creams before with meh results and went with addition fruits and cream this time. For some reason I don't mind as much when I MTL vape shitty juice so I went for a MTL version first. I think it came out fantastic. I added 1 drop of SS for the 15ml bottle I made.\r\n\r\nIt's pretty good off the shake, but after sitting over the weekend, I think it's really good.","steep_days":"3 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T17:35:34.000-05:00","best_vg":"50%","views":"1425","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Florida Key Lime","flavor_id":"7699","vendor":"FA","millipercent":6000},{"name":"Cherries","flavor_id":"757","vendor":"INW","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Cherry Blossom Tea","flavor_id":"1482","vendor":"LB","millipercent":8000},{"name":"Cream","flavor_id":"604","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":2000}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"144361","name":"Cherry Blossom Tea w/ Lime (MTL/Pod)"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
