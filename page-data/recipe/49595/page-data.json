If you like the original I suggest you give this a try, since it is pretty close to the original. And even if you are not a big fan of Dinner Lady's version, but are attracted to this profile in general, give this a try and please let me know what you're thinking. Many of my friends prefer my version, saying it is more round and full in taste. In my opinion, I have to work a bit on the \"rice-flavor\" and maybe try other flavorings; please let me know if you have any suggestions on that. Hope you like it and if you do, I'd be very pleased if you leave a small review ;)  Enjoy!!\r\n\r\nSome \"quick\" notes:\r\n\r\nCAP Horchata / TFA Rice Crunchies\r\n\r\nHorchata gives the impression of a rice milk but also leads to some weird off-notes when used to high in this context. I used TFA's Rice Crunchies to add more of a rice flavor to the mix.\r\n\r\nTFA Bavarian Cream / FA Fresh Cream / CAP Vanilla Custard\r\n\r\nThe combination of these three flavourings gives a nice milky impression of a pudding with some vanilla notes. Fresh cream adds some light \"milkyness\", while Vanilla Custard adds some more heavy and buttery/eggy cream notes, leading to a thicker pudding-like vape experience. The Bavarian Cream adds more vanilla and is used to blend everything together.\r\n\r\nCAP Raspberry V2\r\n\r\nI used Capella's Raspberry, because I didn't want a too realistic and more syrup-like raspberry flavor as a topping and it does a very good job in this context. Note that I used the V2 just because I don't own V1. Since I don't know if there is a big difference between Version 1 and 2, I can't say for sure that you can substitute V1 for V2, but you probably can...\r\n\r\n\r\nMix @ 70/30 VG/PG. You can shake&vape this, but i suggest to let it sit for at least 2-3 days.\r\n","steep_days":"3","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T19:14:59.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"5319","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Raspberry V2","flavor_id":"109","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1100},{"name":"Horchata","flavor_id":"74","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Rice Crunchies","flavor_id":"142","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Bavarian Cream","flavor_id":"145","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Cream Fresh","flavor_id":"540","vendor":"FA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Vanilla Custard","flavor_id":"131","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Sweetener","flavor_id":"339","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":500}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"49595","name":"Dinner Lady's \"Rice Pudding\" Remix"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
