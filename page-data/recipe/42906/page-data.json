Appologies for the confusion, just received an email notifying me today! \r\nI have no idea how it will taste with the cookie dough, just re ordered some. But I can confirm that Cookie is very good in the meantime. After 6 days steep the Icecream came through, sandwiched between the sweet, nutty cookie. \r\nIt's got to be TFA VBIC, CAP's offering, whilst being really creamy just doesn't have enough flavour to stand up to the cookie.\r\n\r\nInspired by Wayne's weekend mixing assignment.\r\nWorks good as a shake and vape, you mostly get a peanut butter caramel cookie, with a lovely texture. Tasty, moorish and not harsh in any way whatsoever. Not much Icecream at first but that'll come with the steep. \r\nFirst time working with FLV and already impressed.\r\nAny feedback appreciated!","steep_days":"7 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"total_reviews":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-06T20:42:59.000-05:00","best_vg":"80%","views":"2046","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Vanilla Custard","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Vanilla Bean Ice Cream","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Vanilla Whipped Cream","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Cookie","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Caramel","vendor":"LA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Biscuit","vendor":"INW","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Peanut Butter","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1000}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"42906","name":"Caramel Cookie Nut Icecream"}}}
