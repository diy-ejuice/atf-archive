This is particularly boozy for a shake n Vape, and delicious; however if you can let it steep for a few days for the pudding, fig, and rum to meld in with the dough of the bread pudding and sweet dough, it will be mind blowing. The pumpkin spice adds a perfect flavor for a holiday feel. I love this spice. No sweetener is needed for this, unless you just canâ€™t live without it. ðŸ˜€. \r\nPeace to everyone. Merry Christmas and Happy New Year. \r\n\r\n","steep_days":"3 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-06T23:07:27.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"1361","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Bread Pudding â€“ SC","vendor":"RF","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Vanilla Pudding","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Raisin Rum","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":500},{"name":"Sweet Fig","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":750},{"name":"Sweet Dough","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Pumpkin Spice","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":250}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"64386","name":"Rum Figgy Pudding "}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
