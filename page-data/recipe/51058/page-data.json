If this doesn't taste blue; I don't know what does!\r\nThere's no vanilla to distract from the blueberry. It's straight up blueberry and cheesecake. \r\nThe FA Bilberry and FW Blueberry combo make an intense, deep and authentic blueberry. \r\nTFA CCG and CAP NY Cheesecake are staples in good cheesecake recipes, no reason for me to mess with that. \r\nSome FLV Cream and FA Marshmallow to sweeten and give a fuller creamy vape. \r\nFA Lemon Sicily brightens the blueberries, could up the sweetener a bit if desired, not finding it too sweet at 0.5, about right for me. \r\nYou get a realistic, ripe blueberry on top and throughout, with a thick creamy Cheesecake sitting underneath. Lovely fluffy mouthfeel too.\r\nDefinitely needs 5 day minimum steep; the Bilberry is very powerful at first, with little input from the creams to balance it out. A week is optimal.\r\nLet me know what you think if you mix it ðŸ˜‰\r\n","steep_days":"6","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:49:23.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"1702","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"New York Cheesecake","flavor_id":"90","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Cheesecake (graham Crust)","flavor_id":"152","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Blueberry","flavor_id":"1201","vendor":"FW","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Bilberry","flavor_id":"533","vendor":"FA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Lemon Sicily","flavor_id":"524","vendor":"FA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Cream","flavor_id":"604","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Marshmallow","flavor_id":"473","vendor":"FA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Super Sweet","flavor_id":"2384","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":500}],"reviews":[{"user":"cdaniell30","text":"Damn this is nice and DARK blue, lol.
