Will let you know how it goes. As for Aloe chunks - INW Aloe might be a good start, if you can find it :)"},{"user":"MotherPunker","score":"4","text":"very simple yet tasty, juicy little mix here.  mixed it up a little bit back and kinda forgot about it till i was in the store the other day and saw these aloe drinks.  So i got one out of curiosity and boy, I'm addicted to those now!  Kinda reminds me of those little fruit bubble drinks you get at restaurants where they put those yummy bubbles in sprite.  Far as adding texture for those little aloe chunks, i dunno, gonna tinker with that one but I'm wondering about watermelon since its kinda pulpy."},{"user":"ncdulo","score":"4","text":""}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"52108","name":"Alø Sipper"}}}
