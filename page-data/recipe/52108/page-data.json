So i got one out of curiosity and boy, I'm addicted to those now!  Kinda reminds me of those little fruit bubble drinks you get at restaurants where they put those yummy bubbles in sprite.  Far as adding texture for those little aloe chunks, i dunno, gonna tinker with that one but I'm wondering about watermelon since its kinda pulpy.","score":4},{"user":"ncdulo","text":"","score":4}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"52108","name":"Alø Sipper"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
