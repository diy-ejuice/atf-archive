Perfect as an ADV. The yogurt in combination with the honey peach results in a perfectly smooth peach."},{"user":"Thadentman","score":"5","text":"This is a very nice peach vape, Very sweet and creamy and the yogurt really pushes it over the top. Yogurt in this recipe was brilliant, Most peaches are very harsh to vape but the yogurt cuts all the harsh notes off and the Tfa vbic is just a great thick ice cream to smooth it out and give it that creamy texture. Great recipe!"}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"12130","name":"She's A Peach"}}}
