It's going to get you close until you can pick this one up. I had to order mine from across the pond. \r\n\r\nhttps://flavourart.com/en/store/flavors/emotions/custard-premium-flavor/\r\n\r\nTraditionally I do an extensive right up, but this has really been getting in the way of me releasing content.\r\n\r\n I think this is a very straightforward recipe custard rum yummy. The one thing you might be asking yourself why pumpkin pie. Here I use it to boost the texture and creaminess of the already delicious custard base. \r\n\r\n Happy holidays everybody I hope you enjoy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","steep_days":"3 (SNV)","temperature":"421","recipe_score":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-12T10:14:52.000-05:00","best_vg":"69%","views":"2019","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Jamaica Special (jamaica Rhum)","flavor_id":"521","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Pumpkin Pie","flavor_id":"5896","vendor":"HS","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Cream","flavor_id":"604","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Rum Baba SC","flavor_id":"9041","vendor":"WF","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Custard","flavor_id":"484","vendor":"FA","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Blood Orange","flavor_id":"7698","vendor":"FA","millipercent":500}],"reviews":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"76764","name":"Baba rum pum pum pum"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
