I love Squirt Soda, I wanted some and had the flavors on hand. \r\n\r\nSquirt (originally named Citrus Club) was created by Herb Bishop in 1938, after experimenting in college. The result required less fruit juice and less sugar, which Bishop declared had the \"freshest, most exciting taste in the marketplace\".\r\n\r\nIn 1941, a mascot named \"Lil' Squirt\" was created in an effort to broaden public awareness. Squirt became a popular soft drink in many parts of the country, especially the West and Southwest. In the 1950s, it became accepted as a mixer used in cocktails.\r\n\r\nBig thank you to Herb Bishop!","steep_days":"1 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:49:56.000-05:00","best_vg":"60%","views":"1677","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Grapefruit","flavor_id":"65","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":3500},{"name":"Lemon Lime Soda SC","flavor_id":"8372","vendor":"WF","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Super Sweet","flavor_id":"2384","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":250}],"reviews":[{"user":"ID10-T","text":"This might be the only thing that CAP Grapefruit is good for, but itâ€™s very good for it. The recipe is light in flavor, but very refreshing and even feels effervescent. Not as bold and acidic as I remember Squirt being, but it has been awhile. IIRC it tastes just right for it, just like a little watered down. It makes me want to crank up both flavors a bit and see if it still works as well as it does as written, but with just a bit more intensity, without going awry. If not, one or the other flavors might need to be backed up with something else. &#xD;\n"}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"88205","name":"Lil' Squirt"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
