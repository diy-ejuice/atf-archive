After almost 4 Weeks it didnt change much and what i get now is pretty much burned Espresso with cream. I think this is definitely not a long steeper. Best spot is around 1-2 weeks. Still thx for the inspiration!"}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"127600","name":"Caramel Macchiato"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
