The Korean War Veterans Memorial stuck out to me, so I decided to venture down Korean desserts. There is a dessert style tea that is found during festivities as well as being drank to help digestion due to the ginger. The tea is called Sujeonggwa. It is a tea made with ginger, dried persimmon, and cinnamon. Normally fairly sweet as well. This is a simple mix, trying to replicate a long boil/steep with the spices, so they are a little stronger, while still holding the sweetness of Persimmon plus sugar. Give it a go! The rich cinnamon is at ONE drop per 30mL","steep_days":"3 (SNV)","temperature":"420","recipe_score":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-12T00:42:44.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"361","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Ginger","flavor_id":"4415","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Persimmon Spice","flavor_id":"4424","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":350},{"name":"Rich Cinnamon","flavor_id":"638","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":50},{"name":"Persimmon","flavor_id":"4420","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":250}],"reviews":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"204866","name":"Korean Festivi-teas!"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
