It 's a fluffy buttery cookie with a thick cream on top. \r\nTwo layers.\r\nThe cookie consists of INW Biscuit stone, VT Biscuit Base, WF Brown Sugar Cookie SC and WF Shortbread Cookies SC. The INW Biscuit gives the base of the biscuit with its well-known buttery flavor. The WF Shortbread Cookies provides the very fluffy feel to the cookie, but to balance it out and tighten it a little I added a VT Biscuit Base. Brown Sugar Cookie gives bass to the stone with slightly sweeter notes like black sugar over darker dough (oatmeal - biscuit?). \r\n\r\nThe cream consists of TPA Bavarian Cream at 2% where it starts and gives caramel notes,, WF Caramel Butter, VT Pudding Base where it acts as a bridge with its biscuit notes, but also rounds the biscuit and cuts the very rough texture. Last but not least, VT Sweet Cream that slightly lightens the creams and spreads them to the recipe. VT Cookies and Cream is the perfect bridge for this kind of recipes.
