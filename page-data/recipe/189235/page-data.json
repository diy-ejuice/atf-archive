FLV Peach + FA White Peach are the stars of this recipe, with the FA Armenia providing some support. For the soda I went with a typical soda base, or at least the one I use for most of my sodas. This mix does great with some WS23, really adding to that soda feel. While this mix is great without it, I personally add a bit of WS-23. This was a collaboration between @HumanPuck & @Ginko in live-mixing.\r\n\r\nJoin the discord https://discord.gg/ufVTyAQ\r\n","steep_days":"0 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:51:28.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"959","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Armenia (apricot)","flavor_id":"507","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Fizzy Sherbet","flavor_id":"8878","vendor":"VT","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Lemon Lime","flavor_id":"83","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Peach","flavor_id":"629","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Peach White","flavor_id":"543","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"189235","name":"Princess Peach (#live-mixing diy_ejucie discord Collaborative mix)"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
