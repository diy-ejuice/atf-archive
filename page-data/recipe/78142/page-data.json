A Deep Fried Twinkie is exactly what this is and I mean spot on. This is a strange recipe I suggest a 2 to 3 day steep but you only have about 2 weeks before it starts to fade. So I wouldn't make huge batches because a long steep doesn't help this recipe. Either way I think you will really enjoy this recipe!!!!!","steep_days":"3","temperature":"420","recipe_score":4,"updated_at":"2020-12-12T17:11:17.000-05:00","best_vg":"75%","views":"5504","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Deep Fried Spongecake ‚Äì Super Concentrate","flavor_id":"7882","vendor":"RF","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Funnel Cake","flavor_id":"4166","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Buttercream Frosting SC","flavor_id":"8361","vendor":"WF","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Sugar Cookie","flavor_id":"2299","vendor":"RF","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Sweetness","flavor_id":"4413","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":500},{"name":"Whipped Marshmallow","flavor_id":"8744","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Vanilla Cream Extra SC","flavor_id":"8382","vendor":"WF","millipercent":1500}],"reviews":[{"user":"BigRed","text":"taste like a commercial juice that‚Äôs for sure . i like it but i think the cake texture could be slightly improved . these are my thoughts as a shake and vape . let‚Äôs see how it steeps for a few days , even after a few mins the flavor gets better .","score":4},{"user":"Skywxp3d","text":"It‚Äôs delicious! - way underrated recipe, tastes like ‚Äúhostess‚Äù if that‚Äôs a flavor üòé SO GOOD!! *UPDATE - made a second batch, I never do that!
