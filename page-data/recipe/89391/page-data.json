That's what I am attempting here. This recipe is best defined as a strawberry tart with a pistachio, graham crust. I was wanting to create something bright and refreshing to break out of the heavy eliquids that we often vape during the winter months. \r\nThe Body:\r\nA creamy light custard with a graham cracker crust incrusted with pistachio undertones. CAP Vanilla Custard, TPA Cheesecake (Graham Crust), FA Pistacchio (Pistachio).\r\nThe Top Note:\r\nSweet, fresh strawberries with sugar added. I found it hard to use just one strawberry to get that fresh, ripe strawberry that I was going for, so I built my own using FA Juicy Strawberry, TPA Strawberry (ripe), and JF Strawberry Sweet.\r\nAccent:\r\nThe pistachio is part of the body of this recipe but also lends itself to the accent note on the end of the vape.\r\nA 5 day steep is a minimum and I recommend 1 week. \r\nVisit Freedom To Mix on Discord https://discord.gg/SmSc8Ef\r\nVisit Freedom To Mix on FaceBook https://www.facebook.com/groups/415341418920740/ \r\n\r\nPlease comment, mix, and or rate,....it makes us all better mixers.
