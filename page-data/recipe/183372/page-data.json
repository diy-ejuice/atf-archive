It turned out pretty nice. \r\nIt’s pretty thick and rich for a milk- more like a cream that tastes like milk. The VT Vanilla Cream and VT Sweet Cream combo is so good. Then I added FLV Milk to give more of a milky taste and velvety, smooth mouthfeel. \r\nI wanted to darken it all up a bit so used FA Vanilla Bourbon as it’s a lovely, darker vanilla. FA Butterscotch also adds a bit of dark sweetness. \r\nFA Almond was an obvious choice as it’s so tasty. I used a little TFA Toasted Almond to try to bring it forward in the mix.\r\n\r\nIt needs about a week for everything to come through and balance out. It’s not bad before that. The creams are just a little light and it lacks body.
