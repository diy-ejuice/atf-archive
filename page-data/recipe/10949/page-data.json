Reminiscent of mango pure√©.\r\n\r\nFA/TPA/FLV/CAP Mango The four mangoes here all offer different notes of a mango flavour.\r\n\r\nFA Mango \r\nFull on flavour. A great mango flavour but also very dry in taste.\r\nTPA Mango \r\nThe one that turns people off mango vapes when they first try it. Pithy and over-ripe, though the earthy note is important as it adds realistic flavour to the other concentrates.\r\nCAP Sweet Mango \r\nCloying and almost overbearing, but with the sweetness and denseness of a mango.\r\nFLV Mango \r\nFLV Mango is to Mango what CAP VC V1 is to Custards. Fantastic flavour to add roundness of all the elements of mango flavours - helps to boost the other flavours without pushing any individual note too high.\r\n\r\nNone of them quite make the mark on their own (especially TPA's mango which can be quite foul.) The ratios here are quite important in my view. If you want a stronger flavour make sure that you increase each Mango flavour proportionately to each other.\r\n\r\nFA Marshmallow \r\nA classic for adding mouthfeel and density to any recipe whilst also acting as a sweetener. One of my favourite flavours.\r\n\r\nFA Lime Tahity Cold Pressed\r\nAdds that sharp, sweet tangy flavour on its own, but in this mix it helps to boost the inherent mild citrus in a mango without adding any discernable lime flavour.\r\n\r\nINW Shisha Strawberry\r\nA flavour for those who can't taste strawberries. Fantastic concentrate. In this recipe it also adds to the thick, almost cloying taste of fresh mango on your tongue.\r\n\r\nEthyl Maltol \r\nVery imporant note for this sweetener. Don't sub for sucralose - it's not the same and doesn't boost the recipe's sweetness. Instead all that it does it add a false sweet taste that doesn't sit well in here. Ethyl Maltol is perfect here as it helps to boost the inherent sweetness in each of the flavours.\r\n\r\nOptional additions:\r\n\r\nKoolada \r\nTry anywhere from 0.25-1% to add a fantastic cool feel to mimic a sort of mango smoothie.\r\n\r\nTPA Sweet Raspberry \r\n0.25-0.5% For a sharper tang, though it will alter the recipe as this flavour is very strong.\r\nHope you enjoy it!","steep_days":"0","temperature":"0","recipe_score":4.5,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:48:46.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"11555","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Mango","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Mango","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Sweet Mango","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1750},{"name":"Costarica Special (mango)","vendor":"FA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Marshmallow","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Lime Tahity Cold Pressed","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Shisha Strawberry","vendor":"INW","millipercent":1200},{"name":"Ethyl Maltol","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":250}],"reviews":[{"user":"AndreM","text":"Oh my,  one of those rarest of events - biting into a juicy, PERFECTLY ripe mango.
