So what would blue taste like to me? To put it simple... refreshing! Like a crisp winter sky. Now to emulate that into a flavor...\r\nI used FW Blueberry, but at 3.25% it's not what you are tasting here. It's a thick syrup style blueberry that is giving the HS something to sit on top of and give it some body. HS is a bright, very candied Blueberry and these two combined is very good if candy is what you're after. The jelly candy/marshmallow/Swedish gummy is to give this a chewy candy base, like a soft cloud and the whipped cream helps round the sharpness out. Sweeten it up, drop in some extreme ice, and you have my idea of blue. A cool, sky blue gummy candy that's as refreshing as it is good. \r\n**If you don't want a slight menthol note, sub the extreme ice with 1 drop koolada per 10ml or any other cooling agent...but the Menthol/mint in extreme ice adds an interesting touch.","steep_days":"2 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-06T12:54:43.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"1868","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Blueberry","vendor":"HS","millipercent":1250},{"name":"Blueberry","vendor":"FW","millipercent":3250},{"name":"Extreme Ice","vendor":"FW","millipercent":500},{"name":"Jelly Candy","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1250},{"name":"Super Sweet","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":500},{"name":"Whipped Cream","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Marshmallow","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":750},{"name":"Swedish Gummy","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1000}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"52412","name":"Cool Blue Mornings"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
