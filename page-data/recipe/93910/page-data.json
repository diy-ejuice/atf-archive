It does need a few days steep for all the flavors to marry well. This one Mixin Vixens recipe of the month\r\n\r\n*I diluted FLV Rich Cinnamon to a 10% dilution and used 0.25% as it is a VERY strong flavor and I needed the slightest hint of cinnamon to make this taste like this particular tea... but you can omit it if you don't have/like it. \r\n\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_l_bk-0ps20&t=9s\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daJ30KH0Aoc&t=9s\r\n\r\n\r\n","steep_days":"3","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:50:03.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"3295","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Blood Orange","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":250},{"name":"Hibiscus","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Hibiscus","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":250},{"name":"Italian Lemon Sicily","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":250},{"name":"Lemon Grass","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":250},{"name":"Passionfruit","vendor":"FA","millipercent":750},{"name":"Rich Cinnamon","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":20}],"reviews":[{"user":"ID10-T","text":"Love this. I pick up passionfruit first and foremost, without getting any throat pain from the stuff; seems the secret is to keep it under 1% and mix other things light with it so it still stands out, and also pair it up with things that enhance it. Lots of hibiscus here but the floral stays below the level of getting perfumy, just right for the hibiscus tea profile, and then there's lemongrass with some added citrus that seems to fit in wonderfully with the passionfruit and lemon grass without calling too much attention to itself. Nothing is sticking out as out of place, despite what looks like a whole list of difficult ingredients with the exception of CAP Hibiscus, the only one I see here that I know is forgiving and easy to work with. Rich Cinnamon to give it the earthy warmth of an herbal tea without really tasting of cinnamon? Genius.  It's light and refreshing, easy on the palate, but plenty flavorful despite the low total flavoring %. And it has a surprising amount of body to it, it's not a thin, top-heavy vape.
