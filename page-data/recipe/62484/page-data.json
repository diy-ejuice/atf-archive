With fall coming up this is one of those classic flavor combo's that I love come this time of year so I was really happy to get this ready for fall this year.\r\n\r\nFW Yellow Cake/FLV pound cake\r\nStraight up FW yellow cake is still the best around, and the texture just wouldn't come together perfectly with JF or CAP. You can use JF in the same % if you really want to, but it won't be as good. I love combining the Yellow cake with FLV pound cake for the texture it brings, and that slight off note I've heard some people describe as anise doesn't come off as anise to me, but more so the cooked, caramelized edges of a cake that really makes it stands out and sells the idea of a bundt cake with more cooked surface area. \r\n\r\nFLV cranberry \r\nThis is the perfect cranberry to me if you want a cooked cranberry in my mind. It's sweet, mildly juices, and enough tart to still come off as cranberry. It's on odd flavor in that it can get lost easy with some flavors or it can over power others just depending on what it's paired with, but this % brings it to the balance in the cake I was looking for.\r\n\r\nTFA orange cream/CAP sweet Tangerine/LA CCI/FLV Frosting\r\nThese all come together to make the orange sweet cream icing. The TFA orange cream and CCI is the main base for it, the CCI brings a super sweet icing flavor with just a slight tang, and when mixing with the TFA orange cream get's us almost all the way there, but the TFA alone lacks some of the sweet orange punch from the icing. CAP Sweet tangerine reminds me a lot of an orange juice type flavor, and just a small amount really boosts the orange sweetness like you get making a real icing with sugar and orange juice, then the FLV frosting just bumps up the density of the icing separating it from the cake so instead of getting a creamy cake you get an cake topped with icing and you catch it more on the exhale.\r\n\r\nThis one needs at least 10 days steeping for the bite of the oranges to calm down and the creams to mingle the way they should, but it really hits strides around 2 weeks.

This steep may kill me!&#xD;\n&#xD;\n*Update*  Here we are eleven days later.  I cracked it open at 9 days and the cake base was being bullied by the orange quite a bit.  After two more steeping days, I get cake and orange, but the cranberry seems a bit muted.  This may be that my sense of taste sucks after years of smoking, but I think that I'm going to bump up the amount of cranberry in my next mix to about 2.25%."}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"62484","name":"Cran'orange bundt cake"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
