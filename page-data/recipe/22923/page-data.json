There is no cream filling and if you want milk get off your ass and go to your fridge, because you won't find it in this profile.

I was pretty skeptical about it translating into a vape, but this recipe nails it and I really enjoy it.","score":5},{"user":"Burritoclock","text":"This is strange. Not bad! But hard to define. I whipped it up (had to order Oatmeal Raisin) and let it sit the 10 days and just now fired it up. It kind of nails the profile, but now I'm trying to figure out if that's a good thing in a vape. lol I definitely taste the cookie, and the oatmeal, and the raisin! I'm going 5 stars for now because it is what it said it would be. I don't know that I will want to vape it often, and I don't think it'll be for everyone, but it's a good recipe. Thanks!","score":5},{"user":"jbird","text":"Krucial is too kind! My part was small in this. &#xD;\nIf you like oatmeal raisin cookies then I have no doubt, this is for you. It's exactly that. FLV pretty much nails the raisin part but needs help with the cookie part. JF Biscuit, with the CDS, does a great job of doing that. JF Bavarian Cream and TFA Butter were the keys to keeping this from being too dry. This worked great without compromising and turning it into a cookies N' Cream recipe. &#xD;\nKrucial did a great job on this and I'm honored to be linked to this recipe. This is now in my ADV rotation. ","score":5}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"22923","name":"♡Grandma's Oatmeal Raisin Cookies♡"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
