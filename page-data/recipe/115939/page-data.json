It’s easy. It’s pretty sweet.\r\n\r\n(TPA) grape juice and (TPA) grape candy go well together to make a fairly synthetic/candy grape flavour. (CAP) jelly candy assists with this. I don’t really know what to say about (TPA) black currant... I suppose it’s kind of like Ribena and helps to round the flavour off nicely, I think. You can take or leave the koolada. That’s really a personal choice. It doesn’t alter the flavour profile, but I think it helps to make the whole thing pop.\r\n\r\nYou could use this as a shake and vape... I do. But I also usually make a second (bigger) batch to let it steep. I don’t usually touch that bottle until about 2 weeks.\r\n\r\nMix this one up, you will not regret it. As always, enjoy, and let me know how you feel about it. \r\n\r\nPeace ✌️ ","steep_days":"5 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-06T08:37:27.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"2450","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Grape Candy","flavor_id":"327","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Grape Juice","flavor_id":"231","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Jelly Candy","flavor_id":"2170","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Black Currant","flavor_id":"213","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Kool Effects (koolada","flavor_id":"1332","vendor":"FW","millipercent":750},{"name":"Raspberry (sweet)","flavor_id":"267","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":750}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"115939","name":"Gaping Grape"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
