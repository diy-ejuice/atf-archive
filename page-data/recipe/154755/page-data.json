He would make an extra one, just because we all loved it so much. He gave me his recipe many year ago. He began getting sick a few years ago, and so I started making the Millionaire Pie for holidays for the family at my family's request. He has since then passed away, and it has become something I make every year. Since he got sick, I have been trying to make this into a vape form, and this has gone through close to 100 iterations to try and make it \"perfect\". The problem is, it will never be perfect. This is the next iteration that I am making, and in light of Fresh03's Metal Mixing, and the song End of Heartache by Killswitch Engage, this is the first public iteration that I have released, and will release changes along the way as well. I will put notes below:\r\n\r\nThe Graham Cracker Crust: Pastry zest adds that little something that makes the authentic crust in a vape form. Graham Crust and Cinnamon Sugar make the graham cracker portion, giving a good flavor and slight texture.\r\n\r\nFilling: I did a lot of layering here to try and get the filling balanced, I feel its getting there, but as always, I will think it needs something differet. The two condensed milks add a great balance, and make for the sweet condensed milk base. The whipped creams, FLV being a very authentic whipped cream taste with a good mouthfeel; CAP adds a hint of vanilla which plays well with everything, and adds a layer of whipped cream. The cream cheese icing adds more mouthfeel and depth, as well as the cream cheese taste which is also part of the base of the pie.\r\n\r\nFilling \"Toppings\": FLV pineapple is slightly sharp, but sweet and I feel it mixes well in this. FW Butter pecan is a cream and sweet pecan, which lends a great pecan taste, the butter blending in with the rest of the creams. WF Roasted pecans and cream adds a hint of realness and the toasted pecan taste. \r\n\r\nThe mix is sweet as it is, you can put sweetener to taste. I like it sweet, and this is a very sweet dessert, so I add a touch of SS\r\n\r\nThis is a White Whale of mine, that I have been working on for too long. It will never be perfect, I can only hope to get it where I feel its \"Acceptable\". It will probably never be finished sadly.
