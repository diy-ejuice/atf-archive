I wanted to share this with all of you to enjoy some damn good and refreshing juice during these economic hardships. \r\n\r\nI present to you my Fruit From the Stars series. This one, of many others, is my hands down favorite. It's profile is a sweet and juicy guava that is beautifully blended into the complex and exotic fruit that is soursop with hints of kiwi.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is amazing off the bat, but gets even better progressively after the next 72 hours of creation. Doesn't get much better after that, but does NOT fade. \r\n\r\nHope you all enjoy this as much as I did :)\r\n","steep_days":"2 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-06T20:45:56.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"797","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Sweet Guava","flavor_id":"118","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":5000},{"name":"Pink Guava","flavor_id":"637","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":500},{"name":"Soursop","flavor_id":"4448","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Cactus","flavor_id":"647","vendor":"INW","millipercent":250},{"name":"Ruby Red Grapefruit","flavor_id":"1404","vendor":"FW","millipercent":250},{"name":"Kiwi","flavor_id":"522","vendor":"FA","millipercent":750}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"194510","name":"Fruit From the Stars: Pleiades"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
