Mix at 70VG / 30PG. Based on Wayne Walker's STRAWBERRY YOGURTS, this is my go to strawberry yoghurt. I replaced CAP Sweet Strawberry with JF's, because for me, it has much more flavour and is just the perfect strawberry syrup. I've also added CAP Marshmallow for creamier and sweeter mouthfeel. FW Hazelnut combines so well with FA Caramel and adds another depth.","steep_days":"3 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"total_reviews":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T15:20:19.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"2771","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Creamy Yogurt","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Strawberry (ripe)","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Meringue","vendor":"FA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Carmel (caramel)","vendor":"FA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Super Sweet","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":500},{"name":"Hazelnut","vendor":"FW","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Yogurt","vendor":"FA","millipercent":750},{"name":"Sweet Strawberry","vendor":"JF","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Marshmallow","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":750}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"15750","name":"Sweet Strawberry Yogurt"}}}
