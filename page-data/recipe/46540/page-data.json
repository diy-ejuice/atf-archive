I want this one to be REALLY creamy, sweet, and satisfying. I'm planning for the banana to stand out more than the blueberry. Wish me luck.\"\r\n\r\nThe above text is what I put in the description when I originally mixed this juice. I knew it would need steep time, but it was surprisingly delicious right off of the shake. I mixed a second bottle so that I could have one put away steeping steadily. A solid month later I came back to the steeping bottle, upon sampling this juice I was happily surprised. This was awesome! I really nailed this one, I had thought to myself. After a few hours I did realize  that I had over-sweetened a little bit.\r\n\r\nGiven a little bit of steep time, (3 days or so) the banana falls back a little, the blueberry jumps to the front, and the whole flavor melds together much better than it seems off the shake. \r\n","steep_days":"7 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T17:34:04.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"1366","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Blueberry","vendor":"FW","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Ripe Banana","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Banana Cream","vendor":"LA","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Cheesecake (graham Crust)","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2500},{"name":"New York Cheesecake","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Graham Cracker Clear","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Super Sweet","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":500}],"reviews":[{"user":"cdaniell30","text":"Can't give a rating because I subbed WF banana puree for TFA ripe banana, but as I mixed it, it turned out excellent."}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"46540","name":"BlueNana Cheesecake"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
