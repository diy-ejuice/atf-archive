Flavorful. Delicious.**\r\n  \r\nJF Yellow Cake needed a slight kick in the pants to become more 'cakey'. TFA Vanilla Cupcake filled that role perfectly. Without TFA VC, this mix is 'flat'.\r\n  \r\nIt took me awhile to settle on the right combination of strawberries for my topping. I wanted the taste of pie filling, as well as fresh strawberries. TFA Strawberry Ripe with TFA Tfa Strawberry works EVERY time. \r\n  \r\nTFA Whipped Cream is used here, not just for it's authenticity, but also because it allows the layers to stay in place. CAP VWC tends to obliterate layers. Yeah, it's amazingly delicious-but I wanted to keep the layers in place here.\r\n  \r\nTFA Marshmallow is something I've always found not present in most DIY Shortcake recipes. I just love it. Not only does it lend to the \"mouthfeel\" I was imagining...it also adds a special 'surprise' for your mouth!\r\n  \r\nIf you mix this up as is(meaning no substitutions) please consider leaving an honest review under the 'review' tab.\r\n  \r\nThis is quite good 'fresh', but after 5-8 days, the marshmallow, whipped cream & cake begin to pop. \r\n  \r\nI have a hard time keeping this in stock. As soon as I make it I vape it. Very difficult to steep. 'Fresh' the liquid is clear. At 20 days, it becomes a very pale yellow. \r\n  \r\nI've not tried this in a tank, as I usually use RDAs. If you tank it, and like or hate it...please leave an honest comment/review stating so. Feedback is considered very important to me.\r\n  \r\nI'd like to thank my entire crew at **#EJUICEMAKERS** for their constant support. Without them...I would not be mixing today. Love you all!!\r\n  \r\n*Please do not use this recipe for commercial profit. Please do not post to other eliquid recipe sites without asking permission.
