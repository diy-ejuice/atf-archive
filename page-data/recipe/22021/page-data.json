Nutty Nana makes the best treats but she has a bit of a smoking habit.\r\nI'm starting Soho (FA) at 4% because it needs to be there but I wanted it to just sit there so that it is strong and creamy yet won't kill you. Now we get to the fun part Banana and Peanut Butter , Banana Cream (TFA) at 4% creates a decent banana flavor and Peanut Butter (TFA) at 3% adds just the right amount of peanut to go with the banana cream to mesh with the Soho , the Cheesecake (graham crust) (TFA) at 2% adds the Graham cracker flavor and more cream (as if we needed any) it also adds a certain warmth to the overall flavor , Bavarian Cream (JF) adds cream of course but it also adds fullness and body , Cookie (FA) at 2% helps the graham cracker and adds a nice dessert feel. The Super Sweet (CAP) 0.5% IS NEEDED but can be subbed for Sweetener (TFA) at 1.5%.\r\n\r\nThat's it folks ... Tasty after just one nights steep but like NANA she just gets better with age.","steep_days":"0 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T10:43:11.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"1672","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Soho","flavor_id":"413","vendor":"FA","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Banana Cream","flavor_id":"210","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Peanut Butter","flavor_id":"291","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Cheesecake (graham Crust)","flavor_id":"152","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Super Sweet","flavor_id":"2384","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":500},{"name":"Cookie","flavor_id":"490","vendor":"FA","millipercent":2000}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"22021","name":"Nutty Nana"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
