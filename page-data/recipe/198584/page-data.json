A steep should make this much better . i’m using blueberry muffin and yellow cake as the waffle with a little waffle to give it some crisp also some white cake to fluff it up a bit . the blueberry jam and blueberry gummy candy make up for the jelly and the peanutbutter .. well you know why that’s there lol . If everyone likes this one i will come out with a strawberry version ","steep_days":"7 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"total_reviews":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T23:39:05.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"635","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Blueberry Muffin","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Yellow Cake","vendor":"JF","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Waffle","vendor":"CC","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Fluffy White Cake SC","vendor":"WF","millipercent":500},{"name":"Peanut Butter","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":5000},{"name":"Blueberry Jam SC","vendor":"WF","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Blueberry Gummy Candy SC","vendor":"WF","millipercent":750},{"name":"Sweetness","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":500}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"198584","name":"PBJ Waffle - Blueberry"}}}
