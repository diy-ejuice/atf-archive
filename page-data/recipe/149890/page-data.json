I think the pastry/cinnamon combination that this have is amazing for a simple recipe like this one.\r\n\r\nNow in order to smoothe and add more mouthfell and a creamy layer I went with TPA Banana cream and TPA Vanilla swirl. Those two make the cinnamon more soft and delicate. And the TPA Banana cream adds like a hole new twist, more like a surprise element... And that's it!! just 3 flavors but a very great juice in my oppinion.\r\n\r\nAs a SNV i have to say its really good but simple, with not much mouthfeel so I encourage you to wait from 3 to 7 days... That way it feels more balanced and I hope it will give you nice a surprise.\r\n\r\nHope you guys like it and please leave behind a review.","steep_days":"4 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T23:37:38.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"2245","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Cinnamon Danish Swirl","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Banana Cream","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Vanilla Swirl","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Super Sweet","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":500}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"149890","name":"Easy Cinnamon Roll!!"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
