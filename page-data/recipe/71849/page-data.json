In this recipe at 0.5% it's only used to backup the Blue raz and strawberry and to give it a little bit more of that Raspberry punch.\r\n\r\nRf sc Blue raz - I've been enjoying this concentrate quite a bit. It's got a nice candy vibe to it and 2% here is plenty enough for me.\r\n\r\nFa juicy strawberry - I love this strawberry. I've seen some people saying they can't taste it... well I can taste it and it tastes great to me. 1.5% gives this recipe a nice bright juicy punch in the face and really livens up the mix. For me it's a perfect fit here, you can taste a nice bit of strawberry and it sweetens up the mix.\r\n\r\nFa Oba Oba - Here for mouthfeel and to makes these berries taste even sweeter. I have to restrain myself from using oba oba in most of my mixes but it's a good fit here as I was going for straight candy berry crack sweetness. 0.75% is more then enough.\r\n\r\nFa Sour Wizard - This is THE additive for me. Really gives mixes that little extra somethin' somethin'. I use it at 0.25% and that's really all you need most of the time. This stuff is so dank, my tfa sour is so jelly. \r\n\r\nSteep 2-3 days but is a decent s&v.
