By golly I think I did it. \r\n\r\nFA UP is used as the main profile here for a coffee almost espresso flavour.  The FA Caramel and TFA Vanilla Bean Gelato bring the UP right UP there adding in a smooth creamy touch to this package really rounding up that coffee, and the Caramel adding in some sweetness.  Finally, Zeppola here I wanted to add some sort of doughnut base without being in your face.  At 4% it's doing just that but in turn making a well rounded delicious vape.
