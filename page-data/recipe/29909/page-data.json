This one is similar to a Lava Flow which is coconut, strawberry, banana, and pineapple.\r\n\r\nThis is a mix that will be full of in-your-face-flavor so keep that in mind before ordering/mixing.\r\n\r\nHangsen Pineapple I find to be the best pineapple for this mix. INW Pineapple may work here but other pineapples I've tried just don't cut it for a tropical mix.\r\n\r\nFeel free to sub FLV Coconut with 1% TFA Coconut Extra or use whatever coconut you like.\r\n\r\nAs usual, don't add heat or 'air out' these mixes for best taste. This one is certified shake 'n' vape, better with time.","steep_days":"1 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-11T14:15:50.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"2556","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Banana Cream","flavor_id":"916","vendor":"LA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Coconut","flavor_id":"640","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Pineapple","flavor_id":"2097","vendor":"HS","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Strawberry","flavor_id":"668","vendor":"INW","millipercent":500},{"name":"Strawberry (ripe)","flavor_id":"271","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":6000}],"reviews":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"29909","name":"Lava Flow"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
