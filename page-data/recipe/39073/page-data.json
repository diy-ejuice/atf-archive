This mix blends perfectly with the fruit and light cream ratio.  I wanted to make it very simple. \r\n\r\nTPA STRAWBERRY RIPE gives it that true fruit feel. Almost that natural ripeness. \r\n\r\nTPA APRICOT & PINEAPPLE is what you really taste here. Together they almost give it a tart sweetness. \r\n\r\nTPA RASPBERRY SWEET gives it sweetness that's add to the other flavors without destroying coils.\r\n\r\nTFA VBIC blends it all together. It really doesn't serve as a cream just helps glue the fruit together.\r\n\r\nAdd koolada if you'd like for some coolness.","steep_days":"3 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"total_reviews":2,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:49:14.000-05:00","best_vg":"80%","views":"2290","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Apricot","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Strawberry (ripe)","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Raspberry (sweet)","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Pineapple","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Vanilla Bean Ice Cream","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1500}],"reviews":[{"user":"cdaniell30","score":"5","text":"This has been in my ADV rotation since it was shared.
