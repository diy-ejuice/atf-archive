This mix blends perfectly with the fruit and light cream ratio.  I wanted to make it very simple. \r\n\r\nTPA STRAWBERRY RIPE gives it that true fruit feel. Almost that natural ripeness. \r\n\r\nTPA APRICOT & PINEAPPLE is what you really taste here. Together they almost give it a tart sweetness. \r\n\r\nTPA RASPBERRY SWEET gives it sweetness that's add to the other flavors without destroying coils.\r\n\r\nTFA VBIC blends it all together. It really doesn't serve as a cream just helps glue the fruit together.\r\n\r\nAdd koolada if you'd like for some coolness.","steep_days":"3 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"updated_at":"2020-12-12T11:50:46.000-05:00","best_vg":"80%","views":"2294","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Apricot","flavor_id":"209","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Strawberry (ripe)","flavor_id":"271","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Raspberry (sweet)","flavor_id":"267","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Pineapple","flavor_id":"259","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Vanilla Bean Ice Cream","flavor_id":"186","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1500}],"reviews":[{"user":"cdaniell30","text":"This has been in my ADV rotation since it was shared.
