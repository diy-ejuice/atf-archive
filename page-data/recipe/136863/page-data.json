It was a great idea, well-crafted from the best ingredients at the time. But at the time was more than two years ago. We’ve got better tools for this job now. FE Green Tea is better than TFA (grass) or FA (ass) but it’s still too floral, thankfully we now have **FLV Eisai Tea**, which tastes much closer to the matcha flavoring in those Green Tea Kit Kats. **WF Crispy Wafer** also better job than CAP Sugar Cookie in getting that crispy inside. I’ve replaced TFA White Chocolate with a combination of **FLV and FW White Chocolates** – no more black pepper and a great combination of top and mid-range notes that I'm again stealing from @jbird – and added some sweetness. Earlier versions were missing some creaminess, so I carried over one ingredient from the original recipe, **CAP Vanilla Whipped Cream**, which fills a small gap in the white chocolate duo.

It's easily a hundred orders of flavor magnitude better than the original. I'm going to agree with jbird here, the combination of CAP Vanilla Whipped Cream with his white chocolate base has actually changed my opinion on white chocolate vapes forever. It makes the white chocolate here creamy, full-bodied, and it doesn't fade out on me at all. I ran through my bottle of this beautiful creation faster than anything I've made before. The Eisai Tea is an obvious choice for matcha, but the perfect balance Dave achieved with such a potent flavor is remarkable. Crispy Wafer does exactly what the label says it's going to do, it adds a delicate, crispy wafer that manages to still stand out under all of that delicious white chocolate cream. "},{"user":"jbird","score":"5","text":"First off, I appreciate the mention. Of course you took that WC base and made it better. The combo of the white chocolates and vanilla whipped cream are fantastic! These, plus the sweetener, really drive home that full-bodied, creamy mouthfeel. Not only does the Eisai Tea work great, it sits in that chocolate base and is balanced perfectly. You get none of those dirty lawn clipping notes that usual comes with green tea flavors. I find the Crispy Wafer somewhat subtle on the inhale but comes through on the back end of the vape. It adds another layer of texture that really makes this recipe come off as complex. &#xD;\nI'm very familiar with this delicious candy bar. The original recipe left me convinced that I wouldn't enjoy this in a vape. This was at no fault of the creator. She tackled a very hard profile and used what was available, at the time. But this recipe not only delivers, it's scary accurate to the actual candy bar.  I really can't express in words how satisfying this recipe is to me. No more driving to Chinatown just to pick a bag of these up. So a BIG thank you to Dave from me and my wallet! An instant ADV. Thank you for sharing another great recipe! "},{"user":"Silky","score":"5","text":"Absolutely delicious. Eisai tea is the perfect  matcha/green tea flavor for this profile! I've been using this white chocolate  base for ages. It's awesome. Knocked it out of the park with this one Dave.  Killer remix. Thanks for letting me taste test it!"}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"136863","name":"GTKK 2019"}}}
