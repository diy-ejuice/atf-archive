They all compliment each other beautifully. Mix this one up and thank me later. Just so its known in no way would i consider this a tobacco recipe.  Its more of a buttery  dark creamy goodness. Whatever it is i can't put it down. I love it so maybe just maybe you will too. I am willing to bet this will become absolutely amazing with a long steep but as is i love it after a 2 day steep but i feel after 5 days its definitely better. Enjoy!\r\n\r\n\r\nSweetener: I used .50% flavor west sweetener but feel free to use more or less of your sweetener of choice.","steep_days":"5","temperature":"420","recipe_score":5,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:50:25.000-05:00","best_vg":"75%","views":"6240","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Milk & Honey","flavor_id":"609","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Toffee Ice Cream","flavor_id":"8987","vendor":"VT","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Brown Sugar","flavor_id":"313","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Madagascar (Vanilla Classic)","flavor_id":"526","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Ry4 Double","flavor_id":"379","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":3000}],"reviews":[{"user":"alexmori","text":"Amazing!

Thanks for sharing!"},{"user":"G8RH8R23","text":"Dude this is a great vape. Mixed up a 30ml and let it sit for a few days. A dark and creamy vape with just the right amount of sweetness. For me, this replaces ry4u in my rotation. Awesome job!"},{"user":"Seakow","text":"Brown Sugar is a bit high for my personal taste, but I've had some bad experiences with it in the past so I'm not going to knock the flavor for my own person issues. Great recipe as always Rory!"},{"user":"Hawger03","text":"Dark and delicious with tons of yummy caramel and creme brulee coming through at the end.  RY4 flavor on inhale but not much tobacco.  This is a luscious decadent vape.  Currently dripping and loving it!"},{"user":"Gordo","text":"Excellent recipe. Deep, rich, smooth"}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"116411","name":"Y-NOT?"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
