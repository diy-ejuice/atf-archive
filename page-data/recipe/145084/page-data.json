Thereâ€™s a little bit of harshness from it. Do you know which flavor is giving that harshness?"},{"user":"matthewkocanda","text":"Before I dive into this, I want to say this recipe is a trip down memory lane, and yet, I can't explain what it reminds me of. All I know is that every exhale reminds me of the first few months of vaping. There's something about the profile that gives me so much nostalgia to some of the first e-liquids I bought from vape shops when I first started. So straight away, I genuinely love this recipe. Now, on to a proper review. The use of ingredients here is near perfection. I've used CAP Lemon Lime a whole lot in my career as a mixer, and this might be one of the best uses I've ever experienced. It stays prominent in the mix, but doesn't carry some of the strange off notes that the concentrate sometimes has. I'm assuming that's due to the use of VT Fizzy Sherbet to add brightness and depth to an otherwise linear flavor. FW Grape Soda is a banger on it's own, but can sometimes be used incorrectly. Here, we see that 1% working beautifully in order to add that subtle grape note, without completely overpowering the other nuances of the mix. I absolutely love this recipe, it doesn't feel medicinal (which I feel happens from time to time with anything grape in mixing), it has a perfect blend of tart citrus, dark grape, and sweet candy. Great use of flavors in this one, expert navigation of some easily misused concentrates, and an overall enjoyable vape. This will remain in my rotation."}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"145084","name":"Leanin' 2.0"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
