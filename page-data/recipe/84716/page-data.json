There seems to be a lack of tropical fruit recipes compared to other profiles, but this one delivers.  It also does so without leaning on any major flavor staples that are usually employed.  The criminally underused jackfruit is is main note here but the papaya has just enough room to stretch its legs without getting funky or overpowering.  The lime and pear don't come through so much as flavors as they just add some tartness and wetness. Overall it's bright and refreshing and delightful.  I might be stealing this as the basic foundation for some tropical recipes in the future."},{"user":"OldAgeVaper","text":"Great tasty eliquid well full of flavor and hitting my taste buds making my mouth water.&#xD;\nTried this just in time for my holiday and a damn good job i showed faith and mixed a 100ml lol  :)&#xD;\nI bet this would be nice if you added a touch of chill to it also .&#xD;\nvaping in a hurricane 1.3 , 0.5 ohms with 3.8 volts.&#xD;\n&#xD;\nGrats ! nice mix budwell worth a 5 star."}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"84716","name":"Oxygen"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
