I was given 10ml of a clone he had bought to get an idea of what I was aiming for. It tasted bad, so from research I set about remixing what I imagined it should taste like. I was just starting out in the world of full DIY so my flavouring choices were limited along with my experience but I think I came up with something pretty reasonable.\r\n\r\nBanana Cream - (TPA). I tried a few banana flavours but wanted something that was light, sweet and creamy, not too realistic. This one seems to fit the bill and at 4% shines through as the main note.\r\n\r\nButterscotch & Butterscotch Ripple - (Flavor West). I love these two flavours. I find the combination keeps up that creaminess level and gives a nice rounded caramel/butterscotch base for that banana to sit on.\r\n\r\nCaramel - (Flavor Art). Just a touch here to boost the Butterscotch's and add a bit more depth to that caramel base.\r\n\r\nCinnamon Danish Swirl - (Capella) I played around with various ratio's for with this one as some people are afraid of cinnamon. If your not a fan feel free to knock it down .5 or 1% but at 2.5% I personally find it shines through without overpowering the recipe.\r\n\r\nCoconut - (TPA) A little back note I thought I detected in the clone sample i received to work off.  It just sits nicely in the background to add a sneaky back note.\r\n\r\nMeringue - (Flavor Art). This is just to add a bit more sweetness without adding any sweeteners and to try and pull everything together, add a bit of lightness, and tone down the cinnamon danish swirl a touch.\r\n\r\nVanilla Swirl - (TPA) The main vanilla base for all that lovely butterscotch, caramel, banana and cinnamon to sit in. I wanted to key the creamy vanilla base light so avoided using any heavy creams.\r\n\r\nSo that's my first recipe posted here. If you do mix it I'd love to hear your thoughts or suggestions on improving it. \r\n\r\nCheers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","steep_days":"5","temperature":"0","recipe_score":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-10T16:00:00.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"1311","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Banana Cream","flavor_id":"210","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Butterscotch Ripple","flavor_id":"1217","vendor":"FW","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Butterscotch","flavor_id":"1216","vendor":"FW","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Carmel (caramel)","flavor_id":"503","vendor":"FA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Cinnamon Danish Swirl","flavor_id":"35","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Coconut","flavor_id":"317","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Meringue","flavor_id":"530","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Vanilla Swirl","flavor_id":"189","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1500}],"reviews":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"42154","name":"Fatboy Remix - Not Too Shabby."}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
