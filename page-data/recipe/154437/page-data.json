From the first time I blanched that first sprig and caramelized it in a modest pot pan meal with kipfler potatoes & a tender lamb shank carrying all that flavour, I was in love. While I understand that may sound pretentious, flavour has always been my passion. \r\n\r\nNow, unfortunately there isn't a lamb concentrate and even if there was, it wouldn't transfer into a pleasant eLiquid in my opinion. However the the complex sweetness of rosemary has me so besotted that I felt it was worth trying to find a profile where it can work in an eLiquid. \r\n\r\nAfter experimenting and researching many recipes, the pairing of rosemary with lemon contrasting against a bakery was by far the loveliest. \r\n\r\nThank you to the loveliness of Inawera's Rosemary concentrate, this was made possible with incredible authenticity. It needs to be to be used with restraint to ensure you don't over power a recipe with herbaciousness.  Restraint is key and using it in balance with other concentrates is essential to ensure that gorgeous complex sweetness shines light through a recipe. In my opinion 1% would be the highest point I would take this concentrate to avoid it from offending. \r\n\r\nIn this recipe I have utilized the new \"Lemon Squares\" concentrate by Wonder Flavors which gives a perfect baseline of dense bakery with slight & light sweet lemon tones. \r\nI enhanced the bakery by complimenting it with a little Flavorah Pastry Zest which offers some authentic biscuit base bakery tones along with some convincing lemon zest. \r\nThe Loranne Cream Cheese Icing was also used with restraint to balance the tones of the lemon & to get a little bit of sweetness, as well as bring some lovely texture into this recipe. \r\nTo help balance this recipe and assist with a fullness through the middle of this profile, I used the reliable INW custard. It also helps to smooth off some edges of the high notes. \r\nI took a little calculated risk to use OOO powdered sugar as a sweetener here. It works as that type of sweet dust you get on those higher end cafe bakeries and comes in a little after a good steep. \r\nThe real hero in this recipe is of course the the Inawera Rosemary. It is so authentic and has played a lovely complimentary role that makes this recipe as unique as it is beautiful . Offering that complimentary unique sweetness has simply worked this into a delectable all day vape. \r\n\r\nIMO this is a very pleasant and enjoyable vape on a single coil RDA at 60W with a SST single coil at 0.2 ohm \r\n\r\nI hope you enjoy this just as much as I enjoyed creating this little recipe, but let me know what you thought in the comments below. \r\n\r\nSeriously if you like a solid recipe that works give it a go!\r\n\r\nCheers for reading this far, now go and get mixing!\r\n\r\n\"Together, Let's Discover!!!\"\r\n\r\nFacebook - https://www.facebook.com/groups/diydownunder/\r\nDiscord - https://discord.gg/kH4Fqbc\r\nYoutube - https://www.youtube.com/c/diydownunder\r\nWebsite - https://www.diydownunder.com/\r\nInstagram IGTV : @diydownunder","steep_days":"5","temperature":"0","recipe_score":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-10T17:58:19.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"994","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Cream Cheese Icing","flavor_id":"2380","vendor":"LA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Custard","flavor_id":"4210","vendor":"INW","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Lemon Squares SC","flavor_id":"10263","vendor":"WF","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Pastry Zest","flavor_id":"8562","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":500},{"name":"Powdered Sugar","flavor_id":"6522","vendor":"OOO","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Shisha Rosemary","flavor_id":"837","vendor":"INW","millipercent":500}],"reviews":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"154437","name":"Lemon Rosemary Slice "}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
