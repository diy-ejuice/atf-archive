After a couple of misses trying to mix this I think I have finally gotten close. I still want to try and swop out the TFA Vanilla Custard with FA Custard Premium to see if it creates a more mouthful of creaminess when paired with the creams. I have dropped the Malted milk down to 2.5 where it was previously at 4, it can be a bit overwhelming at such a high percentage.\r\nI have mixed this at 70/30 and let it steep for about a week and it tasted amazing. I then left it to steep one more week and OMG, I cannot put down my Vape. This is definitely a winner, although I feel it can still be tweaked slightly to make it even more amazing. Maybe a V2 on the way","steep_days":"10","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"total_reviews":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T09:45:13.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"1881","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Malted Milk (conc)","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Cream Fresh","vendor":"FA","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Strawberry (ripe)","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":6000},{"name":"Sweet Strawberry","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Juicy Strawberry","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Sweetness","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":500},{"name":"Vanilla Custard","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Bavarian Cream","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1000}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"149130","name":"Strawberry Malted Milk"}}}
