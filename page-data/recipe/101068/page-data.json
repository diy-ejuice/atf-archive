I been mixing with so much sweet guava and it really is the miracle of this mix. Never tried the original either but i don't think i need to.   "},{"user":"Ebc88","score":"5","text":"Never tried the original but this remix sure is tasty. Like all the others said it is very smooth. I expected a little harshness only steeped it 3 days and with all fruits and citrusâ€™ &amp; no creams to smooth them over I figured it would be a little sharp but i was pleasantly surprised excellent job very tasty recipe you created. I Need to remember to make another batch this summer and add some coolant"},{"user":"amouthforwar","score":"5","text":"I'm piggy-backing off @HarvestMoon here, SNV is fucking phenomenal. Insanely smooth and lush. I literally said \"holy shit\" before I could even exhale my first puff of this stuff. Gotta give some credit to the folks who made the retail juice for designing an excellent profile, but for a DIY remix you hit this one out of the ballpark and then some @Mathematical. Stellar mix here, can't wait to see how it steeps, if it lasts that long :) Would love to see you do a mix with mostly the same components but with the nectarine. Bet it would be awesome if you could find the right nectarine concentrate to fit, but I trust your judgment after this one."},{"user":"HarvestMoon","score":"5","text":"Shake and vape is very nice.. actually insanely smooth.. will have to make another batch let that one steep a bit and get back to you."}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"101068","name":"Pacha Mama (remix)"}}}
