One just does not tire of this juice. Thank you for the recipe."},{"user":"Threesixtyzero","score":"5","text":"Been chasing a good menthol. Watermelon crack has been my jam...This is, in my opinion, way better than any menthol vape I've tried. So powerful and strong. Delicious sweet taste. Tastes the same throughout the entire day. I will probably only vape this for the rest of my life :) chills you to the bone. Really would like to see some variations"},{"user":"Skywxp3d","score":"5","text":"Really satisfying, amazing how you get such a sweet flavor from the mint! I'd love to see more recipes , maybe add some fruits or creams? Maybe I'll try! "},{"user":"RuntDastardly","score":"5","text":"Wow! Cap Cool Mint + INW Natural Mint! What a killer combo! Cool, refreshing, and just sweet enough. I didn't have FW Menthol, so I subbed with FE Menthol at the same percentage, and *man*, this is fantastic. I haven't had a good menthol vape in awhile, and I've *definitely* never had one this good."}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"33598","name":"Qebui's Gust"}}}
