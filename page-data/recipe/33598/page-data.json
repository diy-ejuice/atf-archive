Watermelon crack has been my jam...This is, in my opinion, way better than any menthol vape I've tried. So powerful and strong. Delicious sweet taste. Tastes the same throughout the entire day. I will probably only vape this for the rest of my life :) chills you to the bone.

Cool, refreshing, and just sweet enough. I didn't have FW Menthol, so I subbed with FE Menthol at the same percentage, and *man*, this is fantastic. I haven't had a good menthol vape in awhile, and I've *definitely* never had one this good.","score":5}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"33598","name":"Qebui's Gust"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
