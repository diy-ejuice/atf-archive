A fall favorite! Infamously sticky and famously delicious! This is my take on the nostalgic caramel apple lollipop that I'm sure we all remember from our days of tearing it up on the playground, with just the lightest touch of cinnamon mixed in.\r\n\r\nJF Fuji - Yummy green apple, used at a high percentage for a strong forward flavor\r\nFA Caramel - Sticky caramel candy flavor\r\nFLV Butterscotch - Sweetens and thickens the caramel, making it a bit creamier\r\nCAP Cinnamon Danish Swirl - Adds a nice pinch of cinnamon and the pastry notes push the caramel further to the chewy side\r\nTFA Strawberry Ripe - Adds a lot of fruity sweetness without distracting from the flavor profile\r\nFA Lemon Sicily - Brightens the apple, calms the cinnamon way down, binds the caramel and apple together. This is totally the ingredient that makes the whole thing work.\r\n\r\nReally needs a 3 day steep to come together.","steep_days":"3","temperature":"","recipe_score":5,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:48:51.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"1846","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Fuji","vendor":"JF","millipercent":3500},{"name":"Strawberry (ripe)","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Cinnamon Danish Swirl","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Carmel (caramel)","vendor":"FA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Butterscotch","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Lemon Sicily","vendor":"FA","millipercent":500}],"reviews":[{"user":"Billywilly","text":"I'm enjoying this recipe.
