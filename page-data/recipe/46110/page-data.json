Very glad that I was finally able to track the flavor down since this is delicious. I am a huge huge fan of Largo's Lament, and I am now torn on which one I like better. Largo's Lament has an amazing addition of white chocolate which I really enjoyed, but this is the perfect key lime recipe. At the end of the day, I have to give it to largo milk just for the fact that it reaches full potential in about half the time that Largo's Lament does!"},{"user":"Rubicone","text":"Largo Milk is a great one. For me it needs 10 days to blend and... You have to try it. Thanks for share it!!!"},{"user":"RainbowDragon","text":"I was reluctant to vape lime, fearing that it would be overpowering or sour and nasty. This key lime pie has changed my mind on what a juice can be. Refreshing yet creamy and smooth just like a bite of the real thing. I waited for it to steep and regret not making a bigger bottle right away. Fantastic. 10/10 would recommend"},{"user":"Joni","text":"Great recipe. My new favorite key lime pie."},{"user":"bjorama","text":"Haven't found many fruit mixes that can pull me away from the Vanilla Custards but DAMN.  I never looked at lime and my vape and thought they would make me this satisfied.  Alot of ingredients and I mixed it as directed.  Don't know if I can pick out what everything is doing but all I can say its down right delicious.  It's been 7 hours and my tester is empty.  That just doesn't happen very often.  5 Stars not cuz its \"decent\" and could use this or that... 5 Stars means its getting mixed in the biggest bottle I have because it's perfect as is .  5 stars because its a no brainer ADV, and SHAKE AND VAPE Certified.  If your like me and a hard sell on fruity profiles, mix it now.    Lime....    really?    Hey honey, I like lime!!"},{"user":"Slippaz","text":"Excellent work on this recipe!  The description says that it's \"heavy on the cream,\" and that's not false; but that richness cuts through the key lime beautifully to create a nice, balanced vape with just a hint of graham cracker mixing in with the bitterness of the key lime.  Delicious, and the recipe I always reach for when I need a fix of this type of profile."},{"user":"Ebc88","text":"Brought this with to the beach and it doesnâ€™t disappoint. Creaminess and crust like trxture is on point. Lime is coming through perfectly without any harshness excellent job"},{"user":"horizonism","text":"Only let this steep for two days, and it's already amazing. Surprised it hasn't had more love. It's a solid &amp; very finely balanced mix. I'll try to pop back with more notes when / if I get to the 5 day mark. Or (more likely) when I come back to my second bottle in a little while. Thanks for sharing! "}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"46110","name":"Largo Milk"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
