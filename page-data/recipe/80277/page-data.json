Excellent job wanye "},{"user":"ObiWanCannoli","text":"Had to sub in Strawberry SC (RF) at the same percentage as I dont yet have Juicy Strawberry from FA. This recipe is awesome and is the first yogurt recipe I have truly loved ! This recipe shows off what a great flavoring Capella Creamy Yogurt is. The kiwi and strawberry combine beautifully here to push that commercial yogurt flavor to the max. The yogurt base is simple but really nails that yogurt taste and feel. Fresh off the shake I decided to try it and ended up vaping my whole 10ml tester that evening. I am mixing up a much larger bottle now and will let this steep a week if I can resist. This recipe is sweet and the flavors are bold which is just what the doctor ordered. A great simple recipe man keep up the good work!"},{"user":"Bjorncoetsee","text":"Looks good.
