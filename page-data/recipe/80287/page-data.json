In particular, using FA Pandoro to make a Chocolate Pandoro Cake, a Christmas dessert an Italian student had been telling me about. However, due to its inescapablely lemon cake flavour, FA Pandoro was dropped from the recipe and different flavours were used to achieve a Chocolate Pandoro Cake profile. \r\n\r\nCake layer\r\nFLV Pound Cake/JF Yellow Cake  - this makes up the cake portion of the recipe. \r\n\r\nFA Joy/ Flv Cookie dough/ CAP Butter Cream:  FA Joy lends the yeast notes you find in a Pandoro Cake and 0.5% is just enough not to get too overpowering. Strangely enough, It also happens to go beautifully with chocolate. FA Joy also helps separate the frosting from the cake so preventing it from being a just a creamy chocolate cake.  FLV Cookie Dough is the chocolatey cake batter which softens and mellows the cake  Cap Butter Cream provides the rich buttery notes you get in a Pandoro cake and enhances the frosting layer.\r\n\r\nFrosting\r\nFLV Frosting/Cap Vanilla Whipped Cream:  FLV Frosting was used despite the painful 2 week steep it requires. Cap Vanilla Whipped cream softens the frosting and smooths out the cake.\r\n\r\nChocolate layer\r\nHS Australian Chocolate is a semii-darkish  chocolate with cocoa notes and is enhanced by the sweeter FLV Milk chocolate. FLV Coconut was added to further complement the chocolate and accent the cake.  Didn't want the Chocolate too rich or to be a top-note flavour,  just wanted it to blend in and provide a more background note. FLV Milk chocolate can be quite potent so it was orginally added low at 0.15 % then upped to 0.45%.\r\n\r\nA Chocolate Cake flavour could have been used to simplify things (LB Lava Cake is in the post) but mixing in chocolate flavours with a cake base is a good way to learn about both.\r\n\r\nOverall, the recipe turned out well. It's not too rich but quite smooth and satisfying as chocolate vapes go.\r\n\r\nNoted: Ep. 24 - Cakes (DIY E-liquid Flavor Notes) \r\nhttps://diyordievaping.com/2017/11/07/noted-ep-24-cakes-diy-e-liquid-flavoring-notes/\r\n","steep_days":"5","temperature":"0","recipe_score":4,"updated_at":"2020-12-12T18:29:36.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"1985","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Frosting","flavor_id":"4412","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":750},{"name":"Vanilla Whipped Cream","flavor_id":"1","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Butter Cream","flavor_id":"3","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Coconut","flavor_id":"640","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":250},{"name":"Pound Cake","flavor_id":"4306","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Yellow Cake","flavor_id":"4560","vendor":"JF","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Joy","flavor_id":"401","vendor":"FA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Australian Chocolate","flavor_id":"2657","vendor":"HS","millipercent":500},{"name":"Milk Chocolate","flavor_id":"4389","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":450},{"name":"Cookie Dough","flavor_id":"4373","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":750}],"reviews":[{"user":"Bjorncoetsee","text":"Looks great ","score":4}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"80287","name":"Pandoro al Cacao (chocolate pandoro cake)"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
