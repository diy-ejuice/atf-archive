Based on reviews on noted I went with M-Style because of it's semi close flavor to malrboro (which is what I used to smoke) and FLV Classic cigarette because it is dirty and ashy. I added Black fire for that smoky flavor and DNB for the ash tray flavor. Vanilla because you do feel a hint of vanilla, small but present on Malrboro, it provides a very very light accent. Fa Bitter Wizard to lower the sweetness from the VG.","steep_days":"7","temperature":"450","recipe_score":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-11T14:04:55.000-05:00","best_vg":"55%","views":"2031","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"M-Style","flavor_id":"3615","vendor":"SC","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Classic Cigarette","flavor_id":"4358","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":500},{"name":"Black Fire","flavor_id":"458","vendor":"FA","millipercent":250},{"name":"Tobacco Dirty Neutral (dnb)","flavor_id":"2186","vendor":"INW","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Cured Tobacco","flavor_id":"630","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":750},{"name":"Bourbon (vanilla Bourbon)","flavor_id":"420","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Bitter Wizard","flavor_id":"464","vendor":"FA","millipercent":300}],"reviews":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"151985","name":"cigarette"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
