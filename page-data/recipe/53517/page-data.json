Don't get me wrong, this \"house mix\" is what almost everybody where I'm from keeps on-hand at all times...It's that damn good.  He uses apricot where you have mango.  I've been trying to nail the house mix for months now, and you just put me miles ahead of where I was with this, but I think I prefer your use of mango here...at least through the summer months.  Excellent work, this is going in my ADV rotation for sure."}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"53517","name":"Hawaiian Breeze"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
