I think they were probably going for an American Spirit type of tobacco, and I think they did a really good job with this one.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe FLV Clove is just asking to be paired with a tobacco for a Kretek style vape. It is bold yet not overwhelming, rich without being dry or harsh, and has nuance and balance. If you like clove at all you need to get this one.\r\n\r\n\r\nA fairly simple and straightforward recipe, but if you're looking for a good clove tobacco vape this will probably be up your alley. Still tweaking %s here and there but so far this is my favorite iteration.","steep_days":"5","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"updated_at":"2020-12-12T14:05:20.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"3184","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Clove","flavor_id":"639","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":250},{"name":"Native Tobacco","flavor_id":"4393","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1500}],"reviews":[{"user":"Jwolfe1525","text":"Ordered the flavors after watching the Noted tobacco episode because I love Djarum Black.   I made a 10ml sample tester at 12mg and after the shake it has very good flavor, nothing is overpowering anything else and it tastes pretty damn close to the real deal.  The only real difference is where the sweetness comes from, instead of it on your lips after the draw it's on the exhale.  Im vaping it on an authentic KFL 2019 with Coilology mtl micro alien Claptons @ 0.7ohm and 25w and absolutely love the flavor.  Will be mixing a couple more bottles so I can steep it and see how it changes after a week and more.   Thank you for this recipe it's absolutely amazing and if anyone reading this likes Djarum Black I suggest you try this recipe for yourself.

Very well done.","score":5},{"user":"SlashaLO","text":"This is straight up, damn good clove cig. I don't think I can say too much more. It was very balanced. At first, I thought the clove would just overwhelm the tobacco, and off of a shake it probably would have. I actually let it sit longer than 5 days, 26 to be exact. There is NO loss of flavor, and this reminds me of the cloves that I would smoke back in the day. Love it!","score":5}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"44355","name":"Klove"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
