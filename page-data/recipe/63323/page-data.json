They serve literally hundreds of different baked goods but among them is a favorite of my Fiancé and I, their fruit tart. The crust isn’t your traditional pie crust—it’s more like cake. The cream tastes rich like custard but isn’t too sweet. On top they put blackberries, blueberries, strawberries, kiwi, and dragon fruit. They top the whole thing with a very light apricot glaze. It’s amazing.\r\nI used FA Kiwi as it was more of a real Kiwi flavor as opposed to a booster. At 1% it is present without being overbearing.\r\nCAP Dragon Fruit was a bit different from my normal use of TFA Dragon Fruit but once again I’m looking for candied pieces of fruit and not flavor boosters so this worked well at 1%\r\nFA Forest Fruit is just wonderful and covers the whole range of berries I was looking for. FA Fuji Apple complements all the fruits and brightens them up.\r\nFor the crust I used a mixture of TFA Pie Crust which is what you would normally expect from a fruit tart and mixed with the classic FW Yellow Cake. It represents the unique crust of Porto’s fruit tart perfectly.\r\nAnd that cream--- not just any cream would do. I’ve fallen in love with OOO Cream (Milky Undertones) because it can be used in just about any recipe that needs a cream note without added vanilla tones or sweetness. I took this almost as high as one should possibly use it and it works great. Combined with a light use of everyone’s favorite VC, CAP Vanilla Custard v1, this made the cream rich but not too sweet just like the real deal. The vanilla notes of CAP VC fortunately get lost in the mix and is just barely detectable.\r\nFinally to top it all off, a very light usage of FA Apricot for the glaze. \r\nBest after two weeks. This one benefits from a steep but if you insist on S&V, microwave it for 5 seconds.","steep_days":"14","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T21:32:09.000-05:00","best_vg":"75%","views":"1502","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Cream Milky Undertone PG","flavor_id":"6539","vendor":"OOO","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Vanilla Custard","flavor_id":"131","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Cake (yellow)","flavor_id":"1222","vendor":"FW","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Pie Crust","flavor_id":"179","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Forrest Mix (forest Fruit Mix)","flavor_id":"453","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Kiwi","flavor_id":"522","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Dragon Fruit","flavor_id":"49","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Fuji","flavor_id":"506","vendor":"FA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Armenia (apricot)","flavor_id":"507","vendor":"FA","millipercent":500}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"63323","name":"Tartaletas de Frutas"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
