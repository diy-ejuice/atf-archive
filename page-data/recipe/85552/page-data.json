You may want to boost the blueberry but for me it hits all the check points and is delicious!!! Hopefully you enjoy it as much as I do. There's a touch of cinnamon and a slight butterscotchy  note as well. The vanilla custard is used for the egg aspect along with a touch of vanilla. This is totally vapable on day 3 but it really holds its own after 5 days of steeping. Enjoy!!!","steep_days":"5","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"total_reviews":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T12:46:32.000-05:00","best_vg":"75%","views":"2065","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Blueberry Muffin","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":2250},{"name":"Sweet Dough","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":500},{"name":"Cinnamon Crunch","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1250},{"name":"Cream Milky Undertone PG","vendor":"OOO","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Vanilla Custard","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1500}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"85552","name":"Blueberried!! \" Blueberry Bread Pudding \""}}}
