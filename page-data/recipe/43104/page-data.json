I was roughly inspired by a commercial juice (Subjuice flavor of the same name) but this doesn't (and isn't meant to) taste at all similar.  I was trying to get a more realistic cheesecake flavor and a bit sharper lemon.  This does need to steep awhile if you want to get the full effect.  Given enough time, the fresh cream will eventually blend with the cheesecake base and make something less dry, but if you try to vape it too soon, the cream flavor just sits on top as a separate flavor, which I find unpleasant.\r\n\r\nI'm still pretty new at this so I'm open to feedback!","steep_days":"14","temperature":"500","recipe_score":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-12T10:14:27.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"1674","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"New York Cheesecake","flavor_id":"90","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Cheesecake","flavor_id":"4430","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Graham Cracker Clear","flavor_id":"325","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Juicy Lemon","flavor_id":"79","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1250},{"name":"Forrest Mix (forest Fruit Mix)","flavor_id":"453","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Cream Fresh","flavor_id":"540","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Berry Mix","flavor_id":"5899","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1000}],"reviews":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"43104","name":"Lemonberry Cheesecake v6"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
