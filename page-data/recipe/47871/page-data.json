At first it seemed like there just wasn't enough chocolate so I added in the milk chocolate. Once I did that the FLV milk chocolate kind of took over, and after a nearly 3 week steep it turned into one of those Chocolate Pirouette cookies.  \r\n\r\nThe Greek Yogurt is used to enhance the bakery flavors in the cookies and not meant to be tasted in the recipe, so I don't recommend using more of this ingredient.  The Cream was intended only to smooth also as an enhancing flavor, so it should really stay at this level too.  \r\n\r\nIn fact, I don't recommend increasing the percentages at all on this recipe even if you are a muted taster, as I had my husband (a less than average palate) try it and he identified what it was immediately and found it quite nice.  For me, even though I'm a sensitive palate, I enjoy the flavor as it is, it is a little strong for me, but it has steeped long enough to be smooth and sweet. \r\n\r\nIt doesn't need a lot of sweetness to it, as it seems pretty sweet, so I only added a small amount of FLV sweetness. Since those cookies are sweet, but not like sugar coated, if you go with a sucralose sweetener use a small amount, (under 0.5%.) \r\n\r\nAs for steep time, I only put that amount of time because this is when I've tested it since my initial first week testing.  I tested it shake and vape, it wasn't very good at that time. At one week is when I added the chocolate, so the chocolate had almost 2 weeks steep time in and the cookie notes had almost 3 weeks of steep time.  I would definite steep this one at minimum 2 weeks. If it doesn't seem quite right give it a few more days to another week.  But once it's done steeping it is a beautiful after dinner or with coffee vape. Though I have been vaping this flavor all day, I don't think this would be an all day every day for a week kind of flavor, but I can easily add this to my flavor rotation to have with my coffee in the morning or as a dessert replacement at night, or a midday snack. \r\n\r\nFor More Mixing Tips and Info Visit my Site and Youtube Channel: \r\nhttp://flavor-pro.com/\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCA6gV-5vxieuG2_TcIKpYCg\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBy Glane23 (Own work) [CC BY-SA 3.0 (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0) or GFDL (http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/fdl.html)], via Wikimedia Commons https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File%3APirouette_cookies.JPG","steep_days":"19","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:49:20.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"3347","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Cookie Dough","flavor_id":"4373","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1310},{"name":"Cookie","flavor_id":"4369","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":450},{"name":"Biscotti","flavor_id":"4403","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":180},{"name":"Cream","flavor_id":"604","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":340},{"name":"Greek Yogurt","flavor_id":"615","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":130},{"name":"Peanut Butter","flavor_id":"607","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":300},{"name":"Milk Chocolate","flavor_id":"4389","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":150},{"name":"Sweetness","flavor_id":"4413","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":400}],"reviews":[{"user":"SlashaLO","text":"Ok, this is STARTLINGLY accurate. Its a very good mix. I was slightly worried that I wouldn't be able to taste this overall, but I was able, and very happy about that. I get that flaky outer layer with that nice creamy type center. I think I might try a version identical to yours, dropping Milk Chocolate and adding Smooth Vanilla to make a more vanilla type version.
