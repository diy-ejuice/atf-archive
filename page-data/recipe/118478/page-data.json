This extract is not as dark as INW biscuit but if you go to high with shortbread it appears to take on a popcorn like quality. The initial smell of this smells almost like FLV popcorn. You can replace this with inw biscuit at the same percentage and achieve similar results.\r\n\r\nFLV Rhubarb- This is the only realistic rhubarb in my opinion. WF is basically raspberry, VT is basically sour mush, INW is way too green and vegetale. I have never used this higher than .4 and I do not recommend you go any higher. Even after a 14 day steep the rhubarb still has that sour root flavor right on top where you want it.\r\n\r\nFA Red Touch- I removed the sweet strawberry because I felt like it took away from the main rhubarb profile I had going before so I'm reverting this back to the original state at 2%.\r\n\r\nFlapper Pie WF- Flapper pie is pretty much a perfect blend of custard and meringue. I didn't go above 3% because I do not want any of the graham cracker notes to poke through.","steep_days":"14 (SNV)","temperature":"420","recipe_score":0,"total_reviews":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-05T11:05:54.000-05:00","best_vg":"69%","views":"1383","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Crunchy Frosted Cookie","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Shortbread","vendor":"INW","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Super Sweet","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":500},{"name":"Red Touch (strawberry)","vendor":"FA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Rhubarb","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":400},{"name":"Flapper Pie SC","vendor":"WF","millipercent":3000}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"118478","name":"Strawberry Rhubarb Boi"}}}
