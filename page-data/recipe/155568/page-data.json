I created the Mango base with FLV Apricot, Mango, Cantaloupe and DF Mango. Then used it to replace the Strawberries in Wayne's final version of his Boosted remix. After tweaking the percentages I balanced it out perfectly and with a 7 day steep she is delicious. Just mix the shit and enjoy. Thanks KRUCIAL.
