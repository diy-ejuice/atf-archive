With that out of the way; only an overnight steep so far, but this is already damn fine. I'm loving the balance of berries in this. It already has a nice grainy texture, without pushing into weird territory, and a good complementary smoothness from the cream milky / meringue combo, even at this early stage.  I can only see this getting better as time goes by. Goes very well with my morning espresso. I'll try to remind myself to report back in 7 days and update this with further comments / suggestions. It's already a five star mix for me, as far as hitting the cereal profile. Thanks for sharing!
