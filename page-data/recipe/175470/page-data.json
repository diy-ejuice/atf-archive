The yoghurt part adds a nice creamy and round taste. I find 3% just be just perfect for it.\r\n\r\nI found TFA DX Peanut Butter to go very well for it around 3% as well - although, it does need 3 days to sit as the peanut butter is very strong right after the first shake (but still taste good).\r\n\r\nFW Butterscotch at 2% has two jobs in this recipe. First of all - adding to the flavor of the profile obviously and secondly, it adds a nice creamy effect to the mix as well.\r\n\r\nFA Caramel at 0.75% is only there to boost the caramel flavor from the butterscotch a little.\r\n\r\nThe CAP Butter Cream adds two things as well to this mix - knowingly that it's one of those concentrates that tastes different from person to person.\r\nThe first job it has is to add a little bit of buttery effect to this mix, that'll help the TFA DX Peanut Butter to be a little bit more round in flavor.\r\nSecond job is to add a little bit of waxy texture to the mix for the mouthfeel.\r\n\r\nLastly, TFA Vanilla Swirl for a rounder flavor and to sharpen off the edges from the banana (plus adding a hint of vanilla in the mix)\r\n\r\nI recommend 3 days steep to make the TFA DX Peanut Butter and CC Banana Yoghurt to mainly blend in together as they are the main components.\r\n\r\nEnjoy and feel free to leave a review!","steep_days":"3","temperature":"0","recipe_score":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-10T14:53:30.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"849","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Banana Yoghurt","flavor_id":"4256","vendor":"CC","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Dx Peanut Butter","flavor_id":"288","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Butter Cream","flavor_id":"3","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1250},{"name":"Butterscotch Ripple","flavor_id":"1217","vendor":"FW","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Carmel (caramel)","flavor_id":"503","vendor":"FA","millipercent":750},{"name":"Vanilla Swirl","flavor_id":"189","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1500}],"reviews":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"175470","name":"Butty Nana"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
