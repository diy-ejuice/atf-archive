It was one of my favourite commercial juices before I went to DIY. At first I wanted to accomplish a 1:1 copy, but after a few people have said it tastes quite better. I decided to go ahead and run with that and make it even better. This is the Pod / MTL Version, refer to the OG linked at the bottom for DL. \r\n\r\nTested on a Cthulu 1928 MTL RDA, 15w 6 wraps 2mm 25mg/mL Nicotine\r\n\r\n#####**Notes**\r\n\r\nRefer to the OG for the notes :)\r\n\r\nHope you enjoy this remix!
