Came up with this simple recipe. - This i my version 2 I enjoy a ton right now. Changes: The reduction of the butterscotch, sugar cookie, and vanilla custard plus the addition of cinnamon danish swirl, a the bit more holy holy grail and a bit of EM helps tie everything very well together. (Only room for improvement I'm seeing is fine tuning the butterscotch a bit more down)\r\n\r\nHas a butterscotch cookie on the inhale with the tobacco coming out on the exhale. \r\n\r\nI hope all enjoy, and if anyone has ideas for improvement feel free to send me a message!","steep_days":"7","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"total_reviews":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T20:33:10.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"669","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Sugar Cookie","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1500},{"name":"HOLY HOLY GRAIL RY4","vendor":"DFS","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Butterscotch","vendor":"TBV","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Vanilla Custard","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Cinnamon Danish Swirl","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Ethyl Maltol","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":250}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"164466","name":"R-Fry-4 v2"}}}
