The 10ml bottles seemed to always be sold out. Finally, I gave in and bought a 30ml bottle. And I wasn't disappointed. This has a taste and smell of FE's sweet rice(thankfully WITHOUT that horrible jasmine note!) initially. After 2 days steeping, this flowers into...cooked oatmeal! And I've always loved oatmeal.\r\n  \r\nFor the little bits of cooked peach & apple, I used both **WF Peach Pie & Cream**(specifically for its' cooked peach note) and **FLV Apple Pop**(perfect cooked apple). Apple Pop also has a *very* faint cinnamon to it that I wanted in addition to **FW Brown Sugar**.\r\n  \r\nI added **OOO Cream Milky Undertone PG** to sort of \"bulk up\" the thickness oatmeal has. This is the 1st time I ever thought to use this for something other than *mouth feel*. And it worked wonderfully here in this way. In addition to this concentrate, I always add a splash of half & half cream to my bowl of oatmeal, and **FA Cream Fresh** filled that need perfectly.\r\n  \r\nFinally, our oatmeal had to be perfectly seasoned. In my opinion, there is nothing worse than oatmeal made without a touch of salt. It turns my stomach. For this reason, good ole **Saline 0.9%** was included(thankfully I'm a nurse and have a never-ending supply of this). Topped off with 0.25% **CAP Super Sweet**, this tastes very similar to Quaker Instant Peaches & Cream Oatmeal(only BETTER because of the apple inclusion).\r\n  \r\nVaping this fresh off the shake, I found this good...but a bit dry. At 2 days steep it became a little more moist. At 3 days & beyond it was perfect. The peaches, apples, cinnamon/brown sugar become only an accent and the oatmeal steals the spotlight as intended. And at the very end of the exhale, you will taste that cream fresh! I hope you enjoy this. It has been my \"white whale\"!! \r\n  \r\n**VG: MAX(At least 88%)**\r\n  \r\n\r\n  \r\n**STEEP DAYS: 2-3**\r\n  \r\n  \r\n*Please dont use this recipe for commercial gain. If you enjoy this please rate it.*\r\n  \r\nThis recipe was created to honor my **E-Juice Makers** Crew!

You are ALL valued!!\r\n","steep_days":"3","temperature":"0","recipe_score":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-10T19:01:10.000-05:00","best_vg":"90%","views":"1292","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Oatmeal N Milk","flavor_id":"10144","vendor":"FE","millipercent":4500},{"name":"Cream Milky Undertone PG","flavor_id":"6539","vendor":"OOO","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Peach Pie & Cream","flavor_id":"6058","vendor":"WF","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Apple Pop","flavor_id":"4380","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":500},{"name":"Brown Sugar","flavor_id":"1208","vendor":"FW","millipercent":1250},{"name":"Saline (0.9%)","flavor_id":"5960","vendor":"OTHR","millipercent":250},{"name":"Super Sweet","flavor_id":"2384","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":250},{"name":"Cream Fresh","flavor_id":"540","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1500}],"reviews":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"151241","name":"Oatmeal Stew"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
