It's great as is but since it was a contest entry with restrictions, I decided to tinker with the top notes a bit. The overripe aspect plays really well with brighter top notes like Cranberry. It turns it almost into a combination of granny smith/golden delicious/red delicious. Very authentic apple taste. No candy here.
