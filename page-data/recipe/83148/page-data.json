This recipe initially began as POG lemonade and after few versions it grew into something different. Enjoy, Hope you all like it. Feedback as more than welcome.\r\n\r\nFW Lemonade ( is my Lemonade of choice swap out yours)\r\n\r\nOrange is a mix FW Blood Orange is to add the tart notes to the orange and the Lemonade. CAP is to fill the Orange out.\r\nINW Shisha Orange And Hibiscus are both to add a syrupiness and peel note to make it more like a beverage.\r\n\r\nTFA Honeysuckle for the sweet light floral note, but also to try and keep the throat harshness down (it replaced FA PassionFruit)\r\n\r\nCAP Sweet Guava adds the tropical note to the lemonade and tartness.","steep_days":"2","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-06T04:11:06.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"1331","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Lemonade","flavor_id":"1336","vendor":"FW","millipercent":3500},{"name":"Juicy Orange","flavor_id":"80","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":500},{"name":"Honeysuckle (pg)","flavor_id":"306","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Blood Orange","flavor_id":"1197","vendor":"FW","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Hibiscus","flavor_id":"72","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":500},{"name":"Shisha Orange","flavor_id":"832","vendor":"INW","millipercent":500},{"name":"Sweet Guava","flavor_id":"118","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":2500}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"83148","name":"HOG AIDE"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
