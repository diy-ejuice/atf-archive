Pretty much Shake and Vape but does taste better every day since creating.  I will be adjusting as my taste buds demand.  :D  Update:  Since this has become my all day vape and I could drink this stuff it is so good I am going to call it DONE.  I do not want to add any creams etc... as that isn't what I want right now.  I will play with mixing more flavors with Strawberry later.  I am a happy camper that I was able to please my palate so easily!  I use 80 VG/ 20PG 6ml nic base premixed from LiquidBarn.  Easy peasy!","steep_days":"3 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":3,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:50:19.000-05:00","best_vg":"80%","views":"2027","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Sweet Strawberry","flavor_id":"121","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":8000},{"name":"Super Sweet","flavor_id":"2384","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":750},{"name":"Propylene Glycol","flavor_id":"2283","vendor":"RF","millipercent":10000}],"reviews":[{"user":"MotherPunker","text":"this isn't exactly a recipe, its just a single flavour test with sweetening added...."},{"user":"xx2000xx","text":"Very, I doubt I'm right right but maybe something could  be added.
