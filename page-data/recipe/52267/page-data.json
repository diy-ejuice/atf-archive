It is quite good, as the vanilla, milk, and cream make this coffee very creamy and thick. I currently have a batch steeping with a lower percentage of condensed milk (.25%) and sweetener added (CAP Super Sweet .5%) to see if that works out better. This recipe was best after a looooong steep of 14 days.","steep_days":"14","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-06T14:07:07.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"1315","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Cappuccino","flavor_id":"3596","vendor":"SC","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Milk & Honey","flavor_id":"609","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Shisha Vanilla","flavor_id":"841","vendor":"INW","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Milk Condensed","flavor_id":"404","vendor":"FA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Sweet Cream","flavor_id":"183","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2000}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"52267","name":"Keen on Coffee"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
