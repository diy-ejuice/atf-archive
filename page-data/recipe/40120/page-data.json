I have to thank Darren Cole for his pastry  combination fro!m his lemon tart recipe. The only difference is I used Twisted Sketch graham cracker  at .30% instead of Tfa graham cracker clear. I have to say these  Twisted Sketch concentrates are pretty damn amazing. Very strong and very good. The same goes for Papaya punch by Flavorah its my new favorite papaya very good and very strong at .75% you get a good papaya flavor from this concentrate even at such a low percentage. Overall this is a very delicious recipe that pulls off this profile in less than 4% total flavor concentrate in the whole recipe and it tastes great the next day but it really shines after a 3 day steep. And the twisted sketch Graham!m cracker can be switched to tfa graham cracker clear at 2% but you can't go wrong with picking up an order of Twisted sketch concentrates a 10ml bottle will last for ever they are the strongest flavors I have ever used and they taste great.😁😄😁😀😆","steep_days":"3","temperature":"0","recipe_score":4,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:49:14.000-05:00","best_vg":"75%","views":"1681","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Papaya Punch","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":750},{"name":"Lime Tahity Cold Pressed","vendor":"FA","millipercent":750},{"name":"Cream Fresh","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Graham Cracker","vendor":"TS","millipercent":300},{"name":"Biscuit","vendor":"INW","millipercent":500},{"name":"Golden Butter","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":500}],"reviews":[{"user":"Trevorxgage","text":"Man, this is fantastic. I have the TS Graham so I was able to mix it as is, and I made it for my girlfriend originally but ended up making a bottle for myself as well. The only thing I may change in a touch more lime or some FA custard to add some extra cream and keep that citrus note in there.
