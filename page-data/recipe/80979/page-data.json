It really helps to bring out the grainy notes in the pastry and helps to keep the layers separate.\r\n\r\nThe Orange Cream layer:\r\n\r\nTpa bavarian Cream and FA meringue are used to help bring the mix together and to also add to the creamy orange I get from the original liquid.\r\n\r\nI think Tpa orange cream is used in the original as I get more of a creamy orange than a straight up Tart citrus flavour . At 3.5% it is prominent in the recipe however I have found it needs a lift to help keep the orange as the top note.  \r\n\r\nFA Royal Orange Juice has been added to help with this. I don't think this is in the original as this flavour has only recently been released but I like the sweet juicy orange which this flavour brings.\r\n\r\nI like Cap super sweet at 0.6% for my recipes but this can be adapted to suit your taste.\r\n\r\nHope you guys enjoy and any feedback would be welcome if you mix this up.
