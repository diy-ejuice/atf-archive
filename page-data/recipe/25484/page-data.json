I had one recently at a new local doughnut shop and had to immediately turn this into a ADV.  this has been My morning vape for the past couple weeks.\r\n\r\nShake and vape taste like strawberry mixed pebbles cereal.  After a few days steep, the donut and frosting add to the exhale.\r\n\r\nZepolla and Wow together make a nice light airy donut, with a jelly filled center.  \r\n\r\nShisha and Strawberry Sweet together bring a flavorful candy/jammy strawberry to reinforce the jelly filling Wow provides. \r\n\r\nFruity flakes and Cream Cheese Icing together make the cereal topped frosting.\r\n\r\nVanilla custard melds everything together and adds moisture and thickens mouthfeel.\r\n\r\nNo sweeteners are needed, the CCI brings more than plenty.\r\n\r\n","steep_days":"3 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"total_reviews":2,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:48:58.000-05:00","best_vg":"80%","views":"4142","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Fruity Flakes","vendor":"FW","millipercent":1750},{"name":"wOw","vendor":"FA","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Zeppola","vendor":"FA","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Vanilla Custard","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Shisha Strawberry","vendor":"INW","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Strawberry Sweet","vendor":"JF","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Cream Cheese Icing","vendor":"LA","millipercent":2000}],"reviews":[{"user":"mistress_mimi","score":"5","text":""},{"user":"Perkaltor23","score":"none","text":""}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"25484","name":"Dinonuts"}}}
