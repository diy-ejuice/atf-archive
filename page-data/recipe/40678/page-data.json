Father in law is a big fan of Apple Butter by Liquid State\r\n\r\nFA Fuji: This was the only apple I had on hand. I'm sure there is some sort of a sour green apple type flavor out there, but this works well. I bumped this up a few times to give it that flavor you get right as the tart apple starts to hit your tongue through the caramel. I doubt I need explain FA Fuji.\r\n\r\nFA Carmel (Caramel): Also the only one on hand but it is a solid caramel. It isn't too intense to overshadow the FUJI. I want it to fight for the top note in this recipe. It does a pretty good job. \r\n\r\nAdd as much Super Sweet as you like. .25 is about all I can tolerate in any recipe. But it really helps this one along. I feel without this is would be way to heavy.\r\n\r\nEthyl Maltol to keep lines blurred between carmel and tart apple. This is my first time using it but I felt it was perfect here. Again, don't want either top note to be too apparent. \r\n\r\nFA Liquid Amber: I had it on hand and it always seems to give me a bit of a pie filling flavor in small amount. It turns the Fuji into more of a baked apple. But that may be a stretch. \r\n\r\nI have been vaping on it for about 3 days now and love it. I thought about throwing in 2% (CAP) Bavarian Cream. My fear is that it may completely overpower the apple. I mix this at 60/40. \r\n\r\nGive me your thoughts guys.
