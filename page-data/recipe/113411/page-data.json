Spoon-lickingly delicious.\r\n\r\nA trip down memory lane with an old school profile. I've just \"discovered\" CAP Cake Batter and found out I absolutely love it. It could have gone the other way either as Cake Batter is a notorious marmite flavour: you either love it or detest it. And even though there are lots of newer cake/ dough flavours around, none taste quite like CAP Cake Batter. Basically, it's a gooey, cheap-tasting vanilla dough which coats your mouth and messes up your face as you lick it off that giant wooden spoon.  \r\n\r\nIt might be an old school flavour but still beats the hell out of more recent flavours if you're after that cheap birthday cake batter taste.\r\n\r\n2% CAP Cake Batter is boosted with 2.5% CAP Sugar Cookie. 1% LA Cream Cheese Icing thicken things up with some tangy sugary icing.  CAP Graham Cracker V2 was chosen over V1 as it's a lighter flavour and has a slight gingery cinnamon taste I love. It's a potent flavour and usually kept low but was raised to 1.25% to push that cinnamon through the thick cake batter layer. A dash of TFA Vanilla Swirl helps blend everything. Finally, 0.35% FLV Sweetness for the sweet tooth.\r\n\r\nThis one can be licked off the spoon the next day but best after 3.
