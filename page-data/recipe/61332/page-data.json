Red Burley, Virginia Tobacco, and Kentucky Blend.\r\n\r\nAdded a touch of FLV Cream and FLV Bourbon to act as a bridge between the apple pie and tobaccos.  The slight suggestion of booze from the bourbon has this flavor profile leaning towards an apple pie moonshine.  Got me to thinking about fall weather sitting around a campfire sipping moonshine from a jar (Mason).\r\n\r\nOff the SNV this is a great mix . . . will update after a steep and, possibly, slightly bringing the caramel and bourbon notes a little more forward in the mix.  As of now, I'm enjoying this immensely!\r\n\r\nYes . . . those percentages are a bit high (understatement) . . . but I'll be damned if this isn't one fine apple tobacco vape.  After a short 7 day steep, this is truly magnificent!  Dropped JF Dulce de Leche for FA Caramel and threw some FLV Cured into the mix..  I also doubled the percentage of FLV Bourbon.  This is the juice I reach for when I get home to wind down from a hectic day (e.g. 26 4th graders in an inclusion classroom).  I mix this 60vg/40pg and load it into a solid MTL tank (EVL Reaper).  Definitely a recipe I will return to when this 30 runs out.\r\n\r\n","steep_days":"7 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-06T23:07:25.000-05:00","best_vg":"60%","views":"1143","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Apple Pie","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Red Burley","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Virginia Tobacco","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Kentucky Blend","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Rich Cinnamon","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":200},{"name":"Bourbon","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Fuji Apple","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Carmel (caramel)","vendor":"FA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Cured Tobacco","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Cream","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1000}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"61332","name":"Capt.
