While this is not an original recipe created by me, it is one of my favorites. A big shout out to Beaufort Batches on ELR for allowing me to share this recipe on ATF.\r\n\r\nThe profile is basically described as kettle corn tossed in a glaze made of strawberry gelatin, marshmallows, yogurt, brown sugar and half and half cream and sprinkled with crushed up crunch berries.\r\n\r\nWhat I get out of this is an experience very true to the profile description. The use of the kettle corn, biscuit, and AP provide a very nice authentic popcorn note, and all of the other flavors combine beautifully to mimic the glaze.\r\n\r\nThis is one of many excellent recipes created by Beaufort Batches and I highly suggest mixing this one up. It is definitely the best popcorn vape I've tried so far. If you decide to give this one a try please drop by ELR and show BB some love with a rating or comment. Hope you all enjoy this one!","steep_days":"7 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:49:58.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"1872","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Acetyl Pyrazine 5%","flavor_id":"1709","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Bavarian Cream","flavor_id":"145","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Berry Crunch","flavor_id":"136","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Biscuit","flavor_id":"642","vendor":"INW","millipercent":750},{"name":"Butter Cream","flavor_id":"3","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1250},{"name":"Caramel (original)","flavor_id":"149","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1500},{"name":"French Vanilla","flavor_id":"56","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Greek Yogurt","flavor_id":"173","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Kettle Corn","flavor_id":"329","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Marshmallow","flavor_id":"332","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Red Touch (strawberry)","flavor_id":"421","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Shisha Strawberry","flavor_id":"1711","vendor":"INW","millipercent":2500}],"reviews":[{"user":"Woody0707","text":"I gotta say, this stuff is CRACK.
