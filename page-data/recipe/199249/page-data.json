Unfortunately for me, that was before FLV Mango and other great mango flavors even existed, and my attempts were so bad I had to give up and settle for a peach version. I've finally revisited that old desire, and making a juicy, sweet honeydew/pear with a nice mango top note proved easy thanks to the combination of FLV Mango and VT Shisha Mango. The INW Prickly Pear makes it extra juicy while enhancing both the pear and melon aspects.

For me, it was automatic to mix it. &#xD;\nI whipped up a batch, SNV and came right back to write this review.&#xD;\nPerfect timing! . Another well balanced delicious recipe for our mixing enjoyment.  Thanks! You could probably toss a little ws23 in there if you're lookin for a cool summer vape. He doesn't mention it, and there may be a reason for that.","score":5}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"199249","name":"Commodore Mango"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
