Well that & Quaaludes. But we'll leave those out of the mix as it's rather difficult to recreate in vape form.\r\n\r\nWanted to go a little different here in using banana nut bread for a texture. Imagine more of a pb-banana-marshmallow fluff sandwich if you made it on banana nut bread. Even without gooey marshmallow this is a tasty mix because of how great banana nut bread is.\r\n\r\nCombo of AP\\banana nut bread\\dx peanut butter sets up a nice start for everything. We get our nuts all up in a bunch here. Also I couldn't decide on AP at .25 or .5 so we'll say fuck quarters, I'm using a goddamn third. \r\nNo subs here sorry.\r\n\r\nThe banana cream seems to work well here (sub tpa @ 2%,  if you don't have la banana cream, but you really should ðŸ˜‰) in conjunction with the marshmallow. Feel it kind of lends a hand smoothing things out along with adding it's tasty flavor. Not too strong or overpowering.\r\nFe banana is another one I played with, it works but this recipe almost needs more of a banana cream than a straight up banana. If you want more banana though it's a viable addition.\r\nWF banana puree is another that would probably work with a little more marshmallow added as well, but honestly I'm so tired of revisions I don't have the motivation atm.\r\nPur banana is tasty af & I highly recommend picking it up, but it's realism just doesn't fit here.\r\n\r\nWf gooey marshmallow is here because it's a little more of what I was going for instead of an impromptu sweetener\\edge-taker-off-er that we get with the tried & true tpa. \r\nFor a sub I would suggest fa marshmallow @ 1.25-1\r\n5% as I feel it has a little more realism than tpa.\r\n\r\n.15-2ish super sweet\\1 drop per 10-15ml is good, but not a necessity so I will leave it up to you. Personally both K & I prefer it with 1 drop (10ml bcf size) flv sweetness but it is tasty without if that's your thing. If you normally add, don't be afraid of the gooey marshmallow being too sweet. It's much more true to it's name than tpa.\r\n\r\nSteep: This one really isn't bad overnight, but 4-5 days would be optimal.\r\n\r\nEnjoy & happy mixing! ðŸ˜ŽðŸ’¨ ðŸ’¨\r\nRemember, feedback good or bad helps us all become better mixers!","steep_days":"5","temperature":"666","recipe_score":4,"updated_at":"2020-12-12T15:40:35.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"1207","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Acetyl Pyrazine 5%","flavor_id":"1709","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":330},{"name":"Banana Nut Bread","flavor_id":"144","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Dx Peanut Butter","flavor_id":"288","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":5000},{"name":"Marshmallow (Gooey) SC","flavor_id":"10265","vendor":"WF","millipercent":1750},{"name":"Banana Cream","flavor_id":"916","vendor":"LA","millipercent":2500}],"reviews":[{"user":"LB","text":"This is decent. Maybe its just that I have some old flavors, or maybe its my setup, but even at 5% dx tpa peanut butter, I'm not getting as much as I want.  But the thing that turned me off the most was the banana runt flavor was too much.  After a week or two it died down a bit, but I think I'm going to play with a different banana instead of LA Banana Cream.  This is a good base to work off of though.
