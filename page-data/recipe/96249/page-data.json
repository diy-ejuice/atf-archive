Banana Sweet Cream is creamy enough to make peanut butter melt in your mouth. It'll come first on exhale!\r\n\r\nPeanut Butter V2 (CAP) - by far the most realistic peanut butter. A little bit weak so you might want to crank it up a bit. Up to 5% is just fine but higher percentage might choke banana flavor. By me, 4% works perfect - enough to flush that banana along the tongue.\r\n\r\nBicsuit (INAWERA) - only a bit is enough to lend a nice body to the mix\r\n\r\nSuper Sweet (CAP) - fills gaps and rounds all up\r\n\r\nNo, you can't make flavors replacement. Different flavor vendors do flavor namesakes by using different ingredients, that's why you can't.","steep_days":"12","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T12:46:45.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"876","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Banana","vendor":"FM","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Banana Sweet Cream","vendor":"OOO","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Biscuit","vendor":"INW","millipercent":500},{"name":"Peanut Butter V2","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Super Sweet","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":500}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"96249","name":"Boogie Walk"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
