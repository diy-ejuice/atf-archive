As I was attempting to create one, I discovered that with a dash of hazelnut it really comes alive! \r\n\r\nSo, to create the white chocolate base, a mix of TPA & FW white chocolate, WF white chocolate milky cream and a bit of FW sweet cream. The sweet cream gives the white chocolates more dimension and makes it taste a bit closer to the real thing. \r\n\r\nBridge to the hazelnut with WF hazelnuts and cream, add a drop of TFA hazelnut and round the nutty flavour of with a hint of acetyl pyrazine.\r\n\r\nThis recipe needs at least 14 days to develop properly, and if you can hold off for 3 weeks you will find it's sweet spot. \r\n\r\nPlease mix, enjoy and let me know what you think!
