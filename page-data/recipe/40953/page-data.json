This is the naked version of a strawberry cream churro.\r\n\r\nZeppola was all the rave when it first came out.  By itself, it gives you a fried dough that serves to bring on the churro taste.  Some people have suggested using waffle to give it a little more of an oily taste, but I think the perfect churro is made to be a little more light and fluffy, hence the zeppola.  To move the zeppola away from the typically known donut taste, we had to give it a little something.  Enter biscuit.\r\n\r\nBiscuit adds a buttery note here and does just enough to move zeppola along to a happy place.\r\n\r\nBrown Sugar is here to take the place of the typical cinnamon sugar coating found on churros.  I added it for the darkened sugar taste because frankly, I'm just not a fan of cinnamon in a recipe.  My version and why I call it \"naked\".  If you want to up the brown sugar to 1% or 1.5%, go for it.  If you still want the cinnamon undertone, then keep the brown sugar at .5% and add .5% of Cinnamon Danish Swirl. \r\n\r\nStrawberry Sweet JF is meant to hold on to the strawberry taste even through the steeping process.  I did not want it to fade, so this was the choice.  I was not looking for the most authentic of strawberry tastes, but a maintenance of sweetness.  Remember folks, these things are sold on the streets from Mexico through South America, and there is a strawberry syrup filling inside, so you will not find authentic freshly sliced strawberry taste here.  Not what I was going for.\r\n\r\nBavarian Cream buttery and sweet, and adding just the right amount of vanilla.  Matches up well with the Strawberry Sweet.\r\n\r\nAs I said, this naked strawberry cream churro can be spun to your liking, but you just got the how and why for my tastes.  The adds to experiment with are a little more brown sugar, and cinnamon danish swirl.\r\n\r\nGive it a 4 day steep folks.  That is noted below, but I do not want people to miss this as it does taste different as a shake and vape.\r\n\r\nHappy Mixing\r\n\r\n","steep_days":"4","temperature":"0","recipe_score":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-10T16:00:00.000-05:00","best_vg":"80%","views":"2706","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Zeppola","flavor_id":"6312","vendor":"FA","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Biscuit","flavor_id":"642","vendor":"INW","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Brown Sugar","flavor_id":"313","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Strawberry Sweet","flavor_id":"4745","vendor":"JF","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Bavarian Cream","flavor_id":"145","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1500}],"reviews":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"40953","name":"Strawberry Cream Churro"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
