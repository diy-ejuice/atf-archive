Can omit I suppose. Or dilute. \r\n\r\nI decided I needed a Strawberry Cream, just so I could have one I guess? I dunno. On a whim I decided to use the cream base from my snickerdoodle recipe because it's a nice somewhat 'spicy' cream that uses a couple of creams I don't usually see in Strawberry Creams. It turned out good and I prefer it to majority of the SC's I've tried over the last year.\r\n\r\nThe rich Cinnamon is a drop per 30ml which will be hard to do if you make a batch smaller. I love the warm cinnamon hint but it will survive without it. The idea behind the lemon is to play off the strawberry's and give them a sort of freshness type of thing. It taste good but I have not tested without it because when I start doing that it all goes to shit...","steep_days":"3","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T06:59:48.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"1187","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Madagascar (Vanilla Classic)","vendor":"FA","millipercent":750},{"name":"Marshmallow","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Bavarian Cream","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Catalan Cream","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Vanillin 10% (pg)","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":750},{"name":"Shisha Strawberry","vendor":"INW","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Strawberry Sweet","vendor":"JF","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Juicy Lemon","vendor":"JF","millipercent":150},{"name":"Rich Cinnamon","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":20}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"25058","name":"Et Tu?
