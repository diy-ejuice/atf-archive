There's a familiar dairy aroma with light-eggy, rich, and spicy vanilla notes. On the palate, the milkiness of the liqueur prevails, but the more you sip, the easier it is to locate the whiskey flavor and hints of toffee. It has a nice texture, though it does go on the side of creamy with only a slight touch of whiskey heat\".\r\n\r\nMIXING NOTES:\r\nTPA Kentucky Bourbon and  TPA VBIC are well known friends, but i didnt want too much ice cream flavour so 2% is enough to add light-egg and vanillla.\r\nThe addition on FLV cream turns this to a velvety milky cream, that coats your palate.\r\n\r\nVTA Toffe ice Cream adds  creamy and buttery toffee notes, while FLV Vanilla bean reinforces the vanilla notes turning them deeper and spicier.\r\n\r\n\r\nMIX & STEEP : \r\n60/40 is best so it does not get too thick.\r\n\r\nYo can SnV but after 3-5 days it's where it starts to be what is supposed to.. so leave it as much as you need from there it only will get better (+15 days is best)","steep_days":"7 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"total_reviews":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T23:38:09.000-05:00","best_vg":"60%","views":"213","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Kentucky Bourbon","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Toffee Ice Cream","vendor":"VT","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Vanilla Bean Ice Cream","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Super Sweet","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":500},{"name":"Vanilla Bean","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Cream","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1000}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"166649","name":"Nooku •Bourbon Cream•"}}}
