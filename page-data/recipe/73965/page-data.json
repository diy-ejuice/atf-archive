I tried with a mix of INW Biscuit and FA Cookie at a few different percentages but It just wouldn't play nice ... enter Sugar Cookie. With the Brown Sugar, Biscuit and Sugar Cookie it adds that sweet pastry crumble that ended up being the best combo for the mix.\r\n\r\nFLV Boysenberry / TPA Blackberry - A sweet and tart combination that makes up the sweet filling in the crumble. I went through a few different berries to mix with the Boysenberry. I tried FA Raspberry, FA Forrest Fruits, INW Raspberry then I tried TFA Blackberry and found a good match. \r\n\r\nThe FA Blackcurrant is just there to give the filling a bit of jam like feeling and stickiness. The FA Blood Orange is really subtle and is there only to add a bit of orange zest to the mix.\r\n\r\nYou won't taste the Crumble part until at least day 2. Let this rest for 3-5 days.","steep_days":"5","temperature":"0","recipe_score":4,"updated_at":"2020-12-12T15:39:35.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"1797","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Brown Sugar","flavor_id":"313","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Sugar Cookie","flavor_id":"115","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":5000},{"name":"Blackcurrant","flavor_id":"545","vendor":"FA","millipercent":250},{"name":"Boysenberry","flavor_id":"614","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Blackberry","flavor_id":"214","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":750},{"name":"Blood Orange","flavor_id":"7698","vendor":"FA","millipercent":250},{"name":"Biscuit","flavor_id":"642","vendor":"INW","millipercent":1500}],"reviews":[{"user":"ID10-T","text":"I don’t know that it screams boysenberry in particular, but it is a mostly pleasant dark berry crumble. However, the berry is just a bit buried under all that crumble, and rather than a bunch of sweet gooey berry, I’m getting a ton of dry-yet-buttery INW Biscuit. I wouldn’t mind trying this again, but I’d probably adjust it a bit, maybe cut the Biscuit in half and push the Boysenberry up to 3%.
