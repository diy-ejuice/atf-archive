Hands down this is the best lemon pound cake I've tried so far and quite possibly the best lemon anything-and I've tried a lot of them. I've been rationing the 30ml I made but I think its time for a much bigger bottle. Subbed in SC Lemon for FE although I've heard that they are one and the same. Perfect recipe and a must mix! ","score":5},{"user":"kindground","text":"Such a great recipe. Fully saturated flavor and absolutely decadent. It's great off a shake with in your face lemon, but after a day or so it comes together even better. This is everything I look for in a lemon bakery vape. Nailed the profile perfectly. The perfect lemon riding on top a rich buttery pound cake. Excellent job. ","score":5},{"user":"ID10-T","text":"In a word, decadent. A sinfully rich delicious recipe that perfectly nails the pound cake profile. It even makes me hate myself like such a dessert would; I hate that I took so long to get around to trying it. ","score":5},{"user":"Smoky","text":"phenomenal! Tried this with the same percentages but INW lemon cake changed to JF yellow cake, this is on par with dinner lady, a lemon tart remix. Perfectly balanced soft lemon flavour with a nice spongey cake flavour.","score":5}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"7037","name":"LMN#"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
