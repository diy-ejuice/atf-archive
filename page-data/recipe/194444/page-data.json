Described as a creamy butterscotch with full tobacco. Real good. Lead me to build a recipe very similar to the orginal but not as sweet butterscotch forward as the OG. \r\n\r\nButterscotch Custard Tobacco.\r\n\r\nUsed a magnetic stir for 4 hour. I would steep 2 weeks or more.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","steep_days":"14","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:51:34.000-05:00","best_vg":"65%","views":"887","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Butterscotch Ripple","flavor_id":"1217","vendor":"FW","millipercent":900},{"name":"555 Gold","flavor_id":"685","vendor":"INW","millipercent":1250},{"name":"Sweet and Smokey Tobacco","flavor_id":"10151","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":600},{"name":"Corn Bread","flavor_id":"2007","vendor":"OOO","millipercent":700},{"name":"Custard","flavor_id":"4210","vendor":"INW","millipercent":900},{"name":"Turkish","flavor_id":"383","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":400}],"reviews":[{"user":"CaptainCornbread","text":"Really good mix! My girlfriend is really picky about recipes and  she only vapes tobacco flavors. This recipe opened her eyes to other notes besides tobacco. Really came together   after a month. 2 months made it magical. Thanks for your time to make and share this recipe!"}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"194444","name":"Watson Silver remix"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
