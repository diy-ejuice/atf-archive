I decided to try it and play with the percentages and make some additions to improve upon it. This is a really great recipe for pods. The flavor punches through and doesn't hide at all.\r\n\r\nAlpine Strawberry is a really potent strawberry that even strawberry non-tasters will be able to enjoy. It drives that berry base layer and gives a solid foundation to the mix. I know it's expensive but a bottle will last a very long time because of it's potency. Splurge and treat yourself.\r\n\r\nWatermelon Candy brings the bold watermelon to the party and strongly pushes everything towards a candy profile. It's here to bring a punch and not a whimper. \r\n\r\nCactus brings the juiciness and the rind notes of the watermelon. I've used it relatively high here because it plays so well with both the strawberry and watermelon. It gives the much needed juiciness that keeps this a candy profile and reinforces the rind note of the candy watermelon to push it just a bit more towards the authentic side.\r\n\r\nSuper Sweet/Cotton Candy is here to sweeten up the mix. After all we're looking for a candy profile. The Ethyl Maltol in the Cotton Candy helps to round off the harsh notes that I get from just about every watermelon. It's used low so we don't go muting everything we've built.","steep_days":"1 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-12T05:50:19.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"5459","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Alpine Strawberry","flavor_id":"4360","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Watermelon Candy","flavor_id":"275","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":6000},{"name":"Super Sweet","flavor_id":"2384","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":500},{"name":"Cactus","flavor_id":"647","vendor":"INW","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Cotton Candy","flavor_id":"319","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":250}],"reviews":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"136807","name":"Strawberry Watermelon Candy (for pods nic salts)"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
