Really thick upfront coconut. Very soon after the soda bases took over and it was like vaping harsh sprite. Wasn't a big fan. As attractive as 1-2-3 recipes are, some percentages are best changed to fit different situations (coming from someone who loved the shit out of Cranberry Sprite)."},{"user":"NOVITEC","text":"This is really good stuff"},{"user":"zenith","text":"A beautiful Sprite with the slightest hint of coconut, absolutely loving this recipe!"},{"user":"Ebc88","text":"Super tasty and tastes as described with no funky off notes. "},{"user":"Deetzz","text":"Thanks for this one! I fell in love with the profile and made a few variations! Definately a great juice If you want to break away from a dessert or tobacco joose!!"},{"user":"ObiWanCannoli","text":"As much as I absolutely love your cranberry sprite, I think I like this one just a bit more. A nice healthy dose of WS-23 and a touch of sugar daddy sweetener turns this into something I cant put down. This recipe, as well as shyndos mango sticky rice, helped me use up my tester bottle of coconut candy, of which now I have to replace with a much bigger bottle. Thanks for the awesome recipe, its earned a spot in my top 5 for sure."},{"user":"cdaniell30","text":"It's crisp, it's punchy, it's coconut sprite...what more do you people want?"},{"user":"shyndo","text":"I dont know how the lime and fizzy sherbet make this a drink but they sure do, this tastes scary accurate and delicious. I mixed up a 25ml and already regret not making a 60. Fantastic vape!"},{"user":"Mrmixer","text":"Ocean water is my beverage of choice when I'm at a Sonic drive in, this recipe is a really close representation of that flavor. I bought the VT fizzy sherbert just for this, I mixed it up today and filled the tank up and I am impressed just how close it is. Very nice coconut Sprite flavor, the back end is almost that fizz that you get when drinking the real thing. The 3 flavors meld together very well to give you that ocean water taste. Great job! "},{"user":"MrBurgundy","text":"This is a really refreshing spring recipe. The soda base is crisp and has that almost carbonated bite to it. Coconut Candy is perfect here: it doesn’t overpower anything but it slides in right at the end of the exhale to remind you it’s a coconut vape. From what I can remember, it tastes pretty darn close to actual drink. Simple, tasty, and fun. Good job, Dave!"}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"94826","name":"1-2-3 Ocean Water"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
