You can not sub this out for CAP CDS!\r\n\r\n*If you enjoy The Standard's Frankenvape, I think you may enjoy this. It's good fresh, but after 4 days the orange, kiwi & faint cinnamon really begin to mesh well together.*\r\n  \r\n*60-65% VG recommended.*\r\n  \r\n*Please ask permission to post this on other sites, as it is only intended to be shared on ATF. You may not sell commercially*\r\n\r\n\r\n#EJUICEMAKERS","steep_days":"4","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T17:34:19.000-05:00","best_vg":"65%","views":"2427","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Kiwi (double)","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":6000},{"name":"Orange Cream","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":5000},{"name":"Cinnamon Sugar Cookie","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Marshmallow","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Coconut Candy","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2000}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"61607","name":"VapinFrank"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
