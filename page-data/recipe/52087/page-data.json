The top notes are tart and citrusy, warm with a hint of spice, and little floral. The base is sweet juicy apple and tart and syrupy passion fruit along with that strange sort of woody richness of lemongrass. It’s a well rounded, full-flavored juice that combines many different elements without being muddled, and that makes it interesting. It’s not harsh at all, despite being citrusy and spicy, it has a smooth finish. ","score":5}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"52087","name":"CinnaGrassPassion"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
