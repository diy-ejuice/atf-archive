The top notes are tart and citrusy, warm with a hint of spice, and little floral. The base is sweet juicy apple and tart and syrupy passion fruit along with that strange sort of woody richness of lemongrass. It’s a well rounded, full-flavored juice that combines many different elements without being muddled, and that makes it interesting. It’s not harsh at all, despite being citrusy and spicy, it has a smooth finish. "}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"52087","name":"CinnaGrassPassion"}}}
