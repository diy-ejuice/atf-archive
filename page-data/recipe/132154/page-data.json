It has a well cooked body, not too sweet, and the refreshing flavor of anise. We use it with red wine for dessert (like Marsala wine). I grove up with this cookie (without wine, of course).\r\nFor the cookie, after many trials, I find the perfect combo with an high 2.5% of FA cookie and a 1.5% of JF cookie.\r\nFW pie crust work well to give a brown, hard crust to the cookie.\r\nGolden butter essentially make a wet contrast to the dry biscuit base.\r\nFA Anise is a strong, violent, flavor. So, even if it is the profile of this recipe, you can not use more then 0.75%.\r\nTPA Pistachio at 0.5% is the perfect husband for the marriage with anise in order to give a nutty constituency to the recipe.\r\n","steep_days":"3","temperature":"0","recipe_score":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-10T14:56:28.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"1226","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Golden Butter","flavor_id":"60","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":500},{"name":"Cookie","flavor_id":"490","vendor":"FA","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Anise","flavor_id":"499","vendor":"FA","millipercent":750},{"name":"Super Sweet","flavor_id":"2384","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":750},{"name":"Cookie","flavor_id":"4572","vendor":"JF","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Pie Crust","flavor_id":"1375","vendor":"FW","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Pistachio","flavor_id":"293","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":500}],"reviews":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"132154","name":"The Godfather Cookie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
