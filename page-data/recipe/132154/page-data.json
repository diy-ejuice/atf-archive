It has a well cooked body, not too sweet, and the refreshing flavor of anise. We use it with red wine for dessert (like Marsala wine). I grove up with this cookie (without wine, of course).\r\nFor the cookie, after many trials, I find the perfect combo with an high 2.5% of FA cookie and a 1.5% of JF cookie.\r\nFW pie crust work well to give a brown, hard crust to the cookie.\r\nGolden butter essentially make a wet contrast to the dry biscuit base.\r\nFA Anise is a strong, violent, flavor. So, even if it is the profile of this recipe, you can not use more then 0.75%.\r\nTPA Pistachio at 0.5% is the perfect husband for the marriage with anise in order to give a nutty constituency to the recipe.\r\n","steep_days":"3","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"total_reviews":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T11:44:21.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"1219","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Golden Butter","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":500},{"name":"Cookie","vendor":"FA","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Anise","vendor":"FA","millipercent":750},{"name":"Super Sweet","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":750},{"name":"Cookie","vendor":"JF","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Pie Crust","vendor":"FW","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Pistachio","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":500}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"132154","name":"The Godfather Cookie"}}}
