Not exactly my cup of tea but that wont stop me from giving this a good review. The lemon notes in the custard and torrone work well for this one. I would like to try this with the new premium custard from FA either replacing or in addition to the regular custard. Also to note, this was a touch harsh for me. I tend to get off notes and a strange aftertaste from some FA flavors so I had to add a bit of sweetener to help with that. Other than that, this recipe is balanced nicely and all of the flavors work well together. Solid recipe","score":4},{"user":"cdaniell30","text":"I had to sub in CAP vanilla custard, but this is a stroke of genius.","score":5}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"26508","name":"Torrone Custard By: Boogenshizzle"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
