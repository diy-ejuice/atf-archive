I like a generous buttery bakery and a bright lemon curd on it with less sugar. When you bake lemon bars in real life, take the amount of lemon juice advised and double it. Trust me, it changes everything.\r\n\r\nVT Lemon Meringue Tart/WF Lemon Squares/FA Apple Pie = That the bakery. VT Lemon Meringue Tart is lovely, you could almost vape it on its own. WF Lemon Squares isn't that lemony, but it's absolutely the buttery shortbread base for our lemon bars. FA Apple Pie marries like a charm with lemon and gives this vape the body it lacks.\r\n\r\nCAP Juicy Lemon/FA lemon Sicily/VT Sour Lemon = This mix is the bright and zingy lemon juice profile I like. Also, these flavorings will hold themselves at higher wattages. You always need more from Capella fruits and citrus, but when you find the proper % for them, they will behave well and you can trust them.\r\n\r\nFLV Greek Yogurt/FLV Cream = This combo is for the curd, for the tang, for the richness. Again, no bakery ever suffered from 1% of FLV cream.\r\n\r\nThis mix will age well. The first week you'll get a face full of lemon. The second week, your buttery bakery will come out. The third week and on, you'll have a well-balanced lemon bar recipe that will maintain it's lemony goodness albeit a little less zing.\r\n\r\nEnjoy, be queer & vape on!\r\n\r\n[Photo Credits = Â© ERIN / www.wellplated.com ]","steep_days":"5 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"total_reviews":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-05T17:45:10.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"724","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Juicy Lemon","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":5000},{"name":"Lemon Sicily","vendor":"FA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Lemon Meringue Tart","vendor":"VT","millipercent":5000},{"name":"Sour Lemon","vendor":"VT","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Lemon Squares SC","vendor":"WF","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Greek Yogurt","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Cream","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Apple Pie","vendor":"FA","millipercent":2000}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"164272","name":"Lemony & Co.
