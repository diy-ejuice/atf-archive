There we would have a cabin with a small grill out front. The hotdogs and burgers were good but i looked forward mostly to dessert. This tradition continued when i started hosting bbqs. These are a hit along with my grilled pineapples with brown sugar.  \r\nSo u take a banana put a nice split in it, fill the inside with chocolate and marshmallow. Wrap in tin foil and set it on the grill and wait for the magic to happen.\r\nChocolate is a PITA to get even close to as satisfying as IRL. Bf chocolate truffle plus fa fresh cream to get some more milkyness is there.\r\nI used these 2 bananas and even tho they are similar in build i find mixing the 2 of them together is alot better then some of the off notes when taking either one too high on its own.\r\nKentucky bourbon just a bit to give that banana some more warmth and taste \"cooked\".\r\nThis marshmallow  combo is pretty legit. Toasted marsh is not a new flavor but when mixed with PuR marsh it just takes it to a new level. Get that pur marsh it has become my fav one it is very accurate to a real marshmallow with that powdery puffed taste.\r\nShoutout Id10-T he tried v1 via mixersclub and gave some nice recommendations to add to this mix. THANKS AGAIN DAVE!\r\nEnjoy!","steep_days":"5","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:49:31.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"2531","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Chocolate Truffle","vendor":"BF","millipercent":750},{"name":"Banana","vendor":"HS","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Ban√≤ (banana)","vendor":"FA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Marshmallow","vendor":"PUR","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Toasted Marshmallow","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Cream Fresh","vendor":"FA","millipercent":750},{"name":"Kentucky Bourbon","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":500}],"reviews":[{"user":"ID10-T","text":"The earlier version of this that I tried, without the Cream Fresh or Kentucky Bourbon, was already delicious. This is updated version is even better. I've had had this strange lovechild of a s'more and a banana split, but now I feel like I'm in the Poconos doing just that.
