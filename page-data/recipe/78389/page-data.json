It was inspired long ago by [this recipe](https://reddit.com/r/mixersclub/comments/76tavi/_/dplta16/?context=1) by Jwdman in [/r/mixersclub](https://reddit.com/r/mixersclub) (join today!)\r\n\r\nAs you can see, it ended up not really resembling that recipe all that much. \r\n\r\nThe real star here is HC Malaysia Mango. It’s got a really subtle cooling sensation with a sort of mango nectarine type of juiciness. Earlier versions I played around with SC Island Tobacco and INW Cocopilada to get the pina colada stuff in there, but in the end decided to do more of a “build your own” pina colada-esque thing with INW Coconut and Pineapple. \r\n\r\nThe Malaysia Mango on the coolness scale I would say is around FA Polar Blast at .5-.8%. Hard to say for sure because I don’t like that cooling sensation all that much, so I don’t use those additives. But it’s not distracting here. If you really, really don’t like it, replace the Malaysia Mango with FE Mango at 2-3% and cross your fingers that the FLV Cream will help it keep from fading too much. \r\n\r\nI don’t do a lot of fruit stuff, so my description is probably lacking a bit. Just try it. Or don’t. I like it.
