Lol. This is supposed to be a Irish cream pudding parfait! The parfait is supposed to be made up of oatmeal cookie chunks, candied pecans and small chunks of buttered toffee!!$$$😯😉😋 Now I have let 4 people do a blind taste test with this recipe and everyone of them tasted something different and none of them were even close to what the profile is supposed to actually be but one thing is for sure they all thought it was decadently delicious!! Hence the name decadence!!\r\n\r\n\r\nSo this is what and why:\r\nIrish cream pudding = This is a simple combination of Irish cream Flavorah and vanilla pudding Flavorah. The vanilla whipped cream is more of topping but I would be a fool if I thought you could separate the whipped cream topping from the Irish cream pudding they carry to many of the same properties. But I do think the vanilla whipped cream makes the Irish cream pudding just a touch creamier and a little more of a vanilla taste. Others have said they taste coffee or chocolate but as you see there is no chocolate or coffee in this recipe.. Lol. But who is complaining chocolate and coffee flavors usually suck and this definitely doesn't suck its different and good in my opinion. I even had someone say they tasted popcorn.. Now I don't get popcorn at all but Id10t does describe coffee flavors as tasting like burnt popcorn so hey I guess if someone is tasting coffee then hey popcorn isn't that far off or is it??? Lmao 😂😜 \r\n\r\nThe parfait layer:\r\nFor the oatmeal cookie I used in my opinion the best and one of the only good oatmeal cookie flavors. Yesi know I know its a real flavors super concentrate and yes its great!!! Its the only oatmeal cookie I want just oatmeal cookie no raisins or chocolate just oats and cookie. The candied pecans I made with butter pecan by fw and toffee by Flavorah. The toffee by Flavorah works as the buttered toffee chunks and the candied part of the pecans and at a whopping .50%. The rich cinnamon adds a dusting of cinnamon sugar over the top of this decadent treat. The rich cinnamon also works nicely with the butter pecan by fw and the oatmeal cookie . if you want more cinnamon add .05% or a drop per 30ml bottle more of rich cinnamon by Flavorah.. \r\n\r\nSweetener: \r\nI used .35% sweetness by Flavorah but feel free to use or don't use whatever sweetener you prefer. \r\n\r\nSteep time: \r\nThis is a bit strange it tastes really good immediately but it blends together and blooms into this decadently delicious layered Vape treat!! 😳😳😝😜😋😋 I would say its at its best after 5days for sure but its really good on a shake as well lol.","steep_days":"5 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:50:01.000-05:00","best_vg":"75%","views":"1891","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Irish Cream","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1250},{"name":"Vanilla Pudding","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Vanilla Whipped Cream","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Butter Pecan","vendor":"FW","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Oatmeal Cookie – Super Concentrate","vendor":"RF","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Toffee","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":500},{"name":"Rich Cinnamon","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":100}],"reviews":[{"user":"ParDeus","text":"This is a fantastic recipe.  I love RF Oatmeal Cookie, but I've had a hard time getting it to play nice with others.  Here it seems to combine with the toffee to create an authentic Oatmeal Cookie flavor, just as if there are bits of it mixed throughout the pudding.  Fantastic S&amp;V too, quite rare considering the type of profile.  It tastes like a pudding with the texture of frozen cool whip, with just enough crunch to make you think a soft cookie was mixed in.&#xD;\n&#xD;\nFucking phenomenal stuff this is!&#xD;\n&#xD;\nI'm to the point now where TooTall is on my list of elite mixers who's recipes I'll make without question.  List may be a bad term, really just Id10-t and TooTall thus far!"}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"92384","name":"Decadence \"Irish cream pudding parfait\""}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
