The lightly citrusy and soft peach-like Persimmon plays well with these two flavors, adding with it a complex tropical note. \r\n\r\nBase: \r\nBiscuit (INW) and Croissant combine to make a rich, and buttery crumble base. Biscuit (SilverLine) rounds out the base by enhancing the toasted bakery notes; while also adding a soft coconut finish to the crumbly crust. \r\n\r\nLastly, a touch of sweetener is added in order to complete sweet bakery profile.","steep_days":"14","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"total_reviews":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-06T12:55:39.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"1083","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Armenia (apricot)","vendor":"FA","millipercent":250},{"name":"Biscuit","vendor":"INW","millipercent":250},{"name":"Biscuit","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Croissant SC","vendor":"WF","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Juicy Peach","vendor":"HS","millipercent":500},{"name":"Persimmon","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":350},{"name":"Sweetener","vendor":"FW","millipercent":250}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"112592","name":"Picheimon Coconut Cobbler by Leilani"}}}
