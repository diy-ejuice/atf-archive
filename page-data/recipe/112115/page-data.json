I can only imagine it getting better with a longer steep but at 5 days it's really nice.  I had wanted more cinnamon but not overpowering as it is you cannot really make out the cinnamon but the flavors here do come together to produce a great vape.  It's just like the title - vanilla tobacco - and it seems just super simple even though the recipe has all this stuff in it - the vape seems very basic - vanilla tobacco LOL","steep_days":"5","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"total_reviews":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-06T04:11:27.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"2119","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Arabian Tobacco","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Madagascar (Vanilla Classic)","vendor":"FA","millipercent":750},{"name":"Butter Pecan","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":850},{"name":"Sugar Cookie","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":850},{"name":"Caramel","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":850},{"name":"Cinnamon Danish Swirl","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1250},{"name":"Cream Fresh","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1150},{"name":"Vienna Cream","vendor":"FA","millipercent":800},{"name":"Vanilla Bacco","vendor":"NR","millipercent":1500}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"112115","name":"Vanilla tobacco"}}}
