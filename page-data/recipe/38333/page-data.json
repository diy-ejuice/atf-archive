So this started out as a \"shits and laughs\" recipe, but I ended up finding a strawberry I can taste. I ended up loving it so much that I spent the next few months making tweak after tweak until I found an ADV S&C.\r\n\r\nStrawberry:\r\nThe strawberry I can taste is RF Strawberry (SC). Using TPA Strawberry  Ripe ehances the RF Strawberry (SC). TPA makes the strawberry pop.\r\n\r\nCream:\r\nI tried different mixes involving Cheesecake,  butter cream, custard, but TPA Bavarian Cream with a touch of FLV Cream is perfect; creamy, creamy perfection. \r\n\r\nI prefer this at 60/40 after a 7 day steep. Best after two weeks.","steep_days":"14","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:49:13.000-05:00","best_vg":"60%","views":"2108","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Strawberry â€“ SC","vendor":"RF","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Bavarian Cream","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Strawberry (ripe)","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Dragonfruit","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Cream","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":500}],"reviews":[{"user":"MrBurgundy","text":"This is a fantastic Strawberry and Cream recipe. The strawberry is rich, sweet, and fresh. It isn't cloyingly sweet or syrupy though. The cream is thick with enough vanilla to keep it interesting. After a two week steep, I definitely recommend this. I'll be mixing a big batch soon!"}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"38333","name":"Vibe's Milk"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
