It's smoky, dirty, and has a hint of some dark fruit, but not what I'd call sweet. Wouldn't call it fruity either. \r\n\r\nMostly what you'll be tasting is the Black for Pipe. It is currently my favorite flavor I own. It's got a fair amount of smokiness to it on its own, and this is where the hint of dark fruit comes from. \r\n\r\nThe Tobacco Absolute Cuban Cigar adds a bit of dryness to the mix, along with some real tobacco taste. Makes it really feel like a smoke. \r\n\r\nDirty Neutral Base is there doing what it does best- making it dirty and ashy. \r\n\r\nAll together they make a wonderful, simple combo. Great for a drunk vape. Any time I'm going out, this is what's in the tank. Really, it never leaves the tank. \r\n\r\nI'll suggest a 10 day minimum, but it does continue to change a little after that. I usually start digging in after 10 days though. Before 10 days is still pretty good, but it's pretty strong and smoky.

Coming into this I only knew that I could probably expect a nice tobacco smoke. What I got was that and a trip down memory lane. To me at least the flavor is indistinguishable from what I remember a cigarette to taste like and I remember cigarettes being a whole lot more delicious than they actually were. There's a lot of nostalgia for me there and it's really amazing that I can enjoy something like this and still stay away from the smokes. An absolute master class of tobacco flavor. I can't thank you enough for your hard work and sharing this with us all. Really is a nice treat. Thank you !"},{"user":"JTHerman","text":"What a great recipe! I mixed 60ml of it and added 8 drops of FA Bitter Wizard. It’s as close to real tobacco as I’ve come across in the two years I’ve been vaping. Bravo!"},{"user":"goosegirl","text":"I am a big fan of the tobaccos in this mix.  Thanks for putting them together in such a simple recipe."},{"user":"horrend","text":"I'm in love with this recipe. Mainly getting the black for pipe and it's being backed up with the Cuban and a dirty finish. "},{"user":"nowar","text":"I can't believe I never left a review for this. There are very few tobacco recipes that I will keep coming back to over and over again. There is something lovely in this combination that highlights the simplicity of the mix and gives complexity to the flavor. If you are AT ALL interested in tobaccos and like them, this is a strangely bold and yet mild mix. I think of all the recipes I've tried this is my favorite, hands down. 7 stars from me."},{"user":"konvul","text":""},{"user":"amouthforwar","text":"I really can't describe this mix any better than CBV's own description and the other reviews, but I can affirm that it's just a fucking awesome vape. For 3 flavors at barely 5% total, it's rich with vivid layers to it. It's dirty but not like a nasty half-smoked, resume-the-next-day cigarette. Black for Pipe has those signature dark &amp; full tobacco notes balanced with the smoother medium body of the TA Cuban. When it all comes together I get this almost cologne-esque cigar aroma that just fits the bill so perfectly after reading up on the history of this name."},{"user":"ID10-T","text":"Wowzers!  I'm kind of a novice when it comes to tobaccos and although I've loved Black for Pipe for some time, this is my first encounter with both Absolute Cuban Cigar and DNB. I had no idea what to expect. I was worried that it might even taste like licking an ashtray. It does not. It's rich and satisfying and just right. It's everything that CBV's description and Hash's, LimeDrive's, and Ebc88's reviews say it is. There's really nothing I can add that those four haven't already said. I need to have this mixed up at all times, at higher nic level than I usually vape, just in case I decide to go out drinking. I can't even imagine a better vape for that. Fucking Bravo! "},{"user":"Ebc88","text":"This is very tasty and complex tobacco especially to only be 3 ingredients. Taste as you describe. Delicious dirty tobacco. I picked up DNB just to mix this and I like what it does in this mix. "},{"user":"LimeDrive","text":"Mixed 50/50, steeped 10 days. If classy had a taste, this would be it. I get a huge amount of gorgeous old school tobacco flavor from only 5.5% of flavoring. Never smoked a pipe in real life, so this is my introduction. The Black for Pipe gives a dark pipe tobacco taste with dark fruit (I'm reminded of plum skin) and every once in a while some maple. The TA and DNB add balls and heartiness. I feel like I'm hanging in the back of an exclusive club with Al Capone, swinging shady business deals.&#xD;\n&#xD;\nDo yourself a service and mix up some of ChemicalBurnVictim's recipes, even if you don't often mix with tobaccos. He did the work for you, so you can just sit back and enjoy. Thanks, Chem!"},{"user":"hashslingingslashur","text":"exactly as described. smoky, dirty and delicious. lightly dry but in the best way, 60% Vg is perfect and really lets to tobaccos play without making it sweet. I love what DNB brings to the table, it really gives is an ashy quality. This is great with red wine or a nice neat bourbon. Yummmm"}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"55565","name":"Brigade 2506"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
