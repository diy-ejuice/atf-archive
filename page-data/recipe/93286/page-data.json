Seriously though, do you ? White grape, no skin, juicy ripe center with a tad bit of crispness. Thought of using fuji at .25% but I think it's good as is. Maybe cotton candy at 1% to push a Jolly Rancher taste ? Anyways, steeped in a warm water bath 15 minutes, shake and vape. Let the off notes breath and this really permeates the taste buds and the smell definitely is a strong fresh white grape. Feed backs appreciated and encouraged.","steep_days":"3 (SNV)","temperature":"440","recipe_score":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-10T17:57:23.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"1589","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Sweet Strawberry","flavor_id":"121","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Grape Juice","flavor_id":"231","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":6000},{"name":"Mango","flavor_id":"247","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Whipped Cream","flavor_id":"193","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Sweetener","flavor_id":"339","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Cotton Candy","flavor_id":"319","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1000}],"reviews":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"93286","name":"Grape Bro"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
