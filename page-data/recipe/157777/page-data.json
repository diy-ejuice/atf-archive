It also has some sour gummy candy to bring out some more sourness along with the lemon and cherry to add more fruit in there. Cactus, I'm not sure why I put that in there, but it's good. Marshmallows are for body - I especially like the toasted marshmallow, but that might be a bit too much. Cream cheese icing adds some sweetness and creaminess.","steep_days":"7","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-05T23:55:51.000-05:00","best_vg":"60%","views":"1391","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Grape","flavor_id":"784","vendor":"INW","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Blueberry (wild)","flavor_id":"215","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Sour Gummy Candy SC","flavor_id":"9047","vendor":"WF","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Toasted Marshmallow","flavor_id":"340","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Marshmallow","flavor_id":"332","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Cream Cheese Icing","flavor_id":"2380","vendor":"LA","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Juicy Lemon","flavor_id":"79","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Cherry Extract","flavor_id":"222","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Cactus","flavor_id":"647","vendor":"INW","millipercent":1000}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"157777","name":"The Grapist"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
