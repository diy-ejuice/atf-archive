After about a steep of about 10 days the rough waxy flavour from the blackcurrant steeps out. The flavour is nice and smooth on this. \r\nThereâ€™s a bit of sweetness from the creams that were used, yet a slight bitterness from the blackcurrant.  Hope you enjoy!! Feel free to mix and leave a review if you think something could make it better. Thank you in advance and VAPE ON!!","steep_days":"10 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T04:41:13.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"799","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Blackcurrant","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Cream Milky Undertone PG","vendor":"OOO","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Whipped Cream","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Dx Bavarian Cream","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Meringue","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Apricot","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":750}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"171253","name":"Creamy Blackcurrant "}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
