I made this for myself just out of simple curiosity and because I wanted to see what florida key lime did in a mix. Surprisingly this ended up being too good not to share. I find myself (a person who almost never has an all day vape) vaping this literally all day long.\r\n\r\nFA Florida Key Lime brings some delightful top note acid into the mix and fuses with the honeysuckle to make one complete and interesting top note. This simple addition completely changes the recipe up in a new and interesting way! It is used a little high because the flavor fades; however because we use it high, it fades to the perfect amount.\r\n\r\nTFA Honeysuckle infuses the cream flavors with a delicate floral perfume. It’s carefully balanced at 3% to work as a shake-and-vape recipe here. Any higher would be overdoing it – we want the just the sillage of this summery fragrance, nature’s magnet for birds and bees, left behind after steeping in the ice cream base. Failing to strain out the flowers themselves would spoil this elegant dessert.   \r\n\r\nINW Shisha Vanilla brings a sweet, creamy vanilla, very reminiscent of a homemade, non-custard vanilla ice cream. This could almost be a two-ingredient recipe with just these two flavors, but some additional creams pick up where Shisha Vanilla leaves off.  \r\n\r\nTFA Vanilla Bean Ice Cream is a tricky but essential addition. It’s tricky because it has something we don’t want, those custard notes, as this is an egg-free, AKA Philadelphia-style or American-style ice cream. Used low enough with these other ingredients, eggs can be avoided while still providing what we do want – that dense body and luxurious mouthfeel of churned heavy cream. that Shisha Vanilla doesn’t have enough of, and a more robust, truly vanilla bean flavor as opposed to Shisha Vanilla’s flavor that sits somewhere between extract and bean.     \r\n\r\nFLV Cream adds more neutral creamy body to the mix and binds and blends the honeysuckle, vanilla, and creams together. It enhances the heavy milk taste of Cream Fresh as well, but alone, it lacks enough dairy flavor to complete the milk and cream mix used to make this ice cream.   \r\n\r\nFA Cream Fresh brings the milk, but too much of it seems to react poorly to Honeysuckle in souring way, as if the ice cream had been made with milk that was a day or two past its sell-by date. To complete this ode to longing, Cream Fresh and FLV Cream need each other. \r\n","steep_days":"3 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":4.8,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:49:22.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"6908","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Honeysuckle (pg)","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Vanilla Bean Ice Cream","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Cream","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Shisha Vanilla","vendor":"INW","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Cream Fresh","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Florida Key Lime","vendor":"FA","millipercent":2000}],"reviews":[{"user":"Ebc88","text":"Tasty recipe lime and honeysuckle blend and come through perfectly. Cream base is also on point excellent job. "},{"user":"ObiWanCannoli","text":"This recipe is alright. Flavor-wise it's pretty tasty, but as for the vape experience, it leaves a bit to be desired. This mix comes off fairly harsh and dry even after a week or two of steeping. I wish FA flavors weren't so tasty because the vape experience I get with most of their concentrates is pretty poor. Usually a well crafted recipe will be able to eliminate most of the undesirable aspects of those flavorings, just not in this case unfortunately. I could think of several limes I would use before this particular one. I have a feeling fresh cream is contributing to the dryness as well. This recipe is tasty but just a bit too dry and harsh to give 5 stars."},{"user":"trandism","text":"Excellent vape.. And excellent idea to use Longing's base as a testbed for flavours."},{"user":"ID10-T","text":"Truth: This is too good to not share. I started sampling it after only an overnight steep and immediately loved it, but if you either have some patience or make enough, it gets even better around day 3 or 4, when the lime begins to intertwine with the honeysuckle and the creams start to thicken more and give you a richer, more satisfying vape that's not so top heavy. I would encourage anyone who enjoyed the original Longing give this improved version a try.
