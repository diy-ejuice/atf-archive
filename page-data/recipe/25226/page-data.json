It's a straight up milk chocolate. I can appreciate the % is a little high on the flavour side but it's not too harsh on the coils and is just a smooth, sweet milk chocolate. Originally made with 3% TFA Pistachio in there but figured it wasn't adding too much, but there is a difference with it so by all means add it in there, it's definitely tasty.\r\n\r\nI was originally going for a Chocolate Cheesecake / Mudpie but it didn't really turn out that way. I've played with a few different %'s and dropping flavours in and out and this is what happened. I must say it's more of a fluke than it is me being a DIY Ninja. But damn it's pretty good.\r\n\r\nTastes best after a 7+ day steep. Doesn't taste anywhere near as good straight from the bottle so don't be disappointed if you don't have the patience, it's not a shake and vape.\r\n\r\n","steep_days":"7","temperature":"450","recipe_score":0,"total_reviews":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T10:43:12.000-05:00","best_vg":"80%","views":"2200","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Brown Sugar","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Chocolate Glazed Doughnut","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Double Chocolate (clear)","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":5000},{"name":"Meringue","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"New York Cheesecake","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Toasted Marshmallow","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Vanilla Cupcake","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Vienna Cream","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Super Sweet","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":500}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"25226","name":"Coco Diaz"}}}
