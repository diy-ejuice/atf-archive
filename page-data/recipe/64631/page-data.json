The original was my all day vape for many months and helped so many people switch to vaping from smoking. True credit to it's creator... I stumbled upon FA Forrest fruit mix a while ago, as soon as i smelt the bottle i knew i'd found the key.","steep_days":"1 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"updated_at":"2020-12-12T11:51:13.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"6166","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Fuji","flavor_id":"506","vendor":"FA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Forrest Mix (forest Fruit Mix)","flavor_id":"453","vendor":"FA","millipercent":6000},{"name":"Whipped Cream","flavor_id":"193","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Super Sweet","flavor_id":"2384","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1000}],"reviews":[{"user":"nowar","text":"I loved this mix. I, too, never had the original but this was a winner. Fuji falls back and lends a hand and the whipped cream fluffs it up nicely. I also cut the SS down because I knew I didn't need that much. Mixed this up for a friend who is trying vaping to get off menthols and he thought this was solid flavor. For him, I did add a bit of menthol and some ice and he found the ice intrusive but liked the menthol touch. Either way, this is a solid showcase for Forest Fruit that I've been to scared to take up high and let it feature like it does here. Try this one!","score":5},{"user":"rockwise","text":"","score":0},{"user":"Bukah","text":"Never have the original, but this is a pretty tasty shake and vape.  A little too sweet for me, will probably halve the super sweet next time, but delicious.","score":5},{"user":"6retro6","text":"Love \"simple\" recipes like this and this one is delicious, can be snv but even better after three days imo. Never had the original so can't comment on how close it is.","score":5}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"64631","name":"#REMIX Month 2017 / Unicorn Vapors 'Revenge' "}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
