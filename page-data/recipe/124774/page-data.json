The green tea satisfies both the green headdress as well as the asian vibe. The blueberry and pomegranate flavors make up the purple feeling. I used the tried and true holy trinity discovered by edible malfunction on reddit for the deep blueberry taste and the fa pomegranate is bright and tart and just pulls the flavor up. Add sweetener of your choosing if you so desire.

I like the way the light spice of the green tea works with the blueberry trifecta and pomegranate. It's light and refreshing and flavorful. I will definitely be mixing it again.","score":5},{"user":"AlfredPudding","text":"I'm a simple person. If I see the Holy Blueberry Trinity, I mix the recipe. The way Bilberry and Pomegranate work together in this is incredibly interesting. It adds a purple hue to the vape without relying on a grape flavor, and that is impressive in its own right. The green tea base is a perfect compliment to TPA Blueberry (extra) and FW Blueberry, and I would love to try this overall profile in an actual beverage. The description states that you can add a sweetener if you'd like, but I don't believe this recipe needs it.
