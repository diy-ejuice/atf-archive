It's based off of my own memory of what Space Jam's Starship tasted like. That juice was one of my favorites when I first started vaping. The custard percentage may look high(as the total flavoring also looks high). But trust me on this. It's a helluva good vape!\r\n  \r\n\r\n*Can be vaped after a 2-3 hour heat/speed steep. I put mine in a water-tight ziplock in extremely hot tap water. Every 1/2 hour, I would replace the water when it cooled while shaking the HELL out of the juice bottle.*\r\n  \r\n\r\n*Best at MAX VG*\r\n  \r\n\r\n*Please don't use this recipe for commercial gain.
