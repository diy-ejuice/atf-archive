I agree with Duder that a sweeter coconut could be used but excellent recipe as it stands!","score":4},{"user":"Joneser","text":"","score":0},{"user":"Aquaneo","text":"Very tasty, I was able to taste a slight floral in the coconut but its mostly undetectable. It is a perfect balance of sweetness and very light and fluffy. Overall very good and really enjoyed at after mixing...stills needs to steep but not sure it will make it. Great Job.","score":5},{"user":"Mixepic","text":"I let this age for about 2 weeks to give the custard time to develop, I also used TFA Sweetener instead of EM. Regardless I feel FA Coconut is a very real coconut flavor and it may need to be used with a sweeter coconut...TFA coconut candy, FLV Sweet Coconut maybe. It's still a good recipe that deserves a taste. ","score":4}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"6164","name":"Coconut marshmallow custard ceam"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
