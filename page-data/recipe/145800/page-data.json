Just the kind I want. But how to enliven the blue-ness? TFA Blueberry extra of course.\r\n\r\nFW Kiwi - The wet, dark green pulp of the fruit. It's never complete without some compliments, though. It's missing that tart kick, so of course we'll add\r\n\r\nINW Cactus and TFA Dragonfruit, to fluff and emulse and juicify and tart it all.\r\n\r\nWhen it comes to fizziness, my first soda vape was /u/ID10-T\r\n's 1-2-3 Cranberry Sprite, which is still a rotating ADV favorite of mine. But I'd also experimented a lot with FW Pink Bubbly, which worked really well with fruits. So why not half and half? 1% of VT Fizzy Sherbet and 1% FW Pink Bubbly works immensely well.\r\n\r\nFW Sweetener is my go-to for sweetener due to it's chemical simplicity, but if you're a CAP Super Sweet fan, sub it for 0.25%.\r\n\r\nWS-23 for the coolness of the slush.","steep_days":"2 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T10:44:24.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"1287","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Blueberry","vendor":"FW","millipercent":5500},{"name":"Cactus","vendor":"INW","millipercent":500},{"name":"Dragonfruit","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Fizzy Sherbet","vendor":"VT","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Blueberry (extra)","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Kiwi","vendor":"FW","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Pink Champagne","vendor":"FW","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Sweetener","vendor":"FW","millipercent":500},{"name":"WS-23","vendor":"OTHR","millipercent":500}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"145800","name":"Blukiwi"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
