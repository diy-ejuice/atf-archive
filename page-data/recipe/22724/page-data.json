Have with a coffee for afternoon tea.\r\n\r\nFlavour Notes:\r\nINW Biscuit / FW Yellow Cake / FA Joy - This is a fantastic dough base to start from, all three come together to form a wonderful cakey taste and mouth-feel. FW Yellow Cake can be subbed for other Yellow Cakes, I use this because deliciousness.\r\n\r\nCAP Cinnamon Danish Swirl - Used here at 1.25% to add a little bit of spice to the mix.\r\n\r\nCAP Funnel Cake - I've been experimenting with Funnel Cake a lot, Used here at 5% it really boosts the Doughnut right into another stratosphere. It gives the cake a fried texture along with a sweetness on the exhale, The Funnel Cake is the real work dog of the recipe.\r\n\r\nINW Milk Chocolate / CAP Butter Cream - Used together for the chocolate glaze, This combo gives a nice buttery milk chocolate taste that sits on the tip of the tongue. The Butter Cream adds a creamy, glazey note to the chocolate, they work together to create a wonderfully, rich, chocolate glaze....like best friends do.\r\n\r\nI love this as a shake 'n' Vape, but would say it could do with at least a 7 day steep to let the chocolate and Butter Cream really meld. \r\n\r\n","steep_days":"7 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"total_reviews":1,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:48:56.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"4075","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Biscuit","vendor":"INW","millipercent":750},{"name":"Cake (yellow)","vendor":"FW","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Cinnamon Danish Swirl","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1250},{"name":"Funnel Cake","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Joy","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Milk Chocolate","vendor":"INW","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Butter Cream","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1000}],"reviews":[{"user":"Drumbtr","score":"5","text":"This truely does taste like a Chocolate Doughnut! Maybe not a glazed one, to me it tastes more like a Chocolate Devil Cake doughnut, but I also subbed the Yellow Cake for Jungle Flavors, so that may have something to do with it. It's a different flavor profile than I usually vape, but definitely a nice, rich change. I'm a little offput by FA Joy, but it works so well in this mix. The second bottle I've mixed up I dropped it to around .5% and it's a lot more subtle but still adds. My bottle definitely doesn't last long with this stuff!"}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"22724","name":"The Chocolate Glazed Doughnut"}}}
