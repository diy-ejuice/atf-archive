Any other revision just isn't as good. I Always mix Peach with White Peach i just really like the nice strong peach that it delivers. The two watermelons are pretty straight forward i added some of TFA's to get a bit more sweetness in the mix and have the watermelon show a bit through the peach. Lychee is a great addition here it adds a nice juicyness and has that almost sweet taste on the end of your tongue after a hit. Im sure you could add in many other flavors to make this better it could be used as a base. And i havent tried any other PG percentage other than the 8.5 the flavors come in.
