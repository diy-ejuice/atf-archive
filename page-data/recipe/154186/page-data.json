I didn‚Äôt had that in, in my first versions, but I felt like something was missing, and the lemon did exactly what I was hoping.\r\n\r\nThe pink panther is the ‚Äúsecret‚Äù ingredient here. It‚Äôs got such a good Blackcurrant, red berries taste, that just blends nicely in. \r\n\r\nI think I got it pretty well balanced with a sweet orange champagne inhale and a red berrie exhale. And at the end you get the Blackcurrant. Totally yummy imo.\r\n\r\nTested on Citadel rda, fused Clapton coil, 0.22 at 40wüëçüòâ\r\n\r\nI am not a super cool guy, so the 0.1 ws23 is mainly there to add some fizz, and I do think that it fits the profile with some coolness, so feel free to bump it up to 0.25 or 0.5. Wouldn‚Äôt recommend any higher than that, but that is for every profile. Over 0.5 is just to much man!üòä\r\nEnjoy. \r\n\r\n\r\n","steep_days":"1 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"total_reviews":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T20:33:04.000-05:00","best_vg":"60%","views":"1086","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Blood Orange Champagne","vendor":"VT","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Blood Orange","vendor":"FW","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Super Sweet","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":250},{"name":"Pink Panther","vendor":"INW","millipercent":750},{"name":"Moscato","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":750},{"name":"Sour Lemon","vendor":"VT","millipercent":750},{"name":"WS-23","vendor":"OTHR","millipercent":100}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"154186","name":"Blood Panther Champagne "}}}
