This alone is just pure gold.\r\n\r\nWhen adding a nice Vanilla Cream with TFA VBIC, French Vanilla Deluxe and Vanilla Swirl, it just becomes this magical creamy, sparkly, fluffy Cola heaven and every Cola fan should try this out! The 0.3% FA Vanilla Bourbon (which is just Vanilla, no alcohol!) makes one hell of a difference as well.\r\n\r\nAdditives: Super Sweet is an absolute must, WS-23 is optional.\r\n\r\nSNV for Cherry Coke, let it steep for around 5 days to get a rich, creamy Vanilla Cherry Coke.","steep_days":"5 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"total_reviews":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-05T15:44:22.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"1124","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Cola","vendor":"FA","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Black Cherry","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1500},{"name":"French Vanilla Deluxe","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Vanilla Bean Ice Cream","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Vanilla Swirl","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Bourbon (vanilla Bourbon)","vendor":"FA","millipercent":300},{"name":"Super Sweet","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":500},{"name":"WS-23","vendor":"OTHR","millipercent":400}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"159366","name":"Vanilla Cherry Coke"}}}
