NY Cheesecake at this ratio adds the perfect amount of creaminess and tang. FA Custard brightens the fruit by adding a twist of lemon and brings all the layers together. CAP Sugar Cookie creates a light sweet crunchy crust. Sometimes I sub FW Graham Cracker at 1.5% for a different twist. Give it a try, I hope you like it as much as I do.  I'd love to get some feedback on this one.","steep_days":"3 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-06T11:39:12.000-05:00","best_vg":"75%","views":"1180","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Bilberry","flavor_id":"533","vendor":"FA","millipercent":900},{"name":"Forrest Mix (forest Fruit Mix)","flavor_id":"453","vendor":"FA","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Blueberry (wild)","flavor_id":"215","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":4700},{"name":"New York Cheesecake","flavor_id":"90","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":3300},{"name":"Custard","flavor_id":"484","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1700},{"name":"Sugar Cookie","flavor_id":"115","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Vanilla Swirl","flavor_id":"189","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1800},{"name":"Sweetener","flavor_id":"339","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1000}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"24803","name":"Black Sheep Cheesecake"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
