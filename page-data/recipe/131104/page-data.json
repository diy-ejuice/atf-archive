Since Im not a real cowboy I wanted something sweet with  definitive tobacco note (JF RY4 DOUBLe) building on the sweet side of the profile, I decided to use sweets that would compliment Ry4. so dulce de leche and a hint of FA vanilla were my choice, instead of a cream I chose Vanilla Pudding because i like the mouthfeel and flavor it provides after a few days steep. \r\nI made a nicsalt version of this so that I could get a nice nic buzz from my Sourin Drop as I bring justice to the Digital wild west!  Hope y'all like it.","steep_days":"14","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"updated_at":"2020-12-12T18:30:11.000-05:00","best_vg":"60%","views":"1833","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Dulce De Leche","flavor_id":"4575","vendor":"JF","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Madagascar (Vanilla Classic)","flavor_id":"526","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"RY4 Double","flavor_id":"9283","vendor":"FE","millipercent":2000},{"name":"RY4 Double","flavor_id":"4490","vendor":"JF","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Sweetener","flavor_id":"4746","vendor":"JF","millipercent":500},{"name":"Vanilla Pudding","flavor_id":"4433","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1000}],"reviews":[{"user":"Urs1ne","text":"Great mix right here.
