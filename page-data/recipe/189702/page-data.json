It‚Äôs part of the Convicted Vapes line and the profile is ‚ÄúA crisp Red apple dipped in cream cheese icing‚Äù. Let be the first to tell you that this ejuice is absolutely stunning! And I‚Äôm not an Apple fan when it comes to vaping!! It‚Äôs just so well balanced with just the right amount of sweetness,it really is the perfect vape. I HAD to try and re create this profile to best of my ability and honestly,I think I‚Äôve done it and Sammy proud. You can S&V this recipe but naturally after a day or 3 it will become even nicer. Please give it a mix and try and stay open minded if your not a fan of Apple like myself. If you enjoy it and any other recipe I create please show your appreciation by leaving a short review and rating. Happy mixing guys and gals and stay hazy! üíô","steep_days":"3 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"total_reviews":1,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:51:29.000-05:00","best_vg":"75%","views":"695","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Fuji Apple","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Apple Stark","vendor":"FA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Red Apple","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Cream Cheese Icing","vendor":"LA","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Cream Fresh","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Vanilla Cream","vendor":"VT","millipercent":1250},{"name":"Pear","vendor":"FA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Super Sweet","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":500}],"reviews":[{"user":"cxxxxp","score":"5","text":"NAILED IT! I've been working on a sour green apple but this sweet &amp; juicy red apple is the shit! Absolutely fantastic. Realistic, zero harshness, smooth and silky while keeping the apple texture and a hint of peel. Holy mother of apples this is good! Easily the best apple mix i've had to date. You have done furiously well here mixer and your friend must be in awe - straight honoured to have this dedicated to them!"}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"189702","name":"Hooch"}}}
