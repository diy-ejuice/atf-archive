After trying many great recipes over the last few months, I finally feel like it is my turn to give back to this community. \r\n\r\nThis project has been on and off with many versions and tweaks over the last 5 month's or so, but now I feel it is finally where I want it to be.\r\n\r\nOasis was the first commercial juice I really wanted to clone. It is a blend of Peach, Cantaloupe, and Papaya and is quite good actually, however, I saw some room for improvement.\r\n\r\nI am going to say right off the bat that I realize this recipe may look a bit redundant with the multiple flavors per fruit but I can assure you that each and every one serves a purpose.\r\nFLV Cantaloupe: This is an awesome flavoring. Probably the most authentic Cantaloupe I have tried, however, it lacks body and is a bit harsh. At this percentage it lends a tasty ripe cantaloupe without many negatives.\r\nTFA Cantaloupe: This is a sweet candy-like Cantaloupe. It works at 1.5% to lend some of those sweet ripe top notes without too much of the candiness. Also adds a bit of body.\r\nCAP Cantaloupe: This is a nice fairly authentic Cantaloupe although a bit mellower than FLVs. At 2% this works well to flesh out the Cantaloupe and add a bit of body throughout the recipe.\r\nTFA Papaya: The main Papaya component in this recipe. At 2% I find you get a great, slightly artificial flavor, while reducing most of the pepperiness that can come with it.\r\nFA Papaya: This is here mainly to help authenticate the TFA Papaya.\r\nINW Peach: An excellent peach flavor. Brings a fair bit of juiciness to the recipe and is pretty authentic. 1.25% brings a nice ripe peach flavor while minimizing the earthiness that can pop up at higher percentages.\r\nFA White Peach: An excellent flavor and a must have for sure. I use this to add some tartness and brighter top notes to the recipe. It has an almost \"green\" nature which I believe helps to mimic the rind area of the Papaya and Cantaloupe. 1% works for me, however you could reduce it to 0.75% if it is too earthy for you.\r\nTFA Marshmallow: This is here to boost the sweetness a touch and add a bit more body.\r\nTFA Whipped Cream: I use this to emulsify and smooth out any sharp edges.\r\n\r\nSo there you have it folks, my first ATF recipe! This recipe reminds me of a fresh and flavor packed fruit smoothie. It is sweet, smooth and very enjoyable to vape imo. I truly hope that at least some of you will enjoy this as much as I do â˜º\r\n\r\n*Shake and Vape but better after 3-5 days\r\n\r\n*Feel free to add some koolada or ws-23 for an ice cold smoothie.
