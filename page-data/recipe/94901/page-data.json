I then single flovor tested Apollo Feljoa and it felt like a fruity summer escape.  That's when a 123 is born.  Add in some punchy strawberry and the wonderful pink guava a wonderful summer getaway comes to life.  The recipie is built off the pink guava.  The strawberry and Apollo accent it perfectly and bring out new notes and fill it out.  Juicy, fruity, bright, and punchy.   Enjoy","steep_days":"3","temperature":"0","recipe_score":3.5,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:50:04.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"2092","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Apollo Feijoa","vendor":"VT","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Juicy Strawberry","vendor":"FA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Pink Guava","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1000}],"reviews":[{"user":"ID10-T","text":"I just can’t get into this. I like the Pink Guava and strawberry pairing but there’s just something too green and unripe about Apollo Feijoa for me, like a banana that’s not ripe enough to be edible yet, and it’s not mitigated here. Still, this makes me want to do a different 1-2-3 with Pink Guava and Strawberry and something else. Maybe a banana that’s not underripe, a coconut, or something fun like FLV Guanabana."},{"user":"SocialAnxiety","text":"Got the Apollo for free in a BCF order when VT first came to america. It smells like absolute death I really considered throwing it away it smells so bad, like almost made me barf. So I wondered what in the world would anyone use this for. I mixed this when I saw that was used and was surprised.Its very..... different, but still not sure exactly what it is or why it smells so bad but sweet and bitter mix well so here we are. Thanks for using that flavor and showing me what exactly it could be used for. "}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"94901","name":"123 Dreaming of summer"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
