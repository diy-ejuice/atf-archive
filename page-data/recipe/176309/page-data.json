I got this idea when i went to five guys over the weekend and i wanted to create it in a vape. Now if you go to give guys ask for a half oreo “cream” and half banana milkshake and this is what it will taste like . It’s just amazing . It’s a fat kids dream . I give you Oreo banana cream milkshake !  I got some of these percentages (well most) from “Lumi likes it thick” on all the flavors . Enjoy.

Mixed this up the other day and it is one of the smoothest banana creams I have mixed. Really great texture. I think the White Chocolate is a nice touch. Will vape this through the steep and definitely want to make more."}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"176309","name":"OREO BANANA CREAM MILKSHAKE"}}}
