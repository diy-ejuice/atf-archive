At the time I made it, I only had TPA sweet strawberry. Overnight steep, it was tasty but after 3 days the strawberry popped out! Very authentic to the profile and smells delicious! Iâ€™m almost out of the 75 ml I made 7 days ago. Going to make more today!"},{"user":"YippYo","score":"5","text":"My favorite Strawberry recipe by FAR! You simply must try this. Everything about it is so well balanced and accurate to the profile."},{"user":"Brewdog_Kilo","score":"4","text":"Delicious!!"},{"user":"kindground","score":"4","text":"This is very close in taste to its profile. Super accurate. I enjoy this but I have issues with a lot of cake concentrates. Initially I did not like what this steeped into after about a week. I omitted the cake and the notes that made it muddy for me went away. I subbed in 3% DFS Angel Food Cake and it was Delicious!

No cake, no strawberry. I think I might be flavor deaf to TPA's strawberries.  I'd be curious to try this again but with a different combination of strawberries."},{"user":"BuryMeInSmoke","score":"5","text":"First time I mixed this I wasn't a fan initially, got into it too quick and it was super buttery.  With a good week or two of steeping though it comes together perfectly.  Super rich and thick with a nice level of strawberry to keep it balanced.  Great dessert vape."},{"user":"adio","score":"5","text":""},{"user":"Haggis","score":"none","text":"Very good "},{"user":"heatbbx","score":"5","text":"Beyond Excellent, A+"},{"user":"HerrHut","score":"5","text":"Hits the profile.

It really gives the impression of an actual strawberry shortcake bar, the cake base is accomplished very well and it very satisfying.
