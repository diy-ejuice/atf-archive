At the time I made it, I only had TPA sweet strawberry. Overnight steep, it was tasty but after 3 days the strawberry popped out! Very authentic to the profile and smells delicious! Iâ€™m almost out of the 75 ml I made 7 days ago. Going to make more today!"},{"user":"YippYo","text":"My favorite Strawberry recipe by FAR! You simply must try this. Everything about it is so well balanced and accurate to the profile."},{"user":"Brewdog_Kilo","text":"Delicious!!"},{"user":"kindground","text":"This is very close in taste to its profile. Super accurate. I enjoy this but I have issues with a lot of cake concentrates. Initially I did not like what this steeped into after about a week. I omitted the cake and the notes that made it muddy for me went away. I subbed in 3% DFS Angel Food Cake and it was Delicious!

No cake, no strawberry. I think I might be flavor deaf to TPA's strawberries.  I'd be curious to try this again but with a different combination of strawberries."},{"user":"BuryMeInSmoke","text":"First time I mixed this I wasn't a fan initially, got into it too quick and it was super buttery.  With a good week or two of steeping though it comes together perfectly.  Super rich and thick with a nice level of strawberry to keep it balanced.  Great dessert vape."},{"user":"adio","text":""},{"user":"Haggis","text":"Very good "},{"user":"heatbbx","text":"Beyond Excellent, A+"},{"user":"HerrHut","text":"Hits the profile.

It really gives the impression of an actual strawberry shortcake bar, the cake base is accomplished very well and it very satisfying. The strawberry is also done very well to give off a bright strawberry flavor.
