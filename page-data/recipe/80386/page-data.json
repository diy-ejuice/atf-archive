A time that is cherished by many.\r\n\r\nQuintessential flavors to the season are peppermint and nutmeg, but you don't often see them paired together. In my venture exploring this combination, it is pleasant, satisfying, and a little odd! \r\n\r\nThe star of the show here is LB White Chocolate Peppermint -- this flavor is just wonderful and so easy to work with. It's a delicious smooth and creamy white chocolate with a very subtle and sweet peppermint. While the peppermint is nice it wasn't quite as forward as I wanted it to be, hence the addition of FLV Peppermint. It's a very strong, forward, thin peppermint, and is quite cool; 2 drops per 30mL is plenty.\r\n\r\nWhen you think nutmeg, you think eggnog (well, at least I do!). FLV Eggnog captures the essence of nutmeg very well while giving it a nice creamy base so it's not too dry. This is almost good enough by itself, but the addition of FLV Peppermint cuts through a lot of the creamy body you'd get from FLV Eggnog, so a little extra eggy boost from CAP Vanilla Custard for unctuous warmth does wonders here. \r\n\r\nTFA Graham Cracker clear is here for a little bit of dark sweetness and to play off some of the vanilla notes already in there, as well as giving the recipe some texture to keep your palate entertained.
