Mixed some up, tasted like the bomb diggity(Also, I had almost all the flavors, which almost never happens), and figured I'd throw it up here for you fine ladies and gents.\r\n\r\nThe blog post didn't give any sort of steeping time.

Maybe i oversteeped by waiting 3 weeks before trying it or maybe because i didnt have any saline. But i neither get a truely PB flavor from it but not really a cereal flavor either. All i get is a creamy bakery vibe which would not be idifyable in any way if i wouldnt know what im vaping. Its not a bad taste but also nothing i would see me mixing this recipe again."},{"user":"dmt","score":"none","text":"A tasty recipe indeed. I personally prefer to swap out the PB from TPA for the one from CAP; it just seems to facilitate more of a PB cereal kind of vibe imho. I find TPA PB to be a bit dry in comparison. A half percent of CAP SS isn't a bad idea either (I have a revolting sweet tooth).  :-)"}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"17452","name":"Charlie Noble's PB Cereal"}}}
