Finally i've made one i'm happy with.\r\nIt's not to sweet, it's soft and fluffy, exactly what i was aiming for.\r\n\r\nThe mix of FAs Red Touch and TPAs Strawberry Ripe is more on the authentic side for me which i prefer, but still sweet enough.\r\nMarzipan is nice for a sweet taste after the Strawberries, which does linger a bit and adds an extra layer.\r\nWhipped Cream is used as a cream base, with the Meringue and Sweet Cream making it more milky, soft and improving the otherwise boring texture.\r\nLemon Sicily just adds a nice fresh extra layer to the mix.\r\nIf you like it, please leave a rating.\r\n\r\nUpdate: Added 2% TFA Graham Cracker Clear and 0.25% FA Rose to blend everything a little bit better and to add something special to it which fits well.\r\nUpdate 2 (now finished): -3% Red Touch -1% Strawberry Ripe. Added 4% CAP Strawberry Taffy.
