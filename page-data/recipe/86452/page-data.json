Too much Vanilla bean which is strong on it's own and I thought it would overpower the honeydew. But it doesn't. It's a really smooth and creamy vape. I cut the vanilla to 5% and super sweet to 0.5% due to personal preference. But it's a beautiful recipe. I would recommend giving it a whirl and steeping it for 7 days to let the VBIC settle.
