Much sucess has come when ive add banana, soursop, and mango to this pudding.   Add your favorite fruit.  Ive been sitting on this one for a while and it wasnt until recently that some1 mentioned how accurate of a pudding that base is on it own. Flv van pudding does a wonderful job here and Imo is a great flavor to lay down for other stuff to sit on. Ive tried hard to take it down lower just because i use this concentrate often (especially in golden oreo pudding) \r\nhttps://alltheflavors.com/recipes/37647#golden_oreo_pudding_by_deejay_mills \r\nThis is not a coconut pudding. You can not use flv sweet coconut. Flv coconut is a great thickening agent used in low amounts.\r\nPudding is thick no? The custard beefs up that flv van pudding.\r\n\r\nFor it to stand out as a straight vanilla pudding i needed to up the vanilla. Shisa vanilla is no secret that vanilla creaminess it can add to a mix. Holy vanilla while good just kinda messed with my delicate pudding. \r\n\r\nIve tried this recipe with a few diff bav creams cuz before flv van pudding came into my life bav crean was the only thing that came close to pudding for me. Tpa bav cream was my 2nd favorite version and fw bav cream was my least favorite. Which was surprising since that tends to be my favorite of the bunch (fw). If you dont have jf bav cream just mix it with TFAs, if details in a flavor matter to you mix it with jf bav cream :) \r\nPuddings are kinda like my thing irl, im always on my fat kid shit.\r\nSwiss miss creamy vanilla is my favorite kinda pudding. Second to my my mother's rice pudding <3\r\nhttps://alltheflavors.com/recipes/20165#not_my_mama_s_rice_puddin_by_deejay_mills","steep_days":"5","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"total_reviews":2,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:49:07.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"4413","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Vanilla Pudding","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":3500},{"name":"Coconut","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":150},{"name":"Custard","vendor":"INW","millipercent":500},{"name":"Shisha Vanilla","vendor":"INW","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Bavarian Cream","vendor":"JF","millipercent":1000}],"reviews":[{"user":"CygnusY1","score":"5","text":"This is an incredibly tasty mix, a delicate yet creamy vanilla pudding  taste.
