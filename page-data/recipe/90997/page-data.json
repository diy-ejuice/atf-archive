Aside from that, it doesn't really want to play anything more than a supporting role going below. Strawberry Jam with Toast will assist here perfectly.  \r\n\r\nEnjoy,\r\nScrewdriver","steep_days":"3","temperature":"0","recipe_score":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-11T14:08:02.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"1179","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Angel Cake SC","flavor_id":"9014","vendor":"WF","millipercent":3500},{"name":"Biscuit","flavor_id":"642","vendor":"INW","millipercent":250},{"name":"Strawberry Jam with Toast","flavor_id":"9143","vendor":"RF","millipercent":500},{"name":"Red Touch (strawberry)","flavor_id":"421","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Coconut","flavor_id":"640","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":100}],"reviews":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"90997","name":"Screwed Angel Cake"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
