The base of this mix are the Lemonade(LA) and Sixx mixx wild strawberry tea. The tea has a green tea base that is just lovely not overly earthy or musky - just a nice solid green tea with backnotes of strawberry and papaya . LA leomonade with a little bit of the lemon Sicily just taste like sweet true lemonade Also I did not want the lemon to be a bully in this mix but to sort of blend in with the other fruits and tea . \r\n\r\nEm was added to  add a slight note of natural sweetness and soften some of the edges\r\n\r\nPink guava to me is a flavor that can change based on the other fruits / flavors in the mix. In this case it seems to bring out sweet strawberry and papaya which is exactly what I wanted \r\n\r\nDragonfruit was added as an emulsifier and for some more of the \"red fruit flavor\" notes \r\n\r\nGolden syrup for that sweet dark honey type of note \r\n\r\nartic mint for a bit of minty coolness for a summer time beverage \r\n\r\nis a solid shake and vape but hits its sweet spot at 3 - 5 days\r\nLOOKING for a group to learn about  mixing your own juice check out these groups and your tube channels  \r\nhttps://www.facebook.com/groups/diydownunder/\r\nhttps://www.diydownunder.com/ \r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/user/frank1360\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0xkeZFSG04","steep_days":"5","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"total_reviews":1,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:50:08.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"1908","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Ethyl Maltol","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":300},{"name":"Lemonade","vendor":"LA","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Lemon Sicily","vendor":"FA","millipercent":750},{"name":"Arctic Mint","vendor":"PUR","millipercent":300},{"name":"Dragonfruit","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Pink Guava","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Wild Strawberry Tea","vendor":"SM","millipercent":6000},{"name":"Golden Syrup","vendor":"VT","millipercent":2000}],"reviews":[{"user":"LaJuanaPipa","score":"5","text":"Seems pretty solid and well planned.
