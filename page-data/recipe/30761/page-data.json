So Since I started doing DIY I decided to make my own Blackberry Yogurt. \r\n\r\nMy idea with this was to make a nice Yogurt base, FLV Greek for the Greek Yogurt part, FA Yogurt to mellow it out a little and add some sweet creaminess and FLV Cream for even more sweetness and creaminess.\r\n\r\nThen add in my Blackberry, I went with Cap Black Raspberry after trying out a few others and not getting the taste I was looking for. \r\n\r\nThis Is my first recipe, I mean I like it, but you'll have to make up your own mind.","steep_days":"7","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-05T16:42:43.000-05:00","best_vg":"85%","views":"1441","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Greek Yogurt","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Yogurt","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Cream","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Blackberry","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":3000}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"30761","name":"Baphomet's Midnight Snack (Blackberry Yogurt)"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
