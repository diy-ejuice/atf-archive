Like it’s all soft, slightly syrupy sweet base flavors that play well together, without something on top to really hook me in to wanting to vape more of it. It’s like an excellent part of a recipe that’s not quite finished. An easy route to something that tastes more complete would probably be something like adding just a little FA Cucumber, with that bit of green rind for more of a vegetal bite, or going the more melonious route and adding some FLV Wild Melon or something like that. And then there’s the possibility of going the more creative route, more creative than I am, and going for something completely different and contrasting against this complementary mix. "},{"user":"Wendy","text":"I have a hard time tasting many flavors (strawberry and anything mixed with bakery ingredients) so I have yet to find a great ADV. I really enjoy this one and it could be one of my first ADV. I added a touch of menthol and love it. Thank you for this recipe! "},{"user":"cdaniell30","text":"I had to sub in TFA honeydew, and then I forgot how hard that shit is to get out of a tank and put it in my OBS engine instead of an RDA.  Despite the grief it's going to cause me when I finish this mix, I have to admit it's very light and sweet, and will definitely get another mix when the weather gets warmer."}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"54599","name":"Cucumber Melon"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
