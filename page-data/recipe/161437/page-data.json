My loooonnnnngggg search for one of the most unattainable profiles in DYI has finally been realized - a true coffee with no skunky, rubbery, burnt or chemical vibes....\r\nVT Arabica coffee is a phenomenal coffee flavor and accurately expresses all that is the magnificence of coffee = balanced aroma, lively acidity and full body. Period.\r\n\r\nThe ultra creamy coffee milk froth is a thing of beauty and then some... The best way to describe it is when you use your spoon or finger (my favorite utensil ) to scoop the last delectable milk froth remains from the side of your cappuccino cup and after you dispensed of your (overpriced) cappuccino. The rich, naturally sweet textured milk has just a touch of espresso and it is so good that you are tempted to order another just to lick the froth from the cup! \r\n\r\nSweetened with a touch of caramel toffee, this is my favorite coffee combo to date. \r\n\r\nThis baby needs 7 days or so for the coffee to extract to perfection.\r\n\r\n","steep_days":"7","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"updated_at":"2020-12-12T08:14:22.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"2401","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Coffee Milk Froth","flavor_id":"8858","vendor":"VT","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Arabica Coffee","flavor_id":"8822","vendor":"VT","millipercent":750},{"name":"Caramel Toffee","flavor_id":"2121","vendor":"HS","millipercent":1500}],"reviews":[{"user":"goosegirl","text":"I mixed this up a year ago, and rediscovered it today.
