Adapted from the Dinner Lady Tart remix by dacolez. His recipe is awesome, most prefer it over the original ! This one is an attempt to get closer to the clone. Chances are they didn't use as many flavors as dacole did in his recipe.\r\n\r\n Shake and vape. Used apple pie for crust flavor and cap lemon pie for bakery flavor.","steep_days":"3 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"total_reviews":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T09:27:02.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"3631","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Apple Pie","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Lemon Meringue Pie","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Lemon Meringue Pie","vendor":"FW","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Lemon Sicily","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Custard Pi 3.14","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Acetyl Pyrazine 5%","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":400},{"name":"Meringue","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Bavarian Cream","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1000}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"104522","name":"A Dinner Lady - Lemon Tart Clone"}}}
