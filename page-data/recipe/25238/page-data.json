You know, Homer Simpson's favorite treat.\r\n\r\nThe Donut:\r\nCapella's Glazed Doughnut provides the foundation of this classic donut with a sweet doughy flavor. Jungle Flavors Yellow Cake adds the density that changes it from a light and fluffy glazed donut into a dense cake like donut. Flavor Art JOY brings it all together by adding that fried dough flavor with a little extra sweetness.\r\n\r\nThe Frosting:\r\nA mix of Capella's Sweet Strawberry and Butter Cream plus Flavor Apprentice's Sweet Cream blend together perfectly to make that almost candy like frosting.\r\n\r\nAll that's missing is a nice hot cup of coffee to dunk in.","steep_days":"21","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T23:35:15.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"2208","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Butter Cream","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Glazed Doughnut","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":4500},{"name":"Joy","vendor":"FA","millipercent":750},{"name":"Sweet Strawberry","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Yellow Cake","vendor":"JF","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Sweet Cream","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":500}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"25238","name":"Strawberry Frosted Donut"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
