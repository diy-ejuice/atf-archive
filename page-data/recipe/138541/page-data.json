If you are a fruity & creamy fanboy - give this a smasheroo.\r\n\r\nI have a variation of this recipe out as a oneshot, it uses a re-labled Mango called CBE Double Mango. I have been searching long and hard for a Mango that is of the same caliber as CBE so that I can share this recipe with the world, and not only South Africa. \r\n\r\nFE Mango is our saving grace here, trust me I have tried so many mango concentrates in my time in vaping (Thanks RudeRudi for finding this, and recommending it). Banana Cream TFA brings the body, and mid notes, and provides an amazing blend. These fruits belong together. \r\n\r\nSweeten & Cool as per your preference, I made use of 20% WS23 Dilution - and added 1% SS to the original recipe, and it really works. \r\n\r\nThe original recipe has 8% CBE Double Mango in place of the FE Mango @ 4%\r\nhttp://e-liquid-recipes.com/recipe/2448418/BaMangoMi","steep_days":"3 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"updated_at":"2020-12-12T10:34:38.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"3417","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Mango","flavor_id":"1659","vendor":"FE","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Banana Cream","flavor_id":"210","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":3500},{"name":"WS-23","flavor_id":"8085","vendor":"OTHR","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Super Sweet","flavor_id":"2384","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1000}],"reviews":[{"user":"Johnny2Vapes","text":"I love Mangos, I like cool vapes, and I like light banana flavors... This hits all of that and knocks it outta the park for me. This has to be one of my favorite warm summertime vapes that I can mix and keep mixing up. I also love how super simple it is.","score":5},{"user":"wadeyloops","text":"What an awesome combo, the banana blends so well with the mango, nice thick mouthfeel and a pleasure to vape . A bit musky on the top note if you don't use coolant but easily masked if needed. Yeh this is a banger for sure and it is very generous of you to share your recipe. I added 2 drops of VT sour lemon to my 10ml mix and 2 drops of FA meringue and used FW sweetener at 0.4% for a slight variation I enjoyed.","score":5},{"user":"TamVapes","text":"Am I just horrible at remembering stuff or what?  I mixed this on 2/10/2019.  It is now, 5/13/2019, 3 months later.  You said 3 days, not 3 months; oh well, better late than never right?  I remember on the initial shake, I liked it.  I am absolutely in love with the fact that after 3 months the FE Mango is still showing up in the recipe, and has proven not be a mango that will fade.  This is a fantastic vape, the banana cream definitively provides the body, but without adding any runty banana.  The star is FE Mango!!  Absolutely fantastic for summer or a pod device.  I just put this in my new Z Biip aio mtl pod and the flavor is coming through great.  Thank you for sharing.
