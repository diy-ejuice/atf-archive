The butteriness and light vanilla note of the custard compliments it perfectly - Add some **FA Cookie** in there, to get that baked *crunch note* and you're golden.\r\n\r\nI can't stress enough - This **needs** to steep. It will have an off-putting *sourness* at first. After 8 days that starts going away, and takes on this sort of \"caramel\" note. I guess it's the FA Cookie that brings that \"darkish\" brown sugar note to the mix. At the 12 day mark, more of the custard sweetness has come through, and the pecan note is more prominent.\r\n\r\nYou can easily give this 20-30 days - but to me it needs a minimum of 12 days, to get rid of that *sour/bitter* flavor.\r\n\r\nEnjoy!\r\n\r\n---\r\nI use 70/30 - VG/PG at 3mg\r\n\r\n / Please feel free to leave feedback\r\n\r\n","steep_days":"12","temperature":"0","recipe_score":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-10T16:01:46.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"2857","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Butter Pecan Pie","flavor_id":"6044","vendor":"WF","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Vanilla Custard 2","flavor_id":"10427","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Cookie","flavor_id":"490","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000}],"reviews":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"188803","name":"1-2-3 Pelican Custard "}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
