It ended up becoming a Strawberry Cookie cream. One of my favorites right now.\r\n\r\nEdit: Feel free to sub Sugar Cookie v2 with Sugar Cookie v1. I didnt have it on hand when I created this recipe. Got my hands on v1 a week ago and it tastes pretty much the same as v2 (in this recipe at least). Maybe a liitle bit more creamy and buttery - but hey, that's a good thing!","steep_days":"0","temperature":"0","recipe_score":4.8,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:48:50.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"8562","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Bavarian Cream","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Cookie","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Strawberry (ripe)","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Strawberry","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Sugar Cookie V2","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Vanilla Bean Ice Cream","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":3500}],"reviews":[{"user":"Kronk","text":""},{"user":"VaperKitten","text":"Five Stars, YUM, Delicious, Mixed it last night, put it in my Joyetech Cubis ( I know, Old School but it is all I had open), the flavor is exactly what it says it is Strawberry Cookie and it is Amazing. I added CAP Vanilla Bean Ice Cream instead of TPA (all I had) and Instead of TPA Bavarian Cream I used FW, but recipe is Dead on...I also added 1.5% Sweetner because I am dieting and I NEED the sweetness. Thanks so much to the creater, I will mix this over and over.  (Copied what I wrote in the Discussion section)&#xD;\n"},{"user":"HerrHut","text":"Mixed it with SC v1.  Didn't like the cookie in the first few days.  Now after 5 days, the cookie blends in with the strawberry and cream.  Very tasty!"},{"user":"Effjh","text":"Great recipe, well balanced and tasty. In my experience it is far better using SC v1 over v2 in this recipe. It needs at least a week steep for it to hit that OMG level, once it's there you won't be able to put it down."},{"user":"OpenSauce","text":"First recipe of someone elses I've mixed in about 6 months. Good as a SNV, probably better with a steep as I find the FA Cookie giving me a bit of a bread note (personally though, I don't vape a ton of cookie flavours so I may adjust), i'll maybe try dropping that down to 1% if I make it again. All round though, pretty tasty."},{"user":"TheDrStore","text":"This is a fantastic recipe. I steeped it for a month and it's perfect.  So good to see a local guy releasing bangers like this!"},{"user":"mlNikon","text":"I am really digging this mix. I used v1 instead and it is super good. The strawberry melds with the cookie perfectly. I might have to make this in a bigger bottle, it is so flavorful"},{"user":"usr_local","text":"This is one of the best strawberry vapes I have tried. It is in my rotation and an ADV! The cookie in the background is perfect and the strawberry just blends all together with everything so nice. This is a well balanced mix."},{"user":"odrama","text":""}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"16304","name":"Blushing Milkmaid"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
