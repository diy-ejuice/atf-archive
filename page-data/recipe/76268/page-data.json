I vapes that stuff for a month straight.  Finally I came up with this.  At first you get butterscotch but just for a second then it’s a beautiful creamy hazelnut, So good.  The FA hazel grove backs up fw hazelnut because I personally have problems tasting it after vaping it for a week lol.   I used TFA vbic because it’s decadence.  I’m lucky and don’t get the pepper.  If you do get pepper sub liquid barn for it.  The Butterscotch I believe has been the missing ingredient.  It kind of sauces things up here.  Sweetener I think needs to be there because I’m trying to mimic the hazelnut cream that goes in your coffee and well that stuff is loaded with sugar.  I’m trying to get better about only releasing the absolute best I have got ADHD so when I taste something good I release it and that’s not always good because after a steep it changes.  This has been sitting for a week mixed it up on ELR and brought it over here because it’s that good","steep_days":"5","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"updated_at":"2020-12-12T15:39:36.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"4345","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Butterscotch Ripple","flavor_id":"1217","vendor":"FW","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Hazel Grove (hazelnut)","flavor_id":"417","vendor":"FA","millipercent":750},{"name":"Hazelnut","flavor_id":"1312","vendor":"FW","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Vanilla Bean Ice Cream","flavor_id":"186","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Sweetener","flavor_id":"339","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Vienna Cream","flavor_id":"516","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1500}],"reviews":[{"user":"Skywxp3d","text":"From the picture I figured it would taste like the creamer you find at the gas station, heck no - it’s far more realistic and less “fake” tasting as the creamer - excellent vape thanks!!
