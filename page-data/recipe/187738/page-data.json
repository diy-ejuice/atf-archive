In any event, at some point, just as a side note, he said ... \"I mixed these two ingredients together and have been vaping it all week\".....\r\nSo I tried it. It seems to me like such a strange combination, like pistachios and tangerine, . . . It is amazing in flavor. If you like Strawberries, if you like Toffee, ... try this, ... then watch Noted's \"Ice Cream episode and send their guest a thank you, ...lol.   wow, this is good. I went out and got four ounces of each ingredient, due to arrive today while I am at work.  \r\nP.S.  The aweetener is my own addition. As always, sweetener is at your discretion, he did not mention sweetener.","steep_days":"3 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"total_reviews":1,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:51:26.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"429","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Toffee Ice Cream","vendor":"VT","millipercent":8000},{"name":"Shisha Strawberry","vendor":"INW","millipercent":5000},{"name":"Super Sweet","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":350}],"reviews":[{"user":"TheJuiceJackBuilt","score":"5","text":"I like both toffee and strawberries.
