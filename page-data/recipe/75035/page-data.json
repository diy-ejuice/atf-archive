Its a three ingredient masterpiece so when Wayne from diy or die said it was going to be remix month again I thought it would be a perfect time to release my tweak/remix on butter almond custard. I call it Butter Nut Custard  the only change I made from the original recipe is I removed the Flavor Art almond and added wonder flavours hazelnuts and cream at 2.5% . I think its a great twist on a great recipe if you haven't mixed up the original butter almond custard by Krucial make sure you do its amazing!!! This recipe like the original is magical after a 2 week steep  but I would say its pretty close to perfect after a 10 day steep but like most custards it just keeps getting better and better. When I make custard recipes I know I am going to like I make 240 ml's so I can start vaping  it around 7 days and have enough to still have some after 30 days when its absolutely magical!! Just a great 3 ingredient  recipe/remix  of a great 3 ingredient  recipe.","steep_days":"10","temperature":"420","recipe_score":5,"updated_at":"2020-12-12T15:39:35.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"3107","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Vanilla Custard","flavor_id":"131","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Butterscotch Ripple","flavor_id":"1217","vendor":"FW","millipercent":3500},{"name":"Hazelnuts & Cream","flavor_id":"6056","vendor":"WF","millipercent":2500}],"reviews":[{"user":"Ebc88","text":"For only using 3 ingredients and getting this much flavor and to top it off a well balanced recipe that taste as described .
