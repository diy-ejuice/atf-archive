Could never quite get it to work, trying lots of different combos. With the new INW Milk Chocolate hype and the Chocolate Milkshake recipe I decided to give it another whack.

(and if I knew how to link it here I would...) \r\n\r\nMy test was 30/70 and steeped for 5 days was the best.\r\n\r\nFlipped to done.
