Each puff of this liquid will cause you to impulsively utter the words of forever. Unlike your real life wife, You'll never grow tired of this succulent dessert.\r\n\r\nUpon receiving Wonder Flavours, I noticed the bulk of the concentrates were bakery based. No complaints here, It's no secret I love bakeries! Needless to say it didn't take long for me to conclude I really wanted to create a cake. Not just any cake, THE cake. In my humble opinion, the balance of these flavors provide that fulfilling satisfaction of a delicious wedding cake baked with love.\r\n\r\n**Recommended for**: High Wattage Drippers.\r\n\r\n**What I vaped it on during development**:\r\nDually RDA\r\n80 Watts\r\nRambo's Wire Art Coil:\r\n3mm .16\r\n28g Stainless Steel Frames, .3 Ribbon 3ply 316L Nichrome80 Fraliens\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n**WF Buttercream Frosting**\r\nAdds a nice rich icing to the cake.\r\n\r\n**WF Fluffy White Cake / WF Angel Cake / FLV Cupcake Batter**\r\nThese three ingredients make up the role of cake for this recipe.\r\n\r\n**FLV Sweet Coconut** \r\nProvides a smooth sweet milky coconut to the profile.\r\n\r\nVideo for notes: https://goo.gl/JroN6X\r\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n**Substitutes**\r\n\r\nWhile it wont taste the exact  same, I've tested it and it's similiar with these substitutes: \r\n\r\nWF Angel Cake -> FW Yellow Cake @ 0.5%\r\nFLV Sweet Coconut -> TFA Coconut Extra  @ same %\r\nFLV Cupcake Batter -> CAP Cake Batter @ same %\r\nCAP Super Sweet -> TFA Sweetener @ 0.5%\r\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n**Steeping recommendations**\r\nI would recommend letting this formulation sit for at least **3** days to allow the notes to properly meld together and the inherent alcohol to dissipate.\r\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nFollow for more creations:\r\nhttp://www.youtube.com/c/SteamCraft","steep_days":"3 (SNV)","temperature":"420","recipe_score":5,"total_reviews":4,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:49:56.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"4284","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Buttercream Frosting SC","vendor":"WF","millipercent":500},{"name":"Fluffy White Cake SC","vendor":"WF","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Angel Cake SC","vendor":"WF","millipercent":750},{"name":"Super Sweet","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":250},{"name":"Sweet Coconut","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":750},{"name":"Cupcake batter","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1250}],"reviews":[{"user":"Zugmaschine","score":"5","text":"I love this cakey cake! Iam a MTL-Vaper, so i increase the flavours by 25%. Thought first it is to much, but it turns out very well. After 5 days all flavours are comming well together. Absolut a wedding cake.&#xD;\nI vaped the first 30ml in my Dvarw at 18 Watts and it was emty after 4 days. Thanks for this good recipe SteamOn!"},{"user":"JustinLFranks","score":"5","text":"What a great cake from a relatively simple recipe! I made the suggested substitution of CAP Cake Batter for FLV Cupcake Batter. I also do not have FLV Sweet Coconut, but get pretty intense waxy and \"soapy\" off notes from the suggested substitution of TPA Coconut Extra, especially when used as high as 0.75% (it's a rather strong flavoring). So I used 1.25% of TPA Coconut Candy instead. I also have CAP Coconut and FA Coconut at my disposal, and will try those as well in the place of FLV Sweet Coconut.&#xD;\n&#xD;\nThe cake flavoring in this recipe is phenomenal, but I found it a bit too light on the frosting for me. So I replaced the 0.25% CAP Super Sweet with 0.5% TPA Whipped Cream. It's a light and airy cream which also adds a fair bit of sweetness, which is why I omitted the CAP Super Sweet instead of just adding the TPA Whipped Cream to the recipe.&#xD;\n&#xD;\nI realize that the changes I've made make it a good deal different than the original recipe, but am still giving this 5 stars, since it was a very simple matter to make the adjustments to match my own preferences.&#xD;\n&#xD;\nI was also surprised at how \"potent\" this recipe is, even with such a low amount of total flavoring (5% for the original, and 5.5% for my modified version). Part of this is because I vape at a fairly high wattage (100 - 120 watts), but I still tend to use a lot more flavoring in my own recipes (usually 8-10%)."},{"user":"ambzizbanannerz","score":"5","text":"Delicious! ♥️ Ty!"},{"user":"BlackMambaVapes","score":"5","text":""}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"87857","name":"Ceremonial Cakes | Coconut Cake"}}}
