Grapple was the recipe I submitted for round one  of diy or dies round one of the world mixing championship. All I changed in this remix is the apple used. In the original I used 3% Fuji apple by flavor art and in this version I used sour apple by flavorah which makes it a sour grapple lol. This is totally vapable after a shake but I find it best after an overnight steep it calms down quite a bit and has enough time to blend perfectly in about 12 hours. Enjoy this sour grapple!!!!\r\n","steep_days":"1 (SNV)","temperature":"420","recipe_score":4.5,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:49:36.000-05:00","best_vg":"75%","views":"3529","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Grape","vendor":"INW","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Cactus","vendor":"INW","millipercent":350},{"name":"Sour Apple","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1500}],"reviews":[{"user":"Ebc88","text":"Super simple and super tasty. Excellent usage of cactus really juices the overall vape. "},{"user":"Grorco","text":"I mixed this up last night and flooded my RDA with it, took a hit and was discussed by the cactus. I thought about changing my cotton, but was too lazy and took another hit, and then another and another.. every hit I fell a little more in love with the way that cactus that seemed overbearing at first, blended into the grape pairing perfectly for a splendid sour grapple delight! I couldn't believe how smooth this became, it was almost like drinking a sour grape pop without the fizz, thanks for the great recipe!"}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"65240","name":"Sour Grapple!!"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
