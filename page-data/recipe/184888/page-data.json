I really wanted to push my self this time, and the was to make something delicious with flv Brie cheese.\r\n\r\nI searched the internet for desserts with Brie cheese, and I fell over this video with a lady making a puff pastry baked Brie with pear that‚Äôs looked very tasty.\r\n\r\nSo I went with it. \r\n\r\nBRIE CHEESE: so I wanted the Brie to be notable but still vapable, and 0.7% may seem high for most people and it is a pretty scary flavoring, but it also got something to it that really isn‚Äôt that scary when paired with the right ingredients. At 0.7% it‚Äôs there. You can definitely taste it. It brings a touch of that musk that it has, but also I nice velvety mouthfeel.\r\n\r\nWF CROISSANT, ACETYL PYRAZINE: This is my puff pastry. Croissant is the perfect base for this part , and backed up with some AP for some texture.\r\n\r\nPEAR, APPLE  FILLING: This is the pear filling that lays on top of the Brie cheese just before you wrap it I puff pastry. The pear is a perfect ripe pear, and the apple filling adds some cinnamon spice, adds a cooked feel to the pear and provides some texture to the pear üçê.\r\n\r\nVANILLA PUDDING, VANILLA BEAN: the pudding i used to add a slight creamy feel, and the vanilla bean to enhance the vanilla flavor in the vanilla pudding. Adding vanilla, tricks our mind to think, that what we are vaping something sweeter than it really is, and are making the Brie cheese taste, become a dessert type flavor that we can enjoy.\r\n\r\nSWEETNESS: Where absolutely necessary to make it enjoyable. Cause even though the vanilla is there, the vanilla also needs some actual sugar to make this work. \r\n\r\nThat‚Äôs it. Give this baby a 5 day steep, and lean back and enjoy a PUFF PASTRY BAKED BRIE AND PEAR ","steep_days":"5","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"total_reviews":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T14:14:25.000-05:00","best_vg":"60%","views":"833","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Apple Filling","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":500},{"name":"Sweetness","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":750},{"name":"Brie Cheese","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":700},{"name":"Croissant SC","vendor":"WF","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Pear","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1750},{"name":"Vanilla Pudding","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":750},{"name":"Vanilla Bean","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":500},{"name":"Acetyl Pyrazine 5%","vendor":"OTHR","millipercent":250}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"184888","name":"Puff Pastry Baked Brie & Pear"}}}
