The shortbread is a little doughy (cookie doughy) and slightly undercooked, jf biscuit does bring in more crisp biscuit notes however the custard dials the grainy mouthfeel down slightly.\r\nThat being said, this doesnt taste like crap at all, its rich and butter heavy, carries a great mouthfeel boosted by the custard with nice cookie dough like biscuit qualities. The cranberry is on point and boosted by flv's jammy berry, ive not added sweetener as the berry jam is already sweet enough to cut through and stand out from the buttery biscuit and custard layers.\r\nDeffo worth a try ðŸ‘ŒðŸ‘Œ\r\n\r\nEdit:\r\nWf crumble topping instead of jf biscuit works well too ðŸ˜‹","steep_days":"14","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:51:48.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"490","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Jammy Berry","flavor_id":"10150","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":500},{"name":"Cranberry","flavor_id":"41","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Biscuit","flavor_id":"8737","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Biscuit","flavor_id":"4487","vendor":"JF","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Custard","flavor_id":"4210","vendor":"INW","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Powdered Sugar","flavor_id":"6522","vendor":"OOO","millipercent":1000}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"208830","name":"Early Decorations"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
