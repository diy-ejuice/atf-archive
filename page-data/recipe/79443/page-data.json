I dropped the pistachio and the holy vanilla and added the most amazing flavor Flv Vanilla Bean. This is amazing. It has become my all day work vape, which means 8 to 10 hours a day vaping only one setup. I thank Kriswk and Flavorah because very little effort on my behalf went into this amazing recipe.","steep_days":"3 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"total_reviews":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T22:32:34.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"1772","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Almond","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1250},{"name":"Hazelnut","vendor":"FW","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Ry4 Double","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Sugar Cookie","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Vanilla Bean","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":500},{"name":"Vanilla Bean Ice Cream","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1250}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"79443","name":"Ry4 Special"}}}
