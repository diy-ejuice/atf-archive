A bright, clean, dragon-berry milk, kind of like a Creamsaver that doesn't exist but definitely should. Inspired by God Milk by @SkiddlzNinja and my own Mother of Dragons' Milk recipes, but better than either of those after a one-week steep.

Well done and Epic job ID10-T, This is another BANGER!!!","score":5},{"user":"Ebc88","text":"This fades quit a bit over time vaped about 30 mls after a 10 or so day steep. Vaped the remainer today after a month, and all the lovely strawberry I was getting as toned down, but overall it is still good. This is also an older recipe and i am sure if you redid it there would be things you would do definitely today. The creaminess IMO is on point its simple and gets the job done. The dragonfruit is also used very well it shines through and plays well the strawberry. If that TPA strawberry didn’t fade and develop a strange “green” like note as it steeped this would be the perfect SB &amp; cream","score":4},{"user":"koldfusion","text":"Lots of stems and plastic taste for \"Strawberry Mutes/Non Tasters\" after a month, yet still strangely yummy. The feeling (not the taste) is like licking the smelly marker at school and kind of getting off on the taste so you keep going back for more.  The TPA Bavarian Cream really softens up after a month.&#xD;\nIt's one of the only recipes I can taste strawberry in. But only the first pull or so.  Great to keep on standby so I can enjoy the stuff.  My bottle has been sitting for over a month and the smoothness of the cream is stellar.

This has worked beautifully for me!","score":5},{"user":"nabs1990","text":"","score":5},{"user":"Jthectic","text":"Great stuff, can taste the strawberry very well with the dragonfruit mixed in. Definitely a bright s&amp;c that has a good cream base to it. ","score":5},{"user":"coop34","text":"This def IS better than the 2 which inspired this mash-up. Great work!","score":5},{"user":"Omarf181","text":"","score":5},{"user":"rklimek76","text":"Within 1 day of steeping, this has easily became my favorite Dragonfruit based recipe. The strawberries used add complexity to the dragonfruit, while the vanilla swirl and the bav cream do something I can't even begin to explain, imparting a thick, delicious creaminess that is wonderfully balanced with the fruit  elements.","score":5},{"user":"EdibleMalfunction","text":"&#xD;\nThe Warrior reached up, and with arm outstretched, sliced off the Dragon's glistening jewels. The serpent let out an ear-splitting roar, and in humility took to the skies and soared away. &#xD;\n&#xD;\n\"These will fetch quite the gold in the town market,\" the Warrior thought, back at camp. But then another thought came to him. \"But what do they taste like?\"&#xD;\n&#xD;\nSetting them upon the roasting fire, the Warrior began twitching in anticipation. The moment would soon arrive when he would find out.&#xD;\n&#xD;\nPlucking the round, toasted fleshy orbs from the flames, he plunged them into his waiting mouth. Biting down sends warm,  fresh, milky cream flowing down the sides of his chin. \"Interesting,\" The Warrior mused. \"These taste faintly like Strawberry, but only of its ripeness. There's something else. Like the essence of the serpent is imbued upon my prickling tastebuds!\"&#xD;\n&#xD;\nPleased, the Warrior set off on yet another adventure, this time with a quest in mind. \"I must have all of the Dragons' delectable dangly-bits,\" he smirked. \"Every last pair of them...\"","score":5},{"user":"Bogey_Again","text":"Finally!  A dragonfruit vape that I like. At first it was a little harsh however after 10+ days it's magical.","score":5},{"user":"HerrHut","text":"Delicious as Shake'n'Vape.
