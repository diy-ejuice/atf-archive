A good sangria should be sweet, fruity, boozy, and chilled. You can adjust the sweetener level to your own tastes, or sub CAP SS with FLV Sweetness if you are are looking to make it without sucralose (use around 0.25% to 0.4% of FLV Sweetness as a replacement.)  Caramel is there to add a slightly richer note, you could also use a brown sugar in this spot as well, but I liked the caramel taste. \r\n\r\nIf you'd like to participate in the Year of Mixing find the Flavor-Pro group and join us for our weekly challenge - all mixers welcome - and there will be some prizes.
