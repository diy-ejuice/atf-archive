Mixed with no subs this is a solid key lime cheesecake. Your cheesecake combo works perfectly. The graham cracker makes a really great crust, and the pink guava and lime pair really well together gives you really great key lime style citrus. With out the harshness that alot citrus flavors have. Also it survives a steep mine steeped for close to 2.5 months. Excellent job man and thanks for sharing ","score":5}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"127679","name":"Aerith in Vegas"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
