This is my take on Vapetasia's Killer Kustard.\r\n\r\nThe body: The TPA Vanilla Custard and CAP Vanilla Custard v2 are the dominant flavors here with a little added TPA Vanilla Swirl to really maximize Vanilla. The TFA Bavarian Cream was added to simulate the dense creamy mouth feel of a true Custard.\r\n\r\nSupporting flavors: The combination of CAP New York Cheese Cake v2, CAP Vanilla Cupcake v2  and TFA Sweetener add a layer that resembles a cake batter in taste and texture. It is noticeable on the inhale but much more present on the exhale.\r\n\r\nSteep time: This mix doesn't really come to life until at least 1 week. The Vanilla will be quite strong until then. The depth of flavor and mouth feel need a full months steep to really develop and it continues to improve for a few more months.
