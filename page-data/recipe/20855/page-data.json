This is the other one.\r\n\r\nThis was the love child of getting tired to unbearable throat hit from fruit vapes. I decided to combine the softest fruits I knew TPA - Strawberry (ripe), TPA Banana Cream and TPA Jackfruit. Golden Pineapple came in later, because it's not harsh at these percentages and fits like a glove in here, and vanilla Custard was the last nail to the flavor coffin. I fiddled around with the ratios (and you can too), but these percentages make the most pleasing balance to me.\r\n\r\nPineapple can go up to 3% before accumulating annoying throat hit.\r\nJackfruit is perfect at 2%\r\nBanana Cream works at 2-3%\r\nStrawberry (ripe) at 4-5.5%\r\nVanilla custard to taste, but over 1.5% imparts a custard taste and can make the vape too thick and sweet. Under 0.5% and you'll just be better without.\r\n\r\nThis is a familiar flavor profile to many, nothing new. Strawberry, banana and something tropical. It's sweet, smooth and delicious. The Jackfruit makes this the amazing vape it is. These are all the notes you need:\r\n\r\nTPA Jackfruit - The best tropical flavor I've tried, and the star of this recipe\r\nTPA Banana Cream - Delicious and creamy\r\nTPA Strawberry (ripe) - Sweet and soft\r\nCAP Golden Pineapple - Fruity top note\r\nCAP Vanilla Custard V1 - Perfect thickening agent","steep_days":"2 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":4.8,"total_reviews":5,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:48:54.000-05:00","best_vg":"75%","views":"4587","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Strawberry (ripe)","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":5000},{"name":"Banana Cream","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Jackfruit","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Golden Pineapple","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Vanilla Custard","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1500}],"reviews":[{"user":"Spycke","score":"5","text":"Ready to make anther batch! Great recipe!"},{"user":"ObiWanCannoli","score":"5","text":"I can appreciate this recipe. Objectively, its a nicely balanced recipe, flavorful and pretty smooth, just not really for me. I think the VC is throwing this off a bit for me. &#xD;\nUpdate: After letting my half finished 30ml sit for 20 days this recipe has gone from 4 to 5 stars. The VC definitely needed time to mellow out. The earthiness is all but gone now and the fruits have blended beautifully to create a wonderfully smooth and creamy fruit experience. Definitely a great recipe after a minimum 2 week steep."},{"user":"cdaniell30","score":"4","text":"Sweet but earthy with the jackfruit and banana cream.  This is really really good.  I love how *just enough* of the banana cream hangs around at the finish."},{"user":"hashslingingslashur","score":"5","text":"Nice stuff. Great use of jackfruit. This is even yummy without the vanilla custard. &#xD;\n&#xD;\n"},{"user":"RuntDastardly","score":"5","text":"I cannot tell you how much I love this! It's such a satisfyingly juicy, sweet, fruity mouthful of sunshiny goodness. If happiness came in vape form, this would be it. I can see why this one calls you back. I'm just finishing the last few drops, and I'll definitely be making more. Thanks for sharing this!"}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"20855","name":"Addict"}}}
