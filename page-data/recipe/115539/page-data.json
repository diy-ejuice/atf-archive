I can’t say that I personally like it -  but that’s only because it reminds me of Tequila Rose and that brings back some bad memories. But if you can imagine a Whiskey Rose - Tequila Rose with whiskey instead of tequila - this is it. You get booze right up front, not an excessive amount, but like you would get drinking straight Irish cream. Then the strawberry comes and tastes a lot like Nestle Quik strawberry. There’s a rich cream with a bit more of that whiskey taste, tangled up with hints of chocolate and dark caramelly sweetness like Bailey’s Irish Cream. Putting personal baggage aside, I have to say that this is a very successful recipe and if it a strawberry and cream flavored Irish cream sounds good to you, you should try it. The 0.5% Super Sweet is also a bit much for me, it gets a little Splenda-y at the very finish, but it doesn’t seem essential to the flavor, it seems like it could easily be cut out or maybe even eliminated depending on personal preference.
