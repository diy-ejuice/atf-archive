Since its summer and NYC is way too hot right now, I knew I had to make my version into the frozen kind of cream puff. The angel cake and sugar cookie are acting as the pastry portion while the vanilla whipped cream, vanilla pudding, and cream fresh are the frozen creamy center. Using WS-23 at 0.25% is high enough its present but low enough this isn't too cold. Since the vanilla whipped cream and cream fresh are lighter creams, I used vanilla pudding to add some depth/thickness and to build on the vanilla in the whipped cream. Give it at least a week to steep and since this was designed for a higher watt device, if you use anything below 60w I recommend increasing the overall flavor percentage to your liking.","steep_days":"14","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:50:23.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"1228","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Angel Cake SC","vendor":"WF","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Vanilla Whipped Cream","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Vanilla Pudding","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1250},{"name":"Cream Fresh","vendor":"FA","millipercent":750},{"name":"Sugar Cookie","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1500},{"name":"WS-23","vendor":"OTHR","millipercent":250}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"114624","name":"ExclusiveGirl's Profiterole #MixinVixens"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
