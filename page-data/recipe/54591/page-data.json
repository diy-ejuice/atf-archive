I really just played off the dark berry notes that I got from single flavor testing. Same goes with the Caramel and Vanilla Custard I added to give it some creaminess and make it a little more dessert like. \r\nOverall it is a sweet and bold pipe tobacco with a kick of blackberry.

I don't generally like tfa blackberry.  I also can't really figure out what the burley is doing for this mix well enough to make words.  What I do know is, I get a strong blackberry note from this recipe, and it's totally not unpleasant or what i normally expect from tfa blackberry.  You'd never know it from the above, but I really like this recipe, and I think it's a solid mix even though I can't seem to work out how everything comes together to make this happen.  I get this with Mophead's recipes more often than with others, it's like he's some sort of evil genius."},{"user":"DeadHer0ine","text":"Absolutely delicious. I'm not usually a tobacco fan, but I was searching for other uses for TPA blackberry and stumbled across this one. It was interesting enough to justify the purchase of Aged Burley, and has now become a staple in my personal rotation. The tart, sweet, and dark all play together here perfectly - a wonderfully balanced recipe."}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"54591","name":"Black Jack"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
