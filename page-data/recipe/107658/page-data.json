It could stand to be lowered down to .25%. Up to you.\r\n\r\nI added 3 drops of CAP Supersweet to a 30ml mix and it wasn't all that great. If you decide to add any consider adding 1-2 drops or just leave it as-is without CAP SS. It should be sweet enough on it's own without it.","steep_days":"1 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"total_reviews":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-06T20:44:05.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"1104","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Fuji","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Cantaloupe","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":500},{"name":"Honeydew","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Cotton Candy","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":750},{"name":"Lemon Sicily","vendor":"FA","millipercent":250},{"name":"Rainbow Candy","vendor":"FW","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Strawberry (ripe)","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Strawberry","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1500}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"107658","name":"Cantadew"}}}
