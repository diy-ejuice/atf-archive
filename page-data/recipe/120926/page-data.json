I tried very hard to keep the number of ingredients to a minimum. Perhaps I need a more diverse stash? \r\n\r\nFruit: I wanted a sweet, sticky cooked apple component without it being too bright; I used apple fuji and apple pie together with a touch of pear and dragonfruit to mellow it down. \r\n\r\nPastry: I decided that the notes I wanted for the sweet pastry/crumble could be achieved with sugar cookie and Graham cracker. I used Graham cheesecake to add a sweetness to it, and the wafer in the lucky shot creates a bridge to the next layer.\r\n\r\nCaramel sauce: the caramel in the lucky shot is rounded out by english toffee and dulce de leche. I was thinking of a thick, sweet caramel sauce or even custard to this part, which is helped by the Devon cream and custard premium. \r\n\r\nVanilla ice cream: I wanted to get a feeling of a melting scoop of ice cream sat on top of the pie. TPA VBIC does the job very nicely together with the Devon cream and custard. The marshmallow rounds it all out with a rich sweetness. \r\n\r\nI am sure that plenty of subs could be made for just as successful a recipe. I would be interested to hear about them. \r\n\r\nGive it a mix, steep for at least a week (I would suggest 3 actually) and let me know what you think!
