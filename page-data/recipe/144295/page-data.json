Tart and sour along with fizzy sherbet gives that fizzy feel and vanilla whipped cream is there to smooth it all over and add a touch of mouthfeel so it doesnâ€™t get too linear after a few pulls.\r\n\r\nIf you like what I do and this recipe then please rate and review :)","steep_days":"1 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-10T16:01:17.000-05:00","best_vg":"60%","views":"1544","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Frog Gummy SC","flavor_id":"10124","vendor":"WF","millipercent":6000},{"name":"Sweet Tangerine","flavor_id":"123","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":500},{"name":"Super Sweet","flavor_id":"2384","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":500},{"name":"Tart and Sour","flavor_id":"2520","vendor":"LA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Vanilla Whipped Cream","flavor_id":"1","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":500},{"name":"Fizzy Sherbet","flavor_id":"8878","vendor":"VT","millipercent":1500}],"reviews":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"144295","name":"Fizzy peaches"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
