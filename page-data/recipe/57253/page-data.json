Similar to the Archway apple oatmeal cookies you can buy. \r\n\r\nThe FLV blueberry/boysenberry combination makes for a great blueberry jam with some much needed berry \"darkness\". \r\n\r\nThe JF cookie/CAP sugar cookie combo provides that cookie base without taking it too much in that buttery direction. \r\n\r\nTFA toasted marshmallow and oatmeal cookie at these percentages provide the oatmeal/molasses notes. Much higher with the oatmeal cookie and it starts to get funky. It doesn't have a tremendous amount of oatmeal going on in it anyhow.","steep_days":"4 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"total_reviews":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T20:32:09.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"2024","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Blueberry","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Boysenberry","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":500},{"name":"Cookie","vendor":"JF","millipercent":750},{"name":"Oatmeal Cookie","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Sugar Cookie","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Toasted Marshmallow","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":750}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"57253","name":"Violoats Beauregard (Blueberry Oatmeal Cookie)"}}}
