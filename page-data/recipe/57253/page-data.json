Similar to the Archway apple oatmeal cookies you can buy. \r\n\r\nThe FLV blueberry/boysenberry combination makes for a great blueberry jam with some much needed berry \"darkness\". \r\n\r\nThe JF cookie/CAP sugar cookie combo provides that cookie base without taking it too much in that buttery direction. \r\n\r\nTFA toasted marshmallow and oatmeal cookie at these percentages provide the oatmeal/molasses notes. Much higher with the oatmeal cookie and it starts to get funky. It doesn't have a tremendous amount of oatmeal going on in it anyhow.","steep_days":"4 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-10T17:56:50.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"2029","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Blueberry","flavor_id":"620","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Boysenberry","flavor_id":"614","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":500},{"name":"Cookie","flavor_id":"4572","vendor":"JF","millipercent":750},{"name":"Oatmeal Cookie","flavor_id":"178","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Sugar Cookie","flavor_id":"115","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Toasted Marshmallow","flavor_id":"340","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":750}],"reviews":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"57253","name":"Violoats Beauregard (Blueberry Oatmeal Cookie)"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
