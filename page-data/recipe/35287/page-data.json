The actually blueberry is very mild while the Tahitian Vanilla is the star of this dessert. The crumble part has a very macaroon-like quality to it. You can definitely get the coconut flakes within this cookie crumble. \r\n\r\n The blueberry will stay prominent in the first week. Then creams take over and push the bb to the back. I used TFA Cheesecake (graham crust)  to add a bit of texture to the macaroon and a some weight to the overall mix.\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n ","steep_days":"10","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:49:10.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"3754","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Tahitian Vanilla Cream","flavor_id":"6065","vendor":"WF","millipercent":3500},{"name":"Macaroon","flavor_id":"3517","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":500},{"name":"Blueberry","flavor_id":"620","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":500},{"name":"Blueberry","flavor_id":"1201","vendor":"FW","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Vanilla Swirl","flavor_id":"189","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Cheesecake (graham Crust)","flavor_id":"152","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1000}],"reviews":[{"user":"NastyNate","text":"Great recipe! Tahitian Vanilla cream works pefectly here."},{"user":"NonStopMix","text":"Going through all your recipes, I decided that I wanted to give this one a mix. I was missing FLV blueberry so I made sure to purchase it with my last order. &#xD;\n&#xD;\nOn to the recipe. At first shake, the blueberry was bright and this was coming from the FLV blueberry. After letting it sit for a good week and a half, this recipe is really good. It's creamy and the vanilla note is really nice. The blueberry has pushed it's way to the back and the crumble has come thru with a light coconut note. It's a nice pleasant vape that is very satisfying, not overly sweet, and doesn't kill my tastebuds after vaping it all day. You did a really good job on this recipe! Great use of the flavors you chose and balanced perfectly. Also, thank you for the review you posted on my recipe!"},{"user":"Gachatay","text":"I actually forgot I had this mixed, I knew it needed a bit so I put it in the back of my drawer. This is based on an 18 day steep. &#xD;\nThe Tahitian vanilla is a darker vanilla (by taste not color) and WF did an excellent job with this flavoring. You get the robust dark notes that I haven't found in any other vanilla creams and it works so well here. The blueberry combo here was interesting, you get that blueberry glave from FW with a brighter note from FLV that makes a pretty damn good blueberry for creams and I can see this doing well in bakeries too. It's sitting nicely in here and isn't your average top note blueberry. I'm getting some nice texture from the crumble base with a slight touch of coconut just to keep things interesting. I really love what you did here, I have another 30ml steeping, my tester never stood a chance. Best believe I'll be playing with this blueberry layer tonight to see how it goes in my cake base. As always, great job bud!! Look forward to the next one"},{"user":"Thadentman","text":"This recipe is extremely well layered. Flv blueberry is my favorite blueberry but can never get it to work. Iâ€™ll be vaping this for a while, great job!"}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"35287","name":"Vanilla Blueberry Crumble"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
