I went as far as even having my percentages as 3%,2%, and 1% lol. I love inawera creme brulee I literally go through a 30ml \r\nbottle every month. This creme brulee can be as simple or as complex as you want it. You can leave it as is and have a great creamy vanilla creme brulee. Or you can add whatever top note you want to this cr√®me brulee. Add a fruit of choice or some caramel or butterscotch and it will work. If you want a crust add it. It's up to you were you want to take this but at the end of the day its delicious the way it is. Just a fun simple cr√®me brulee recipe/base!! I almost forgot the steep time for this custard recipe isn't crazy long its very enjoyable on day 3 but I think its at its best after a 6 day steep.. If you don't have inawera shisha vanilla just about any vanilla will work obviously you may need to adjust the usage percentage to what ever works with the vanilla you substitute. If you don't have inawera custard you could sub it  or replace it with Capella vanilla custard or tfa  at the same percentage. Obviously it's not the same recipe with substitutes but this is diy and substitutes happen. If you don't  have inawera Creme Brulee well you just need to get some. There are no suitable substitutes for inawera  Creme Brulee!!  Enjoy!! I\r\n\r\nSweetener: use it don't use it that's your choice me I used .25% Flavorah sweetness. I don't list sweetener because it's not a necessary evil. This recipe is good with it or without it and or with what ever your favorite sweetener is because almost every flavor house has one. Enjoy!!!!)\r\n\r\nJust a great creamy Creme Brulee. Oh and did I say EASY TO MIX!!!! #easypeasyniceandsleazy","steep_days":"6","temperature":"420","recipe_score":4.8,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:50:06.000-05:00","best_vg":"75%","views":"15858","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Custard","flavor_id":"4210","vendor":"INW","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Creme Brulee (yc)","flavor_id":"894","vendor":"INW","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Shisha Vanilla","flavor_id":"841","vendor":"INW","millipercent":1000}],"reviews":[{"user":"Zugmaschine","text":"Simple Recipe - complex taste! After 3 days steeping really, really good mix. Next Batch get a longer steep :-)&#xD;\nWill make also a batch with TPA VC V2 same %! But with the TPA VC V2, i have to lower the Shisha Vanilla to half  or leaf it out maybe, because TPA VC V2 has a lot own Vanilla, and to much of it could \"interfere with those lovely caramelized sugar crust top notes of the Creme Br√ºlle\" how ID10-T has noted."},{"user":"bjorama","text":"Something about INW Creme Brulee that is offputtin to me..  Maybe its both the Custard and Creme brulee ingredients because I love Shisha Vanilla. I made a big bottle based on all the fabulous reviews, but even after a 5 month steep and can't get it into..  I'm sure it's quite good, just not meant for me.  However, If you have any ideas on some possible additional ingredients, I'm open to try it.  I got about 50mls of it mixed."},{"user":"Ebc88","text":"Easily one of the more flavorful 3-2-1 recipes I have mixed. Everytime blends nicely together. Best of all doesn‚Äôt need a long steep. Glad I decided to mix a 60ml instead of a 30ml. "},{"user":"MrBurgundy","text":"Not only is this a tasty treat, it‚Äôs also a great base recipe to build off off. It‚Äôs rich, creamy, and has some serious depth to it for being three flavors. The toasty caramel and vanilla really liven up the custard. I love the simplicity here; it satisfies me on many levels. Good work, Tootall!"},{"user":"ID10-T","text":"For a simple recipe with just three ingredients and 6% total flavor, this thing is awesome. It‚Äôs rich and satisfying and really demonstrates what both Creme Brulee and Custard by INW are and what they do. I wonder whether a darker vanilla might work even better than Shisha V here because it is a little on the bright side, but without trying it out I have no way of knowing. A vanilla that rides too high might interfere with those lovely caramelized sugar crust top notes. It might get a little boring as an ADV but if you switch flavors frequently enough it isn‚Äôt, and it tastes like it would welcome all kinds of additional ingredients that might make it more interesting: In other words, it tastes like the perfect base for a creme brulee recipe to accent however you please. Mix it up as written first and then see what ideas it gives you. I‚Äôm thinking almond would excellent. I‚Äôve looked at culinary recipes for almond, almond-vanilla bean, orange-almond, and amaretto creme brulees and they all look like ‚ÄúI want to vape that.‚Äù Could be as simple as adding 1.5 to 2% FA Almond to this. Or 1% INW Marzipan for that amaretto-type creme brulee and keeping with the all-INW theme here. Anyway, beautiful simple recipe just the way it is. Thanks, TooTall!
