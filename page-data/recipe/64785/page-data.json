Some recipes include butter; which is always a welcomed addition in the recipe, but not required. This is a traditional Filipino sweet and sticky rice cake that was often eaten during the holidays or during parties when I was small.\r\n\r\nFor this recipe, I wanted to capture this rich, delicious, and very much loved dessert my mother would make for us.\r\n\r\nIt is very tasty right away but 1 week steep would be optimal.\r\n\r\n♥️ I hope you enjoy it ♥️\r\n_______________________________________________________\r\n★Q & A \r\n\r\n• Question: Is this very sweet?\r\n• Answer: Yes. On a sweetness scale: 1 (not sweet) - 5 (very sweet). I would rank it a 4.5.\r\n\r\nNote*\r\nIf you do not prefer added sweeteners like Super Sweet - feel free to substitute with Meringue. Or feel free to leave the sweetener out. It is nice & sweet on its own. \r\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - \r\n• Question: Can I mix at a higher VG ratio?\r\n• Answer: Sure thing. 70/30, 80/20, whichever you prefer. However I would increase the steeping time. Approx. 1.5 - 2 weeks.\r\n\r\n______________________________________________________\r\nPhoto Credit: Maria K","steep_days":"7","temperature":"55","recipe_score":5,"updated_at":"2020-12-12T11:51:14.000-05:00","best_vg":"65%","views":"2362","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Brown Sugar","flavor_id":"313","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":250},{"name":"Coconut","flavor_id":"640","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":150},{"name":"Coconut","flavor_id":"650","vendor":"INW","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Condensed Milk – Super Concentrate","flavor_id":"7873","vendor":"RF","millipercent":250},{"name":"Cream Fresh","flavor_id":"540","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Sweet Cream","flavor_id":"117","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Sweet Rice","flavor_id":"7727","vendor":"FE","millipercent":5250},{"name":"Toasted Marshmallow","flavor_id":"340","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1250},{"name":"Vanilla Whipped Cream","flavor_id":"1","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Super Sweet","flavor_id":"7787","vendor":"PUR","millipercent":250}],"reviews":[{"user":"Ebc88","text":"Mixed at 70/30 steeped for a little over 2 weeks.
