I wanted to make a simple version that suited my own taste buds and hopefully yours too. \r\n\r\n5% VT Lemonade Clear: a light lemon forward/ lime soda. The lime notes get too piney any higher than 5%. However, this needs help to get it where I want it:\r\n\r\n2% VT Sour Lemon and 1.25% FE Lemon boost lemon notes and add tartness and volume.\r\n\r\n1.5 % VT Fizzy Sherbet adds \"effervescence\" and light lemon/lime. When used over 1.5%, I find its lime notes get way too bitter and intrusive. \r\n\r\n0.25% Super Sweet rounds out sweetness.\r\n\r\nWS-30 for cooling effect and to enhance fizz effect.\r\n\r\nNeeds at least 1 day minimum steep.  Don't make big batches as this mix will lose vibrancy after 1 week, although still vapeable.\r\n\r\nOptional:\r\n\r\n0.30% VT Ginger Root for a hint of fresh ginger.","steep_days":"1","temperature":"0","recipe_score":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-11T14:05:26.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"717","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Lemonade Clear","flavor_id":"8916","vendor":"VT","millipercent":5000},{"name":"Fizzy Sherbet","flavor_id":"8878","vendor":"VT","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Lemon","flavor_id":"1655","vendor":"FE","millipercent":1250},{"name":"Sour Lemon","flavor_id":"8971","vendor":"VT","millipercent":2000},{"name":"WS-23","flavor_id":"8085","vendor":"OTHR","millipercent":250},{"name":"Super Sweet","flavor_id":"2384","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":250}],"reviews":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"185522","name":"Lemon Lime Spritzer"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
