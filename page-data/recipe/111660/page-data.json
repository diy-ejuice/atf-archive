Trader Joe used to carry dried orange cranberries that were amazing and I would cook with them every chance that I got.  The PUR-Cranberry Orange just kind of warms up the mix and adds a nice depth.   I liked the pecan flavor in the PUR-Butter Pecan Praline Ice Cream so I used it to add some creaminess to my filling as well as the nuttiness.  FLV-Maple just works really well with these flavors as does the FA-Liquid Amber to help round out the recipe.  You could sub the CAP-Double Apple for Pur-Country Apple if needed.   The Cap-Super Sweet is optional but it does add a nice hint of sweetness to the mix.\r\n\r\nI let it settle for a few hours before taste testing it and it has not changed drastically with steeping.  I did cut down the original amount of FA-Zeppola because it got a little greasier than I wanted.  I may still tweak it a bit when I have time but overall I am happy with how it turned out.  \r\n\r\n","steep_days":"1 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"total_reviews":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T21:32:39.000-05:00","best_vg":"50%","views":"967","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Butter Pecan Praline Ice Cream","vendor":"PUR","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Cinnamon Danish Swirl","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Cranberry Orange","vendor":"PUR","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Double Apple","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Liquid Amber","vendor":"FA","millipercent":200},{"name":"Maple Bar","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":500},{"name":"Zeppola","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Super Sweet","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":350}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"111660","name":"Autumn Turnover #Mixin Vixens"}}}
