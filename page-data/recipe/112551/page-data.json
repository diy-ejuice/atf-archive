That little extra touch of dragonfruit emulsifies and provides a nice little zing to the flavor combo. I chose to use RF Strawberry for it's innate candy vibe alongside INW's, But you could easily swap it out for a strawberry you have on hand. Just keep fading probabilities and the other ratios in mind. FLV Greek Yogurt alongside LA's Bubble gum provides a decent mouthfeel. That extra 5% VG plays to sweeten and thicken the mix to an enjoyable dripper level experience. I like it at 75/25. Try it out and let me know what you think.\r\n\r\n**PS** Forgive me for the sloppy notes, Usually my syntax and notes are much cleaner and in depth, But I'm really short on time today. (Running story of my life)\r\n\r\nMucho amor mi agigos/amigas!
