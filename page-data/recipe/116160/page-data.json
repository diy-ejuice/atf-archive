It’s just absolutely dripping with juiciness, maybe the juiciest juice I’ve EVER tried. That WS-23 and mint from the Cucumber Mint complement each other so well. The iciness doesn’t drown out the flavor. 2% TFA Honeydew is about my limit for that stuff and it can be a bully, but it’s not pushing out the cucumber, which is surprising. It actually seems to be amplifying it vs. Cucumber Mint as a single flavor. All of these flavors work together beautifully. The only thing I can really say by way of criticism is that I’m not convinced 0.1% TFA Peppermint is actually doing anything at all here. It’s not a very strong flavor - 3 or 4% is not an unheard of amount for something like a peppermint ice cream. However, I haven’t tried it without it so I can’t say for sure that it isn’t doing anything. "}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"116160","name":"Cucumis"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
