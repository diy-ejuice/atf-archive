If you are a fan of mango and looking for a great summertime recipe then give this beauty a mix.\r\n\r\nI wanted to try something a bit different from my usual recipes and my new bottle of FLV Black Tea was sitting on the shelf looking lonely so I thought why not?                               \r\n                                                                      Id10-t tackled this profile quite a while ago with a simple and pretty tasty mango iced tea recipe, however, I felt it a bit too linear and a touch harsh on the throat. Not to mention FA Black Tea, although not horrible, leaves a lot to be desired.\r\n\r\nI decided I wanted the mango part to be more along the lines of a nectar/puree, so I used a combo that I have really been digging lately, FLV Mango at 1% and SC Mango at 2% is low enough to let the other flavors shine through, yet provides a nice full mango nectar. If you don't have SC Mango yet, do yourself a favor and buy it! It is an amazing flavor and my current favorite. Its only downfall is that its susceptible to a bit of fading after a few days so it is best as a SnV. FLV Mango is there to bolster the SC and contribute some of its brighter citrusy top notes.\r\n\r\nFLV Black Tea provides a nice sweet and mildly complex tea base and has become one of my new favorite flavors. 1.5% provides a good level of tea flavor to the recipe. Bump up to 2%  if you would like the tea to be a bit more apparent.\r\n\r\nCAP Hibiscus is another great flavor and it pairs very nicely with the mango, adding a nice twist to this recipe. 1.5% brings the flavor up enough to compliment the mango and black tea while providing a nice syrupy sweetness to the profile.\r\n\r\nTFA Strawberry at 1% is mainly here to ensure this recipe is as smooth as silk. Also, strawberry is a wonderful pairing choice for mango and even at a fairly low  1% compliments the mango and hibiscus wonderfully.\r\n\r\nI add 1.5-2% WS-23 30% but if that is too much please feel free to take it down to your preferred level.\r\n\r\nI have really been digging Ricks Sugar Daddy sweetener since I started using it. In fact, I don't use anything else anymore because this stuff is amazing! It's about the same potency as TFA Sweetener so I don't believe 1% is absurd by any means but feel free to sub your preferred sweetener or remove it completely as the recipe is fairly sweet on its own.\r\n\r\nI enjoy this recipe right off the shake but if you let it sit for a day or two, the tea and hibiscus will pop out a bit more as the mango fades slightly.\r\n\r\nI really hope that some of you are able to mix this up â˜º It's a perfect vape for summertime cocktails on the patio or just lounging in the sun.","steep_days":"1 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-06T20:44:04.000-05:00","best_vg":"80%","views":"2060","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Black tea","flavor_id":"9377","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Mango","flavor_id":"3516","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Mango","flavor_id":"3617","vendor":"SC","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Hibiscus","flavor_id":"72","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Sugar Daddy (TBV Rick)","flavor_id":"9207","vendor":"OTHR","millipercent":1000},{"name":"WS-23","flavor_id":"8085","vendor":"OTHR","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Strawberry","flavor_id":"272","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1000}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"106776","name":"Iced Mango Hibiscus Tea"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
