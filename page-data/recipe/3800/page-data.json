A beautifully baked and gooey apple with the perfect amount of cinnamon and a flaky, doughy crust. This isn't a $1 apple pie from the D's or the grocery store. This is an expensive pie made fresh at a local bakery or perhaps even your grandmothers house. I let it steep for two weeks and it's golden. I'm sure it only gets better with time."},{"user":"Burritoclock","score":"5","text":"A classic and still unbeatable."},{"user":"wh1skeyk1ng","score":"5","text":"Just made this.  11/10 for authenticity.  Amazing flavor as well.  Great as a shake and vape."},{"user":"Mixepic","score":"4","text":"BotBoy did a good job with this recipe. The cinnamon is pretty strong, I recommend 1-2 drops per 30ml of FLV Rich Cinnamon as I find it takes over the bakery or doughy notes a bit.
