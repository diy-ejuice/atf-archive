Either with a cup of coffee in the morning or with some dessert after dinner it's a fantastic vape.\r\n\r\nRF oatmeal cookie is the raw extract, not the VG concentrate\r\n\r\nNotes in the November 2016 recipe thread\r\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/5am6a3/november_2016_recipe_thread/d9st1dq/","steep_days":"20","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:48:53.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"3603","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Oatmeal Cookie","vendor":"RF","millipercent":1250},{"name":"Brown Sugar","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Carmel (caramel)","vendor":"FA","millipercent":750},{"name":"Sugar Cookie","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Biscuit","vendor":"JF","millipercent":750},{"name":"Peanut Butter","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":7000},{"name":"Red Burley","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Kentucky Blend","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Acetyl Pyrazine","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":250}],"reviews":[{"user":"Seakow","text":"A buddy of mine made a bottle of this for me. Currently vaping it now. You're right it's not like Foo's Gold, instead I get a delicious full flavored cigar with a creamy peanut butter exhale. TOP NOTCH! Well done Trevor.
