Well balanced cocktail that will make you smile :D\r\n\r\nFirst time use Honeydew SC from Real Flavours. Use 0.5-2.5%\r\nSolo test 2.5% 80/20, Great flavor here, It's a sweet, bright, and fresh flavor, no harshness, no throat hit, It's super smooth and pairs perfectly with other melon aromas. I tried it with cantaloupe, papaya, watermelon and cream. \r\n\r\nS/V let it sit 24 hours, better or perfect 4 days.\r\n\r\nShare and rate this if you like it.","steep_days":"3","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"total_reviews":1,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:49:18.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"1950","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Cream","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Guanabana","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Honeydew â€“ SC","vendor":"RF","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Jasmine Natural","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1250},{"name":"Sweet Coconut","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":500},{"name":"Vienna Cream","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1250}],"reviews":[{"user":"Turbito","score":"5","text":""}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"44830","name":"Honeydew Melon Drama "}}}
