And I guess it is this time. This is a Blueberry apricot vanilla muffin. The blueberry is the low note, while the apricot is the high note, and a touch of vanilla somewhere in between with a muffin finish. I was actually surprised with how much I liked this, but its still an early version.","steep_days":"5 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"updated_at":"2020-12-12T17:10:22.000-05:00","best_vg":"60%","views":"2523","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Armenia (apricot)","flavor_id":"507","vendor":"FA","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Biscuit","flavor_id":"4487","vendor":"JF","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Blueberry Muffin","flavor_id":"608","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":3700},{"name":"Toasted Marshmallow","flavor_id":"340","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1400},{"name":"Vanilla (bourbon)","flavor_id":"184","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":750},{"name":"Bavarian Cream","flavor_id":"145","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":3100}],"reviews":[{"user":"nks","text":"excellent fruit combination,good bakery","score":5},{"user":"LB","text":"Apricot and blueberry is a great combo in this recipe.  If I had to knock anything I would say that the \"muffin\" is slightly weak, but that's it.  I can taste muffin, but like all \"muffin\" vapes, it's lacking something still.. maybe just muffin texture... I don't know.  Anyway, great flavor.  Really balances well and holds up as I have a bottle that has been steeping for a month or more and it's still good.  Good work.","score":5}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"24793","name":"Blueberry Apricot Vanilla Muffin"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
