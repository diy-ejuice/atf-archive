This is great and really works better than I thought with the danish swirl that high but damn it works great. Thanks for a great mix Aaron."},{"user":"whthek","text":"Warmed up a few times,during steep, with cap off to evaporate alcohol from (LA)CCI          Fantastic stuff..Thanks! "},{"user":"bjorama","text":"I mixed this about 7 minutes ago and this is the most delicious, mouth watering, calorie free flavor I have ever had.  Best recipe off the shake period.!! I mixed this with Super Sweet at 1%, everything else as directed.  About 2 days ago I mixed up the Sadlad Cinnamon Toast Crunch and was impressed how much I enjoyed it..   But this recipe is in another league.  If this gets better with a steep it'll be a damn shame cuz I don't think it will ever get the chance to get past day 1.  Thanks for a perfect recipe, and I'm very picky.  10/10"},{"user":"koldfusion","text":"Tastes pretty good. I get a chlorine vibe from it at times. Made it 100% to spec. No subs.&#xD;\nI think there is some serious muting going on in here. Still tastes OK. Slays your coils. "},{"user":"MrZigglesworth","text":"This is a spot on cinnamon roll with cream cheese icing and it was definitely worth the wait. If you're not leary about sucralose or FW Yellow Cake, give this a mix."},{"user":"Benoz","text":"really nice didnt get much of a steep as i vaped it all :) i learned that sugar cookie, cream cheese icing and some sweetener make a yummy topping and will be steeling this combo for future use thank aron and well done  "},{"user":"Cumulonimbus","text":"I have been working on a recipe very similar to this, was getting ready to share, but no need to now since youâ€™ve conveyed what I was going to. Well done! :) "}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"110756","name":"Cinnabong "}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
