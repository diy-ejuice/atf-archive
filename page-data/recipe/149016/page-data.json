This is a fun recipe and using the last 2 releases of the flavors from Frank and his team of guru's.\r\nStrawberry Baked is such an original flavor profile.. It's as if they were literally pulled right from the oven and put into the mix where as the Cobbler ( Berry ) really enhances the strawberry as a fully baked component. Strawberry Candy give's the high's of a strawberry with the sweetness the mix needed.. Cream Filling with the Marshmallow round out the high edges and gives the mouth an overall full feeling.\r\n\r\n**Follow me on FaceBook - http://www.facebook.com/msabadossenior.. IG - mark_sr_diy ..
