I mixed it as written and was pleased.. On the second go round i added 1% boysenberry (VT) to see if i could get that blueberry note a little more up front. Ill comment further later on. Thanks for the good n simple banger!"},{"user":"MixerMatt543","score":"4","text":"Tasty mix! Will be meeting more of this! "},{"user":"robolto78","score":"4","text":"This is definitely reminiscent of a scone annd very tasty. Great job! My only critique would be that it feels dry, but scones are dry, right? That being said I mixed 2 more 30 mls. One of which I dropped the INW Biscuit down to 2.5 and added 2% CAP sugar cookie to see if that will alleviate the cotton feel I get from this. If you like scones people, try this recipe. Again, great job!"}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"140577","name":"Blueberry Scone"}}}
