The flavor in question is Moon Sugar by Mr. Good Vape, and it can be gotten at Liquid Barn's website.  This recipe calls for 8% Moon Sugar in addition to the other ingredients listed below.\r\n\r\nThis began as an attempt to recreate and enhance a flavor called Brewski that was made by someone at the local vape shop where I live, back in the glory days before the new laws and regulations prevented such vape shops from mixing their juices in-house.  It was a wonderfully decadent dessert flavor consisting of Banana, Graham Cracker, and Sugar Cookie.\r\n\r\nMy first draft of this recipe was fairly simple,  Banana and Moon Sugar, both used at the starting percentages recommended by Liquid Barn (7 and 15% respectively).  The Moon Sugar on its own contains the necessary notes of graham cracker and sugar cookie, while also adding a touch of butterscotch,  making it a prime choice for recreating and enhancing the Brewski flavor I loved so much.\r\n\r\nThe addition of Kings Custard was actually just a happy accident.  I had run out of Moon Sugar midway through a mix, and so I chose Kings Custard as a substitute to fill in the remaining space.  I found that it actually improved the flavor, especially after giving it some time to steep, so from then on I continued to use an approximately 50/50 mix of Moon Sugar and King's Custard.\r\n\r\nFor quite a long while I considered the flavor to be finished.  It was already a wonderful dessert flavor that was a favorite among me and my friends.  But over time I began to desire something more.  Delicious as this flavor was, it still felt somewhat bland,  and so began my most recent venture to further enhance it.\r\n\r\nAnd that's where the Gold Rum and the Bourbon Vanilla came in.  I found the Gold Rum to be an extremely strong flavor, and for quite a while I feared that it would simply be too overpowering and unsuitable for this mix, but after many attempts and a couple instances of deciding on a whim to try mixing old and new drafts of this juice, I believe I have finally perfected this recipe!  At this low concentration the rum adds a warm savoriness without being overpowering, and the bourbon vanilla helps to further highlight the sweetness and creaminess of the dessert flavors.  The result is a wonderfully savory custard flavor with just the right amount of sweetness and a faint alcohol bite.  Pure decadent bliss!","steep_days":"10","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"total_reviews":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T02:17:56.000-05:00","best_vg":"80%","views":"242","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Kings Custard","vendor":"DOD","millipercent":8000},{"name":"Banana","vendor":"LB","millipercent":7000},{"name":"Madagascar Bourbon Vanilla Flavor","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Gold Rum","vendor":"VT","millipercent":100}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"203096","name":"Vindy's Treasure Hoard"}}}
