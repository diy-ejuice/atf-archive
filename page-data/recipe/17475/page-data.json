I accused her of turning our kid into a hipster. This lays down a good base to make a more homemade version of that.\r\n\r\nPEAR- With this pear flavor i was trying to get some of that grittiness you get from dried fruits and pear was the only thing i could think of that could convey that.\r\n\r\n FUJI- This JF fuji is a great apple that really stands out and i wanted to get a little bit of sourness that you get at the beginning of a bite of these fruit strips, but keep it low enough to get more of the sweet apple flavor.\r\n\r\nCINNAMON-  The cinnamon at such a low percent leaves out the bakery aspect and just add a very light spice which is most noticeable on the exhale and aftertaste.\r\n\r\n STRAWBERRIES- I wanted the sweet and ripe to come together to really solidify the strawberry on the back end and support the earthier strawberry from the sweet roll. \r\n\r\nWith a week steep you get a little bit of that upfront sourness of the apple and pear, followed by the strawberry sweetness on the exhale with a touch of spice from the cinnamon, while the sweet roll carries through from beginning to end.
