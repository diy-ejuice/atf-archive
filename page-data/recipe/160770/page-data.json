Ginger and lemongrass are said to have many health benefits, feel free to read up on it and try it if you already haven't.\r\n\r\nFlavor notes:\r\n**FLV Eisai Tea** brings the green tea flavor, it's slightly fruity, earhty and dry which is a perfect base for this beverage.\r\n**FLV Ginger** is a relatively sweet ginger syrup, which is much needed here to get the balance right as some of the other flavors can be a bit dry.\r\n**FLV Lemon Grass** is slightly sharp but a spot on lemon grass flavor. The bitterness helps the tea get an even more authentic feeling and pairs beautifully with the ginger to give a very fresh and unique taste.\r\n**FLV Honey Bee** is known to have a floral note, but I think that gets completely buried here. It gives the tea a very very pleasant honey mothfeel and almost nectar type sweetness. Highly recommend this flavor if you need a honey for teas.\r\n\r\nThis can be shake and vaped, but a day or two will make it better.\r\n\r\nShout out to @nowar for all the support <3","steep_days":"1 (SNV)","temperature":"420","recipe_score":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-11T14:17:29.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"1272","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Eisai tea","flavor_id":"9378","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Ginger","flavor_id":"4415","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":700},{"name":"Honey Bee","flavor_id":"2149","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":200},{"name":"Lemon Grass","flavor_id":"2592","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":300}],"reviews":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"160770","name":"Medicine Brew"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
