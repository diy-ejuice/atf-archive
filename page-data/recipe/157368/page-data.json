It does seem to me that these Blackberry/Raspberry Lemonade vapes are somewhat the rage these days, so I might as well join in with my Razzleberry/Boysenberry Lemonade recipe. Not much to say here other than the berry notes come out in the initial exhale with the Lemon lingering on for a while. While not a complex profile it is a pretty smooth and refreshing vape on a hot Summer day. The addition of Polar Blast at around 1 drop / 15 ml is optional, but I like the effect it gives along with the WS-23. \r\n\r\nI usually vape this on a restricted air flow single coil RTA like a Kayfun V5 running 38 Watts into a Kanthal Clapton at around 0.5 Ohm. \r\n\r\nJust a note - FW Lemonade is usually called FW Natural Lemonade.","steep_days":"3 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-12T02:45:50.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"1116","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Lemonade","flavor_id":"1336","vendor":"FW","millipercent":4500},{"name":"Razzleberry","flavor_id":"1393","vendor":"FW","millipercent":3500},{"name":"Lemon","flavor_id":"1655","vendor":"FE","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Boysenberry","flavor_id":"614","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":500},{"name":"WS-23","flavor_id":"8085","vendor":"OTHR","millipercent":250},{"name":"Polar Blast","flavor_id":"5910","vendor":"FA","millipercent":150},{"name":"Sweetener","flavor_id":"1432","vendor":"FW","millipercent":500}],"reviews":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"157368","name":"Razzle My Azz"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
