It's provides for a well needed break from the usual flavors I vape. It's smooth and well blended and I really enjoy the peanut butter aspect. I did not have wonder waffle by INW, so I used their biscuit as a sub and it turned out very well. Thanks for sharing."}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"164675","name":"Elvis Eats"}}}
