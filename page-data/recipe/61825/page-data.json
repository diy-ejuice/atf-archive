It's tobacco, cocoa/chocolate, nuts, and vanilla. \r\n\r\nThe cocoa note here is coming from the FE MLB. It basically tastes like FE Real Cig with some dry, unsweetened cocoa. Kind of an ashy Tobacco as far as the FE tobaccos go. Not really DNB type of dirty, but it's decent. But this recipe is far from what I would consider \"ashy.\" Cocoa note is most prevalent. \r\n\r\nThe nutty comes from the Hazelnut and Tobacco Symphony. CAP Hazelnut has been the only one I've used since I started mixing. I used it in my first diy adv, and never really bothered shopping around for a different one. It's rich and has a nice, full mouth feel, so I still use it. If it's not the best, feel free to sub. Tobacco Symphony is a wonderful nutty tobacco. It's a rich peanut type of nut with a nice mellow tobacco. \r\n\r\nVanilla for Pipe is decent enough as far as vanilla goes. I'm not a huge fan of vanillas these days in general, and CAP Vanilla Custard in particular. But again, feel free to sub for your favorite vanilla at what you feel is an appropriate strength. \r\n\r\nI think the possibilities for an RY55 are just as endless as the possibilities for RY4, and it's always been a profile that I've been more interested in.
