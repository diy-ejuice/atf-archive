A bit of TPA Vanilla Swirl pumps up the chewiness and provides body. TPA Dragonfruit helps blend everything together into one smooth, chewy candy.

Thanks!","score":5},{"user":"Zany","text":"Hadn't really found a use for FLV Peach Gummy - It's a decent flavor on it's own, but kinda' boring - I have not tried the candy peach rings this recipe tries to mimick, but it is a damn tasty recipe! Smooth, and juicy peach candy - The small amount of Super Sweet really helps sell this as a candy.&#xD;\n&#xD;\nGood job!","score":4},{"user":"konvul","text":"Awesome stuff. Thanks.","score":5},{"user":"RockyHarlow","text":"No reviews on this classic? Unbelievable. Chewy peach rings, well balanced flavors. That 0.5% TPA Dragonfruit is absolutely necessary as well, it's such a perfect emulsifier to combine the Vanilla Swirl to the peaches. Without it the flavors stack as opposed to blend, still good though. Easy to mix, easier to love. Mr.B is an absolute wizard, you're only hurting yourself by not trying this. All hail the swirl.","score":5}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"68857","name":"The Ringer"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
