Using Cap vanilla custard FLV pudding  I build the moose/pudding type base. FA Cappuccino bring a sweet creamy coffee note and flv coffee adds a slight bitter coffee bean note. I used VTA Coffee milk froth to accent the cream note in the coffee part of the mix. Sugar cookie adds just a touch of a bakery note for the bottom layer of the pudding. I layered in just a little bit of Fa Chocolate glazed doughnut to add cocoa notes and the Cookie Crisp at the bottom in the moose/pudding mix & representing the few chocolate shavings on the top. Finally I added a touch of sour wizard to the mix because I like to add that sour note to chocolate in order to make it pop. The sour Wizard is optional but it lends for a good accent to  this mix and sour Wizard can be used at a higher % optionally to 0.50% and the sour note can be subbed with LA Tart and Sour if you don’t have FA sour Wizard. Tart and Sour has a different component as far as sour notes go but at this % it’s there as an enhancer rather than as a flavor note. \r\nI recommend 5 day steep but it’s pretty good with an overnight sit. \r\n","steep_days":"5","temperature":"0","recipe_score":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-12T14:06:48.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"1785","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Coffee","flavor_id":"635","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":300},{"name":"Coffee Milk Froth","flavor_id":"8858","vendor":"VT","millipercent":1250},{"name":"Italian Relax (cappuccino)","flavor_id":"505","vendor":"FA","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Chocolate Glazed Doughnut","flavor_id":"9952","vendor":"FA","millipercent":750},{"name":"Sugar Cookie","flavor_id":"115","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Vanilla Custard","flavor_id":"131","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Vanilla Pudding","flavor_id":"4433","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Sour Wizard","flavor_id":"4354","vendor":"FA","millipercent":100}],"reviews":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"123879","name":"Cocoa Cappuccino Mousse by eJuice Fairy"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
