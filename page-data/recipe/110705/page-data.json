Expanding on my Purple Haze recipe... i have gotten my vape mail in and my absinthe from TPA ... so the Delosi Black Licorice is out (LOL)... and i have changed my sweetener to FLV and decided to layer the FLV Sweet coconut w/FA Coco Coconut and layer the VT Light Rum w/ FA Jam Rhum ..hoping for a more authentic flavor and really make this Drink style vape a serious contender .... I hope everyone who tried the original recipe enjoys the upgrade and Please give feedback .... thanks \r\n\r\nSide Note : VT Recommends 4 to 5 days steep on the Russian Vodka ..however i think it will be ok as a S&V recipe.\r\nAlso if you choose to cool this recipe down I recommend ws23 and mix to taste.. I use 1 drop per 10 ml ","steep_days":"4 (SNV)","temperature":"60","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T14:13:19.000-05:00","best_vg":"60%","views":"1935","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Sweet and Sour Purple Drink","vendor":"WF","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Russian Vodka","vendor":"VT","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Light Rum","vendor":"VT","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Jamaica Special (jamaica Rhum)","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Golden Pineapple","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":700},{"name":"Sweet Coconut","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Absinthe","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Sweetness","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":250},{"name":"Coco' (coconut)","vendor":"FA","millipercent":400}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"110705","name":"Purple Haze v2"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
