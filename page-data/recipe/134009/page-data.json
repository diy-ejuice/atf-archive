The apple is not subtle, the cinnamon is not overwhelming, and the crumbly graham is on point :) Hope you enjoy it!\r\n\r\nApple Fuji FA + Pair of Pears INW make a nice melty apple, Two Apples INW is added as a fruity apple sweetener. Two Apples INW can work on many fruit mixes as a sweetener, if you keep below 0.5 the apple taste won't be overwhelming (give it a go in pineapple mixes!). The apple in this recipe is not \"baked\", but sweet and melty.\r\n\r\nCheesecake (GC) TPA + Biscuit Base VTA + Graham Cracker FW create a crumbly, slightly buttery graham cracker base. \r\n\r\nBavarian Cream TPA + Vanilla Bean Gelato TPA are added for mouthfeel, fluffiness, and to blend everything together.\r\n\r\nCinnamon Ceylon FA is a bakery cinnamon, not spicy at low percentages. Can be omitted if you don't want the cinnamon in here. I wouldn't replace it with a hot and spicy cinnamon in this mix.\r\n\r\nLet it steep a bit, the crackers used here need some time to develop the full flavor and mouthfeel.","steep_days":"7","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T09:44:58.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"2105","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Apple Fuji","flavor_id":"4886","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Bavarian Cream","flavor_id":"145","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Biscuit Base","flavor_id":"8828","vendor":"VT","millipercent":1200},{"name":"Cheesecake (graham Crust)","flavor_id":"152","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Cinnamon Ceylon","flavor_id":"497","vendor":"FA","millipercent":300},{"name":"Graham Cracker","flavor_id":"1297","vendor":"FW","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Pair of Pears","flavor_id":"9290","vendor":"INW","millipercent":500},{"name":"Two Apples","flavor_id":"671","vendor":"INW","millipercent":500},{"name":"Vanilla Bean Gelato","flavor_id":"185","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1000}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"134009","name":"Apple Graham Crumble"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
