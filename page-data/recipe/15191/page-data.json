I've mixed up a few vanilla custards and so far this one is number one.   About to mix some batches of other custards while I wait for the 2nd bottle of 120mls of ginger sauce to mature!","score":5},{"user":"phried","text":"Tastes exactly like the description, two vanillas with a strong custard base topped off with crushed graham crackers. Best after a long steep.I like simple eggy custards and adore complex ones - this is somewhere in the middle.","score":4},{"user":"Dalpho","text":"One of best custards I'll be mixing this for a long time again and again.","score":5},{"user":"6retro6","text":"Actually forgot my bottle of this in my drawer for 7 weeks, it's a really delicious and smooth vape now, wasn't that impressed when I tested it direct after mixing but now I can't put it down.

The combination of VC and VBIC in a 2:1 ratio is an unforgettable team of double vanilla diacetylicousness and I thoroughly enjoy what those little bits of NY Cheesecake and Graham Cracker do to them. Nice to see this finally on ATF, SleepersDemon! ","score":5},{"user":"RuntDastardly","text":"I, too, am happy to see this on ATF! Now I can love it up and add it to my favorites for easy mixin' again and again and again. This is a fantastic recipe, and one I enjoy from the first drop to the last.
