Use it at your liking...\r\n\r\nLike all other custards & creams it's gonna require a steep but I've tried to use ingredients that don't take that long and are great besides... The butter pecan seems a lil strong off the shake but it should blend in well once the creams bloom...\r\n\r\nI hope that you enjoy this recipe as much as Butters enjoys a double kiss! Please give a rating/review if you do give it a mix... Enjoy & keep mixing delicious vapes!\r\n","steep_days":"5 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T21:33:17.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"902","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Butter Pecan","flavor_id":"1212","vendor":"FW","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Butter Pecan Praline Ice Cream","flavor_id":"7745","vendor":"PUR","millipercent":3500},{"name":"Caramel Butter","flavor_id":"6046","vendor":"WF","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Vanilla Ice Cream","flavor_id":"1511","vendor":"LB","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Vanilla Custard","flavor_id":"131","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Super Sweet","flavor_id":"2384","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":500},{"name":"Butterscotch Ripple","flavor_id":"1217","vendor":"FW","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Vanilla Swirl","flavor_id":"189","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2000}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"183371","name":"Butters Pecan Dream"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
