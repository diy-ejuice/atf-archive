As in, it's the only thing she wants to vape.  I've tried taking down the FLV Bourbon and she doesn't like it as much (yes I know it's a high amount for FLV).   This is a very unique vape, and yes it smells like bourbon to everyone around you but it's also very sweet and creamy.  I've even gotten to where I enjoy this in my rotation.  I know these %'s seem high but seriously try it my way because I've tweaked this twelve different ways and this is the only one she wants.  In her words \"It's the only flavor I can really taste.\"   She refuses to wait for steeping and uses it as a Shake and Vape.  I like it better after five days.  I'm making this 120 ml a week for her.","steep_days":"5 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"total_reviews":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-02T15:41:31.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"724","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Bourbon","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Kentucky Bourbon","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Sugar Cookie V2","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Sweet Cream","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Vanilla Custard","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Rick's Sugar Daddy","vendor":"TBV","millipercent":2000}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"172098","name":"TOC'S Bourbon Cream Cookies"}}}
