This recipe began as a riff on one of Enyawwreklaw's Live Mixing recipes. I didn't have all of the flavors needed for the recipe. I have also been trying to clone a recipe for a Banana Snickerdoodle Cookie. This recipe was great on it's own, but it didn't quite have that \"oomph\" that pulled it from the drawing room floor to something that I was ready to release. The addition of the TFA Sweetener gave this recipe exactly what I was looking for. I also added 1 drop per 30 ml of FLV Rich Cinnamon, and there were fireworks going off in my mouth. **EDIT** The rich cinnamon can be subbed quite effectively with CAP Cinnamon Danish Swirl. This recipe is finally to the point where I feel good about releasing it into the community. I would like to ask for any feedback and constructive criticism in the comments section down below. I sincerely hope you enjoy this recipe as much as I do. Pretty good as a shake n' vape, but the vanilla custard really comes out to play after a few days to a week.
