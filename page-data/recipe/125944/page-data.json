This mix celebrates this unique citrus varietal which is less sour but sweeter and more flavourful than it's well know brother/sister/cousin, the Orange.\r\n\r\nFA Tanger is the star of the show and treated as such. It is an authentic representation of a fresh, sweet tangerine in all it's glory. There is a tinge of zest present which adds a stunning 'bite' when you least expect it.\r\n\r\nCap Sweet Tangerine keeps FA honest and prevents it from being too linear by boosting the sweetness a tad. Combined, these two provide an full burst of tangerine goodness!\r\n\r\nThe FA Cream provides some body & creaminess, allowing the fruit to show their full potential.\r\n\r\nWS23 cools everything down without detracting from the stars of show. Feel free to start the WS23 off at 0.50% and adjust up if required.\r\nSub WS23 with Koolada at your preferred % if preferred.\r\n\r\nGive this baby 3 days or so and she is ready to pop! \r\n","steep_days":"3","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"total_reviews":1,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:50:32.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"1838","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Tanger (mandarin)","vendor":"FA","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Cream Fresh","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"WS-23","vendor":"OTHR","millipercent":750},{"name":"Sweet Tangerine","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":2000}],"reviews":[{"user":"Jthectic","score":"5","text":"A cold, refreshing mix.
