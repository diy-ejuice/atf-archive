Afterwards, i found out you can still buy the juice lol!\r\nThe juice is not a banger and nothing crazy about it but maybe someone finds it interesting.\r\n\r\nAs always a simple and typically very sweet profile for a commercial juice, enjoy.","steep_days":"10","temperature":"0","recipe_score":4,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:50:51.000-05:00","best_vg":"80%","views":"4419","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Double Chocolate (clear)","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Graham Cracker Clear","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Vanilla Bean Ice Cream","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Super Sweet","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1500}],"reviews":[{"user":"nightshark","text":"Way too sweet but good base.
