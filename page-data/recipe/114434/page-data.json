Really enjoying this one\r\n\r\nThe crispy outer shell layer used CAP Cereal 27, WF Deep fried pastry dough and WF Glazed donut\r\n\r\nI feel the Cereal 27 contributes nicely to the crispy outer shell of the pastry with the deep fried pastry dough and glazed donut for the inside portion\r\n\r\nThe cream base used here is the new FA vanilla ice cream with CAP Vanilla whipped cream for mouth feel. My original thought was to use LB VBIC, but I use that so often, I wanted to try FA in a mix.\r\n\r\nI used FE Lemon with FA Custard to make that lemon pop a bit\r\nThe first version of this, I used FA Lemon sicily, but it did not come thru the way FE Lemon did. Also, I know the FE Lemon will not fade the way Lemon sicily will after a good steep.\r\n\r\nCAP Super sweet is optional but I feel it contributes to the recipe\r\n\r\nI created this after mixing 3 versions of a straight up Cream puff. Although I was pretty happy with one of the 3, I feel the profile was a bit basic and needed a little something more for it to be something I would vape a lot of. That is where the lemon comes in.\r\n\r\n","steep_days":"5","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"total_reviews":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T10:44:06.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"1626","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Cereal 27","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Deep Fried Pastry Dough SC","vendor":"WF","millipercent":500},{"name":"Glazed Donut SC","vendor":"WF","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Custard","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Vanilla Ice Cream","vendor":"FA","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Vanilla Whipped Cream","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Lemon","vendor":"FE","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Super Sweet","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":250}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"114434","name":"Lemon Cream Puff #mixin vixens"}}}
