Compliments the flavor very well. INW Raspberry adds some tartness to the punch while adding a nice finish to it all.\r\n\r\nCucumber CAP\r\n\r\nUsed this to add a \"wet mouthfeel\" and at this low % it doesn't even show up in the mix. just makes it a bit more wet.\r\n\r\nSuper Sweet CAP\r\n\r\nThis just adds some sweetness to the mix.","steep_days":"0 (SNV)","temperature":"420","recipe_score":0,"total_reviews":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:51:41.000-05:00","best_vg":"65%","views":"666","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Blue Raspberry Slush","vendor":"OSD","millipercent":10000},{"name":"Blue Raspberry","vendor":"LB","millipercent":5000},{"name":"Raspberry","vendor":"INW","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Super Sweet","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":500},{"name":"Cucumber","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":250}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"202425","name":"Blue Razzberry!"}}}
