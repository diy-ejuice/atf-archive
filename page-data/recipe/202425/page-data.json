Compliments the flavor very well. INW Raspberry adds some tartness to the punch while adding a nice finish to it all.\r\n\r\nCucumber CAP\r\n\r\nUsed this to add a \"wet mouthfeel\" and at this low % it doesn't even show up in the mix. just makes it a bit more wet.\r\n\r\nSuper Sweet CAP\r\n\r\nThis just adds some sweetness to the mix.","steep_days":"0 (SNV)","temperature":"420","recipe_score":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-12T18:30:59.000-05:00","best_vg":"65%","views":"672","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Blue Raspberry Slush","flavor_id":"2970","vendor":"OSD","millipercent":10000},{"name":"Blue Raspberry","flavor_id":"1479","vendor":"LB","millipercent":5000},{"name":"Raspberry","flavor_id":"667","vendor":"INW","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Super Sweet","flavor_id":"2384","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":500},{"name":"Cucumber","flavor_id":"43","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":250}],"reviews":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"202425","name":"Blue Razzberry!"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
