I love Holy Holy Grail and FLV tobaccos but they kill coils and cotton pretty quickly.\r\n\r\nJF RY4 Double is a great base to build upon. It's very caramel/vanilla forward and just needs a boost here and there. I chose to boost the tobacoo with INW Vanilla for Pipe which is a nice tobacco forward flavor that pushes the tobacco notes a bit more to the front. It won't show up in the mix for about a week, but when it does this mix starts to shine.\r\n\r\nFA Caramel and INW Shisha Vanilla are here to boost those accent notes in the VFP and RY4D a bit more forward and make the mix sweeter with more depth of vanilla/caramel. These 2 bring help without bringing a ton of baggage or off notes and work with the tobaccos instead of clashing with them.\r\n\r\nFLV Peanut Butter was chosen for the nut notes because it doesn't fade as much and we don't really need a perfect peanut butter here. We just want the nutty notes and pyrazines that it has to offer. I added FW Hazelnut for it's creaminess. It helps keep the PB from being dry and adds some creaminess to the vanilla/caramel notes and rounds out the nutty profile nicely.\r\n\r\nI wanted a coffee accent because Holy Holy Grail RY4 has some coffee notes that I love. Coffee flavors are all lacking in my opinion and I felt that this choice was one that would make or break this mix. I chose SC Cappuccino because it adds a bit to the creaminess of the hazelnut and stays away from that burnt popcorn note if you keep it low. Its a relatively dark concentrate, but it's still kind to coils/cotton. Some may be sensitive to the burnt popcorn off note and I would recommend adjusting this ingredient to your liking if you want more/less.\r\n\r\nI spent a lot of time balancing this recipe and checking it after a steep. This is, of course, for my palate. If you find that yours is different feel free to tinker with the percentages a bit. This won't need sweetener. The chosen concentrates do all the sweetening it needs. If you mix this up please leave a review or some feedback. All opinions are welcome!\r\n\r\nThis is good after about a 7 day steep. It's phenomenal after a month though","steep_days":"7","temperature":"0","recipe_score":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-10T14:52:52.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"3019","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Cappuccino","flavor_id":"3596","vendor":"SC","millipercent":600},{"name":"Carmel (caramel)","flavor_id":"503","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Graham Cracker","flavor_id":"8554","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Peanut Butter","flavor_id":"607","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1250},{"name":"RY4 Double","flavor_id":"4490","vendor":"JF","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Vanilla For Pipe","flavor_id":"886","vendor":"INW","millipercent":1750},{"name":"Shisha Vanilla","flavor_id":"841","vendor":"INW","millipercent":500},{"name":"Hazelnut","flavor_id":"1312","vendor":"FW","millipercent":500}],"reviews":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"119863","name":"Adios Mother F#cker (coffee nut RY4)"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
