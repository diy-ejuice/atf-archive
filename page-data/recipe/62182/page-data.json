Am4a is a flavor that seems to give different vibes to everyone, and changes with each pull. Some get chocolate, I personally get more of a rum type of flavor from it with maybe a hint of chocolate. INW Tobacco C is a fairly complex flavor as well. It's a creamy, smooth tobacco, but tends to get a little lost in the mix, so I went a bit high with it, but it works. FLV Fig I have not played with much, but it is a really nice fig flavor that plays really well with the tobaccos here. INW Black for Pipe is here to give the tobaccos a little smoky boost, but also has a nice, dark fruit vibe that blends with the fig really well. \r\n\r\nThis one is pretty decent as a shake and vape, but that Am4a likes to change a bit as it steeps. So enjoy it fresh and watch it change as the weeks go by.
