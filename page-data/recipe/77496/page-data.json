A perfect blend of a creamy refreshing mint with a touch of rose. A surprising blend that works pleasantly to refresh your palette. \r\n\r\n** This is very nice right after the shake. After a couple of hours you get a lovely refreshing mint on the inhale and a nice cream and rose note on the exhale.
