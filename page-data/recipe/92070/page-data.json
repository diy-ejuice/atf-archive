This is was one that I liked a lot, but haven't thought of until a friend mentioned it. I went out and got a few packs to see if I could get a recipe out of it, and here it is.\r\nThis isn't anything fancy, it's a simple 3 fruit profile but they were made for each other. Once I figured out the actual drink, it was just a matter of finding the right combo of orange and strawberry...then hitting the correct balance.\r\nThe orange sits on top and blends with the strawberry through the vape with a light banana note on the back. It's a nice juicy mix that's full of flavor. Creating a fruit body isn't always an easy task, you can end up with a thin recipe that's all top notes. The banana cream helps solve that by creating a nice base for the others to sit on and the juicy strawberry adding a wonderful dose of moisture that wets your mouth. If you liked this kool-aid, or love a good fruit mix I suggest giving this a shot. It's well balanced and you can taste each layer individually. \r\nYou can S&V this one, but I find a solid 24-48 steep gives the banana time to get in it's role and the orange will tone down a bit.\r\n\r\nEnjoy üòã","steep_days":"2 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:50:01.000-05:00","best_vg":"65%","views":"6437","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Banana Cream","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Juicy Strawberry","vendor":"FA","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Sweetener","vendor":"FW","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Sweet Tangerine","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1250},{"name":"Blood Orange","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Shisha Strawberry","vendor":"INW","millipercent":1750}],"reviews":[{"user":"WhatTheFront","text":"Nice old school koolaid taste.

Very accurate to the actually drink.  The strawberry and orange are very well balanced. The banana adds very nice mouthfeel but doesn't really stick out. Definitely a recipe to be proud of.
