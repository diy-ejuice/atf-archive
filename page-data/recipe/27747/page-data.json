Wanted to go for the \"apple cereal\" flavor without using the name brand as the title. So I used one of the knock off names with a Prince song twist :) \r\nUsing Fuji Apple and Apple Pie together allowed the apple to easily meld with a more sugary cereal flavor without it tasting like two separate mixes. Sugar Cookie for added sweetness and some of the bakery. Finally, AP gives it a bit of graininess that was much needed when I was testing it without. Will be opening the books again on this flavor soon, working with other possible meringues and/or bakery flavors, tweaking %'s, etc. Welcome feedback and criticisms of all kinds on this recipe.","steep_days":"7","temperature":"0","recipe_score":4,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:49:01.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"1244","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Acetyl Pyrazine","flavor_id":"1709","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Apple Pie","flavor_id":"8","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":6000},{"name":"Apple Fuji","flavor_id":"4886","vendor":"FA","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Meringue","flavor_id":"530","vendor":"FA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Sugar Cookie","flavor_id":"115","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Biscuit","flavor_id":"642","vendor":"INW","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Captain Cereal","flavor_id":"137","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1750},{"name":"Cinnamon Danish Swirl","flavor_id":"35","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":500}],"reviews":[{"user":"mk0","text":"I don't get apple jacks from it, but it's a really good apple pie.
