To me it's a full-out chocolate flavor. **MB Glamour Chocolate** a lighter slightly milky chocolate, and it's the reason why this needs around a week of steeping, since it takes a while for that chocolate flavor to fully develop.\r\n\r\n**Sweetener** is highly recommended for this mix, TFA 1% or CAP 0.5%.\r\n**WS-23** works here too, if that's your thing.","steep_days":"7","temperature":"420","recipe_score":5,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:51:01.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"1472","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Banana Cream","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Devon Cream","vendor":"VT","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Glamour Chocolate","vendor":"MB","millipercent":1000}],"reviews":[{"user":"jasone414","text":"I don't exactly like banana flavored things, but I occasionally vape bananas for a change of pace.
