I wanted something deeper and more syrupy.\r\n\r\nFLV Blueberry Muffin\r\nNo muffin notes with this one, Inaccurate name. Used for deeper ripe notes but it also provides a level of salivation when you vape it. Quite strange, But very pleasant.\r\n\r\nFA Bilberry\r\nDeep dark berry. Yum. 'Nuff said.\r\n\r\nTFA Dulce De Leche\r\nSweet milk with berries? Yes please!\r\n\r\nTFA Marshmallow\r\nSweetness, Mouthfeel, Fills the gap between cream and fruits.\r\n\r\nFA Vienna Cream\r\nRichness, Creaminess, A nice hint of vanilla to contrast the blueberry.","steep_days":"10","temperature":"0","recipe_score":4.5,"total_reviews":2,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:49:17.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"3448","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Vienna Cream","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Marshmallow","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Dulce De Leche","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Super Sweet","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":250},{"name":"Blueberry Muffin","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":750},{"name":"Bilberry","vendor":"FA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Blueberry","vendor":"FW","millipercent":3500}],"reviews":[{"user":"mlNikon","score":"4","text":"This is a pretty tasty mix! The dulce de leche is a nice addition. I think for me the bilberry is a little high as it is too earthy tasting. The rest of the mix is balanced very nicely, Good job!"},{"user":"peachykeen","score":"5","text":"Our gain with you revisiting Smurf Soup. The blueberry in here is bursting with blueberry goodness. Flavor West in combination with the blueberry muffin.  The Dulce De Leche makes a richer cream base after a 3 week steep. Five stars! "}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"44603","name":"Lackanookie"}}}
