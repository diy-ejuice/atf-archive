Great body and mouthfeel in - enjoy the combo of strawberries in the mix. Wonder how this would work with INW Shisha Strawberry + JF Strawberry Sweet? Might give that a go soon - love the cream base! ","score":4},{"user":"qb","text":"After a 1 week steep, I am finding this to be a very tasty mix. The cream is prominent without being over heavy, with the main body of the mix coming from the cookie/nut. I do like the strawberry, however I prefer a more candied strawberry flavour, so I will swap the ratios of the strawberries around.  Thank you!","score":4}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"12882","name":"God's Milk"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
