This is my closest approximation of it.  Before you turn your nose up at it, I've given out several samples of this and received nothing but good feedback.  It's a very simple recipe, to be sure, but if you're looking for a creamy strawberry cheesecake this fits the bill quite nicely.\r\n\r\nINW Biscuit does a nice job giving us the little crumbs of crust that are littered throughout the ice cream.\r\nTPA Marshmallow, CAP NYCC, and TPA VBIC give a nice, sweet cheesecake ice cream without any sour notes and a thick, creamy mouthfeel.\r\nFA Juicy Strawberry was my go-to here because it gives a sweet candy strawberry syrup flavor that stands up well by itself among the creams.\r\n\r\nIf you don't have Juicy Strawberry, you can probably get away with subbing a Strawberry Ripe/Sweet blend with emphasis on the sweet strawberry, but you'll lose some of the inherent juiciness that you get from FA.  I don't think people who get pepper from TPA VBIC will be bothered too badly by it at 1% here, and I wouldn't recommend subbing CAP in because the slight spice that comes from TPA VBIC fills in the body that would be a little thin using NYCC alone at only 3%.\r\n\r\n*Edit:  I knew I had cribbed this cream base from somewhere, but couldn't remember where.  I went back and looked, and I have to give credit to @Thadentman for his excellent work.","steep_days":"3 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"updated_at":"2020-12-12T18:29:35.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"2921","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Biscuit","flavor_id":"642","vendor":"INW","millipercent":750},{"name":"Marshmallow","flavor_id":"332","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"New York Cheesecake","flavor_id":"90","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Juicy Strawberry","flavor_id":"8779","vendor":"FA","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Vanilla Bean Ice Cream","flavor_id":"186","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1000}],"reviews":[{"user":"KylezKloudz","text":"Nice tasty mix! üëçüëç Didn't have juicy strawberry, so I threw in my own strawberry combo...
