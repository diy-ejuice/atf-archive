I wanted something I could vape that would help with my sore throat and my sinuses so I finally got to bust out my menthol flavors (I'm not usually a menthol guy). FLV Red Apple is usually fairly dry by itself at this % but when backed by FA Fuji it helped create a very cool and sweet apple. So if you're home sick, feel like poop, but you still want to vape, give this a shot. I can personally say this is S&V certified.","steep_days":"3 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"total_reviews":1,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:49:51.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"1292","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Cool Menthol","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":500},{"name":"Red Apple","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Fuji","vendor":"FA","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Super Sweet","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":250},{"name":"Polar Blast","vendor":"FA","millipercent":250}],"reviews":[{"user":"jasss22","score":"5","text":"Love it "}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"82788","name":"Sinuses are Stupid"}}}
