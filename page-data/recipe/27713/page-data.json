A fairly basic berry mix. Mostly inspired by /u/christopherson's phenomenal Looma recipe (reposted here https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/22844), though this is a  'brighter' berry-juice profile since Cap's Harvest Berry (a much 'darker' berry mix) has been intentionally omitted. With CAP's HB gone, you're left with a very close flavour to the cordial here.\r\n\r\nI've tweaked around with FA forest mix and INW raspberry for some time now, in hopes to recreate a raspberry/lime sherbet from a great DIY site here in Australia. Though that one led me to this cordial recipe and it worked well. With fuji apple and cactus, you get more of a juicy bite out of the berries.\r\n\r\nGive it about a 5 day steep to get rid of any possible weirdness from INW Raspberry and it develops nicely.\r\n\r\nOptional: \r\n- Koolada at 0.5% to make it like it was straight out of the fridge.\r\n- FA Lime Tahiti Cold Pressed at 0.5-1% for some lime-y zest to complement the berries\r\n","steep_days":"5 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":4,"updated_at":"2020-12-12T18:29:02.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"6030","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Forrest Mix (forest Fruit Mix)","flavor_id":"453","vendor":"FA","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Apple Fuji","flavor_id":"4886","vendor":"FA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Raspberry","flavor_id":"667","vendor":"INW","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Cactus","flavor_id":"647","vendor":"INW","millipercent":1000}],"reviews":[{"user":"cdaniell30","text":"Everything is nicely balanced, and the forest fruits rounds out the inw raspberry","score":4},{"user":"Waldschrat","text":"Nothing special but still delicious and well balanced.
