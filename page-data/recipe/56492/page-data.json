I mixed about 20 recipes in big bottles when i first started diying.  Foolish yes.  But it allowed me to have a nicely aged dark and powerful milk and honey. Not the milk and honey they talk about in the bible.  No sir.   The kind of milk n honey that stays out late doing things you just can't bring your self to question because you are truly afraid of the answer youll hear.  Let it age a few months and you'll have to rename it the Anti Milk n Honey.  Good stuff.."},{"user":"cdaniell30","text":"nice, dark, sweet, and creamy."},{"user":"Vurve","text":"I'm Vurve and I approve this message."},{"user":"SlashaLO","text":"Nice, simple, and sweet.
