DX MILK - it doesn't show up on the list I guess.  Sugar cookies v1 - cinnamon I had tried out at .25 and it never showed up so I'm trying it higher at .75.  This is the first time I am trying the butter pecan I think and .75 seems like it should just make an appearance but not overwhelm.  I want this tasting mostly like cereal and cream with just touches of the nuts and cinnamon.  And then enough tobacco so that it doesn't get lost in all this.  I do use sweetener now - I didn't used to - it does act somewhat like salt I think in that it brings the flavors more forward.","steep_days":"15","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-05T11:05:33.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"1380","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"DX Milk Chocolate","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1250},{"name":"Cereal 27","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Tahitian Vanilla Cream","vendor":"WF","millipercent":1000},{"name":"555 Gold","vendor":"INW","millipercent":2250},{"name":"Sweet Cream","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1250},{"name":"Sugar Cookie","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Butter Pecan","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":750},{"name":"Cinnamon Ceylon","vendor":"FA","millipercent":750},{"name":"Super Sweet","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":250}],"reviews":[{"user":"Mr-G","text":"555"}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"95794","name":"Cinnamon cookies cereal and cream w/tobacco"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
