JF Biscuit being a great base for that drier baked cereal note and bolstered with a little Capella CDS to bring that ever so slight bake cinnamon note. The Strawberry Ripe is only in here to boost the apple pairing of JF Fuji (can sub with FA Fuji) and FA Stark Apple. I personally have found that using FA Meringue with OOO Milky Undertones gives just the milk notes that should be present in any cereal vape if you are looking for that drenched in milk flavor. Then just enough Super Sweet to get that tongue out to like them lips. I hope you all enjoy it and let me know what you think.
