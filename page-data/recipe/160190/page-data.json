I’ve never tried them, but they really are a thing! There are two ways to make them. In one you actually dip the flower heads in batter and fry them. In the other, the flowers are milled into a classic fritter dough, with some Cordial thrown in to bolster their flavor, and fried. Both are dusted with powdered sugar and served warm. I was envisioning the second type when I created this recipe. I’ve never eaten fried flower heads, but I can imagine what a dough with elderflower in it would taste like.\r\n\r\nWith that said, the recipe is pretty straight forward. The Deep Fried Pastry Dough and Zeppola make up the fritter dough. The Elderflower and Powdered Sugar make up the elderflower and powdered sugar! The Cream and the Marshmallow keep the mix from being dry and softens the sharpness of the elderflower into the sweetness of the dough.\r\n\r\nThis needs at least 5 days to develop. Off the shake it takes like hot metal! After a day or two it tastes like a powdered sugar donut with a little zest. By day 5 the elderflower starts to shine. The bakery notes take on a more fried dough characteristic, rather than just a donut. The powdered sugar tastes more like fresh powdered sugar versus the mass produced, sitting on a shelf for god knows how long, kind of powdered sugar you get on those donuts. It’s still a tad dry. I’m not sure if that will steep out or if the recipe needs some tweaks. I’m also not sure if this tastes anything like an elderflower fritter. But it’s interesting and different. I think it’s a profile worth exploring further with the help of MC.\r\n\r\nMixed at 70VG/30PG with Essential Depot mats.\r\n\r\n","steep_days":"5","temperature":"420","recipe_score":4,"updated_at":"2020-12-12T20:31:11.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"716","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Deep Fried Pastry Dough SC","flavor_id":"8367","vendor":"WF","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Zeppola","flavor_id":"6312","vendor":"FA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Elderflower","flavor_id":"3518","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Powdered Sugar","flavor_id":"6522","vendor":"OOO","millipercent":500},{"name":"Cream","flavor_id":"604","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Marshmallow","flavor_id":"332","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":500}],"reviews":[{"user":"eyemakepizza","text":"Fried Flowers &#xD;\n&#xD;\nSo I’m for sure getting flowers. There’s no doubt about that. I’m getting a subtle little taste of powdered sugar in back of the Elderflower. I’m am however having a very hard time picking up any of the fried dough part. I’m getting a super trace amount of it. Almost like when you walk into a bakery and you can smell the doughy pastry in the air. It’s very light which is surprising considering the amounts used in the mix. This was mixed on 12/15 and I’m just getting into it on the 16/17th of January. I’m partly curious if maybe I’m not getting the full fried dough experience because it was lost to too long of a steep. I really enjoy the concept of this mix. I would definitely like to see how it is either after a few days steep or maybe with the Zeppola bumped a bit to make it more pronounced.","score":4},{"user":"nowar","text":"I am glad I got to retry this mix. The first time I tried it, it had steeped for far too long (2months) and lost a large amount of the distinctive characteristics of this mix. What I get is like what I imagine a classic apple fritter, fried dough with pockets of grease and apple chunks, would taste like if you replaced the apple chunks and sweet flower petals, never glazed it and instead dusted it with just enough powdered sugar to make it not sweet and not savory. It's somewhere in the middle which works really well to cut the grease but to complement the floral, almost tea-like, component. This is a rather unusual take on elderflower, even if it's a real thing, and i find it is both interesting and falls into my category of profile: fried dough without too much sweet. I would recommend this easily.","score":5},{"user":"ID10-T","text":"Well that’s delightfully different. I had no trouble believing that’s what a fried dough made of elderflowers oomphed with St. Germain and dusted with powdered sugar might taste like. And once I got over how odd it was to encounter fried dough behind that strong floral, entirely pleasant and very interesting. &#xD;\nThis had steeped for more than three weeks before I tried it. I didn’t have any issues with too much dryness, the powdered sugar finish is perfect. The elderflower is forward and dominant but what’s behind it is definitely a fried dough. The only thing I might think about changing is working possible replacements for either WF Deep Fried Pastry Dough or FA Zeppola or both to get rid of the spice notes that interfere with the elderflower. It mostly covers them up but it still tastes like a little clove/cinnamon/nutmeg spice got that fritter where it doesn’t really belong, and seems like it would be a cleaner and more enjoyable elderflower top note without them. You could get the fried aspect from WF Glazed Donut, but it would still need something to fill it out,  and Zeppola might be the best thing for that job. Maybe just replacing Deep Fried Pastry Dough with WF Glazed Donut would take out enough spice for elderflower to fully overcome it. Or, if you could get your hands on SA Beignet, it might a single-ingredient solution for both the Pastry Dough and Zeppola, and as an added bonus, render the OoO Powdered Sugar unnecessary and get you down to just four flavors to balance.
