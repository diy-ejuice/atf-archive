Finalized in the second iteration, the first version had a bit more cream and an unfortunate addition of FLV Connecticut Shade. CT Shade did not play nicely with the other kids so he was banned from the sandbox. (These were later transformed into the Spicy Professor). Added to top it off was just a hair of INW Shisha Vanilla which adds warmth and a sensation of sweet without the added sugar.\r\n\r\nDescription: Buttery, nutty, creamy, caramel, dry, and tobacco forward\r\n\r\nResult: This is a tobacco straight up. Imagine an RY4 without the sweet. The caramel is there and the vanilla, too. The creaminess and nuttiness is there. But this is very much a tobacco vape. You will get a delicate balance of dry nutty creamy buttery caramel under a warm blanket of tobacco with very little distinct flavors, all wrapped up snug for you. We hope you enjoy this as much as we did.\r\n\r\nJoin the discord and share your ideas! https://discord.gg/ufVTyAQ","steep_days":"1 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"total_reviews":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T23:37:25.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"1832","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Red Burley","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1500},{"name":"RY1","vendor":"HS","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Caramel Butter","vendor":"WF","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Hazelnuts & Cream","vendor":"WF","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Cereal 27","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Shisha Vanilla","vendor":"INW","millipercent":250}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"143001","name":"Nutty Professor"}}}
