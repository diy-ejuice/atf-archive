The other day I recieved  Raspberry Jelly Bean WF and added it to one of my favorite Raspberry lemonade mixes and after tweaking the recipes background notes a bit and adjusting the lemonade base this has become my favorite ADV. \r\nSometimes I taste the candy element more and sometimes I taste the lemonade more and I really like that..If you like a sweeter vape just bump the sweetness to 0.40 or so. This works fine as a shake and vape but a couple days and the raspberry really starts to pop.","steep_days":"2 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"total_reviews":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T23:39:23.000-05:00","best_vg":"65%","views":"415","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Candy Roll","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":750},{"name":"Fizzy Sherbet","vendor":"VT","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Lemonade","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Lemonade","vendor":"LA","millipercent":3600},{"name":"Raspberry","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":800},{"name":"Raspberry Jelly Bean SC","vendor":"WF","millipercent":2300},{"name":"Raspberry (sweet)","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":3500},{"name":"Razzleberry","vendor":"FW","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Sweetness","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":200}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"208926","name":"A Little Red Death (Raspberry Candy VS Raspberry Lemonade)"}}}
