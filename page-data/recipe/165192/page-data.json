Well not quite, see this is a combination of experience, balance and a little bit of chance. Off the shake it was delicious, 5 days later it was delicious now exactly 20 days later it is amazing! \r\nThis one is worth playing around at different temperatures to get the fruits you like to shine with your sensory system. \r\nThe presence of the various flavors in this is obvious although there isn't a total separation of flavor. In other words, if you focus on the strawberry and kiwi you will notice that more, if you focus on the berries and banana you will notice them more as well. The berries seemingly glisten in the background. The positioning of Cap Sweet Guava offers a lovely texture and body to the fruits here and is the most valuble player with the most assists here. It's a fruit medley that works.\r\n This is one of the most complex things to achieve in DIY eLiquid creation, that is to achieve obvious flavours that are separated with more than 3 fruits. While they are not completely separated, this is the closest I have ever made or come across in all the time I have been mixing. \r\nThe Bakery combination of JF Biscuit and WF Flan have worked perfectly as the base layer of this profile. The mouthfeel & flavour is on point. \r\nThere certainly was a little bit of lady luck to get a profile like this right on the first attempt with this flavour combination but I will accept that lol. \r\n\r\nBottom line is this recipe is authentic as it is delicious and all day vapable. I am my own worst critic so to give this 5 Stars puts it in with   my top all time recipes. \r\n\r\nSee it being made here: https://youtu.be/xkO0dws51fQ?t=4831\r\n\r\nGive it a go and let me know what you thought of this!\r\n \r\nSteep 5 Days for best results but vapable off the shake. \r\n\r\nEnjoy!\r\n\r\nI tested on a Wotofo Recurve DUAL RDA 0.14ohm SST coils at 65w\r\n\r\nI hope you enjoy this just as much as I enjoyed creating this recipe, but let me know what you thought in the comments below.\r\n\r\nSeriously if you like a solid recipe that works give it a go!\r\n\r\nCheers for reading this far, now go and get mixing!\r\n\r\n\"Together, Let's Discover!!!\"\r\n\r\nFacebook - https://www.facebook.com/groups/diydownunder/\r\nDiscord - https://discord.gg/kH4Fqbc\r\nYoutube - https://www.youtube.com/c/diydownunder\r\nWebsite - https://www.diydownunder.com/\r\nInstagram IGTV : @diydownunder","steep_days":"5","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T20:33:11.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"2404","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Flan SC","flavor_id":"10107","vendor":"WF","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Forest Mix","flavor_id":"4576","vendor":"JF","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Biscuit","flavor_id":"4487","vendor":"JF","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Kiwi Strawberry With Stevia","flavor_id":"82","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Peach White","flavor_id":"543","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Soft Banana","flavor_id":"1524","vendor":"MB","millipercent":3500},{"name":"Sweet Guava","flavor_id":"118","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":2000}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"165192","name":"The Flan"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
