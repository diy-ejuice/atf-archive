I wanted to try something a little different with the sweet rice. Pistachio came to mind from an Asian influence and these flavors just work really nice together. Even with vanilla custard in the mix the FE Sweet Rice still hangs in there as the top note. This has a nice pistachio flavor that lingers through the vape with a creamy vanilla finish. I can't put it down it is addicting and just works.","steep_days":"3 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-12T10:14:55.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"1511","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Pistachio","flavor_id":"293","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Sweet Rice","flavor_id":"7727","vendor":"FE","millipercent":5000},{"name":"Meringue","flavor_id":"530","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Vanilla Custard","flavor_id":"131","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Cream Fresh","flavor_id":"540","vendor":"FA","millipercent":500}],"reviews":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"80271","name":"Rice Custard w/ Pistachio"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
