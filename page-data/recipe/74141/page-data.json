I'd like a little more of a creaminess to it but if you're a root beer fan you'll absolutely love it. FLV's Root Beer is a killer flavor, and this really accentuates it. Drop the super sweet if you're not a fan of sweeter flavors, but I'd recommend keeping the FW Vanilla Bean Ice Cream at a bare minimum. It makes the whole thing really pop and adds a creaminess to it that the root beer alone lacks in my opinion.","score":4},{"user":"SatJoe563","text":"Taste good as SNV.  Didnt have vanillin, used Shisha Vanilla same %.  Good recipe.  Thanks again.","score":5},{"user":"Ebc88","text":"Wow can definitely see this being my adv for awhile gonna have to order some more flv root beer","score":5},{"user":"shyndo","text":"Delicious shake n vape, love that Wayne doesn't overcomplicate the profile and really just lets the flv rootbeer shine. Every accent just enhances the natural flavor of the root beer and takes nothing away from it.","score":5}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"74141","name":"Root Beer Float"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
