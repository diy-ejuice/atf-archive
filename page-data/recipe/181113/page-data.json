I have changed the recipe numerous times adding this and that but at the end of the day these five flavors create a vape that I absolutely love. Add some menthol for a cool finish and if you like a creamier root beer then just bump the creaming soda to 1.75% and the vanilla bean to 1% (adding marshmallow works as well)","steep_days":"3 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-10T14:53:35.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"640","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Creaming Soda","flavor_id":"8862","vendor":"VT","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Root Beer","flavor_id":"8567","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1400},{"name":"Root Beer","flavor_id":"1401","vendor":"FW","millipercent":2100},{"name":"Sweetness","flavor_id":"4413","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":250},{"name":"Vanilla Bean","flavor_id":"8573","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":250}],"reviews":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"181113","name":"the ROOT"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
