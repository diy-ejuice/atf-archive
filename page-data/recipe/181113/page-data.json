I have changed the recipe numerous times adding this and that but at the end of the day these five flavors create a vape that I absolutely love. Add some menthol for a cool finish and if you like a creamier root beer then just bump the creaming soda to 1.75% and the vanilla bean to 1% (adding marshmallow works as well)","steep_days":"3 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-06T20:45:29.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"633","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Creaming Soda","vendor":"VT","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Root Beer","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1400},{"name":"Root Beer","vendor":"FW","millipercent":2100},{"name":"Sweetness","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":250},{"name":"Vanilla Bean","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":250}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"181113","name":"the ROOT"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
