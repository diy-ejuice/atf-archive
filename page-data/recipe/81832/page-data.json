RF Yogurt parfait is the base, and is pretty good on its own. IMO just needs some help. It already has a pretty good tang so i went with Cap creamy yogurt to help accent it. Some additional assorted berries with the forest fruit and strawberry ripe. The meringue will help tame down some of the tang, while still leaving this a delicious Greek yogurt with the berries swirled in. give it 3 days and it is quite heavenly.","steep_days":"3","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:49:50.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"1198","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Creamy Yogurt","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Forrest Mix (forest Fruit Mix)","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1250},{"name":"Meringue","vendor":"FA","millipercent":750},{"name":"Strawberry (ripe)","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Super Sweet","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":500},{"name":"Yogurt Parfait â€“ Super Concentrate","vendor":"RF","millipercent":3000}],"reviews":[{"user":"RdaJunkie","text":"This recipe is not getting enough attention. I've had yogurt parfait for awhile and just haven't used it until this recipe. It looked good so I said hell ill finally give that concentrate a go and see how this is. I'm glad I did. Description and profile is spot on. Not too tangy or sour at all, its actually very smooth and rich. And then for the berries. They actually feel like they lay mixed into the yogurt. Not on top or bottom like a lot of yogurt mixes with berries. Awesome job"}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"81832","name":"Yogurt Par-Fave"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
