I started this recipe years ago using NETs for the tobacco but here it is now in it's 100% artificial glorious-ness.\r\n\r\nNot much to notate on flavor usage here other than FLV Red Burley and FLV Cured Tobacco being two of the nicest artificial tobacco flavorings ever created!!!\r\n\r\nFW BS, CAP FV and TFA Marsh providing a different slant on the typical caramel and vanilla RY4 base.\r\n\r\nGood as a shake and vape, good as a mid steeper, good as a long steeper.

This recipe is hard to describe to my vaping buddies other than \"Here just try it, \" to which they respond \"Wow! Damn that's amazing!\" And those are mainly people who claim to dislike tobacco profiles ðŸ˜‰ This is a decadent, smooth, mouthgasm of a desert-y tobacco-y treat that you need to experience no matter your aversion to tobacco flavors. The cured and burley at those levels don't attribute too apparent a tobacco note, (if you're not searching for them) as much as they make you feel like you're eating a big bowl of baked, slightly caramellized, butterscotch pudding while sitting outside, in front of a blazing, aromatic hardwood fire. Excellent recipe, off to make a much bigger bottle!"},{"user":"ID10-T","text":"Itâ€™s like breathing sweet pipe tobacco through an unlit pipe while a mouthful of butterscotch sundae from DQ melts in your mouth. An amazing take on RY4 that's hard to put down! "},{"user":"HerrHut","text":"Yummy.  I wouldn't even classify it as a tobacco.  More like a pure dessert.  Good stuff!"},{"user":"KillaCoDe","text":"This is an excellent recipe! Mixed up about 120ml's of it now and its one of my new favs! The butterscotch, french vanilla and marshmellow come together really well and is also balanced well with the tabacco flavors. As usual Fear nails it!"}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"35021","name":"BUDDERSTOTCH aka Burleyscotch V2"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
