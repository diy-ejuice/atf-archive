This takes my favorite elements from Mothers milk, Unicorn milk and Boosted and combines them into my ultimate favorite recipe.\r\nIf you want it sweeter, I recommend TFA sweetener. Start at .25% & work up from there. Butterscotch and DDL sweeten it enough for me but everyone has different tastes. \r\nNeeds at least one week steep but gets even better with time.The malt comes out more the longer you let it steep. Don't like ddl, use strawberries and cream instead. Don't have FW butterscotch, use TFA or FA caramel. Want more strawberry, up it to 8%. No noticable difference using Cap vbic so if you don't like TFA VBIC it's okay to sub. HIGHLY RECOMMEND using FW vbic. Good strawberry variations that I've tried: 3.5% each Cap sweet strawberry and TFA strawberry ripe; Wayne's my dude 4% Cap sweet strawberry, 3% TFA strawberry, just TFA strawberry ripe 7% or TFA strawberry ripe 5% with 2% JF sweet strawberry  (my new favorite combo)","steep_days":"14","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"total_reviews":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T22:31:43.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"3541","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Strawberry (ripe)","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1750},{"name":"Cream Fresh","vendor":"FA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Vanilla Swirl","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Vanilla Bean Ice Cream","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Malted Milk (conc)","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Dulce De Leche","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Butterscotch","vendor":"FW","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Strawberry","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1750},{"name":"Strawberry","vendor":"FW","millipercent":3500}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"16592","name":"Strawberry milkshake "}}}
