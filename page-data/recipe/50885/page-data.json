Just in time to beat the summer heat. \r\n\r\nThe FLV cream and vanilla swirl create a more milk shake style cream base. \r\n\r\nWithout a doubt, the best two mangos for this are FLV and CAP. They are light, fresh, and sweet. FA pear provides a bit more fruit body and wetness to the mouth feel. Lastly, CAP sweet strawberry helps to blend the mango into the cream while providing additional sweetness and balancing the overall fruit profile. \r\n\r\nMakes for a perfect shake and vape while the mango is fresh.
