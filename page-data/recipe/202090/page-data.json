I've tried all sorts of things and quite literally all of them found themselves to be washing the pipes down my kitchen sink.\r\n\r\nGot a new shipment in a few days ago and as I was single testing JF RY4 double found it great and just thought fuck it, why not throw a drop or two of red Burley in there and see what happens. \r\n\r\nWhat happened is it was fucking delicious. I've yet to make it past day two of a steep, but even on day 2 it's just a superb desert tobacco vape .\r\n\r\nTo say it's better than Cardinal would be some straight sacrilege, but to me at least it's comparable. A different vape, but satisfying and ticks all my boxes. And, as these concentrated aren't going anywhere soon, hopefully... Something we can all enjoy for many years to come.\r\n\r\nCheers !","steep_days":"0 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"total_reviews":1,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:51:41.000-05:00","best_vg":"65%","views":"1970","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"RY4 Double","vendor":"JF","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Red Burley","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":750}],"reviews":[{"user":"AAP-DAAP-DERP","score":"5","text":"That's a nice pairing you did there... and it's nice after the shake which surprised me a lot.
