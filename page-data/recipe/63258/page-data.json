Smooth creamy vanilla, adds warmth and body. Red Burley is the best for being accepting of most accompanying aromas, oakwood adds a nice woody note, and well graham cracker and zeppola...can't really go wrong with that combo as a bakery note.\r\n\r\nAfter doing a few tests with playing around with the percentages, I find myself coming back to the original recipe and preferring it to other versions. If you want a bit more of a graham forward taste, add in 0.75% FLV Graham Cracker, but other than that I pretty much like it as is.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\nphoto credit: BaboMike <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/36976184@N02/5581447146\">Feminine Penis</a> via <a href=\"http://photopin.com\">photopin</a> <a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/2.0/\">(license)</a>\r\n","steep_days":"7 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":4.8,"total_reviews":4,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:49:35.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"5302","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Zeppola","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Oak Wood","vendor":"FA","millipercent":170},{"name":"Red Burley","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1150},{"name":"Vanilla Pudding","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Graham Cracker","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":450}],"reviews":[{"user":"chief63","score":"4","text":"Not bad, not bad.

Creamy vanilla graham cracker notes up front with a subtle tobacco note.  This is very well balanced.  True to the description of a vanilla Ry4 type recipe.  Iâ€™m not real big into tobacco vapes, but I really like this one.  Great job.  "},{"user":"kindground","score":"5","text":"This is simply delicious. Needs a week to steep but it's worth it. The vanilla and the bakeries are really bringing out the chocolate notes in the tobacco for me. I love it! "},{"user":"ID10-T","score":"5","text":"Give this about week to steep. It develops into a wonderfully woodsy warm vanilla tobacco that's remarkably full-flavored for such low %s used. I don't know why it's listed as a \"work in progress\" - it tastes finished to me, with no sign of room for improvement. Not too sweet, not too dry, just terrific. I can definitely enjoy this Morning Wood all day. "}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"63258","name":"Morning Wood"}}}
