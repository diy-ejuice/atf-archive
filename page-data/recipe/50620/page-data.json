I figured I would share it with the world since it came out delicious.\r\n\r\nFW Grape and LA Grape, two of the best artificial grape flavors come together to make the perfect grape candy combo. I also added a touch of FLV Grape, which is by far one of  the greatest yet most powerful candy grape flavors Iâ€™ve ever tried. It really makes the whole grape aspect pop.\r\nFW Bubblegum, one of my favorite bubblegum flavors. Basically, pink Dubble Bubble. This flavor can be a little weird. There isn't much texture nor is there enough mouthfeel imo. People used to mix this flavor at absurd percentages for the full on gumball flavor. IDK how they did 10-12%. The gum flavor is super strong to me. I added the ethyl maltol to soften the edges along with adding that natural sweetness and also added FA Oba Oba to punch up the overall candy profile of the entire mix. It also adds some extra mouth feel so you're almost chewing on some delicious bubblegum.\r\nThis stuff is good right out of the gate, but I just suggest giving it a few days to become one with the VG and mellow out a bit. ENJOY!\r\nThis is a super simple mix and I know for sure you can take the gumball half and add different fruits to it to makes some other gums. Give that a try sometime, I make a watermelon gum this way too.","steep_days":"3 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T23:35:43.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"2034","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Grape","flavor_id":"947","vendor":"LA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Grape","flavor_id":"1298","vendor":"FW","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Bubble Gum","flavor_id":"1210","vendor":"FW","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Grape","flavor_id":"2593","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":500},{"name":"Ethyl Maltol","flavor_id":"1710","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Oba Oba","flavor_id":"480","vendor":"FA","millipercent":250}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"50620","name":"Statutory  Grapes"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
