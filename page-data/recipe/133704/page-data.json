Brings a bright gummy that isn't plastic tasting like some gummy flavors I've tried. Believe it tastes fully authentic.\r\n\r\nCAP 27 Fish - Bringing more gummy to the table while bolstering the red flavor of the juice. Also another gummy I think tastes completely realistic to the title.\r\n\r\nRF Strawberry - Is the power house of the two strawberries used in the recipe. brings a jammy/candy strawberry flavor.\r\n\r\nCAP Sweet Strawberry - Rounds out the strawberry jam/candy portion of the recipe.\r\n\r\nCAP Super Sweet - Felt it was needed to hype the flavors and bring on the brightness needed to do the original juice justice. Tried CAP SS all the way up to 3%, didn't add anything special that I was looking for, so just used to bring out the strawberry candy and hype the gummy.\r\n\r\nPreferred Shake and Vape. Tested in the Falcon Mesh Tank.","steep_days":"1 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-06T20:51:27.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"2535","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"27 Fish","flavor_id":"8736","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":3000},{"name":"27 Bears","flavor_id":"8735","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":5000},{"name":"Strawberry","flavor_id":"2294","vendor":"RF","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Sweet Strawberry","flavor_id":"121","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Super Sweet","flavor_id":"2384","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":500}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"133704","name":"Strawberry Gummy - Glas Basix Remix"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
