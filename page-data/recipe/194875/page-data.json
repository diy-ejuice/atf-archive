Problem solved.\r\n\r\nWith a more bold, balanced, sweet AF strawberry jelly out of the way, all I need was a buttery sweet cookie to surround it with.\r\nI chose a heavy dose of Sugar Cookie 6% because it would scale well up high with the  OOO Strawberry Jam.\r\n\r\nI backed it up with a firm cookie they call a Biscuit in the UK. The buttery cookie note, texture and \"snap\" that Biscuit(INW) brings worked well.\r\n\r\n*the Butter base keeps them from sticking to the pan*\r\n\r\nGood to go off a shake,  just give it enough time to let the bubbles settle...best after 3 days + imo\r\n\r\nThis recipe was tested and designed on the Haku single Clapton at .54ohms at 50W and the Moonshot RTA at .56ohms at 42 watts\r\n@s2k on ELR\r\n\r\n","steep_days":"3 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"total_reviews":2,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:51:34.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"1172","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Sugar Cookie","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":6000},{"name":"Strawberry Jam","vendor":"OOO","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Super Sweet","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":500},{"name":"Biscuit","vendor":"INW","millipercent":1250},{"name":"Butter Base","vendor":"VT","millipercent":250},{"name":"Strawberry","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2000}],"reviews":[{"user":"Skywxp3d","score":"5","text":"First week or two I was like ‘meh - after that it keeps getting better, 4 weeks and omg it’s delicious!
