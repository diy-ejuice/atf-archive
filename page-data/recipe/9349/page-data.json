I love the use of Vanilla Butternut. It adds extra density to that already chewy cookie. The maple flavor of it just melts into the buttery creams. This is getting better as the days go. The creams are coming together and it feels more and more cohesive. Will definitely be mixing some more. Thanks for sharing!"}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"9349","name":"Sugar cookies and Maple buttercream"}}}
