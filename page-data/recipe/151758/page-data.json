Here it brings the main note, with a distinct tropical floral note, sweet and not as aggressive as FLV Hibiscus. It also provides a full mouthfeel that imitates the syrup sweetener they use in Starbucks.\r\n\r\nFLV Lemon Tea: For me this is not black tea with lemon, but more like lemons boiled with tea. The lemon note is bright and upfront and not too sweet or candied. The tea note is almost infused in the lemon flavor, making it easy to blend in this mix.\r\n\r\nwww.instagram.com/nachef.mixing/\r\n\r\nSalud!","steep_days":"0 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"total_reviews":1,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:50:57.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"2627","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Sweet Tea","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":9000},{"name":"Hibiscus","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Lemon Tea","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Super Sweet","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":500},{"name":"WS-23","vendor":"OTHR","millipercent":350}],"reviews":[{"user":"dougc","score":"5","text":"This simple recipe is flavorful, perfectly balanced and tastes just like the picture.
