It's extremely versatile and doesn't need as much of a steep time as other VBIC. Mixes well with any combo of fruits I throw at it.\r\nShisha vanilla is a nice sweet accent\r\nFW, tpa strawberry and tpa ripe strawberry - this combo is Kat's strawberry stone. I use it a lot. Gives a true fresh strawberry flavor. \r\nJF sweet strawberry - this flavor reminds me of juice left in bowl of sugar sweetened strawberries. \r\nFLV sweetness - stevia based sweetness without the aftertaste. At lower percentages it really brightens this mix","steep_days":"7","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"total_reviews":null,"updated_at":"2020-11-26T11:54:52.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"1522","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Strawberry","vendor":"FW","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Strawberry","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Strawberry (ripe)","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Strawberry Sweet","vendor":"JF","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Holy Vanilla","vendor":"DFS","millipercent":3250},{"name":"Shisha Vanilla","vendor":"INW","millipercent":250},{"name":"Sweetness","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":100}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"48513","name":"Holy Strawberry "}}}
