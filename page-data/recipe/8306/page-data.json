It's still a coil gunker because of the Chocolate Glazed Donuts, but at least you're not vaping radioactive sugar fumes.

Maybe a little less waxy than the original - a good thing.  Still a little 'tickly' on the throat but not as harsh as the original.  Great improvement on the original.  Nice work!  Doesn't need the 21 day steep IMO but YMMV.","score":5},{"user":"Lupeie","text":"This was pretty good, it's a bit harsh for me.
