Maybe a little less waxy than the original - a good thing.  Still a little 'tickly' on the throat but not as harsh as the original.  Great improvement on the original.  Nice work!  Doesn't need the 21 day steep IMO but YMMV."},{"user":"Lupeie","score":"4","text":"This was pretty good, it's a bit harsh for me.
