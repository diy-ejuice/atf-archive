By itself it is not enough but 1% is a good start to build and then HS Hazelnut Coffee comes into play.\r\n\r\nHS Hazelnut Coffee 2%\r\n\r\nI really enjoy HS Hazelnut Coffee but it certainly benefits from FA Up to add more of the coffee note that gets a bit hidden by the Hazelnut.\r\n\r\nFW Hazelnut 2%\r\n\r\nFW Hazelnut is neccessary to get that Hazelnut Creamer taste that I like with my coffee. This flavoring nails the hazelnut taste but also has a level of cream that really makes it versatile in a lot of recipes.\r\n\r\nCAP VWC 3%\r\n\r\nI still needed one more cream that wasn't going to be too heavy as to sit in the bottom of the profile and CAP Vanilla Whipped Cream is always my go to when this situation happens. It mixes well with everything and doesn't sit too low in the profile when I want the coffee to sit heavy.\r\n\r\nTFA Sweetener 1.5%\r\n\r\nI love my coffee light and sweet and when making a recipe based on how I like my coffee, sweetener was a must to capture that taste. Feel free to play around with this percentage, I found for myself and I really like my coffee sweet that 1.5% was perfect.\r\n\r\nThis recipe is great as a SnV, the hazelnut creamer is the first flavor you will taste followed by coffee on the back note of the exhale which reminds me of drinking coffee. I use so much creamer and sugar in my coffee that I taste those first and then the taste of coffee will come through in the end. The longer it steeps the more that coffee note will start to be stronger but it never leaves the back note which is exactly where I want to it to stay. I mix at 80vg/20pg so if you mix this at any other ratio please let me know how it comes out!\r\n","steep_days":"3 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-06T20:39:46.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"1606","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"UP (coffee)","flavor_id":"4473","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Hazelnut Coffee","flavor_id":"4353","vendor":"HS","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Hazelnut","flavor_id":"1312","vendor":"FW","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Vanilla Whipped Cream","flavor_id":"1","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Sweetener","flavor_id":"339","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1500}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"40940","name":"WAKE UP!"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
