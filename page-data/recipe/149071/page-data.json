To me its fantastic and here's my theory.  FA Lemon Sicily notoriously fades quickly and combine with LA Lemonade it gives you that great sweet lemonade up front.  The problem here is that you can't really mix much of it, this is where the FLV Lemonade comes in to play.  It takes 3-5 days to really open up, its fine as a SnV but starts to shine after a few days.  You get that really tart and sweet lemonade.  As the Sicily starts to fade the FLV Lemonade starts to get brighter and sweeter, thus extending the life of your lemonade base.  Add your fruits and ws-23 as you like.","steep_days":"1 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"updated_at":"2020-12-12T15:40:34.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"3185","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Lemonade","flavor_id":"951","vendor":"LA","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Lemonade","flavor_id":"636","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Lemon Sicily","flavor_id":"524","vendor":"FA","millipercent":750}],"reviews":[{"user":"fieldgreens","text":"I've tried a few lemonade bases, and this is the best one.  Not overly lemony, no off notes, not terribly sweet.  A really great vape on its own, but also really great to build on.  Absolutely perfect. ","score":5},{"user":"gunsforhands","text":"This is by far my favorite lemonade base.  I use it with a boysenberry/raspberry combo and every time I have it, it gets better and better.  It's very tart and tangy at first, and then after a few days it morphs into a more sweet, almost canned or powdered lemonade...which is by no means a bad thing. This has become a staple for me in my mixes.","score":5},{"user":"TheJuiceJackBuilt","text":"So for a lemonade base this is lovely. I tested it out after 2day steeping. I get a bright sweet artificial lemonade taste, kind of like the cheap lemonade you get from the supermarket, (which happens to be my fave type of lemonade). This will easily become my go to base for lemonade mixes in the future. ","score":5}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"149071","name":"Puckenade(Lemonade Base)"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
