This is my attempt at it, and really my first attempt at making my own recipe period.  I really dig this.  It is great right off the shake, in fact, I almost prefer it right off the shake as you get a little bit more of the New York Cheesecake.  Delicious.  It steeps nicely and the mint does fade, but I still find it an enjoyable all day vape.  \r\n\r\nI wish I could give you more information about why I choose this flavor for this reason, but I'm really not into single flavor tasting.  I just used the flavors that I have acquired from research. . . and recipes I've bought for.  Watching Noted in particular and listening to what flavors ranked and what they could do brought me to this list for this recipe.  I had intended to take the long road and alter percentages and try alternative flavors, but to be honest. . . . I really like this as it stands.\r\n\r\nThe one thing I can say is that the mint is mild in this.  I might bump it up a .25% when I mix it next, but for the most part I think these are spot on for my taste and what I was going for.\r\n\r\nIf you do indeed try this recipe out, I encourage you to try it as it steeps.  The changes in flavor are quite nice and really change from day to day.","steep_days":"3 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T21:33:07.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"907","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Cream Fresh","flavor_id":"540","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Meringue","flavor_id":"530","vendor":"FA","millipercent":750},{"name":"New York Cheesecake","flavor_id":"9956","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Spearmint","flavor_id":"284","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":250},{"name":"Super Sweet","flavor_id":"2384","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":500},{"name":"Vanilla Cream","flavor_id":"8992","vendor":"VT","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Vienna Cream","flavor_id":"516","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1750},{"name":"White Winter (spearmint)","flavor_id":"557","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"161127","name":"Spearing Mint, Creamy Concoction"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
