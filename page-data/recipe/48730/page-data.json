This is our top note and after testing it at multiple percentages all I can say is it just works at 2 percent. It just freaking works. Gives a nice soft caramel flavor reminiscent of brown butter to the mix. 2 percent might seem high to most but I just ask them to try it.\r\n\r\nCap Vanilla Custard is what really makes this ice cream and not gelato. This concentrate increases our steep time but also adds fresh yolks tempered in sugar lending a nice richness that is sorely needed in thick French ice cream.\r\n\r\nINW Shisha Vanilla adds sweetness; a nice complex and wonderful vanilla that compliments our caramel and brings the mix to a whole new level.\r\n\r\nHS French Vanilla Ice Cream is our soft slow-cooked buttery note with a nice slightly cold ice cream flavor. It has unparalleled richness so we must use it low. This also increases our steep time but it's worth it.\r\n\r\nFLV Cream works as an emulsifier for the creams and a nice soft background creamy note that doesn't mute or lower our flavor ceiling. Truly an amazing concentrate. Also, I can't stress enough how well this and fresh cream work together.\r\n\r\nFA Cream Fresh is the dairy brother of flv cream, This is our half and half unpasteurized and a necessary ingredient in our ice cream.\r\n\r\n\r\nFull write-up of the process behind this recipe can be found on diyordievaping.com\r\nYou can find Jerry's version here: https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/46554\r\nTRY IT!

I took a couple rips and instantly loaded it up in my squonker (reserved only for recipes I plan on vaping a lot). I'm a huge fan of that deep, buttery richness. So well balanced. The caramel gives of that almost burnt sugar note that really catapults this recipe into awesomeness. Great job shyndo!"},{"user":"Rawtune","text":"Didn't know what to expect, but damn this is awesome. 2 weeks in and so balanced and perfect caramel creaminess"},{"user":"CygnusY1","text":"One of my favourite mixers at the moment and a really sound guy. Excellent recipe. "},{"user":"mlNikon","text":"Just mixed this up so it hasn't steeped but it is very tasty. Very well balanced sir, well done."},{"user":"MrBurgundy","text":"Thick, nuanced brown butter ice cream. Shyndo nailed this one. I thoroughly enjoyed this fresh, but over the course of two weeks it has solidified into an absolute treat. The sweet, almost tangy caramel is backed up by a rich vanilla ice cream. The FLV Cream really emulsifies everything together through the steep. Such a good call. It isn't overbearingly sweet; I can vape it all day long. This is a definite keeper. I'll be mixing a major stash. Thanks for sharing, Shyndo. Very well done, my friend."},{"user":"Billywilly","text":"Only 2 days into curing and I really enjoy this.
