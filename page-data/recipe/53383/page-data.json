Watermelon just seems to take us all back to our childhood memories of July 4th BBQ's and fireworks. \r\n\r\nWatermelon; that crisp, refreshing sweetness of summer that we all enjoy. Whether you enjoy putting salt on it or eat it without, it's that part of Summer we all look forward to.\r\n\r\nWatermelon as a flavoring generally seems to deliver a sweet candied watermelon or a more authentic mildly sweet watermelon. I'm not a big fan of candy vapes, so I decided to create a more authentic watermelon profile. I have only made 1 other watermelon profile and to be honest, was not that pleased with the result and the fact that I only have 2 watermelon flavors, TPA Watermelon and LA Watermelon, I felt I had to choose from the lesser of two evils when it came to these flavors. However, the result is quite nice. \r\n\r\nTPA Watermelon\r\nI chose to use this over LA watermelon because the LA watermelon seemed to be more of an artificial candy watermelon. TPA seemed to be the best choice as the base to this recipe.\r\n\r\nTPA Apple\r\nI nice subtle, not tart, apple to build a crispness into the watermelon base\r\n\r\nCAP Kiwi\r\nKiwi at 1% seems to add brightness to this recipe without overtaking the watermelon. \r\n\r\nLA Cotton Candy\r\nI had considered using CAP Super Sweet but thought that cotton candy (Ethyl Maltol) would be a bit better in that SS seems to make the over-all juice sweet and EM seems to just make the fruits sweeter and that was what I was going for.\r\n\r\nThe end result, a crisp, refreshing summer vape. I suggest letting it steep for just a couple days to get the best flavor from this recipe. Enjoy :)\r\n","steep_days":"2 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"total_reviews":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T20:32:06.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"5147","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Apple","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Cotton Candy","vendor":"LA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Kiwi","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Watermelon","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":3500}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"53383","name":"Watermelon Smack #DiyorDieWeekendAssignment"}}}
