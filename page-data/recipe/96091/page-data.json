So I can not speak on its authenticity. This is weird &amp; different. I would of never thought of pairing figs and brie cheese in a vape liquid, but it works. This does however border on being too sweet for me, and I know it was only used at 0.2% but I am not getting any black pepper notes. Looking at the ingredients you used that is the only one i can’t pick up on. The fig, honey, and apple pair well together. The cheese and cream make it really creamy and give it some body to the mouthfeel. All and all this was an enjoyable vape for me and makes me want to add Brie Cheese to my ever growing flavor collection. &#xD;\n","score":4},{"user":"ID10-T","text":"Really jumped into that April Fool's theme with both feet, huh?&#xD;\n&#xD;\nDespite the gross name, I actually liked it, but it's still pretty weird. My first impression was that this tastes like prune juice with chunks of creamy cheese and some honey in it. That impression hasn't changed much after vaping more of it and trying to dissect it, but it's nowhere near as bad as that sounds, actually pretty enjoyable. I get the honey, especially in the finish and aftertaste, but the combination of fig and apple up top, along with honey that makes an appearance there, really gives me a prune juice effect. It's very sweet, and what little pepper I get seems to help offset that, so it might be essential to this not becoming yucky - becoming too musty and sweet at the same time - I don't know. It seems out of sorts with the rest here, just making it all to busy. I wonder what it would be like without the Black Pepper and without the Super Sweet. Would you still get that lingering honey sweetness or does it require the Super Sweet to do that? If this could work without the Super Sweet, it might not need the Pepper. If it relies on it for the honey to work, then maybe it does need both, and it just is what it is. The creamy cheese underneath is working, I like it.It does taste like Brie, and I love Brie with fruit and have no issue with vaping it when it's well-done like this. I want a baked brie and cranberry vape now, someone needs to make that for me because as badly as I want it, I equally don't also want to vape failed attempts at it.","score":4}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"96091","name":"Musty Toe Cheese"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
