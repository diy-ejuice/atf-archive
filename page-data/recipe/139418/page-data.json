As I like to mix with much lower %'s. So I knew I wanted to use flavors that were just stronger more vibrant flavors and what better flavor combo for that than Watermelon Lemonade. \r\nI'm not a huge fan of Koolada so I went super low with it in this mix but it worked out wonderfully for me. It gives that slight cool icy feeling on the back of my throat and my teeth on the exhale just like When you take a big ICE COLD Drink. The watermelon and mix of lemons are really well balanced in this IMO. Watermelon upfront and tart/sweet lemonade on the back end followed by that cool bite from the koolada. It is sweet but not overly sweet which is how I prefer my mixes to be (just sweet enough). Over all I think this mix turned out just Lovely. \r\nI let it steep for 3 days before trying it, 3rd day it was really good and smoothed out each day after.\r\n Give it a mix and let me know what you think..","steep_days":"4","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"total_reviews":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-05T15:44:05.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"1207","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Juicy Lemon","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":500},{"name":"Lemon","vendor":"FE","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Lemonade","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Watermelon","vendor":"LA","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Watermelon","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":500},{"name":"Wild Melon","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1250},{"name":"Sweetness","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":500},{"name":"Koolada 10 Pg","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":250}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"139418","name":"Water-Made"}}}
