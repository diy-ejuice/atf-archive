After mixing I wasn't really all that impressed with the outcome. The chocolate wasn't quite there and I wasn't getting much caramel notes. The nuts &amp; nougat were pretty on point though. Then after a few weeks of steeping... I was still kinda disappointed. I think they really tried there best with this profile but it doesn't quite measure up in my opinion. Nice attempt though seriously. This is a really challenging profile."},{"user":"V1rus","text":""},{"user":"Clearkill","text":"Yeah this is a very tasty vape after it steeps, five stars for flavor. It's dark and gooey with a nutty overtone. Three stars for false advertising, it tastes nothing like a Snickers bar."},{"user":"gravi-tea","text":"the mix is dry i think its the chocolate but i was really hoping this would be a home run its chocolatey cream with caramel but hardly any nuts noticeable good try though"},{"user":"Cumulonimbus","text":"i bought the flavors i didnt have just so that i could make this recipe for husband, hes a die hard snickers lover and he instantly fell in love! great job! its not exactly an adv for me, but it has grown on me and he's the main reason i made it anyway. job well done.
