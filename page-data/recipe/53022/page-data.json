It tastes like a papaya limeade and that's it. Great when you need something different. A very refreshing summer  vape. You probably can shake and vape but I honestly didn't try it on a shake I made a bunch of stuff and was pleasantly surprised out how awesome this turned out. Let me know what you think in the reviews.","steep_days":"3","temperature":"420","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T00:07:21.000-05:00","best_vg":"75%","views":"1398","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Papaya Punch","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":750},{"name":"Lime","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":400},{"name":"Lime Wedge","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":250},{"name":"Lemonade","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Sweetness","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":250}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"53022","name":"Papaya limeade"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
