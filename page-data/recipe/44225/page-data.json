This is a light chai to highlight the sweet creamy papaya and orange.\r\n\r\nI serve this with a couple toasted marshmallows to stir in and melt to brighten the papaya and lighten the spices for a wonderful summer night experience.\r\n\r\nEnjoy","steep_days":"7 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-06T20:10:13.000-05:00","best_vg":"80%","views":"1370","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Papaya","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Chai Tea","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Bavarian Cream","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Orange Cream","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Toasted Marshmallow","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1300},{"name":"Horchata Smooth","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Anise","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":300}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"44225","name":"Papaya Chai Tea (Light)"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
