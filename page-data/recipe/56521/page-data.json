This recipe is an example of simplicity at it's finest. For a recipe to be good, it doesn't have to be complex. In fact, I've found that the simpler the recipe, for the most part, the better the recipe is for picking up on all the different layers in the mix. Too many flavorings can muddy or mute the over-all recipe.\r\nLemon Baker's Delight is a moist lemon cake with hints of vanilla on the inhale and finishes with a nice toasted marshmallow on the exhale. Not much more to say about the profile except, that's it is delicious! \r\nCan be a shake and vape, but is best after a 3 day steep.\r\nVisit Freedom To Mix on Discord https://discord.gg/SmSc8Ef\r\nVisit Freedom To Mix on FaceBook https://www.facebook.com/groups/415341418920740/ \r\n\r\nPlease comment, mix, and or rate,....it makes us all better mixers.

I didn't get a lot of cake from my mix, but that's my own fault...I subbed JF yellow cake and didn't up the percentage in the mix.  I rarely ever mix anything twice, but I enjoyed this enough that I'm giving it another go with the cake bumped up a good bit."},{"user":"shyndo","score":"5","text":"REALLY REALLY good simple lemon recipe. Well balanced, creamy cakey lemon that just hits the spot. Easy to mix, easy to run out of! If you don't have FE lemon I implore you to get it as this is a perfect example of its wonderful superiority!"}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"56521","name":"Lemon Baker's Delight"}}}
