It has that nice green tea on the back and I would describe it as being creamy upfront with a pleasant powder finish. I finished 30 ml in a day. Personally I think a 10 day steep is enough. But really give this one a try!"},{"user":"AutomaticFailure","text":"Honestly, I was kind of skeptical of this recipe. I figured with so much cream flavors that it wouldn't taste that great off a shake. Oh boy was I wrong! This is a super creamy mix with a hint of green tea and a backend of crispness. I personally think that you could do without some of the creams and condense it down some, but as it is now, this is pretty great.
