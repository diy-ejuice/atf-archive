The resinous, piney flavour, inherent to the Juniper berry, is wonderfully balanced by citrus peel and a smidgen of spiciness from freshly ground peppercorns. There is a wondrous  boozy element to the flavour which rounds the profile off expertly. The 'booziness' is not overwhelming in the least but rather augments the authenticity  & overall Gin experience. I see this as the best bits of FA Fin and FM Pure Gin combined to create a well rounded & balanced Gin.\r\n\r\nFLV Rose Essence brings a delicate, true rose, sophistication to the mix and softens the gin ever so slightly. This is a very \"safe\" rose flavour compared to other overpowering versions, and will not kill your mix, if used with care.  At 2% it brings a semi-rose tinge without being floral, nor does it hinder the Gin to shine. The TPA Rose Candy assists the FLV Rose Essene to punch through the Gin foundation, which can restrict other flavors to shine. In addition, this adds a splash of sweetness to a relatively dry Gin. \r\n\r\nFLV Citrus Soda brings a new level of an authentic lemonade/Sprite type flavor to the market. This is a fresh lemon and lime base with a touch of fizziness to perfectly emulate a Sprite like mixer. This is a more dynamic version of FLV Lemonade as it has more pronounced fresh lemon and lime notes. This acts as the mixer base and assists in \"moisturising'  the gin.\r\n\r\nCAP Cucumber fulfills two roles here: Firstly, it provides some juiciness to mix without detraction. INW Cactus does this slightly better but it imparts an unwelcome flavour in this melange. Secondly, the subtle cucumber flavor adds another flavor dimension/layer which concludes the overall profile with an intriguing little twist. I found 2.5% to be aptly enough but it can be  increased to around 4% for a more pronounced cucumber taste.\r\n\r\nWS23/Koolada is optional at .50 to provide an icy feel.\r\n\r\nGive this one at least 3 days to settle down...","steep_days":"3","temperature":"0","recipe_score":4,"total_reviews":1,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:50:44.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"929","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Juniper Gin","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Citrus Soda","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Rose Essence","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Rose Candy","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Cucumber","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":2500}],"reviews":[{"user":"ID10-T","score":"4","text":"&#xD;\nA little throaty - but not unexpected or even necessarily unwanted - I mean, you’re vaping gin, right? I think it does a pretty bang-up job of hitting the profile, except that the CAP Cucumber is getting lost in this blast of juniper and rose and citrus soda. I even get all the nuances of that Juniper Gin, which is a really excellent pairing with rose, but the cucumber is just overwhelmed. I don’t know if it needs more cucumber, or maybe if FA Cucumber would have been a better choice. But the cucumber getting overwhelmed is hardly a reason to keep someone who wants to vape an interesting gin cocktail profile from loving it.   &#xD;\n"}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"139102","name":"Layerz Pink Gin"}}}
