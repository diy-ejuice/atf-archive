As much as I enjoyed it with CAP Cinnamon Danish Swirl, FLV is the King of cinnamons so I wanted to introduce some of them to this pairing. \r\n\r\nInitially I went with Rich Cinnamon, which was good but balancing it was quite difficult. I had also tried FLV Red Apple in here as I would have liked a darker and softer apple with the Cavendish and Fig. Upon smelling FLV's Apple Filling, it immediately struck me as a blend of Rich Cinnamon and Red Apple; while this does seem to be the case, the balance on the two is incredible, making this task easy. With a softer rounder apple, the Strawberry ripe becomes less of a necessity to soften the edges of the recipe, and with the cinnamon in Apple Filling being less invasive than Cinnamon Danish Swirl, the Strawberry flavor is more pronounced as well. \r\n\r\n[Just a revisit of one of my favorites](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/15900#autumn_sunset_by_cheebasteeba). Hope you enjoy as much as I do!
