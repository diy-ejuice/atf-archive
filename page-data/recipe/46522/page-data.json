If you shake and vape it has pineapple up front but not over running the shake if you let it sit a day or two it comes together nicely. The cotton candy is just to sweeten I recommend it but is up to you . I hope you enjoy this one I know I do ","steep_days":"2 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:49:19.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"3284","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Bavarian Cream","flavor_id":"145","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Cheesecake (graham Crust)","flavor_id":"152","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Meringue","flavor_id":"530","vendor":"FA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Brown Sugar","flavor_id":"313","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Banana Cream","flavor_id":"916","vendor":"LA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Golden Pineapple","flavor_id":"61","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":4500},{"name":"Pineapple","flavor_id":"809","vendor":"INW","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Cotton Candy","flavor_id":"319","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1000}],"reviews":[{"user":"lococarnage","text":"Great recipe.
