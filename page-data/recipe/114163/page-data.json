I adore FW Butter Pecan and Graham Cracker but wanted to see if I could boost them both a bit using OOO Butter Pecan and CAP Graham Cracker (which has a light bakery cinnamon note that plays well with the butter pecan and bourbon) respectively.  I did the same with TFA Kentucky Bourbon and VT Bourbon . . . a proven pairing that works.\r\n\r\nI used DIYFS Holy Holy Grail to boost the caramelized syrup of the two Butter Pecans (it is, in my opinion, a stellar caramel, and the touch of tobacco brings a nutty, earthy accent to help, both, the graham and the pecan aspects).  Having attempted a graham forward recipe in the past, I wanted to round out the edges with a creamy custard, turning to the buttery, smooth FA Custard Premium to achieve that feat.\r\n\r\nMixed it 60vg/40pg and enjoyed it last night with several sips of whiskey . . . it was also an excellent complement to coffee this morning.  After a full week with 5th graders, whose minds are still firmly fixed on summer-mode, it was a much needed respite from the chaos.
