Is this guy even serious? Well, one word: yessiree! When I first started with this mad combination, I was intrigued by the absurdness of the concept but it turned out, to coin a phrase,  absolutely fabulous! The sweet, runty banana notes are kept in place and stunningly enhanced by the contrasting cactus, resulting in a one of a kind flavour combonation... \r\n\r\nThe banana combo is compliments of @Tootall and is, by far, the best banana combo around. The distinctive ‘fake banana’ FLV, with its natural, ripe banana creaminess blends perfectly with the equally ripe and runty WF Banana Puree to create a decadent banana ‘pudding’.\r\n\r\nINW Cactus is such an intriguing flavour that it just fits here as if it was meant to be paired with banana all this time! The inherent, albeit slight, hints of pear and citrus is the perfect companion to blend with the banana base. INW has noted that Cactus pairs well with banana and a few recipes are about, so this is not a total hairball idea...\r\n\r\nThis is good off the shake.","steep_days":"1 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"updated_at":"2020-12-12T11:52:38.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"2178","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Banana","flavor_id":"603","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":750},{"name":"Banana Purée","flavor_id":"6042","vendor":"WF","millipercent":1250},{"name":"Cactus","flavor_id":"647","vendor":"INW","millipercent":1000}],"reviews":[{"user":"Skywxp3d","text":"I’m back to mix this again, that says a lot right there - might try a few different banana flavors for fun here!

I've been getting bored with my adv and I think you might have given me the interesting change I needed. Thank you and good work! Its not easy to find off the wall flavor combos that work","score":5},{"user":"Borninfire138","text":"Fucking legit. Also tried replacing WF Banana Purèe with LA Banana Cream @ 4.5 with great results. Great candy banana flavor with tons of mouth feel. Nice and wet. Ive never used cactus more than a drop here and there. Really surprised that this worked. &#xD;\n&#xD;\nBorn.
