This has a lot of layering trying to get to that oatmeal cookie, and this is as close as I've come to hitting it. \r\n\r\nThe blueberry itself is a combo of FW Blueberry, WF Blueberry Jam, and FLV Jammy Berry . . . going for that close to cooked, jammed-up blueberry rather than ripe blueberry.  \r\n\r\nThe cookie is the real beast here.  The star of the show being, in my opinion, JF Cookie V2.  It is, hands down, my favorite cookie. There are a lot of other moving parts here layered atop one another trying to reach oatmeal cookie heaven.  0.25% FLV Granola still shines through without dominating the mix like a higher percentage would . . . that stuff is a bully in a mix.  \r\n\r\nI know these overly-complex recipes are not everyone's cup of tea . . . but this has been such a long-sought-after pursuit.  I felt compelled to share it.  If you mix it, I hope you enjoy it!","steep_days":"1 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T19:16:17.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"1164","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Blueberry Jam SC","flavor_id":"10115","vendor":"WF","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Cookie V2","flavor_id":"9322","vendor":"JF","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Butter","flavor_id":"494","vendor":"FA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Jammy Berry","flavor_id":"10150","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":250},{"name":"Blueberry","flavor_id":"1201","vendor":"FW","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Graham Cracker","flavor_id":"1297","vendor":"FW","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Hazelnut","flavor_id":"1312","vendor":"FW","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Oatmeal Cookie â€“ SC","flavor_id":"7522","vendor":"RF","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Granola","flavor_id":"8555","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":250},{"name":"Sugar Cookie","flavor_id":"115","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Cinnamon Crunch","flavor_id":"611","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Sweetener","flavor_id":"1432","vendor":"FW","millipercent":500}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"174024","name":"Am I Blue?
