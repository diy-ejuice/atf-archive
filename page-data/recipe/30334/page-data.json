I have never tried the original but I have been vaping this  flavor of mine for 4 months and Iit never gets old I usually make a 120ml  bottle and never make a flavor again but with tgis one I have probably made over 1000ml granted my wife and all my friends love it too but that's jusr what I made for me and my wifeI have made three times that amountfor my friends lol. I would say the flavors are self exsplanitory. It is good as a shake and vape and is probably 100% after 2 days. This is a very tasty mix don't be scared give it a try!!!! $$$$$","steep_days":"2 (SNV)","temperature":"","recipe_score":4,"updated_at":"2020-12-12T20:28:52.000-05:00","best_vg":"75%","views":"2801","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Kettle Corn","flavor_id":"329","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":7500},{"name":"Strawberry (ripe)","flavor_id":"271","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":5000},{"name":"Creamy Yogurt","flavor_id":"5","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Cotton Candy","flavor_id":"319","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1000}],"reviews":[{"user":"ID10-T","text":"I love this idea, but the execution seems to have quite a bit of improvement. The strawberry could be a little less ripe and a little more candied - like the artificial strawberry I would expect from that strawberry yogurt coating, and the popcorn flavor is there but a little buried under the strawberry yogurt. The texture is lacking. Besides changing the strawberry, I’d try backing up the popcorn with a little CAP Cereal 27 or something like that to crunch it up a bit.

The kettle corn and sb ripe work really well together and the creamy yogurt makes everything nice and creamy ","score":5}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"30334","name":"Popcorn man"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
