RF (SC) Apple smells just like a candy apple flavor, so it was the prefect choice here!  TFA bubble gum is a great straight up pink bubble gum flavor, it makes up the inside of the green apple sucker. CAP Super Sweet helps make that Apple pop and sweetens the mix perfectly  ! Shout out to AKA Krucial (Barrett) as we were hanging out one evening and checking out some of my new flavorings that I hadn't really played with yet, and I let him smell RF Apple and right away he said to me that smells like a perfect candy apple, and that it would make a great Blowpop. So I took that and ran with it. Here's we're I arrived at.. Go mix it up and leave your feedback!!!!!! Thanks !!! SK!!!!!!
