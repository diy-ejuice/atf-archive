I’ve learned the secret ingredient.Its Chemnovatic flavors. Lemon Cream Wafer at 3.5%. This flavor is not listed on all the flavors yet. But it’s the key ingredient in it. The other flavors are just the help it needs. It’s good off the shake but after 4 days you really start to taste everything. I’m not sure if it’s going to allow me to save a flavor it doesn’t have yet. So YOU MUST READ THIS for this recipe to work. So take out the lemon cream and switch it to the lemon cream wafer.","steep_days":"4","temperature":"0","recipe_score":4,"updated_at":"2020-12-12T14:08:02.000-05:00","best_vg":"75%","views":"2243","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Super Sweet","flavor_id":"2384","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Cheesecake (graham Crust)","flavor_id":"152","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Bavarian Cream SC","flavor_id":"10404","vendor":"WF","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Cookie Butter SC","flavor_id":"10406","vendor":"WF","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Meringue","flavor_id":"176","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Almond Cookie SC","flavor_id":"9013","vendor":"WF","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Lemon Squares SC","flavor_id":"10263","vendor":"WF","millipercent":1750},{"name":"Lémon Cream","flavor_id":"5749","vendor":"SA","millipercent":3500}],"reviews":[{"user":"MotherPunker","text":"its good but no, not quite there, needs CMN lemon.  THAT is the bright and light complex lemon that everyone has been looking for.  As soon as I opened it and smelt it, was like oh ya.... that's what you smell when you smell lemon tart, fresh like opening a window on a spring day.  It almost even smells buttery all on its own which is weird and confusing but man I can't stop smelling it. ","score":4},{"user":"s2k","text":"This looks really good!
