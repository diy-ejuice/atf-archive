The fancy label and booth babes are in your mind.\r\n\r\nSpecial shoutout to Flavorah and Liquid Barn for putting together the DIY Extravaganza at the Vegas Vape Expo.  Mixers were breaking down DIY for attendees.  This recipe was my attempt to create a quick, tasty, and \"commercial\" vape juice right in front of people on the fence about trying DIY.\r\n\r\nAs a \"simple\" juice, this is mostly about bolstering a single flavor into a fuller vape.  Luckily, CAP Green Apple Hard Candy really doesn't need all that much help.  It's a green apple jolly rancher, full stop.  I don't get any of the acetone off-notes present in a lot of green apple concentrates here.  It's almost perfect for a sweet, sticky and slighty warm hard candy vape.  It's a simple profile, but executed really well.  This recipe was specifically formulated to 16% to work with the liquid barn basic bottles, so the 12% is a bit arbitrary, but it works well there.  \r\n\r\nFLV Sour Apple brings in some support.  It's another green apple candy flavor, but it isn't quite as full and sweet.  The \"Sour\" part is pretty great though, and it just provides a bit of punch to keep the jolly rancher from building into something too sticky and cloying.  Most \"sours\" aren't all that tart and the malic acid will gradually eat at the flavors underneath, hollowing out your juice.  FLV Sour Apple doesn't seem to mute nearly as bad over the long term, and it really helps to set off the CAP.  3% of this flavor is a lot, but we're not in overflavoring territory and the CAP GAHC soaks it all up.\r\n\r\nAnd Capella Super Sweet, well, it's a sweetener.  The acids there seem to help further enliven candies and this is pretty much the perfect place for it.  1% is a bit high for a DIY recipe, but it's still on the low end for \"commercial\" stuff.  It's also a candy recipe, soooooooooo.....  But whatever, use as much or as little as you like.  It's DIY.  If Super Sweet is a bit harsh for you, then try FW Sweetener at 2 or even 3% for a comparable level of sweetness.  This isn't the recipe for TPA or EM, and the muting with those options is probably detrimental with any kind of steep.  I feel like you actually want a bit of bite with all that sweetness.\r\n\r\nCan you add cooling? Yes, it's DIY.  The recipe will work fine with it.  Stick with a neutral coolant instead of something like menthol.  I like .5% of 30% WS-23.  You can go as cold as you want though.  1% will be \"icy.\"  2% will be brutal.  Again, it's DIY.\r\n\r\nSo there you go, this was actually relatively popular with the people I talked to, and I hope it's a pretty good illustration of how easy DIY can be if you stay out of the way of the flavors and just want to vape something that tastes good.    For just 2 flavors and some sweetener, you get a good balance of sweetness, tartness, and depth of flavor.  The level of flavor may be a bit obnoxious, but that's the point.  You could make this more complex or less overwhelming, but I wanted to target an audience of people that were not already invested in the community.    \r\n\r\nI'll get back to 10 flavor existential nightmares soon enough, but I thought this might be worth sharing.  As much as I enjoy the nerdier side of mixing, the show was a good reminder that DIY can be a bigger tent and I need to do something to help make it one.\r\n\r\nAlso, Shyndo came up with the name.  I'm not sure if the DIY snobs or the juice line goons are Camp Tigerclaw in this scenario, but it's a cool ass name and sometimes that is enough.  BIG TENT.","steep_days":"3 (SNV)","temperature":"450","recipe_score":5,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:50:33.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"25717","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Green Apple Hard Candy","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":12000},{"name":"Sour Apple","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Super Sweet","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1000}],"reviews":[{"user":"Sebastien","text":"Simple and delicious!

It's a new ADV for me. Thanks for introducing me to my first \"candy\" vape."},{"user":"mdharris0207","text":"I get a really soapy flavor from this, not to be a hater but this mix is just unbearable. I have tried it off the shake and then 3 days in, a week, 2 weeks, and a month. It is awful to me, maybe something to do with my palette. "},{"user":"kitu5","text":"Okay, wow. This is a brilliantly simple mix I could easily see finding in any store. The Sour Apple gives a very realistic texture and taste. Mixing that with the Green Apple Candy makes this a perfect blend between candy-like and authentic as hell. And the level of sweetener makes this hit commercial grade without being cloyingly sweet. And I could see where putting this \"on ice\" would be brilliant. Total ADV. &#xD;\n&#xD;\nCrushed the hell out of this, man!"},{"user":"Djuna","text":"This is so simple, and so soooo good.  Mixed up 80 mls yesterday, and split half the batch with a buddy. I literally just messaged him to tell him how goshdarn delicious this stuff is and to get it in his squonk mod asap. Everything in this recipe is on point, and I'll be mixing more of it. Lots more.   "},{"user":"CriticalVape","text":"Very nice. A super-simple, commercial-grade recipe. Well done, as always. Everyone needs to try this. A super-juicy, apple explosion in your face.&#xD;\n&#xD;\nAlso super excited to discover these two new flavors. Nothing better than a great recipe that also add usable items to your flavor stash. The FLV Sour Apple has an incredible aroma. It has a full, fleshy feel. Paired with the CAP GAHC it's beautiful. I've been playing around with percentages, but I think you hit the spot. I do like a bit more of the Sour Apple, usually around 3.5%-4%, but the original is outstanding, balanced. Reminiscent of old-school commercial mixes back when we were lean on available flavorings. Goes to show simple is sometimes the best route. It's become somewhat taboo to see such a high percentage as 12, but with certain flavors, that's where they have to be. Especially with some CAP and most FW. Kudos, Sir, and thank you!"},{"user":"MrBurgundy","text":"This is a tremendous recipe. It‚Äôs simple, straightforward, and it packs a punch. The apple flavor is bright and sweet. It‚Äôs very reminiscent of a jolly rancher. FLV Sour Apple cranks the tartness up while also adding a subtle peel note. I dropped Super Sweet to 0.5%, but I understand why it was at 1%. Anyway, this is a really enjoyable fruity candy mix. Thanks for sharing, Rick!"},{"user":"MECH_MOD_RN","text":"LOVE this   - I am a huge fan  of simple mixes that give you full on flavor from time to time   and this is it .. great in an pod, RTA ..  add a touch of   WS 23  and loving it    THanks"},{"user":"dougc","text":"This is a great recipe, simple and very tasty.
