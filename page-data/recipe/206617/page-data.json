A nice natural cheesecake base smothered with a strawberry compote with pieces of strawberry mixed into the sauce.\r\n\r\nCheesecake base: WF Strawberry Cheesecake, CAP NY Cheesecake, FW Graham Cracker\r\n\r\nStrawberry 🍓 Compote: WF Strawberry Gummy Candy (the syrup), FA Juicy Strawberry, TPA Strawberry Ripe (provides the fresh strawberry pieces) \r\n\r\nGive it a mix & let me know what you think 🧐 3 days is enough for it to meld but I'm sure it'll only get better with more time...🤤🤤🤤 Sweetener is a necessity for me but feel free to add or remove your own... Hope y'all enjoy it as much as I do!👊😃","steep_days":"5 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":4,"updated_at":"2020-12-12T18:31:01.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"1057","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Strawberry Cheesecake SC","flavor_id":"10413","vendor":"WF","millipercent":4000},{"name":"New York Cheesecake","flavor_id":"90","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Strawberry (ripe)","flavor_id":"271","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Juicy Strawberry","flavor_id":"8779","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Strawberry Gummy Candy SC","flavor_id":"10097","vendor":"WF","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Super Sweet","flavor_id":"2384","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":500},{"name":"Graham Cracker","flavor_id":"1297","vendor":"FW","millipercent":2000}],"reviews":[{"user":"Microbe","text":"Very nice after just 2 days.
