SF testing JF Honey Peach I knew it only needed a nudge to make it tea, it has some herbal notes in the back ground leaning towards tea already. FLV Lemon Tea I picked up recently and hadn't really had time to SF test but I had high hopes and it worked out well. I did try laying a few flavors but its actually fairly complex as it is, JF Honey Peach has a lot going on without anything else added. \r\n\r\nIf you want to cool this off I suggest .5% FA Polar Blast or 1.5% Delosi Ice. WS-23 has an off note that gets weird here.\r\n\r\nOver night steep recommended. You can SNV but its a little bland at first.\r\n","steep_days":"1","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-05T06:47:44.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"990","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Honey Peach","flavor_id":"4561","vendor":"JF","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Lemon Tea","flavor_id":"3515","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Super Sweet","flavor_id":"2384","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":500}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"77531","name":"Peach T"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
