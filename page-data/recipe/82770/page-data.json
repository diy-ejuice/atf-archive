Wanted to do a red and green cream I was thinking Strawberry lime but the limitations really affected my ability to use lime. So it turned into a strawberry cream with a kiss of lemon.","steep_days":"3 (SNV)","temperature":"421","recipe_score":3,"updated_at":"2020-12-12T10:14:57.000-05:00","best_vg":"69%","views":"1928","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Lemon Meringue Pie","flavor_id":"84","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Custard","flavor_id":"484","vendor":"FA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Red Touch (strawberry)","flavor_id":"421","vendor":"FA","millipercent":3000},{"name":"New York Cheesecake","flavor_id":"90","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":3000}],"reviews":[{"user":"QueerYourVape","text":"This was a test for me to see if I can taste FA Red Touch. Answer is, I can't. What I get is a very biscuit-y lemon meringue pie. Simple, not bad, totally missing the point for me, and that's on me.

Anyway, not my thing at all.","score":3}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"82770","name":"Touched by light"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
