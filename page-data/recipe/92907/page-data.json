Once its layered and stirred together you take it and smooth it out in a baking dish and then sprinkle toffee chunks on as stopping kind of and then stick the dish in the freezer for a couple hour. When your ready pull it out cut into squares and serve.\r\n\r\nWhat I did and why I did it:\r\nOverall this is a simple mix that is delicious in my opinion. The angel food cake was achieved using fw white cake. I feel that fw white cakeis an exact Angel food cake now it misses the profile for white cake because its obviously an angel food cake. Its kind of spooky how much it emulates an angel food cake in flavor and in texture. Now my toffee and cool whip layers get interesting. Ifeel like whipped marshmallow by capella gives me that cool whip type texture and even a slight vanilla creaminess with a little extra help in the cream department I feel whipped marshmallow becomes a perfect cool whip layer. For my extra help in the cream department I used a brand new purchase in the toffee ice cream by vape train. Toffee ice cream by vape  train is a great really thick buttery cream\r\nThe ice part is a matter of suggestion and the toffee is very slight and I think it . could easily be masked with a little vanilla and creams to create a thick buttery ice cream but that's not what I am doing here. But I will be trying that next I almost think fruits could be added to toffee ice cream but again that's to be continued I just really \r\nLike its thick buttery style of ice cream its what I look for in a ice cream Vape and I think this is a great way to get that buttery thick ice cream that I love. Back to my recipe the cream from toffee ice cream turns the whipped marshmallow all the way into cool whip and the slight toffee notes and butteriness help the toffee chunk layer. The last part to this delicious dessert is the buttered toffee chunks. I used Flavorah toffee at a low .50%  that mixed with the toffee  and the butteriness from the toffee ice cream creates a perfect buttered toffee layer.\r\n\r\nSweetener:\r\nSweeten don't sweeten its totally your call??? This recipe is sweet without sweetener but I still used .25% Flavorah sweetness but feel free to use a sweetener of your choice.","steep_days":"5","temperature":"420","recipe_score":4,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:50:02.000-05:00","best_vg":"75%","views":"2268","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Cake (White)","flavor_id":"8470","vendor":"FW","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Toffee Ice Cream","flavor_id":"8987","vendor":"VT","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Whipped Marshmallow","flavor_id":"8744","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Toffee","flavor_id":"4425","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":500}],"reviews":[{"user":"chief63","text":"Pretty tasty!
