I've mixed it many times since then, both for myself and others. I've tried it with Forrest Fruit at 2%, 3%, 3.5% and 4%; I found 3.5% to be the best concentration for me. Great in wattage, amazing in TC. The only reason i'm not giving 5 stars is I get an distracting off note every once in a while - I think its the marshmallow. Kind of caramellic/burnt sugar.&#xD;\nVery good stuff, thanks for sharing. ","score":4},{"user":"NikosD","text":"Very pleasant flavour and a brake from what I have been vaping the last 2-3 months. Great if you also consider the simplicity of this.","score":5},{"user":"YippYo","text":"Not really a fan of this recipe unfortunately. I get a really strong &#xD;\ncinnamon off-note that I think is probably from the Marshmallow. Maybe it's just me that gets this note but it really overpowers the other flavors. I also don't get much berry in this recipe. Could be that my setup isn't ideal but it's a 2x Tricore Clapton in the BTFC.&#xD;\n&#xD;\nEdit: After another week or so of steeping the berry was more pronounced but still kinda hidden behind the cream. The off-note subsided to some degree but I still found it present.","score":3},{"user":"Echodub","text":"i'm chiming in with others, it's a simple but delicious recipe. well done!","score":5},{"user":"ObiWanCannoli","text":"Not much to say here. Its simple, well balanced and to the point. Great off the bat but better after a few days. Nice when you need something quick to mix up thats full of flavor and easy on the wallet. I like a bit more berry so I bumped up FF to 3%. Just go ahead and mix this up!

Sometimes less is more, and this recipe is a great example of that.  Seems like some recipes are unnecessarily overly complicated, it's nice to have a great recipe that is super easy to whip up a big batch.

I like it best after a 3 week steep.","score":5},{"user":"Steevsta","text":"Great simple recipe nice creamy fruit blend !","score":5},{"user":"Dalpho","text":"Very simple and tasty berry and cream profile. For those wondering this is enough flavor for the forest fruit at 2% I was so surprised how much flavor it has for being such a low % over all. Just start at 2% you will see, I mixed this at Max VG, dual claptons SS on a tsunami if that helps. I highly recommend this juice.","score":5},{"user":"RuntDastardly","text":"LOVE this! Mixed exactly as posted before listening to my urges to add more Forest Fruit, and am glad I did. Packs a perfect amount of flavor into that little 5%! Beautiful, simple recipe!","score":5}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"7840","name":"Berry Creamy"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
