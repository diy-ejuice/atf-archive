The ice cream base is super rich buttery and creamy. The blackberry and strawberry blend together the give a lovely dark berry vibe. Excellent job and thanks for sharing.

The ice cream is delicious, and I love how the strawberry takes a little of the bitterness out of the blackberry.","score":4},{"user":"BCrunk","text":"Pretty nice, my dude. You're right about the strawberry rounding out the blackberry into something great.","score":5},{"user":"dwinans","text":"","score":4},{"user":"lolwtf","text":"This shit is delicious.  Really hits the spot for me. Thanks bro. ","score":5},{"user":"LocoMojo","text":"Shockingly delicious! The EM from the Strawberry Ripe helps to round the blackberry bitterness out a bit and what's left of the bitter blackberry  works in tandem with the creamy vanilla ice cream to create this uniquely flavorful vape. I'm very surprised that this recipe has not gotten more love! It may be a little outside the comfort zone for some but I recommend everyone try it. I enjoyed it after 2 days steep but it really all comes together around day 5, with the blackberry (while still being slightly bitter and on top of the mix) chills a little and meshes with the steeped fullness of the VBIC. Definitely a great one!","score":5},{"user":"Chrisdvr1","text":"A particularly tasty ice cream Vape. I had to step out Blackberry for flavor art and cut the percentage in half. The strawberry definitely complements the Blackberry as stated above and the combination of vanilla ice creams is a great starting point for any ice cream.","score":5}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"10002","name":"Blackberry Ice Cream"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
