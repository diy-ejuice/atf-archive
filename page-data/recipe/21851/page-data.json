He used 5% of the Gingerbread by TFA which I think was waaaaayyyyy too much. I toned it down a shit ton, and I really like it. I also used /u/meanrockSD's idea of using chai tea for a more creamy, almost like a glaze of icing on the top of the cookie as well as Brown Sugar for a little more moisture and sweetness. It just fits really well. After tasting a longer steeped version, the Chai Tea is pretty distinct, and without the heavy gingerbread % I decided to just cut it out completely. The AP might be unnecessary, but I think it adds a little more breadiness to the whole thing.\r\n\r\nJF Bavarian Cream can be swapped at same % for TFA Bavarian Cream, it's just what I was working with.\r\n\r\nAn alternate version:\r\n\r\nAdd TFA Peppermint - .75%\r\nIncrease Gingerbread to 1.75%\r\nAdd LA Cream Cheese Icing - 1%\r\n\r\nFor a pepperminty Gingerbread!\r\n\r\nYou can S&V it, but it may have some balance issues, give it a few days and it should be nicely mixed and tasty!
