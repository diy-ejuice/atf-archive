I forgot why.\r\nSo I thought to myself \"enough is enough!\" and I made this with it.\r\n\r\nThe Crust:\r\n\r\nI decided the mixture of AP, INW biscuit and FA Apple Pie would make the perfect crust I was looking for and it has a sort of butteriness over this combo. And I really wanted you to taste the crust!\r\n\r\nThe Filling:\r\n\r\nDuh.. WF Butterscotch Cream Pie, which is helped on its way by INW Custard, FW Butterscotch Ripple and a little bit SS to make it disgustingly sweet.\r\nI find that WF Butterscotch Cream Pie has just about enough cream in it for me to get away not using a cream - although FW Butterscotch Ripple does give it a hand with that as well.\r\n\r\nEnd Notes:\r\n\r\nIt tastes pretty fatty, sweet and buttery. Makes me feel like a disgusting pig vaping this, but it's such a guilty pleasure really.\r\nGive it about 3 days steep and you're good to go.\r\n\r\nEnjoy!","steep_days":"3","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-06T04:11:59.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"1430","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Biscuit","flavor_id":"642","vendor":"INW","millipercent":500},{"name":"Acetyl Pyrazine 5%","flavor_id":"1709","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Butterscotch Cream Pie","flavor_id":"6045","vendor":"WF","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Custard","flavor_id":"4210","vendor":"INW","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Apple Pie","flavor_id":"551","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Super Sweet","flavor_id":"2384","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":250},{"name":"Butterscotch Ripple","flavor_id":"1217","vendor":"FW","millipercent":2000}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"157472","name":"Butterscotch Cream Pie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
