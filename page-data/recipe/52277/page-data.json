Looking for ideas to use HS Ginger (I love ginger), I came across [this culinary recipe](http://gnowfglins.com/2017/04/03/blackberry-ginger-peach-thm-e-rice-pudding/), which piqued my interest.  So I decided to make it into a vape. I went with an ice cream instead of a yogurt or rice pudding, mostly because this ice cream base, which I stole from Vurve, is easy and delicious and doesn't need a long steep.\r\n\r\nThis is a good ratio of FA Peach to FA White Peach for what I wanted to do.  HS Ginger, I've found, does a good job of toning down the floral (perfume-y?) notes in berries.  This amount of Ginger is necessary to taste it in this mix and it is really just a compliment.  As it sits, the whole thing really blends together nicely, no flavor is too distinct. \r\n\r\nLet me know what you think. Give it a day to steep.  Also, if you like sweetener like I do, 0.5% CAP Super Sweet hits the spot ","steep_days":"1 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T22:32:14.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"1135","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Blackberry","flavor_id":"214","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Ginger","flavor_id":"3513","vendor":"HS","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Peach","flavor_id":"542","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Peach White","flavor_id":"543","vendor":"FA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Creamy Coconut","flavor_id":"1264","vendor":"FW","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Ice Cream","flavor_id":"4449","vendor":"HS","millipercent":750},{"name":"Vanilla Bean Ice Cream","flavor_id":"186","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":3500}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"52277","name":"Blackberry Ginger & Peach Ice Cream"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
