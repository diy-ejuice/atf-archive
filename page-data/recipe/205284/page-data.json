It is FM Tobacco Bastards Cohiba **************************************************\r\n\r\nFM Cohiba is a strong cigar even at 3% (recommended use on the website is much higher). It gives a gritty mouth and is almost too authentic for me. So i decided to soften it a bit with vanilla for pipe and a little sweetness from ry4 double. Still very much cigar forward, it has a strong vanilla note with a sweeter finish. This was an attempt to make this flavor work after a poorly planned initial sft at 10% that had me ill like i vaped a real cigar. Designed, developed and approved by Frank, my barber, who said, \"It's the bomb\". Frank's a good guy and he likes cigars.\r\n\r\nTested mtl","steep_days":"10","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"total_reviews":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T17:36:32.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"340","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Cohiba","vendor":"SC","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Vanilla For Pipe","vendor":"INW","millipercent":1300},{"name":"Ry4 Double","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2000}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"205284","name":"Frank's vanilla cohiba"}}}
