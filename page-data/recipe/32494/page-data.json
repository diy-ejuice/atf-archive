A 4% the kiwi can shine amongst the rest of the mix. I wanted to use as much watermelon as possible before it became the only thing you could taste, so here at 6.5% its right (6% may be right but i was adjusting from trying it at 5% and 8% and settled on 6.5). The watermelon provides a candy effect and is the backbone of this recipe. Lower % and the watermelon falls too far behind the kiwi, too high and the watermelon is all you taste.\r\n\r\nThese two flavors alone are fantastic, very tart and sweet all at once. With just a little help they become even more delicious.\r\n\r\n**FA Red Touch (Strawberry)** is here to lend a little bit of its fruity sweetness to the kiwi and helps balance the overall kiwi profile. At .75% it won't show up as strawberry too much, but rather as friendly kiwi notes.\r\n\r\n**INW Cactus** adds some juicy which is what we want from candy, the cactus is also an inherently sweet aroma. Any higher than .25% will change the profile too much. 1/4% of cactus is just enough juicy and doesn't need much time to steep.\r\n\r\n**FA Marshmallow** I threw this in for sweetness and more body, .5% and it won't mute our fruit but just add a nice mouthfeel.\r\n\r\n*Lastly, I truly think erythritol is an effective sweetener in many fruit mixes that I have tried.* It really brings out an inherent sweetness. Here, with all the sweets used, it gives a 'sugar lips' effect. I have noticed this effect on some other mixes I am working on. I have a cantaloupe mix I am working on, and the mix without erythritol is noticeably less sweet but the flavor on both is more or less the same. I would not say it is necessary here but I highly recommend it. I mix this specific juice for a couple of people and I am happy to share it here with you.\r\n\r\n **Erythritol works better than EM here because it sweetens without changing everything else that is going on in the mix. If you don't have erythritol, try it with no sweetener. If i were going to use EM rather than erythritol, I would start at .25% or maybe TPA sweetener at .5%**\r\n\r\n\r\n**Definitely tasty as a shake and vape, but after about a day the cactus settles down and blends into the rest of the aromas.**","steep_days":"2 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"total_reviews":1,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:49:07.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"4087","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Watermelon","vendor":"LA","millipercent":6500},{"name":"Kiwi","vendor":"FA","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Red Touch (strawberry)","vendor":"FA","millipercent":750},{"name":"Marshmallow","vendor":"FA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Cactus","vendor":"INW","millipercent":250},{"name":"Sweetness","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":800}],"reviews":[{"user":"Fiftytrent","score":"5","text":"I didn't have the Ethyritol Solution.
