Thanks ediblemalfunction for the blueberry trinity used in this recipe.\r\n\r\nFlavor Choices\r\n\r\nThe blueberry\r\n\r\nas described above the blueberry trinity was implemented. A very good combo of 3 different blueberry flavorings.\r\n\r\nBlueberry FW\r\nBlueberry Extra TFA\r\nBilberry FA\r\n\r\nMy original version of this didn't have Bilberry FA in it, which was also good in its own right. I just wanted to try it with the bilberry added in and percentages adjusted.\r\n\r\nPomegranate\r\n\r\nPretty simple, I just used TFA's Pom for this. Tasty stuff at 2-3% range. I like the subtle almost \"sourness\" this flavor gives, yet I wouldn't say floral, but I could see it becoming floral at higher percentages.","steep_days":"1 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"total_reviews":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-06T12:56:37.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"863","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Blueberry","vendor":"FW","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Blueberry (extra)","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Bilberry","vendor":"FA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Pomegranate","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Super Sweet","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":500}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"180745","name":"Blue Presence of Mind (Blue POM)"}}}
