( DONT let the basil scare you  - if  you are looking for something different and like mint and fruit, you may like this) \r\n\r\n\r\nHoney  pomelo is  just my favorite  pink grapefruit , it is wet and sweet and tart -   if you want it tarter add some  inw grapefruit, or pink guava   or cap grapefruit  to  it  \r\nGolden syrup   adds a light dark syrup note  and cap super sweet adds a top note sweetness for for the citrus\r\nTangeriene     adds some nice rounded sweetness  and body to the mix, if you want a bit more citrus bitterness then FA tanger wound be an option   \r\ntonic water is just that it is tonic water, with that tart slightly  bitter note on the finish    and works really well with the sweet lemon and lime notes of the WF lemon lime soda \r\nI  Use basil  from time to time rather then  mint  in a beverage/ cocktail to add an interesting sweet herbal  note to a mix  that complements fruit and it just works    - it may not be for every one but I really enjoy  it and room note  it provides  BUT USE it LOW  \r\ni added some ws 23  to mine  as a option     \r\n","steep_days":"3 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T12:47:44.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"848","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Basil","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":300},{"name":"Golden Syrup","vendor":"VT","millipercent":500},{"name":"Honey Pomelo","vendor":"VT","millipercent":3500},{"name":"Lemon Lime Soda SC","vendor":"WF","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Russian Vodka","vendor":"VT","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Tangerine SC","vendor":"WF","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Tonic Water","vendor":"VT","millipercent":3500},{"name":"Super Sweet","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":750}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"160890","name":"its 5 o'clock Somewhere   (Grapefruit, basil vodka,  tonic cocktail) "}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
