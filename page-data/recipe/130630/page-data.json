This is a pretty simple mix, but it's really enjoyable. Notes below, but they'll be short and sweet.\r\n\r\nTHE WATERMELON\r\n(FA Watermelon, FLV Watermelon, FLV Wild Melon)\r\nI've been using FA watermelon for my melon note for a long time, but I always found it to be a little too subtle and \"realistic\" for a mix. I didn't realize that I even had FLV Watermelon, but upon smelling the bottle, I realized this would add that candied and artificial watermelon that was needed. Anything over 2% with FLV Watermelon tends to get a little harsh and offensive, but around 1.5, paired with FA's option, it's really fucking pleasant. Add that touch of FLV Wild Melon, and you've got a nice, fully fleshed profile that has some real depth and punch to it.\r\n\r\nTHE STRAWBERRY\r\n(FA Strawberry, TPA Strawberry Ripe)\r\nWell, fuck me I guess. I have been pairing FA Strawberry and CAP Sweet Strawberry for so long, that I forgot about what TPA Straw Ripe can do to a mix. This combo provides us with a back-note of strawberry that doesn't overpower the watermelon, but adds some juicy backbone to it. I've found that lately, any mix that I use my normal FA/CAP combo on, it just ends up being a strawberry forward mix with accents of whatever else I had in there. This combination, at this percent, allows the strawberries to stay in back to support our melons.\r\n\r\nTHE OTHERS\r\n(CAP Super Sweet/WS-23)\r\nYou already know what these are for. I don't normally like adding sweetener, but given that I was going for a more commercial idea here, I added two drops to a 20ml, and it's perfect. Brings some extra brightness to the fruits, while giving a little more mouthfeel overall. Just sweetness, obviously, but it's the right amount. WS-23 can be used to your liking, but 1% is a little too much, 0.5 - 0.75% will be perfect and not mute the fruits in the mix with ice.\r\n\r\nNo need to steep, just mix up, shake up, and enjoy. I've been gone for a while, I hope you fuckers missed me.","steep_days":"2 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"updated_at":"2020-12-12T18:30:10.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"3970","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Watermelon","flavor_id":"616","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Red Summer (watermelon)","flavor_id":"471","vendor":"FA","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Strawberry (ripe)","flavor_id":"271","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Red Touch (strawberry)","flavor_id":"421","vendor":"FA","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Wild Melon","flavor_id":"619","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1000},{"name":"WS-23","flavor_id":"8085","vendor":"OTHR","millipercent":500},{"name":"Super Sweet","flavor_id":"2384","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":200}],"reviews":[{"user":"kitu5","text":"yanno, this one is a little odd on my palette. The watermelon is good. The strawberry is good. It's bright and chilly, like it should be. And yet...there's an odd undercurrent. Somehow, some way, there's a bit of a nutty profile in here. I can't explain it, but it's there. This is like a tropical trail mix. On Ice.&#xD;\n&#xD;\nAnd I dig it!&#xD;\n&#xD;\nSeverely tasty stuff. Made a batch for a friend without the ws-23 to make sure I wasn't losing my mind. He's the one who coined tropical trail mix as a descriptor. Think mebbe it's the wild melon's \"rindiness\" doing that?&#xD;\n&#xD;\nRegardless, this stuff is flat banging.","score":5},{"user":"W3STON","text":"Not a huge strawberry fan but this recipe is amazing.
