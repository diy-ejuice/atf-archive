Do you like peaches? Do you like cheesecake? Then not only should you have most of these flavors in your stash already, but you're going to fuggin love this all day vape \r\n\r\nPeaches N Cream Cheesecake is the profile here. Interesting you might think. Does this exist? Yup. It sure does. Inspired by TOC Michelle H. To make this flavor profile, I took it a step further and with the help of DaytimeFrank and TamVapes, we were able to create this delicious recipe that I am 100% satisfied with. \r\n\r\nOn the inhale you get a nice, thick, creamy cheesecake and then the peaches hit you. Juicy, wet, sweet but natural tasting peach essence comes flying out of your mouth upon the exhale which leaves your tongue and lungs craving more.\r\n\r\nLet me know what you think, and as always, sweeten to taste ðŸ˜‰","steep_days":"7","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:51:40.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"1062","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Armenia (apricot)","vendor":"FA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Cheesecake (graham Crust)","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Cream","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Liquid Amber","vendor":"FA","millipercent":200},{"name":"New York Cheesecake","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Peach","vendor":"INW","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Peach White","vendor":"FA","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Yellow Peach","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":750},{"name":"Yes, We Cheesecake","vendor":"INW","millipercent":3000}],"reviews":[{"user":"cxxxxp","text":"Delicious, you guys nailed the peach, I'm always picking up the earthy off-notes in INW peach, but not here!
