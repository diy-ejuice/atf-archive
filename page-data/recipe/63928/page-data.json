Since I started mixing, I have been trying to replicate my favorite flavor of snow cone.  In high school, my good friend turned me on to half ice-cream / half bubblegum, and it is an absolutely delicious flavor combination.  I have tried several different bubblegum concentrates, trying to find the right one.  I decided to go to the master (ID10-T), himself, for some help.  He suggested INW Bubble Gum (yc) as a good one.  I had finally found my perfect flavor.\r\n\r\nFor the \"ice-cream\" I was using TPA V.B.I.C alone at 4% in all of my trials.  It was good, but it lacked some depth.  Then I remembered how much I enjoyed ID10-T's \"Longing\"  I used his cream base and swapped the Honeysuckle for 3% INW Bubble Gum (yc).  The end result was nearly perfect.  Good enough to be my new ADV.\r\n\r\nThank you, ID10-T, for your hard work.  Not trying to rip off your recipe, just paying homage :) ","steep_days":"3 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":4,"updated_at":"2020-12-12T10:33:42.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"2593","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Bubble Gum (yc)","flavor_id":"709","vendor":"INW","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Cream","flavor_id":"604","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Cream Fresh","flavor_id":"540","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Shisha Vanilla","flavor_id":"841","vendor":"INW","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Vanilla Bean Ice Cream","flavor_id":"186","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1500}],"reviews":[{"user":"MotherPunker","text":"thanks for turning me on to this BG flavour, id also been looking for one for a while to reincarnate my fav childhood ice-cream (and the one I still order....and get made fun of for it lol)  I actually used LB VIC instead just cuz I prefer it.  To be honest I felt like the recipe is missing something.... a wetness i think.  Its not quite full yet, very rich and creamy but if you're trying to make what I understand you are; half BG slush half soft serve ice cream? (snow cone/soft serve swirl is a very popular ice cream stand treat in quebec, I got hooked on when I lived there, I don't get why I've not seen it elsewhere) Then its not quite there.... so close though and SOOOO good!  Im gonna keep tinkering with this one.  perhaps a touch of banana or pear...","score":4}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"63928","name":"Bubblegum Ice-cream"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
