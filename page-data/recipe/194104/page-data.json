I'm usually disappointed with Apple recipes because I find them too potent and sharp tasting, quickly losing my interest. I decided to take a chance and I mixed it exactly as listed. This blew me away! Right off the shake I realized it was exactly the pure and simple Apple flavour I was looking for! The combo of Double Apple and Two Apples is a winner! It's been 3 days now and it's only getting better. This one is going into my ADV vault. Great work."}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"194104","name":"Jumanjì"}}}
