Its an all Flavorah recipe so in my opinion the steep time is much less because of it being all Flavorah flavors. I think its good to vape after it settles overnight and is at its best after 3 days. If you like bread pudding then I dare to say you will love this. Not to mention all of these flavors are good highly concentrated flavors that are all worth having in your arsenal.
