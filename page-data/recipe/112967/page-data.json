Where CAP VC is oftentimes *too* eggy and weird tasting(though I enjoy the HELL out of it), FA's version is perfection. **TFA Ethyl Maltol** is used here because frankly, EM does a better job at not only sweetening custards, but also performs double duty by *thickening* custards. \r\n  \r\n\r\nRecommended steep: 7 days(but good fresh)\r\n\r\nRecommended VG: 80%\r\n\r\n*Please don't use this recipe for commercial gain*\r\n\r\n**E-JUICEMAKERS ONESHOTS**","steep_days":"7","temperature":"0","recipe_score":4.7,"total_reviews":3,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:50:21.000-05:00","best_vg":"80%","views":"5190","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Custard Premium","vendor":"FA","millipercent":3500},{"name":"Holy Vanilla","vendor":"DFS","millipercent":2250},{"name":"Juicy Strawberry","vendor":"FA","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Red Touch (strawberry)","vendor":"FA","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Strawberry (ripe)","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2250},{"name":"Ethyl Maltol","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1000}],"reviews":[{"user":"Zugmaschine","score":"4","text":"In general Vanilla mutes flavours, EM also and the Straw Ripe has Ethyl Maltol  too. Is there really enough Strawberrytaste after a steep? &#xD;\nWill the vanilla and the EM not mute the Strawberry? I will give it a try and report and rate after steeping.&#xD;\nUpdate:  I like to add 1.5% OOO Strawberry Jam for the FA Juicy Strawberry, to make the other Strawberries a little Jam'ier.&#xD;\nBut its a solid, good recipe, how it is."},{"user":"corvape","score":"5","text":"Was looking for a good recipe to try out my first bottles of FA Premium Custard and Holy vanilla.. I’m so Glad I found this one! The strawberry combo is just right.. and that Custard base with the holy vanilla is so smooth and flavorful with no off taste.. 5 Star recipe for sure.. can’t wait to play with these flavors some more.. &#xD;\nthank you for sharing Six Strings.. you have some bangers!"},{"user":"Billywilly","score":"5","text":"I quite enjoy this after on 24 hours, and i dont really enjoy anything.
