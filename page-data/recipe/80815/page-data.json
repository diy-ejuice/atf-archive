Blueberry, Raspberry, and Lemon are there to give you a nice blueberry punch.  The raspberry and lemon really do a nice job of lifting the blueberry up here. \r\n\r\nOverall, at 12% flavorings, this recipe definitely packs a punch.  The fruits mellow out after a short steeping time while the cream pops after a week.  Shake and Vape approved, but it will be in your face a bit if you don't let it steep.
