I will see how it goes and add notes after steep.\r\n\r\nAfter steeping for 2 weeks I have tried it out. I really enjoyed this. Vanilla ice cream forward then it finishes with a buttery cone. I am very pleased. I will be trying out a V2 of which I have already posted a recipe. My reasons for changing to a new recipe is I think it could have a bit more dairy flavor. Please don’t let this stop you from mixing it. It really is enjoyable. I like simple flavors and this hits the spot.","steep_days":"14","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:50:32.000-05:00","best_vg":"60%","views":"1856","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Vanilla Bean Ice Cream","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Meringue","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Bavarian Cream","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Vanilla Custard","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Golden Butter","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":500},{"name":"Biscuit","vendor":"INW","millipercent":750},{"name":"Graham Cracker Clear","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Sweetener","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1000}],"reviews":[{"user":"BananaSlamma","text":"All I can say is WOW. You’ve help bring to an end a road I’ve long traveled in search for the ideal vanilla vape. This is just lovely. Sweet, creamy, exploding with vanilla notes accentuated by a wonderful graham to create the presence of a cone. Good job, fellow mixer. Very good job.
