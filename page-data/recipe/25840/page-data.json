I've toned down that super sweet tho, but compared to for example honeydewwy from Wayne, it's a bit thicker, a bit more leaning on the cream. Very good though!"},{"user":"cincinnatiking","text":" I am new to mixing. I would love to have a cantaloupe ice cream. I only have tfa honey dew v2. Would you even use v2?
