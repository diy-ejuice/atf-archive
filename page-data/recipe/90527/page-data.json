I chose french vanilla because its a bit of a darker vanilla which i thought would pair well with the caramel and smokey ry4 notes. \r\n+ TFA Pie Crust - Main pie crust note \r\n+ TFA RY4 Double - This is the main star of the show, and the concentrate i wanted to build this recipe around. Using it at a rather high percentage and it seems to be working quite nicely. Seems to take a few days to really settle into the mix properly, but once it has steeped for a little while it really blends nicely with the other flavorings in this recipe. \r\n+ CAP Super Sweet/Sweetener - With dessert style recipes, i always like to add a touch of sweetener to get that nice sugary dessert flavor. This is an optional addition to the recipe, but I find it really helps it out. I personally prefer 0.25% of super sweet. \r\n\r\n#### Other stuff: \r\nSo im still working on other batches of this recipe, and this was the first one that i came up with for this profile. I wasnt expecting it to turn out as nicely as it did, so after vaping the last of my bottle today i really wanted to share it. If anyone has any suggestions on how i can take this recipe to the next level, i would love to hear your ideas. Im still rather new to mixing so any help or tips are much appreciated! I think I kinda got lucky on this one.
