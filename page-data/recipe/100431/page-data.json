Well this recipe delivers you all available slushie flavours combined into one rainbow Slushie cup. Wanted to create an artificial fruity (blue razzy) tasting slushie on my own. This is my first attempt and it turned out to be quite nice. Has definitely adv potential.\r\nThe Circus version of the cotton candy is very vital to this recipe as it adds the blue to the razz and rounds out the fruit flavors pretty well.\r\nSugar Lips indeed - keep the sweetener low or leave it if you dont like very sweet liquids. Cotton candy Circus at 2% is enough for some people.\r\n\r\nPhoto by the Gunny Sack - https://www.thegunnysack.com/sunset-slushie-recipe/","steep_days":"1 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"total_reviews":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-02T07:31:37.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"2140","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Watermelon","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Cotton Candy (circus)","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Dragonfruit","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Grape Juice","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Raspberry (sweet)","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Sweetener","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Blueberry (wild)","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Koolada 10 Pg","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":750}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"100431","name":"Slushie Dream"}}}
