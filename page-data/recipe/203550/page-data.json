And yes, I am aware of what year we are in. But you remember ID10-T's 'Viserion' (the iced blueberry?) - which has something like 19% - and yet, here you are having survived long enough to make it to here. Remember this, my good friends, before you discount this recipe. \r\nPlus, it's 80:20 and just look at those additives... I can assure you there were many trials and countless errors along the way. This recipe would not get to see the light of day if I wasn't ok with where it's at.\r\n______\r\n∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙\r\nAbout\r\n∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙\r\n\r\nSince age 16 I have always drank sugar-free drinks whenever I can. Yes that's me, the one ordering the big mac, large fries, chocolate sundae and a diet coke. I don't have anything against sugar (anymore) but it's just one of the unnecessary habits I've kept alive over the years.\r\n\r\nPresent day now and these \"limited edition\" cans of \"V\" energy drink (Australia) appeared and I fell in love with the flavour. Yep, SUGAR AND ALL. Twenty-something grams per 250ml can in this stuff. Suddenly, it was not so important to go sugar-free.\r\n\r\nI'm studying from home in lockdown so you see, these are like delicious little \"cans of motivation\" on the days when I just can't be bothered going to my zoom class for hours on end.\r\n\r\nPoint is, I'd been drinking WAY way too many of these and basically inhaling sugar by the pound so I figured, why don't I turn this into a VAPE JUICE?\r\n\r\nAnd so I did.\r\n\r\nI was experimenting and didn't think this was any good at first so I didn't note the recipe (idiot) but after a few days steep it was right on. I have tried to recreate it as best I can and this is where I'm at. Sweet-tooths (teeth(s)?) of the world, rejoice.\r\n\r\n\r\nTL;DR: I made an energy drink vape juice\r\n______\r\n∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙\r\nFLAVOUR NOTES\r\n∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙\r\n\r\n◦ LB Pink Lemonade ◦\r\nIs effectively the foundation of the recipe, starting us in the right direction and used as a base to work on. It has a nice \"pinkness\" to it (perhaps a little strawberry in there) that sits underneath the raspberries and lemons we're about to add.\r\n\r\n◦ INW Lemons Kick ◦\r\nIt's sahhh fizzy.. Get on this! It has an amazing ability to produce the FIZZ of a carbonated drink. It has a lemonade type vibe to it which is why it's here, working as an energy drink instead of using actual \"Energy Drink\" flavours.\r\n\r\n◦ CAP Juicy Lemon / TPA Sour ◦\r\nJuicy Lemon brings the JUICY LEMON. It's perfect in recreating the lemon in the actual drink. It's too sweet to be totally realistic but too realistic to be candied and is here for its vibrant and zesty lemon flavour.\r\n\r\n◦ TPA Raspberry (Sweet) / INW Shisha Raspberry / CAP Raspberry V2 ◦\r\nI've mixed up the raspberries here. This is based on ID10T's raspberry trinity and I tried it but it's just not the right fit here. I used INW Shisha as I find it to be a bit more syrupy than Raspberry (Malina). I used CAP Raspberry (v2) over FA's Raz (Berryl) because it's brighter, sweeter and the FA offering was just a tad too realistic and earthy in an energy drink.\r\n\r\n◦ CAP SS / TPA Cotton Candy (10% EM) ◦\r\nOriginally, I used FLV Sweetness but CAP is the better option here I feel. The CC seem to enhance the overall flavour saturation and lift up the raspberries a little while the SS brings the typical fizzy drink or soda-type sweetness. I ended up @ 1% SS but thought that might end up too sweet for some.\r\n\r\n◦ WS-23 ◦\r\nYou can omit this but it seems to work better with it. I really like my WS-23 and I added it at 1.5%. I see closer to 1% or less in other recipes so I've added it lower for this reason and becasue it has a tendency to mute the flavours at higher percentages on some devices. Please add in line with your preferences :)\r\n______\r\n∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙\r\nSUBS / Other Changes\r\n∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙\r\n\r\n◦ Sub CAP Juicy Lemon with JF or any other sweet, tart, juicy & fairly realistic lemon. Something I haven't yet tried is VT's Sour Lemon. I've got that coming in this week and will see how well this subs in place of both CAP and TPA Sour.\r\n\r\n◦ You could sub INW Shisha Raspberry with INW Raspberry (Malina)\r\n\r\n◦ Sub brands with additives used here e.g. CC, SS, Sour, WS-23, just double check your %'s :)\r\n\r\nI try to list subs where I can so if I haven't recommended one it's probably because\r\na)I haven't tried it, tested it, or maybe even tasted it!\r\nb) There isn't one (or) I just haven't heard of it, or\r\nc) It's taken me some time to find the flavours I REALLY enjoy and either the flavour is essential to the recipe &/or there's no valid reason in existence you should ever sub this and you really should just get it.\r\nI'm only human.. tell me where there's ones I've missed.\r\n______\r\n∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙\r\nHAPPY MIXING\r\n∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙\r\n\r\nI'm relatively new to this and want to learn more, feedback/comments are always welcome!\r\n\r\nLastly, just in case you use both (ELR) and (ATF) for different reasons like I do, Here's the link to the same recipe over there:\r\nhttps://e-liquid-recipes.com/recipe/3696492/Pizzy%20%26amp;%20Fink%20%F0%9F%8D%87%F0%9F%8D%8B%20%7C%20A%20Sour%20Raspberry%20Lemonade%20Inspired%20by%20V%20Energy\r\n\r\nIf you mix this up, or some variation of it, please drop a comment &/or review below and let us know how it went!","steep_days":"3","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"total_reviews":1,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T15:22:14.000-05:00","best_vg":"80%","views":"847","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Cotton Candy","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Juicy Lemon","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Lemons Kick","vendor":"INW","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Pink Lemonade","vendor":"LB","millipercent":4500},{"name":"Raspberry","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1250},{"name":"Raspberry (sweet)","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Shisha Raspberry","vendor":"INW","millipercent":1250},{"name":"Sour","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1500},{"name":"WS-23","vendor":"OTHR","millipercent":750},{"name":"Super Sweet","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":750}],"reviews":[{"user":"wadeyloops","score":"none","text":"Viserion is ID10-T's recipe buddy."}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"203550","name":"Pizzy & Fink 🍇🍋 | A Sour Raspberry Lemonade Inspired by V Energy "}}}
