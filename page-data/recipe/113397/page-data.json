It's a pretty fantastic ry4, but I can't really take credit for it. Our computer overlords can, for sure. \r\n\r\nRed oak is a little woody, but it's mostly dark sweetness. I typically use FA Oak Wood, but they are pretty much interchangeable. \r\n\r\nDNB is ash, and a good amount of it keeps this dirty, instead of full on sweet. \r\n\r\nCohiba is really good stuff, sweet, a little bit of leaf, and nutty. Not an in your face tobacco, but I really enjoy it. \r\n\r\nTab Blended is essentially a nutty ry4, and it either has no vanilla, or I can't taste it, thank god. It's a very smooth, light caramel, and the 'tobacco' in it basically just makes it dirty. \r\n\r\nFYI numerous additional presses of the 'random recipe' button yielded garbage, but this is a nice change of pace from more authentic tobaccos. It's fine after 10 days, but tab blended get reeeeeally good after a few weeks.
