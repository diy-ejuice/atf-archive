The original recipe calls for equal proportions of lemon juice, Cointreau (orange-flavored liqueur) and Cognac.  Modern interpretations include a version with Bourbon instead of rum with a dash of bitters called The Bourbon Sidecar. This version is based on the latter with the exclusion of bourbon.\r\n\r\nFLV Back Bar Bitters is a revelation & I can see many recipes spawning from this unique flavour. This a a fantastical, deep bouquet of florals & spices which will add a magical touch to any mix. With hints of cinnamon, orange peel, ginger & cloves, it creates a complex and balanced aromatic & spicy additive.\r\nA touch will make a wonderful spiced cookie, mulled wine and add allure to a boring fruit punch!\r\nI use it sparingly here as I want the orange to shine. 0,5 is plenty but can work at higher %'s if you prefer a more pronounced aromatic kick. The inherent citrus notes compliments the Blood Orange perfectly to create a deep and true orange base.\r\n\r\nFLV Blood orange announces itself loud and proud here. Not as bitter as it rivals, this beauty brings a freshness and vibrancy without being sweet nor tangy. A realistic & bold blood orange flavour with just enough zest without being overbearing.\r\n\r\nFLV Lemon at 1% brings a refreshing bright & tart lemon to enhance the deep blood orange. Any higher and it will dominate...\r\n\r\nAn overnight sleep, well shaken, and she is good to go! \r\n","steep_days":"1 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:50:46.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"1177","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Blood Orange","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Back Bar Bitters","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":500},{"name":"Lemon","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1000}],"reviews":[{"user":"thefogvlog","text":"This mix is true to the profile, perfectly described - and the whole mix hangs together really well.
