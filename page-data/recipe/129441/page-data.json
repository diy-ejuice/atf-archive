It's quite frankly one of the best dessert tobaccos around.\r\n\r\nThinking on what a Hobbit would try to get out of a tobacco strain was an amusing exercise.   With crispy bacon off the market my options were limited.\r\n\r\nSo I went with what I know best, besides yogurts, custards.  I cut my shake and vape custard stone down so that I wasn't interfering with the innate creaminess of the HHRY4.  What I wanted was a creamy custard backnote, which I think I achieved. \r\n\r\nThe butterscotch is there to push the caramel in the recipe forward a bit more.\r\n\r\nIt retains the smooth richness of Cardinal while adding a unique twist.\r\n\r\nEnjoy!\r\n\r\nFear's Original Notes:\r\n\r\nI can keep revising recipes for months if not years as I get bored with a really good profile and do something different with it. Gonna release this one before I change it again. :) I have three favorite \"RY4\" concentrates. The original from Hangsen holds a special place in my heart, RY4 Double from TFA does as well but it tends to be on the harsh side for me. Lastly, Holy Grail RY4 from DIYFS is near to perfect for me but suffers from what all RY4s do, (in my opinion)... NOT ENOUGH TOBACCO\r\n\r\nA simple, delectable desert tobacco.\r\n\r\nHoly Grail RY4, one of my absolute favorite RY4s, heavy on the warm creamy caramel, heavy on the vanilla. used a bit heavy here to get the \"warm creamy caramel\" to the front.\r\nFLV Red Burley, I absolutely love this concentrate. It is one of the handful of tobacco concentrates that are not NETs that I feel truly compares to a single varietal test to the actual tobacco it is named after. This is an odd concentrate, it comes in STRONG and true as a shake and vape, then dies off over a week, coming back in week two of the steep, less strong but way more nuance.\r\nFLV Kentucky Blend, this is a really good analog cigarette concentrate, used a bit low here for a very slight smoky ash without having to use a TA. This can be left out completely but I feel it adds a nice note.\r\n\r\nThe pairing of the two FLV tobaccos here is to amplify and authenticate the little bit of tobacco that Holy Grail has. If I am going to long steep a bottle of this >3 weeks I bump the FLV Tobaccos up to double what they are here. Not that they fade away but at double what they are they maintain a stronger presence outside of the 3 week steep.\r\n\r\nThis is a really good shake and vape (by my definition, at least let it sit over night after vigorous shaking), it does change significantly over the next 14 days hitting it's peak of meld and nuance at that point. If you are a desert tobacco lover give this one a shot in a larger mix to experience the change in profile and nuance. I listed 60 vg as ideal as I feel tobaccos benefit from a bit higher PG, but it is also really good at my max VG percentage of 70. This is really good in any flavor atty/tank, different coil types and airflow will accentuate different aspects of the profile immensely.
