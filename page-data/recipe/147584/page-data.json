I used **PUR Sour Raspberry Candy** and **VT Raspberry Jam**.  The Purilum Sour Raspberry Candy, is not that sour, but it gives that great bite of raspberry you would expect to get when biting into a cooked raspberry in a scone, especially combined with VT Raspberry Jam. \r\nThis is a delicious all day vape. Add sweetener to your preference \r\nYou can also switch the fruits out to your favorite fruit. \r\nEnjoy \r\n\r\nFacebook - https://www.facebook.com/groups/diydownunder/\r\nDiscord - https://discord.gg/kH4Fqbc\r\nYoutube - https://www.youtube.com/diydownunder \r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/user/frank1360","steep_days":"5","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"total_reviews":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-05T20:50:50.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"1491","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Jam Scone SC","vendor":"WF","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Raspberry Jam","vendor":"VT","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Starch Base","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":400},{"name":"Cream","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Biscuit","vendor":"JF","millipercent":500},{"name":"Sour Raspberry Candy","vendor":"PUR","millipercent":2000}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"147584","name":"Everybody get Sconed "}}}
