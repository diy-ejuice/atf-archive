The Raspberry adds a \"tang\" at only 0.5% to give that authentic bakery jam flavour.\r\nNote - its INW Raspberry Konkentrat (Malina) used here, but the database did have it as an option. \r\n\r\nThe doughnut is achieved solely with the Cinnamon Danish Swirl (with a touch of Joy, but in honesty you could leave it out) which works with the there components to give a warm cinnamon doughnut on the inhale, that lingers with a strong strawberry jam on the exhale.\r\n\r\nTwo weeks steep time, but you will see it develop even further up to four weeks.","steep_days":"14","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"updated_at":"2020-12-12T18:29:03.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"2423","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Cinnamon Danish Swirl","flavor_id":"35","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":3250},{"name":"Sweet Strawberry","flavor_id":"121","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":6000},{"name":"Strawberry (ripe)","flavor_id":"271","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":5000},{"name":"Joy","flavor_id":"401","vendor":"FA","millipercent":150},{"name":"Jelly Candy","flavor_id":"2170","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":700},{"name":"Cream Cheese Icing","flavor_id":"2380","vendor":"LA","millipercent":800},{"name":"Raspberry","flavor_id":"667","vendor":"INW","millipercent":500}],"reviews":[{"user":"stevenv84","text":"I mixed this up and wow this absolutely amazing and great tasting.
