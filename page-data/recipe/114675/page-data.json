I add 1 drop shisha peppermint per 30ml to have it balanced against the lime. Could add more if you want it fresh but it's a damn potent flavor. Sweetener to taste, I like SS at 0.25 in this since the Carmel in here is already my approach to that sugar cane in a Mojito. Enjoy.","steep_days":"3 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"total_reviews":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-05T13:09:24.000-05:00","best_vg":"60%","views":"1600","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Juicy Lemon","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":500},{"name":"Mojito","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Shisha Lime","vendor":"INW","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Lemon Lime","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Cream Soda","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Jamaican Rum","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Carmel (caramel)","vendor":"FA","millipercent":250},{"name":"Shisha Peppermint","vendor":"INW","millipercent":150}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"114675","name":"Cloudy Mojito "}}}
