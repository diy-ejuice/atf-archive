Pretty damn good and I'm sure the steep will make it even  better.  Hit the profile on the nose.  That zepolla is some good shit."},{"user":"CkoAU","score":"5","text":"Really nice juice, I found that at 14 days it starts to really shine."},{"user":"Neller","score":"5","text":"Really great recipe man, me and a friend of mine who I mix for, always have a 100ml bottle of this brewing up.&#xD;\nI also like to sub the maple with tfa 2.5% or a combo of both. Really only played with them cause I keep running out.&#xD;\nGreat stuff"},{"user":"Cmnderb","score":"5","text":"Absolutely delicious!!  Made exactly as per recipe.  After 7 day steep wasn't very fond of it found it a bit muted and zeppola heavy. Put it back to steep and forgot about it.  Found it yesterday a little over 30 days later and it's perfect.  Not an ADV for me as it's a bit rich but with morning coffee or evenings after supper it's perfect. Will be making more!!! Thanks for sharing!!!!!!!"},{"user":"ID10-T","score":"4","text":"Beautiful combination of ingredients but but that Maple is way too much for me. It gets almost sickeningly sweet yet also a little dry up that high. Cut the maple in half or so to calm that down and let more of the bakery come out, and this almost certainly be a five-star recipe. "},{"user":"cdaniell30","score":"5","text":"This was my intro to FA Maple, and it didn't let me down"},{"user":"QueerYourVape","score":"5","text":"Hey SlashaLo! I wanted to let you know, I watched the maple notes video and they talked about your maple vanilla long john you mixed for the mixathon that you did for someone who wanted a very maple recipe.&#xD;\n&#xD;\nGuess what! It was me who asked! You mixed it for me! So I wanted to say I use it a lot and it’s nice. I think when I know how to mix better I might tweak it a bit so the maple is a little less dry and the vanilla doesn’t come through as much but I still totally love it. It ages really well and I always have a 60ml of it aging somewhere."},{"user":"jesuslizard","score":"5","text":"Perfect,  I was dubious of this because maple can be a bit try or sickening. But the creamy notes really mellow it.  There's not really much note wise to add to this review.  It tastes exactly like the description.  Thick cream with mellow smooth maple flavour,  with a plain doughnut throughout. Going to try mixing this with banana. &#xD;\n"}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"57567","name":"Maple Vanilla Custard filled Long John"}}}
