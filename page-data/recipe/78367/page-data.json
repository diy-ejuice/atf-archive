I'm not sure if a date concentrate exists, but I would say the flavor is somewhere between a jammy fig and a cooked plum.  I used FLV Fig at 0.5% and INW Smoked Plum at 0.2% (a ridiculously low % . . . but that stuff is powerful) to create the gooey resemblance of dates cooked in sugar.  I added the WF Molasses to add the deep sweetness that comes with cooked dates.  WF Almond Cookie (2%), TFA Rice Crunchies (3%), and TFA Coconut Candy (0.75%) make up the body of the cookie that's mixed in (similar to rice crispy treats) after the sugar and dates have cooked into a syrupy sweet mixture.  FA Meringue (1%) and CAP Super Sweet (0.5%) round this out with that heavy coating of powdered sugar that the warm cookies are rolled in before serving.","steep_days":"1 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T19:15:17.000-05:00","best_vg":"60%","views":"1425","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Fig","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":500},{"name":"Smoked Plum","vendor":"INW","millipercent":200},{"name":"Rice Crunchies","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Meringue","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Coconut Candy","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":750},{"name":"Molasses SC","vendor":"WF","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Super Sweet","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":500},{"name":"Almond Cookie SC","vendor":"WF","millipercent":2000}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"78367","name":"Christmas Confections"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
