I'm probably 20 iterations in. Since January I've been altering it an ingredient at a time, however the past few times I haven't changed anything. It's what I'm looking for. An easy vanilla vape. Ol' faithful. It's mild yet rich, and it won't assault your senses. When I've spent the whole day tasting and testing, I can kick back and enjoy this After the Party.\r\n\r\nFlavor Notes:\r\n\r\n4% CAP Vanilla Custard v1 is the base. It's buttery, thick, eggy, and robust. I don't like too much egg though, so it stays kind of light. If I'm doing a custard, it's gonna be with this guy. I tried INW Custard for awhile but it has the same note that I don't like in INW Creme Brulee. CAP has a better flavor for my basic bitch American palate. It's just good. There. That's why I used it. The vanilla part is meh at best, but that's okay. We have a secret weapon:\r\n\r\n1.5% DFS Holy Vanilla is elevating that vanilla into uncharted planes of nirvana. That creamy, mid-baking, vanilla extract essence with its full bodied aroma absolutely has to be here. This will solve all of CAP VCV1's vanilla problems, and take it where it never knew it could go. I've pushed this to 3% without regret, but the custard starts to thin out. At 1.5% the vape remains a thick custard with a very authentic and satisfying vanilla.\r\n\r\n0.5% HS French Vanilla Ice Cream adds some complexity to the custard. It has a rich cream note that is super buttery. I had 1.5% TPA VBIC in the recipe, but it was too bland. It was flattening the profile. FVIC does the opposite. It fleshes out the creams without emulsifying everything into one muddled flavor. 1% Vienna Cream worked pretty well if you're missing this flavor, but it won't be the same.\r\n\r\n1% TPA Bavarian Cream is another supporting flavor for the custard. Along with FVIC, it bolsters the dairy profile around that egginess. It has some of that warm, homely feeling to it that I get from Holy Vanilla. Any higher and this would start to be known, but at 1% it hangs out in the background.\r\n\r\n2% FW Graham Cracker has no cinnamon, it's just a fresh graham. It isn't as crunchy as TPA. I didn't want it to seem like a graham crust but more of a cookie crumbled into the custard. It doesn't pop right out; it's just another warm accent to make this feel like a relaxing vape.\r\n\r\nLet's talk about steeping. This is actually a pretty good shake and vape... To me. I don't like very forward custards, so 4% VCV1 as a shake and vape works for me. Considering it's fortified by other strong flavors, it's good out of the gate. However, I prefer to let all juices steep, especially custards and bakeries because they tend to bloom with time. I don't mind letting this steep for a month or more. With that said, it comes together by two weeks. The Custard does benefit greatly from that time. Do whatever you wanna do; it's a good vape no matter when you vape it.\r\n\r\nHappy mixing. ðŸ‘½","steep_days":"14","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:49:04.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"5162","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Vanilla Custard","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Bavarian Cream","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Holy Vanilla","vendor":"DFS","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Graham Cracker","vendor":"FW","millipercent":2000},{"name":"French Vanilla Icecream","vendor":"HS","millipercent":500}],"reviews":[{"user":"FizzChaser","text":"This is a very tasty, creamy vanilla mix! I do lose that wonderful intense vanilla top note after vaping for a bit, so I've been using it for when I switch profiles. A couple rounds of drips between fruit mix to bakery mix, and again when switching to say a custard.  Glad I mixed this one up, I'll be sure to have this on hand frequently. Great job Burgundy!"},{"user":"crumbym","text":"Very Delicious, I just made it and took a vape, the flavor at the moment is Vanilla ICE Cream flavor, really pops on this and the Graham Cracker gives it that roasted sugar coat taste. It is good as SNV, but I'm going to let it sit for a couple weeks to see what develops. I have learned from making several flavors myself, that the custards only get better with time, you can't rush that Excellent flavor without time. I'll get back soon with results, but for now I'm giving it a 5 since its so good already."},{"user":"kindground","text":"Great recipe. I normally would turn my nose up at 4% CAP VC V1 but I figured all the Vanilla would help smooth out all that egginess. And it does! The touch of graham cracker keeps it interesting. Great adv. I'll be mixing a lot of this in the future. "},{"user":"Jscoggs81","text":"Creamy, custardy, goodness. "},{"user":"mlNikon","text":"This is perfect for my tastes! so rich and creamy.
