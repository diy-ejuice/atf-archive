It has a very unique flavor compared to what we eat Stateside. \r\n\r\nMost notably, it is considerably more “melon-y” and has a buttery mouthfeel, sliding right off the peel, and none of the dank and what some find offputting flavor. \r\n\r\nSo my goal was to emulate that papaya, and I thought pairing TFA Papaya with CAP Cantaloupe would get pretty close and it honestly does. I get no off notes of stank and the dragonfruit really smooths it all together. The coconut is there for shits and gigs, I honestly can’t taste it, just figured it’d add to that tropical smooth vibe.  \r\n\r\nStarted a YouTube series on mixing and stuff. Here’s a video explaining this mix more kinda https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ofi3Ck6oc0&t=17s\r\n\r\n**DISCLAIMER:** This is an SnV, literally just made it and is really tasty. However I make no promises that the dank of TFA Papaya won’t sneak its way out, so if you hate that and consider it an off note, you’ve been warned :)","steep_days":"1 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-10T16:00:22.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"1424","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Papaya","flavor_id":"252","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Cantaloupe","flavor_id":"23","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Coco' (coconut)","flavor_id":"416","vendor":"FA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Dragonfruit","flavor_id":"226","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":500}],"reviews":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"74515","name":"Papaya Upaya"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
