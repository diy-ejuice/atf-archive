Sweet, simple, tinge of chocolate drizzle on a strawberry shake with lumps of heavy shortcake in it. Enjoy!\r\n\r\nIt's pretty straight forward. FW Yellow Cake is the perfect fit for a heavy, yet sweet cake, CAP sweet straw to match a strawberry syrup flavor, INW choco for that hint of chocolate syrup and Molinberry milkshake to give it body. I almost put some VBIC in or some cream, but with the cake it doesn't really need it. Feel free to add to this as you wish, :D \r\n\r\n14 day steep for it to really settle in and sweeten up.","steep_days":"14","temperature":"0","recipe_score":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-12T15:40:37.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"1391","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Milkshake","flavor_id":"1563","vendor":"MB","millipercent":3500},{"name":"Milk Chocolate","flavor_id":"7685","vendor":"JF","millipercent":500},{"name":"Sweet Strawberry","flavor_id":"121","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":4500},{"name":"Cake (yellow)","flavor_id":"1222","vendor":"FW","millipercent":2500}],"reviews":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"153819","name":"Strawberry Shortcake Milkshake"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
