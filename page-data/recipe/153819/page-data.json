Sweet, simple, tinge of chocolate drizzle on a strawberry shake with lumps of heavy shortcake in it. Enjoy!\r\n\r\nIt's pretty straight forward. FW Yellow Cake is the perfect fit for a heavy, yet sweet cake, CAP sweet straw to match a strawberry syrup flavor, INW choco for that hint of chocolate syrup and Molinberry milkshake to give it body. I almost put some VBIC in or some cream, but with the cake it doesn't really need it. Feel free to add to this as you wish, :D \r\n\r\n14 day steep for it to really settle in and sweeten up.","steep_days":"14","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"total_reviews":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T21:33:03.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"1382","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Milkshake","vendor":"MB","millipercent":3500},{"name":"Milk Chocolate","vendor":"JF","millipercent":500},{"name":"Sweet Strawberry","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":4500},{"name":"Cake (yellow)","vendor":"FW","millipercent":2500}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"153819","name":"Strawberry Shortcake Milkshake"}}}
