Couldn't think of anything to improve upon it, Decided to share it. It's sweet, creamy and enjoyable.\r\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n**LB Vanilla Ice Cream:**\r\nA wonderful ice cream offering. No pepper notes present. May appear high but it's worth mentioning I've found that the ice cream flavor lacks presence at lower percentages.\r\n\r\n**INW Shisha Strawberry, TFA Strawberry Ripe:**\r\nThese two shoulder the bulk of the strawberry note.\r\n\r\n**FA Strawberry Red Touch:**\r\n\"Jams up\" the strawberries into a velvety jelly perfect for ice cream.\r\n\r\n**TFA Dragonfruit:**\r\nReally pushes that strawberry in there.\r\n\r\n**INW Shisha Vanilla:**\r\nA lovely vanilla offering that keeps the vanilla note from LB VIC from being too rudimentary.\r\n\r\n**FLV Cream:**\r\nProvides a little lift in terms of density to LB's VIC, but also emulsifies the vanilla's and rounds out the cream. Can substitute with FA Vienna Cream or FA Cream Fresh, although of course, it won't be the same effect.\r\n\r\n**TFA Sweetener**\r\nWell, obv's.","steep_days":"7","temperature":"420","recipe_score":5,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:50:04.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"7465","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Vanilla Ice Cream","flavor_id":"1511","vendor":"LB","millipercent":5500},{"name":"Sweetener","flavor_id":"339","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Shisha Strawberry","flavor_id":"1711","vendor":"INW","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Strawberry (ripe)","flavor_id":"271","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Red Touch (strawberry)","flavor_id":"421","vendor":"FA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Shisha Vanilla","flavor_id":"841","vendor":"INW","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Cream","flavor_id":"604","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":500},{"name":"Dragonfruit","flavor_id":"226","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":500}],"reviews":[{"user":"Untitled","text":"well done!"},{"user":"ambzizbanannerz","text":"This is my fave s&amp;c of all time it's complicated but in a good way ðŸ˜Š"},{"user":"gravi-tea","text":"this was the first mix I made of yours and had it steeping in the cupboard, came back to it 2 weeks later and was blown away! seriously man this is the BEST strawberry &amp; cream profile I've ever tried! shoot me your paypal because you deserve money for this one."},{"user":"Asire","text":"If you are a S&amp;C guy...TRY THIS. Easily beats all the mother of gods dragons milks out of the park. Defined strawberry with a prominent cream in the back without the two parts muddeling together. Great work "},{"user":"Ebc88","text":"You really made the LB VBIC shine. Its been one my favorite ice creams/custards for awhile now. Your SB combo paired with the Dragonfruit is just delicious. Didnâ€™t notice any issues with fading which has always been my problem with SB Ripe. In a world full of SB&amp;creams this one quickly rose to the top of my list to mix again. Excellent job keep up the good work "},{"user":"Jbirdy34","text":"Love this stuff i actually forgot I made it so it sat for 2 weeks! This was the first recipe I could make of yours steam cause you always use something I don't have. "},{"user":"cincinnatiking","text":"5 Stars! I vaped a recipe that was somewhat close to this one, but the TFA Dragonfruit makes that strawberry combo I love so much into something special. The combo of FLV Cream, Shisha Vanilla, and LB VIC is thick and velvety. The LB VIC is amazing stuff! I know it's an overdone profile, but IMO this is the best one I've had. I vape this everyday now. Thanks for sharing it Steam! "}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"94148","name":"Crimson Cream | A Better Strawberry & Cream"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
