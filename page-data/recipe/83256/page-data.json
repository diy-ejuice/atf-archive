From the well-deserved love for Fear's Cardinal to daily (he thought, to himself, hourly . . . tongue-in-cheek) discussion of burl wood by JJ'S_WHOLESALE, the Discord is a place where newcomers (like myself) can rub elbows with the heavy hitters of DIY.  A place where someone who just placed their first order for concentrates can get advice from mavens like Kopel, ID10-T, JennJarvis, mlNikon, ConcreteRiver, etc (I really could go on at length naming mixers that frequent the Discord).  It's an important tool for mixers of any level, in my opinion.  \r\n\r\nThis is, to me, all things golden.  It's a smooth, rich, oaky RY4 . . . creamy dollops of butterscotch and caramel drenched tobacco dripping on fresh, glowing coils.\r\n\r\nOak Milk brings a caramel milk to the, already, rich caramel of Holy Holy Grail RY4.  These are further enhanced by the buttery creaminess of Butterscotch Ripple paired with FLV's Butterscotch.  Vanilla Ruyan blends into the mix . . . a, hinted-at, smoked vanilla custard.  Red Oak brings a woodsy, casked touch.  The tobacco is an equally-weighted marriage of Red Burley and Native Tobacco.  Cream of Gold is dessert tobacco to the core.\r\n\r\nMixed at a 60vg/40pg mix and aged for 3 days . . . I enjoyed it SNV, and even more aged a few days.  I feel like this is ready to be released (or it could be the slight drunkenness of an educator that recently received news of another snow day). \r\n","steep_days":"3","temperature":"0","recipe_score":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-12T14:06:04.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"1844","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"HOLY HOLY GRAIL RY4","flavor_id":"5037","vendor":"DFS","millipercent":6000},{"name":"Vanilla Ruyan Custard","flavor_id":"6066","vendor":"WF","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Butterscotch","flavor_id":"613","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Native Tobacco","flavor_id":"4393","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":500},{"name":"Red Oak","flavor_id":"375","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Oak Milk","flavor_id":"1668","vendor":"FE","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Red Burley","flavor_id":"4355","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":500},{"name":"Butterscotch Ripple","flavor_id":"1217","vendor":"FW","millipercent":1500}],"reviews":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"83256","name":"Cream of Gold (Buttery Oak Burl RY4)"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
