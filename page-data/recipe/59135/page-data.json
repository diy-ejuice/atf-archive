Traditionally I believe Sherbet, is made with orange, pineapple, lemon, lime, and raspberry Several reasons I didn't go with pineapple or lime. Pineapple and lime, are both highly acidic, and with the already acidic Orange in this recipe, it would have been a real pain in the ass to balance out. \r\n\r\nI also believe the sweetness of mango fits the profile much better. I'm fully aware that mango has been Beat to Death, lately but summer is coming to an end, and soon enough we'll be basking in the glory of custards, creams, and bakeries once again, but  a fruity ice cream this can be Vaped year round. \r\n\r\nFLV mango + LB blue raspberry\r\n\r\nFLV mango- is not something I have played around with too much, it has had a lot of great reviews, and has made an appearance in some of the best recipes of the year to date. It seems the downside is it's a little watery,  and can take away from the texture of many recipes. I personally did not notice any watering down of this cream base.\r\n\r\nLb blue raspberry - I picked this flavoring for several reasons, for one it does in part a blue flavor, or what my brain perceives as blue because I've eaten way too many Otter Pops in my youth.. On top of on top of that it's a great raspberry flavoring, and the others in my Arsenal just did fit.\r\n\r\n TFA sweet raspberry is my go-to but I believe it contains ethyl maltol, which was muting other flavors, and balancing it was becoming problematic.\r\n\r\nINW raspberry fit better but is a temperamental concentrate, and tends to overpower everything. I think it could be a suitable replacement if you do not have liquid barns blue raspberry. But 2% is definitely too high I liked it best at .5%. \r\n\r\nAnd that's the list of raspberries I currently own. Would love to hear love any substitutions that work.\r\n\r\nFor the rest of the flavor notes check out the original recipe. I do have to admit to cheating a little on the Steep time, I had a fully steeped batch of my orange vanilla sherbet, and tossed these flavors on top of that. Hopefully they don't fade too much wall aging. Thank you for reading and please if you mix this up feedback and criticism  are very appreciated.\r\n\r\nhttps://alltheflavors.com/recipes/59133#orange_vanilla_sherbert_by_chrisdvr1","steep_days":"21","temperature":"420","recipe_score":0,"total_reviews":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-05T13:08:48.000-05:00","best_vg":"69%","views":"3467","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Vanilla Bean Ice Cream","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Super Sweet","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":500},{"name":"Apricot","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":750},{"name":"Orange Dream Bar","vendor":"FW","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Cream Cheese Icing","vendor":"LA","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Mango","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Blue Raspberry","vendor":"LB","millipercent":2000}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"59135","name":"Tropical rainbow sherbert"}}}
