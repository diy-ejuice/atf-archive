A lot of us contributed with our thoughts, opinions, experiences and with that along with mine I came up with this beautiful rendition of the Aussie Bakery classic, passion fruit tart. This is seriously the best recipe I have crafted to date. Thank you to all those who contributed with their thoughts and ideas on our page!! This is for you and I welcome everyone to not only try this but see if it can be improved.\r\n\r\nDown to the what & why:\r\nThis is a childhood memory and a profile I know very well. To have nailed this profile brings a smile to the dial.\r\n\r\nThe Base:\r\nThis combination of concentrates IMO is a perfect 10/10 bakery crust stone for a citrus style pie bakery. \r\nThe FLV Pastry Zest, INW Biscuit & TPA Pie Crust works together as a beautiful team that delivers the\r\nperfect flavor and textual mouth feel to deliver the base for this profile. \r\n\r\nThe Fruits:\r\nThe fine balance of a little lemon and a kiss of tangerine really are the hero's that lift the mouthwatering\r\npassionfruits to an amazing level of authenticity. The Yellow Passion by VT is the most beautiful Passionfruit\r\nI have ever SF tested but half/half with the \"VT Passionfruit\" it is out of this world!\r\n\r\nThe Creams:\r\nThe Use of FA Custard is the most reliable and beautiful custard that offers that hint of brightness on the end \r\nthat IMO makes it a must to utilise in any citrus style recipe that call for a custard. \r\nThe Capella Butter Cream pairs perfectly and delivers the glossy sweet texture that this profile was calling for. \r\n\r\nGive this recipe a mix whether you have had a chance to try the \"real thing\" or not. \r\nIf you have an appreciation for this profile please let me know what you thought. \r\nMost of all enjoy your mixing journey! & Pash That Tart!!!! lol \r\n\r\nWatch it being mixed here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qao7pYt1sq0\r\n","steep_days":"3","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:50:01.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"2574","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Pastry Zest","flavor_id":"8562","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":500},{"name":"Sweet Tangerine","flavor_id":"123","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":500},{"name":"Yellow Passion","flavor_id":"9367","vendor":"VT","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Custard","flavor_id":"484","vendor":"FA","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Butter Cream","flavor_id":"3","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Biscuit","flavor_id":"642","vendor":"INW","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Lemon","flavor_id":"1655","vendor":"FE","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Pie Crust","flavor_id":"179","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Passion Fruit","flavor_id":"8935","vendor":"VT","millipercent":2000}],"reviews":[{"user":"wadeyloops","text":"I mixed this tart 6 days ago and pashed her like I had just picked up in a night club when I was in my early 20's. She was a bit musky at day 3 but by day 5 she had settled down and behaving well. I wanted her to have a bit more pectin but hey, sometimes you just have to look in the mirror and be grateful you were able to get anything this good to even look at you let alone let you pash her off. I was going to let her go but gave her my phone number and is now on my speed dial for whenever I feel like a pash from a gorgeous tart."}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"92434","name":"Pash My Tart"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
