I've done a pretty acurate job recreating this in a vape. I'm not a fan of cinnamon so I left it out of the recipe but I'm sure if you wanted you could add it.\r\n \r\nBoth Zeppola and lucky shot are two of my favourite concentrates and it was just a matter of tuning them in at the right percentages to get this delicious ADV. \r\nI used VG stevia solution as the sweetener because I find it gives a juicy mouth feel but I'm sure you could sub for .25-.5% super sweet or 1% sucralose\r\n\r\nHope you guys like it, let me know what you think","steep_days":"1 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T12:45:42.000-05:00","best_vg":"75%","views":"2581","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Zeppola","flavor_id":"6312","vendor":"FA","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Lucky Shot","flavor_id":"4349","vendor":"OSD","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Stevia Solutions (5% VG)","flavor_id":"5560","vendor":"NN","millipercent":1000}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"33913","name":"Adams Zep Cake"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
