I love passion fruit, it's not a mystery so as we were doing tropical ice creams I had to do a passion fruit sherbet.\r\n\r\nVT Fizzy Sherbet + WF Frozen Yogurt = This is the sherbet base. The yogurt acts like the cream that gives this lush and generous feeling to the sherbet.\r\n\r\nVT Passion Fruit + FA Passion Fruit + VT Yellow Passion + CAP Grapefruit = The passion fruit full force. VT and FA Passion fruit are a strong fruit base. VT yellow passion makes the passion fruit more authentic and a touch floral. CAP Grapefruit is here to give it a little tartness and redness.\r\n\r\nCap Super Sweet = rounds up the vape very well and makes the passion fruit pop.\r\n\r\nI hope you enjoy this as much as I do ! \r\n\r\nBe queer & vape on !\r\n\r\n\r\n[Photo Credit: Sam Linsell - https://drizzleanddip.com/2011/11/11/fridays-food-porn-granadilla-sorbet/]","steep_days":"3 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T15:21:37.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"1466","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Frozen Yogurt SC","vendor":"WF","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Fizzy Sherbet","vendor":"VT","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Passion Fruit","vendor":"VT","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Yellow Passion","vendor":"VT","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Grapefruit","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Passion (passionfruit)","vendor":"FA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Super Sweet","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":500},{"name":"Sour Lemon","vendor":"VT","millipercent":1000}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"143791","name":"Passionate Consequences (Passion Fruit Sorbet)"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
