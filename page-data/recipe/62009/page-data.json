It is like summer in a cup!\r\n\r\nSteep: very short, perfect after 5 day's.","steep_days":"5","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"total_reviews":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T10:43:36.000-05:00","best_vg":"80%","views":"2495","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Malted Milk (conc)","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Milk Condensed","vendor":"FA","millipercent":150},{"name":"Sweet Coconut","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":500},{"name":"Florida Key Lime","vendor":"FA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Lemon Lime","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":3250},{"name":"Horchata","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Rich Cinnamon","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":100},{"name":"Sweetener","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1250}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"62009","name":"Brazilian limeade"}}}
