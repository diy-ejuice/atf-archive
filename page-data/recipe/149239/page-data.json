FW Milk choc has a plastic-y quality to to that with quite a tame milk choc flavour, I am using the to bend the INW to a commercial milk choc texture... the result is far from fantastic but yeah what ever... I used vanillin... no idea what brand, so lets pretend it TFA :) and sweetener is kind of a must here.\r\n\r\nCandy Shell I am using a combination of FW VBIC, FW Jawbreaker and FA oba oba to achieve this. I wont claim its fantastic but does translate loosely to a candy shell.  I have added a drop or two of FA Meringue for good measure. I am not sure if it really made a difference here, but I like the recipe as is and with limited amounts of INW Milk choc left I am not going to start experimenting,\r\n\r\nGummi, gooey goodness\r\nI used a simple combination of fw swedish and fa rose to create the almost non-descript floral jelly candy flavour. \r\n\r\nyeah so that is it, I hope this is not too disappointing a recipe - Look its a pleasant profile and a fun vape and anyone who have worked with chocolates know the milk choc territory is pretty much undefeated - hope you enjoy\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","steep_days":"3","temperature":"0","recipe_score":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-12T03:46:36.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"1112","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Milk Chocolate","flavor_id":"796","vendor":"INW","millipercent":1750},{"name":"Milk Chocolate","flavor_id":"1355","vendor":"FW","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Vanillin 10% (pg)","flavor_id":"190","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":750},{"name":"Jawbreaker","flavor_id":"1324","vendor":"FW","millipercent":500},{"name":"Oba Oba","flavor_id":"480","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1250},{"name":"Meringue","flavor_id":"530","vendor":"FA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Vanilla Bean Ice Cream","flavor_id":"1451","vendor":"FW","millipercent":500},{"name":"Super Sweet","flavor_id":"2384","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":600},{"name":"Swedish Fish Type","flavor_id":"1429","vendor":"FW","millipercent":350},{"name":"Rose","flavor_id":"511","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000}],"reviews":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"149239","name":"Dotty Gonads - a Requiem for a Chocolate"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
