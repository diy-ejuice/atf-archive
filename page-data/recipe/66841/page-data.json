Only problem for me when I discovered it (and yes, I friggin' squeed when I saw it), was that the lowest they offered it at was 6 mg. At the time, I was very new but committed to my vaping habit to get me the hell off my smoking habit. But, I mentally bookmarked it for when I got down to 6 mg, since I was at 12. Figured it'd only take me like 2 months. I was right. So, with baited breath, I went to order some when I was finally sliding down to 6.\r\n\r\nIT WAS GONE.\r\n\r\nNo longer on the page. It was like it never existed.\r\n\r\nSoooo, I went prowling for reviews, and only found the one. And the guy could barely taste the raspberry?\r\n\r\nUnacceptable.\r\n\r\nAnd now, here we are. Think it's pretty good, but eh, I'll let you make the call.\r\n\r\nGood as a SNV. Better with age. Can't verify if it's any better after 14 days, as I've never had it last that long.","steep_days":"14 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"total_reviews":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-05T02:13:02.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"884","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Orange Dream Bar","vendor":"FW","millipercent":7000},{"name":"Raspberry (sweet)","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":6000},{"name":"Orange Cream","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Dx Sweet Cream","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Blood Orange","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Koolada 10 Pg","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":300}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"66841","name":"Bloody Orphan (Fuzion Orphan Blood remix)"}}}
