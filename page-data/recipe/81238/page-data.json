I wanted this to be smooth, tobacco forward with an accent of maple and a dab of rum.  The molasses is added to enhance the rum and give it a little more sweetness.  I considered using TFA Brown Sugar but the 'lasses seems to fit better. \r\n\r\nIt could use a bit more tobacco so I think v4 will have 1.5% of FLV Cured Tobacco in place of the Tatanka, just to see how it works.
