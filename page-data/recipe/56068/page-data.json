Simpson was a vaper when he was on trial. This would be his Dream Scream, this is the, Robert Kardashian (Vanilla Whipped Cream), Robert Shapiro (Vanilla Bean Ice cream), Johnnie Cochran (Sweet Strawberry) and F. Lee Bailey (Strawberry) of Strawberries and cream. This is a simple mix with a vivid and candy strawberry with undertones of heavy whipped cream.\r\n\r\nThe Strawberry\r\nCAP Sweet Strawberry and TFA Strawberry makes up the strawberry for this profile. This creates a candy strawberry with subtle notes of real strawberry.  This is a killer Combo at a ratio of 4:2. My go to Strawberry combo, credit goes to Wayne at Diyordievaping for this amazing combo.\r\n\r\nThe Cream\r\nTFA VBIC and CAP Vanilla Whipped cream creates this beautiful heavy cream note that will be there throughout the vape. These 2 together at 3% each is perfect and adds to the creaminess without adding anything more than what was needed. If you taste pepper with TFA VBIC then you can sub with Hangsen French vanilla Ice Cream at 1.5%.\r\n\r\nSweetener\r\nI need sucrolose to fully taste strawberry, it isn't needed in this mix if you don't like it. It adds to the candy profile of the strawberry but is not necessary to get the experience.","steep_days":"14 (SNV)","temperature":"470","recipe_score":5,"updated_at":"2020-12-12T18:29:22.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"4772","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Sweet Strawberry","flavor_id":"121","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Strawberry","flavor_id":"272","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Vanilla Whipped Cream","flavor_id":"1","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Vanilla Bean Ice Cream","flavor_id":"186","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Super Sweet","flavor_id":"2384","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":500}],"reviews":[{"user":"cyclereno","text":"Too damn good!
