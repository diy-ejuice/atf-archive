Why shouldn't this magnificent fruit not be the star of the show? Is it a complete bitch!! to work with well yeah some will say so but i hope this recipe shows it's actually pretty versatile.\r\nThe creation originally was to turn inawera plum into more a plum stone something to use as a profile and work further into recipes AKA my Victoria Plum Stone but that's boring so after many versions and how well these flavours used gelled a marriage was formed and a marriage is about working together in respect marriage is love , can you see where I'm going? Of course back to that beautiful word HARMONY.\r\nI wanted risk , risk is reward whether other people think this is worthy of that we'll only see but hopefully I did profile justice.\r\n\r\nLet's break down this marriage \r\n\r\nInawera Plum\r\n\r\nThis was my base something to work upon. It's a great fruit one that can be used in many profiles but the profile here is to make this flavour better. This flavour is a risk it's not widely used and finding a good plum flavour is also difficult. Inawera do a good job here is not mediicinal if used correctly go to high and it will be but at 2% its pretty balanced adding a authentic plum that's bright slightly earthy and semi sweet. It's more towards its outer skin in terms of flavour not its inner flesh the juicy inner is the only problem with this flavour that's the best bit and that's why this flavour isn't perfect but we can work on that with other flavours to create the missing link.\r\n\r\nFA Fresh FIg\r\n\r\nThis flavour is so fucking good again a flavour that misses out so many times and I don't understand that it's so versatile. It will work with almost any fruit especially darker fruits exactly the criteria Plum sits. This will sit perfectly inside the plum to mimick that inner core. Bite into a plum and behind the skin sits that sweet juicy fruity goodness. It's a very complex flavour with changing back notes that really work you get sweetness, juice, floral undertones it's very ripe, kind of mouthwatering and totally turns what some may describe a bland plum into one you want to return to time and time again.\r\n\r\nFA Fuji\r\n\r\nThe final ingredient to create this harmony the glorious threesome, at a small percentage the Fuji melds both the plum and fig together it adds some brightness some tart and added sweetener. It's a flavour that doesn't need a heavy hit on the percentage front it can overpower that's not what I wanted but for what it does add is some mystery you wonder why it's there it questions you but for the right reasons. It works so well with fig and it also ain't to bad with plum either.\r\n\r\nSo there it is a Victoria Plum but we know it better as HARMONY......\r\n\r\nMixed 60VG 40 VG","steep_days":"1 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"total_reviews":1,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:49:00.000-05:00","best_vg":"60%","views":"3314","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Fig Fresh","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Apple Fuji","vendor":"FA","millipercent":300},{"name":"Plum","vendor":"INW","millipercent":2000}],"reviews":[{"user":"ChewingPaintChips","score":"5","text":"this is a beautiful and simple recipe, just enough Fuji to keep you coming back.
