This flavor, to me, is very jam like so I figured it would be perfect for a pie filling. Blueberry muffin helps add a non-floral blueberry note as well as the added bakery for the muffin. I am not a fan of pie crust flavorings so I've been attempting to \"build\" a pie crust using a variety of different flavors. NR Sugar crunch also is used to enhance the pie crust note. Vanilla whipped cream was added to smooth and provide a light vanilla note.","steep_days":"5","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"total_reviews":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T07:01:32.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"718","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Blueberry Muffin","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Pie Crust","vendor":"FW","millipercent":500},{"name":"Sugar Crunch","vendor":"NR","millipercent":500},{"name":"Vanilla Whipped Cream","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1000}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"180161","name":"Rin's Blueberry Pie"}}}
