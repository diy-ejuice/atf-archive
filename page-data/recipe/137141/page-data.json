Both mixes are good and quite different from each other but for me what sets this one aside is addition of the VT BLOOD ORANGE CHAMPAGNE & FIZZY SHERBET, I don't know how VT makes such a realistic fizzy texture but its amaze-balls.  Champagne gives a slight boozy note with a touch of orange to help out the fruits in the mix, sherbet adds to the bubbly-ness with a hint of lemon fizz.\r\nFLV SANGRIA is heavier in tannins than the RF offer & has more of a booziness to it, think of it as being a deep red wine compared toRF being a fruity rosé.  \r\n\r\nFA LIQUID AMBER tops off the boozy note and adds some body.\r\n\r\nMEXICAN CACTUS gives it some juiciness/wetness \r\n\r\nBLOOD ORANGE, CHERRIES/CHRRYL/SHISHA LIME are for the fruits added to the sangria\r\n\r\nFIZZY SHERBET adds some more fizz and a touch of lemon.\r\n\r\nIts honestly sweet enough on its own but I enjoy it with some FLV sweetness or supersweet added to it and in the summer,  .50% WS23.\r\nSNV certified.\r\n\r\nI honestly rate and review every recipe I mix up on here (I consider it to be good etiquette) and would ask you to do the same!\r\n\r\nPlease do not post elsewhere without my prior consent.

The Liquid Amber and Blood Orange Champagne really turn that FLV Sangria into sangria, and the missing citrus is added, beautifully. It’s also legit fizzy. I’ve never had a fizzy sangria, but I think I’d like one after trying this. "}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"137141","name":"Flawed Vacations in Spain V2 (fizzy sangria)"}}}
