I'm absolutely in love... I haven't ever mixed a 120ml for myself until now....\r\n\r\nI don't think that the FA Papaya is necessary here, but I haven't tried this without it.\r\n\r\nI mix it for myself with .8% Super Sweet, but most people think that's crazy.. Please sweeten to your liking.

As a guy who loves the occasional sweet candy recipe, I fully endorse this one. Nicely balanced, full of flavor and juicy. If you have a bunch of coconut candy that you don't know what to do with, mix up a big batch of this, you won't be disappointed."},{"user":"dougc","text":"This is very tasty.
