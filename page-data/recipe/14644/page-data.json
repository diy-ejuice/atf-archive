It started as a clone but strayed so far from the source that it became it's own, completely original, much more delicious recipe. Reminiscent of Pop Rocks but with a more authentic fruit flavor.

It was ok as a snv but I liked it better after a few days. True to its profile and very tasty. Good job on this one."},{"user":"ID10-T","text":"And it is now one of my favorite S&amp;V recipes as well! Is indeed reminiscent of Pop Rocks, such an inventive use of Pink Champagne and Kiwi in a candy profile, and I get no throat hit from the sometimes harsh Swedish Gummy.  Great stuff.
