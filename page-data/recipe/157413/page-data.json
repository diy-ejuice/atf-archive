Forest Mix provides the backbone of the fruit profile.\r\n\r\nBumbleberry layers even more tasty mixed fruits into the mix, along with its wanted candy notes. \r\n\r\nRaspberry Sweet is used as another artificial fruit in the recipe. \r\n\r\nSour Ball Candy is such a great additive and lives up to its name. One of favorite newer flavors to play around with. \r\n\r\nI added a tiny bit of WS-23 as an afterthought, and I personally like it in there. Feel free to leave it out, though.

Sampled myself a bit. This mix boosts FF in all the best ways. First it's cold on the inhale with a hint of berry and then the berry rounds out on the exhale leaving you with a sweet, well rounded indistinct berry candy finish. Reminds me a bit of my first commercial juice I liked, Frozen Hulk Tears, minus the sour apple and watermelon. For a guy who doesn't normally like candies, this is perfect since it is sweet &amp; berry which I do like and just a really great way to feature Forest Fruit at 3%. This is Berry Good.","score":5}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"157413","name":"Backwoods Berry"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
