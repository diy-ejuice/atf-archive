The purpose of me sharing this is for you to use as base to put your own fruits or other flavors on top.\r\n\r\nFirst of all, my take on achieving a \"fizzy vibe\" in a recipe... As true effervescence is not (yet) possible to achieve in vape form, I feel that the sprite esque citrus notes from those flavors is as close as you can get to vaping a soda. Seeing as lemon/lime pairs well with pretty much any fruit out there, you'll be able to do a lot with this base.\r\n\r\nThe starting % are pretty low, but it's usually where I start when I make a new mix.\r\n\r\n**FLV Citrus Soda** at 1.25% is where I start to get that \"fizzy\" feeling from it. I think it's usually best between 1-2% depending on what your goals are and what other flavors your mix it with.\r\n**CAP Lemon Lime** is just straight up sprite almost. It's usually what I start to add more of if I feel the \"fizz\" is missing, and I think it works best between 1-3%.\r\n**WS-23** as cooling works extremely well here to really sell that cold fizzy vibe. If you haven't used it before, start at 0.25%. Personally I do 0.5% - 1% depending on current mood.\r\n\r\nI don't have anything against **sweetener** really, but I don't like using it with this base. I mean it's definitley still good, and it can probably help a lot of other flavors in different ways so I'm not saying don't use it. I do however think it takes away the tanginess of the citrus flavors, thus making it slightly less fizzy. It's a personal preference though, but I never use it with this base. Usually other fruits, florals, etc can be used as sweeteners or are inheretly sweet themselves.\r\n\r\nOther good flavors:\r\n**VT Fizzy Sherbet** can  be used in combination with any of the other too, around 1-4% is usually where I use this, depending on  what else is in the mix of course.\r\n**FA Aurora** also great lemon/lime flavor that can be used together with with FLV Citrus Soda or VT Fizzy Sherbet, use between 0.5-2%.\r\n**FLV Lime** be careful with this one, it's very potent. Start at 0.2%\r\n**FLV Pink Guava** the grapefruit note from this flavor can also help boost FLV Citrus Soda, that extra tang is usually needed if you want a soda type recipe. Seeing as this is not a lemon/lime flavor like the others, it's not pairing compatible with as many other flavors. But for the right recipe, this can be amazing.\r\n\r\nGreat flavors, but bad for making a soda:\r\n**FA Lime (Tahity) Cold Pressed** & **VT Persian Lime** - don't get me wrong, both of these are GREAT flavors for most purposes, but they are terrible to use in combination with FLV Citrus Soda. What they do is just put a \"lid\" on the fizzy notes. Makes everything flat in a sense. They add a great lime note, but if you use them high enough, they will take all the carbonated vibes out of the equation. I won't say don't use them, but I think there are better alternatives if you want to boost the lime in this scenario.","steep_days":"0 (SNV)","temperature":"420","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T19:16:09.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"1624","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Citrus Soda","flavor_id":"10083","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1250},{"name":"Lemon Lime","flavor_id":"83","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1000},{"name":"WS-23","flavor_id":"8085","vendor":"OTHR","millipercent":500}],"reviews":[{"user":"cxxxxp","text":"Thanks so much for your notes Bert!
