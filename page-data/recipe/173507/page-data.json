The Biscuit Base, Gingerbread, Gingerbread extra ginger, and Graham Cracker Clear make up the gingerbread flavor part of the latte.  I was not aiming to have it be like eating the cookie stuck in the cup, that's just decoration, I was going for the drink itself. So the cookie flavor is not super distinct as a crunchy cookie.  I think if I were going to go for that style I would have added FA cookie, some AP, and possibly some TFA Snickerdoodle. Just suggestions if you would like to try it out with this recipe. \r\n\r\nThe coffee layer consists of the VT Caffe Latte, and coffee milk froth. TO me the milk froth has no coffee notes in, but it's thick, creamy, and nearly buttery, which does help bridge the cookie flavors into the coffee. The Caffe Latte is not super strong, and competing with the creams and rich cookie flavors, it does need to be up at 4%. It was just enough for me to get a good stout coffee note for both me and my husband when we tested it.  If you mix this and find it isn't quite strong enough for coffee notes for you, you could easily bump it up by 0.5% until you reach a point that it works for you. I would imagine most average tasters will be satisfied with the coffee level in this recipe. If you're a little sensitive, like I am it could probably be lowered by 0.5%, as when I tried it at 3.5% level I could taste the coffee well enough, but my husband couldn't taste it over the creams. \r\n\r\nThe FLV Whipped cream hangs out on the top layers of the profile, caught most at the end of the exhale and slight aftertaste of whipped cream. \r\n\r\nI didn't find that it needed sweetener. However if you are someone who likes sweetener adding your preferred level to this recipe should yield good results. \r\n\r\nThis is a delightful recipe for the cool winter days coming up here in the Northern Hemisphere. If you like coffee and gingerbread you'll enjoy this flavor. \r\n\r\n","steep_days":"7","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"total_reviews":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-02T17:06:00.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"722","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Biscuit Base","vendor":"VT","millipercent":250},{"name":"Caff√® Latte","vendor":"VT","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Coffee Milk Froth","vendor":"VT","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Gingerbread","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1250},{"name":"Gingerbread Extra Ginger","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":350},{"name":"Graham Cracker Clear","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Whipped Cream","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1500}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"173507","name":"Jarvis- Gingerbread Latte"}}}
