It's delicious but it was a coil gunker, big time.","score":4},{"user":"HerrHut","text":"Don't know the original so can't comment on authenticity.  It's an okay caramel vape.","score":4},{"user":"Mr-G","text":"pretty good","score":4},{"user":"QueerYourVape","text":"I'm not a big fan at all. The caramel is too diluted and the FW salted caramel doesn't work at all, it waters the mix out completely for me. ","score":2},{"user":"KylezKloudz","text":"This stuff is the dank dank! And I didn't have caramel candy to use! I went with TPA Caramel (OG)... Job well done! Great use of the salted caramel!üëçüëçGuess I'll have to add caramel candy to the shopping list...","score":5},{"user":"photohap","text":"I vaped the original and found your version.  Yours is actually better.  I did a test as a shake and vape and it is absolutely AWESOME!!!!  Good job.  I made a second batch subbing out the salted caramel for butterscotch (FW) at the same percentage of 3.5 and it was a dream also..  If I could give you 10 stars I would.","score":5},{"user":"SpankyMcyanky","text":"Love this never had the original but just vaped this after a 3 day steep and it is awesome!!","score":5},{"user":"chief63","text":"Vaped this side by side with the original today.  Awesome work.   In the keeper folder.","score":5},{"user":"VaperKitten","text":"These are the flavors....spot on.....I like a little extra Salted Caramel but that's me but I mixed it exact and I actually have a bottle of Milk Plus to compare and this is it.  When I started mixing almost a year ago the two flavors I wanted to replicate if possible were Jam Monster Blueberry and Milk Plus....Milk Plus now DONE..  This doesn't just give you another Caramel and Cream this gives you the exact same Caramel and Cream  Bravo to the Creator for this one, I will always have some on hand as of now.
