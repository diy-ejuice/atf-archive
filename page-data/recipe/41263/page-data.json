This is a good one Creamy and Vanilla'ey, its yummy.  Not too sweet but sweet enough to be a sugar cookie.  Hope you like.  I made it, gave it a warm bath for an hour then left the cap off for about twenty mins and it was good to vape but steeping a week will give the best flavor....Love to all...Kim","steep_days":"7","temperature":"0","recipe_score":4,"total_reviews":1,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:49:15.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"2363","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Vanilla Swirl","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Biscuit","vendor":"INW","millipercent":750},{"name":"Butter","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":750},{"name":"Cream Fresh","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1250},{"name":"Hazelnut","vendor":"FW","millipercent":800},{"name":"Sugar Cookie","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Vanilla Custard","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Sweet Cream","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1000}],"reviews":[{"user":"jesuslizard","score":"4","text":"This is great, Not amazing but i really like it. it tastes exactly like something i would make. My only critism is that some people might find it to rich and intense But that is exactly what i like about it. Rich vanilla through out the vape with that buttery cookie exhale. The hazelnut helps along the cookie. Just a little bit to rich with the butter and vanilla. I don't think i will be able to handle any more once i finish my 30ml. I know non descriptive reviews are annoying so i tried to add something meaningful to the review. Either way good job. "}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"41263","name":"Vanilla Sugar Cookie"}}}
