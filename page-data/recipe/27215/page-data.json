Fresh Lingonberries, however much they appear to be midget Cranberries, are a unique treat. They're related to both Cranberries and Blueberries but share more similarities with the former in taste and the latter in looks. Lingonberries are, at their core, a sweeter, less tart and slightly bitter Cranberry.\r\n\r\nTPA Cranberry: \r\nI'll be upfront, this is not the best Cranberry for the job but it does get the job done. At 3-3.5% it creates all the similarities you expect in a Lingonberry without overpowering the necessary and subtle nuances of the other ingredients. Any higher and it becomes too tart and lower and it disappears.\r\n\r\nTPA Huckleberry:\r\nThis brings in the Blueberry notes without the musky sock smell and provides some of the bitterness that's lacking in TPA Cranberry. \r\n\r\nTPA Raspberry Sweet:\r\nAnd of course this one brings the sweetness. In this case it brings just enough to make it more palatable than the real thing but not enough to lose the authentic lingonberry flavor.\r\n\r\n","steep_days":"1 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T20:31:51.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"2793","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Cranberry","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Huckleberry","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Raspberry (sweet)","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1000}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"27215","name":"Lingonberry"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
