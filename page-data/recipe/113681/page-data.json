If you ever had \"mary jane\" or a \"Mary Jane\" Cookie you'll love it, otherwise you will never understand this recipe.\r\nTPA Mary Jane is the only concentrate for this flavour in the market. It's the most close we could be to the real thing. This flavour need an high percentage cause it will weak with steeping. 5% is a good place to be, because this can help you to mix&vape if you want a \"mary jane\" dominance, or wait at least a week if you want a good mix with cookie.\r\nFA Cookie is the best cookie out there in my opinion, the most accurate for an italian palate. 2% is the good percentage to fight with the initial strenght of Mary Jane.\r\nTPA butter at 0.35 is the way to give you that oily sensation of the real \"mary jane\" thing.\r\nCap Super Sweet is optional, I think this recipe need it, because \"Mary jane\" has that herbal bitter you may want to calm down with sweetener.\r\nPlease let me know what do you think about this recipe.
