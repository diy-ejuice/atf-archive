I basically just took the brulee and tobacco base from Long Gone Lonesome Blues and replaced the blueberries with strawberries.  \r\n\r\nThe name, Paradeisi, comes from the name of a village on the northern coast of Rhodes, Greece.  It is also the site of an annual Strawberry Festival.\r\n\r\nThe body of the creme brulee is FA Custard Premium and WF Vanilla Ruyan Custard.  The OOO Creme Brulee is there to add the torched sugar top to the custard.  The creme brulee part of the recipe, with the Vanilla Ruyan and burnt sugar of the OOO Creme Brulee, really plays well with the FLV tobaccos.  FLV Cured and Native provide the earthy tobacco backdrop for the strawberries and scorched custard.\r\n\r\nMixed at 60vg/40 pg and well-shaken, this performs well as a SNV.  I put it away and brought it back out a week later and it was perfect (in my opinion) . . . this is a creamy, strawberry, dessert tobacco.","steep_days":"7 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-06T20:44:08.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"1266","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Custard Premium","flavor_id":"9118","vendor":"FA","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Creme Brulee","flavor_id":"1783","vendor":"OOO","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Cured Tobacco","flavor_id":"630","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Native Tobacco","flavor_id":"4393","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1750},{"name":"Vanilla Ruyan Custard","flavor_id":"6066","vendor":"WF","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Shisha Strawberry","flavor_id":"1711","vendor":"INW","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Strawberry Sweet","flavor_id":"4745","vendor":"JF","millipercent":1250},{"name":"Juicy Strawberry","flavor_id":"8779","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"110368","name":"Paradeisi"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
