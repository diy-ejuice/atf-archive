This is mine. A tasty strawberry ice cream with a cookie exhale. I'm not a flavor reviewer so I'll do my best.\r\nJF Sweet Strawberry/TPA Strawberry Ripe is my go to when I want a candy and syrupy strawberry base. No real strawberry here.\r\nFA Cookie adds a nice cookie exhale to the vape.\r\nHS French Vanilla Ice Cream/LB Vanilla Ice Cream is a base I use often with fruits like blueberry and raspberry. It just works.\r\nFA Meringue is there as a sweetener and also adds a little extra element to the ice creams.\r\nFeel free to sub TPA VBIC @ 3%. Unfortunately I found out I was a pepper taster after I bought a 4oz bottle(scotch and flavor orders don't go together). \r\nEnjoy.\r\nedit: French vanilla ice cream HS lowered to 0.25%.\r\nThanks for the advice mlNikon.","steep_days":"7","temperature":"0","recipe_score":4,"total_reviews":1,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:49:43.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"1625","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Strawberry Sweet","vendor":"JF","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Strawberry (ripe)","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Cookie","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Meringue","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"French Vanilla Icecream","vendor":"HS","millipercent":250},{"name":"Vanilla Ice Cream","vendor":"LB","millipercent":4000}],"reviews":[{"user":"mlNikon","score":"4","text":"So this is pretty tasty, its a little heavier than I think I would do it. I think if you were to drop the HS French Vanilla down to .25% or .5% it wouldn't weigh the mix down so much and let those strawberries shine a bit more.
