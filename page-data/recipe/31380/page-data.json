Silly Rabbit is a mediocre flavor that I picked back up trying to mix something similar to Bird Brains from Cuttwood. I still haven't had it myself, but my 2 tasters say this is close, but better. Cap 27 is a nice base to play with, may just be my favorite cereal.\r\n\r\nEdit 5-16-17 I found Tricks Cereal to be an even better fit than SR! To be fair, chewymidget mentioned subbing it because of a lack of SR. It is really good with either, so you can't lose here.","steep_days":"7","temperature":"0","recipe_score":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-12T20:28:53.000-05:00","best_vg":"60%","views":"2491","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Tricks Cereal","flavor_id":"2148","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Cereal 27","flavor_id":"4163","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":6000},{"name":"Milk","flavor_id":"523","vendor":"FA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Cheesecake (graham Crust)","flavor_id":"152","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1000}],"reviews":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"31380","name":"Silly Bird"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
