That may have made him a little upset and when @MaxSavage heard that, he may have gone a little upset too. So I promised them, to make something with WF Cherimoya SC.\r\n\r\nDevelopment:\r\nMy initial try had Cherimoya at 3% blended with 1% WF Passionfruit and FLV Milk & Honey at 1.25% - and then the rest of this recipe, minus the TFA Papaya.\r\nThat was NOT a hit and tasted really weird. The taste I get from Cherimoya is that it's sort of sweet, but right there at the back-end, it has this sort of hops flavor to it. That just didn't go well with either passionfruit nor milk & honey.\r\nTo tame the back-end flavor of hops a little, but to still keep it in, I dropped Cherimoya to 1.25% and added in TFA Papaya at 1.5%, as I felt it would fit with the exotic thing I was after - and boy did that do the trick!\r\nThe pistachio does a nice little dance with both the cherimoya and papaya giving it a little sweet nutty twist. FLV Sweet Coconut joins the dance, and it's a straight rave of flavors!\r\nThe cream binds it all together and makes so very delicious, smooth and round.\r\n\r\n- WF Cherimoya SC 1.25%\r\n- FLV Cream 1%\r\n- FLV Sweet Coconut 0.75%\r\n- TFA Pistachio 3%\r\n- TFA Papaya 1.5%\r\n- CAP Super Sweet 0.25%\r\n\r\nYou can rip into this right off the bat! Want it more creamy, give it a day or 2.\r\n\r\nFeel free to mix, taste, review and enjoy!","steep_days":"0 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-06T20:44:54.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"987","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Cream","flavor_id":"604","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Cherimoya SC","flavor_id":"10123","vendor":"WF","millipercent":1250},{"name":"Sweet Coconut","flavor_id":"605","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":750},{"name":"Pistachio","flavor_id":"293","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Super Sweet","flavor_id":"2384","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":250},{"name":"Papaya","flavor_id":"252","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1500}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"154175","name":"Tears of Alfred & Max"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
