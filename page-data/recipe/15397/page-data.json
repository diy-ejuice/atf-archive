I have been talking about this damn thing for \r\n\r\nI got the idea from one of Wayne's live mixing streams while he was talking about how he wanted to make a black currant lemonade one days. So I shamelessly stole the idea. hah. \r\n\r\nI never made anything from scratch and simply mixed other people's recipes so this was a pretty fun experience. The idea was to get a sweet black currant lemonade with the lemonade being abit more dominant instead of just black currant in the face. \r\n\r\n\r\nFlavourart Black currant: I used this because out of the few black currant flavorings I tried this was simply the best. FA just make some of the best authentic fruits out there and black currant is no exception. Using this was a no brainer. Billberry is there to just enforce the black currant after the recommendations from the mixers collective. it just worked really well.\r\n\r\nFlavourart oba oba: This is a flavoring that randomly got added but somehow worked. Darren cole's timebomb recipe used it and he mentioned it giving a citrus flavor and I put it in the lemonade to test it and it really worked.  For some reason. \r\n\r\nLorann Lemonade: another no brainer. LA lemonade is just a delicious basic lemonade. I added CAP lemon lime to boost the lemonade.\r\n\r\nINW cactus: I used this simply for it's \"wet\" feeling.\r\n\r\nTFA sweetener: Lemonade needs to be sweet. \r\n\r\n70/30 VG/PG\r\n\r\nSteep: 2-3 days\r\n\r\nI have no idea how to do any of this so I apologise if this is abit rough and amateur looking. I have vaped about 60ml and I really enjoy it. it's a nice black currant with a strong lemonade kick to it. I hope people mix this up and give me their opinion so that I can grow and learn.
