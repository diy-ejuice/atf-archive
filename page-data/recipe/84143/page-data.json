The first seven iterations I was able to make something that resembled this staple drink. After a year away and trying different recipes, I came back to what brought me here. With more knowledge and more flavors, this is the closest I am willing to take this mix. \r\nSure, some tweaking could help round out everything a little more, but in the end, it satisfies.\r\n\r\nWARNING: INW Shisha Punch is potent as fuck. Use this at 1 drop per 15ml.\r\n\r\nTFA Brandy / TFA Kentucky Bourbon - What's an Old Fashioned without the brandy? TFA's version is a bit more thick and syrupy than I would like, it's subtle and blends in the middle while adding some body. Bourbon is used low to enhance the Brandy and give more of the alcoholic sting in the throat.\r\nTFA Brown Sugar / INW Shisha Punch - Big shoutout to @CriticalVape for finding the almost near perfect aromatic bitters mix. Even at low percentages, the amount of spice that is added really brings this vape to another level.\r\nCAP Lemon Lime - Us Wisconsinites mix our Old Fashioned with Sprite. Lemon Lime brings out that bright, somewhat bubbly feel overall. After a shake, it does have a plasticy off note, but dies down after about a day steep. \r\nFW Orange / FW Maraschino Cherry / TFA Sweetener - If you are unfamiliar with how this drink is made, a few cherries and a slice of orange are muddled in the glass with a sugar cube. These three flavors try to represent that mixture. While the cherry kind of hides in the mix, the orange tends to be upfront and overall present throughout the vape. Of course, sweetener enhances these notes. while rounding out the sharpness of the Lemon Lime and Orange. \r\n\r\nRight off a shake, it's completely vapable, I do recommend about a day or two to kill off those off notes.","steep_days":"2 (SNV)","temperature":"420","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-06T07:15:26.000-05:00","best_vg":"60%","views":"1195","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Brandy","flavor_id":"345","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Brown Sugar","flavor_id":"313","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Shisha Punch","flavor_id":"835","vendor":"INW","millipercent":100},{"name":"Kentucky Bourbon","flavor_id":"361","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Lemon Lime","flavor_id":"83","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Orange","flavor_id":"1362","vendor":"FW","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Maraschino Cherry","flavor_id":"1349","vendor":"FW","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Sweetener","flavor_id":"339","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":500}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"84143","name":"Wisconsin Brandy Old Fashioned"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
