The sugary graininess really helps the overall mix.\r\n\r\n**TFA Bavarian Cream** Playing as a not-so-shy emulsifier in this recipe as it serves to thicken and provide some vanilla boost, As well as providing a 'buffer' between the cream and pastry.\r\n\r\n**VT Banana Custard** Brings a light but noticeable banana note to the party. It's a creamy banana, Suitable sub would be TFA Banana Cream @ 1%\r\n\r\n**JF Yellow Cake** A little light handed here it serves as a cake backnote allowing the \"cream\" to shine a little more.\r\n\r\n**FLV Frosting** Up front vanilla with a little texture to bring to the game. Provides an almost gooey sugary perception to the cream filling. Pairs incredibly well with 'cake' concentrates.\r\n\r\n**CAP Super Sweet** When I mix this recipe I omit sweetener, But including it you'll find brings it more toward the traditional \"manufacturer\" variety.\r\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nBe sure to follow me on YouTube for future mixing updates:\r\nhttp://www.youtube.com/c/SteamCraft","steep_days":"7","temperature":"420","recipe_score":5,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:50:23.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"7110","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Yellow Cake","vendor":"JF","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Sugar Cookie","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Bavarian Cream","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Frosting","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Banana Custard","vendor":"VT","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Super Sweet","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":500}],"reviews":[{"user":"Skywxp3d","text":"Itâ€™s super delicious and tastes like the photo, one of my new favs, thanks!

I'm usually not a fan of most banana mixes but I wanted to at least try it, well because it's yours. That VT banana custard sits nicely on top and blends really well with the Bavarian Cream and Frosting. My only critique is that I would like a little more bakery underneath. I may try boosting the sugar cookie and yellow cake just for my own palate. Thanks for the excellent recipe! "},{"user":"gravi-tea","text":"wow!
