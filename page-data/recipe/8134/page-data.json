The first batch I threw together was good but I couldn't taste the vanilla, hence the title.\r\n\r\nNow it's a slightly buttery fig and lychee blend with slight tones of cucumber and vanilla. Great for a hot day and one of the few recipes I can continuously vape. Also I can't taste a difference between 3 and 9 mg nic.\r\n\r\nI've been vaping it between .25 and .5 ohms between 40 and 50w with zero gunk or discolor so that's what I recommend.\r\n\r\nShake and vape it's good, but the butter and vanilla pop after 36 hours.\r\n\r\nAs far as I can tell is free of Acetoin, Acetyl Propionyl, sugar, cat litter, bleach, kim Kardashian or any other harmful substances.\r\n\r\nI'm open to all feedback and highly appreciate it.

It took almost all of 30ml to decide whether I even liked it or not, which has to be some kind of record. I had trouble putting it down, mostly because it confused me and I was desperately trying to get a handle on it. Texturally, it's very moist and juicy, yet there's a density to it as well. It's chewy, like a chewing a fresh piece of mouthwatering bubblegum. But flavor is just this intensely confusing blend of sweet grape-esque fruitiness and bitter vegetal greenness, with buttery vanilla finish. There's so much going on, but not too much. I worry about what else goes on the mind that of someone would concoct such a thing as this, but I would heartily recommend it to anyone who is tired of vaping the same old stuff. Fans of Fiestas &amp; Fiascos by ConcreteRiver and the famous Grack Juice by Philosaphucker should definitely give this a shot. "},{"user":"Darklyspectr","text":"Good work man. Its tasty but not the style i like"},{"user":"Vurve","text":"This is such a fantastically weird and unique flavor profile...that I can't stop vaping!&#xD;\n&#xD;\nThe cucumber and fig make this an extremely fresh vape. It's both earthy and fruity. Creamy and bitter.
