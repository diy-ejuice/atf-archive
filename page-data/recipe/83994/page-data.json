Something subtle in the backend to throw off everything. Adds that soapy hand sanitizer.\r\n\r\nJF Marshmallow - The pods sit on a bed of chalk. At a higher percentage, the dry marshmallow adds to a whole bite.\r\n\r\nFA Orange / Lime Tahity / Liquid Amber / HS Blueberry - Based off the blue and orange pods, easily needed a fruit note. Orange is self explanitory while the Blueberry needed a more 'green' note sting. The Lime Tahity brings on that Pledge lemon, while Liquid Amber gives a gel feel overall. \r\n\r\nCAP Jelly Candy - Some plastic note, almost waxy coating.\r\n\r\nCAP Super Sweet - Wayne told me to.","steep_days":"1 (SNV)","temperature":"420","recipe_score":4,"total_reviews":4,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:49:52.000-05:00","best_vg":"60%","views":"10616","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Whisky","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Marshmallow","vendor":"JF","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Orange","vendor":"FA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Liquid Amber","vendor":"FA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Lime Tahity Distilled","vendor":"FA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Blueberry","vendor":"HS","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Jelly Candy","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Super Sweet","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":500}],"reviews":[{"user":"lococarnage","score":"1","text":"I have eaten many Tide Pods, they are delicious. They did quite well  on the presentation to make them look like candy. However, this recipe does not give the same burning sensation and blisters in my mouth and throat that I really enjoy.  You don't truly experience Tide Pods until you are coughing up bloody chunks of flesh.  I wish I could give you a lower score,  due to lack of authenticity.  Maybe 20% TFA Juicy Peach will get you a little closer.&#xD;\n"},{"user":"wh1skeyk1ng","score":"5","text":"I had everything except JF Marshmallow, so I subbed some good ol' sidewalk chalk, ground up in a 10% dilution of PG by weight and used 3%.  I must say this recipe is spot on, and someone obviously spent the time to match everything perfectly.  Kudos!"},{"user":"oddDrop","score":"5","text":"gave 5 stars for science..."},{"user":"Lulzor","score":"5","text":"Back in the day my friends and I would chow down on those dissolving dishwasher tablets. It wasn't until later in life we realized how much better a liquid based detergent could taste. &#xD;\nThis recipe brings me back to the first time we tried Tide's pods. The difference was astounding, as if my whole life had been a lie up to that point. Why bother with something that dissolves in your mouth when it can burst with flavor? It's like going from sweet tart double lollies to gushers. &#xD;\nIt truly cleansed my soul and vaping this recipe had similar, longstanding, effects. Like a primal awakening or an ascension.&#xD;\nTruly, this recipe showcases a mastery of flavor profiles and culinary discipline. I can't recommend it enough.&#xD;\n**You have not lived until you've experienced this recipe.**"}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"83994","name":"Tide Pod"}}}
