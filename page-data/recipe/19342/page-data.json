The Cuban Supreme is strengthened to give it a dry, woody and smooth tobacco feel.\r\n\r\nThe additives give it some organic appeal -- it accents all of the existing tobacco notes but does not negatively affect the existing tobacco base.\r\nThe Vape Wizard helps smooth the rough edges of of the NET and tap it into the core tobacco base profile. The Black Fire is hinted for a smokey almost analog like exhale.\r\n\r\nAll of these flavors (and additives) make the base tobacco profile of this recipe.\r\n\r\nThen the top note... of all the apples I [own] tried, Shisha Apple bond best with the tobacco profile with its own earthy flavor + NET base and turns the entire recipe into a polished Applewood tobacco that keeps you coming back for more.\r\n\r\nADD:\r\n1 drop of FA MTS Vape Wizard per 15ml (https://alltheflavors.com/flavors/flavourart-mts-vape-wizard)\r\n2 drops of FE Tobacco Absolute 50% Liquid Concentrate per 15ml (http://www.ecigexpress.com/diy-e-liquid/e-liquid-additives/liquid-concentrates/tobacco-absolute-liquid-concentrate.html)","steep_days":"5 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"updated_at":"2020-12-12T15:38:55.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"2726","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Desert Ship Blend","flavor_id":"431","vendor":"FA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Cuban Supreme","flavor_id":"433","vendor":"FA","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Black Fire","flavor_id":"458","vendor":"FA","millipercent":250},{"name":"Shisha Apple","flavor_id":"814","vendor":"INW","millipercent":1000}],"reviews":[{"user":"JJ1977","text":"After a few days, the apple mellows down to my taste and mingles with the tobaccos, not super ashy as i would like but its only been 4 days since i made it. After 10 days the tobacco shines through even better, but bangin around 2-3 weeks for that dirty ash tobacco / semi cigar type vape. After 45 days, the apple is just barely noticeable for that background note and the tobacco takes over for that nice dark tobacco vape. Overall definitely a keeper in my book. DAM AWESOME JOB BRO","score":5},{"user":"Fear","text":"This does not get enough mentions or enough attention. It is a \"dirtier\" tobacco vape but really good. It is also not a super in your face overloaded vape. It pairs well with breakfast, lunch, dinner, and beer or scotch. A true all day every situation tobacco vape. Well done Mark, WELL DONE.","score":0}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"19342","name":"Shisha Apple Leaf"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
