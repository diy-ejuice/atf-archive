However, if you can hold out for a couple weeks?... Wowza!! :)\r\n\r\nI hope you enjoy this one as much as I do!\r\nHAPPY MIXING, & HAPPY VAPING!!!","steep_days":"3 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"total_reviews":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-05T02:14:53.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"844","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Bavarian Cream","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Biscuit","vendor":"INW","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Custard Premium","vendor":"FA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Pistachio","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Pistachio","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Ry4 Double","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Super Sweet","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":500}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"183338","name":"Smokey Pistachio Custard "}}}
