Sugary sweetness\r\n\r\nFA Custard: I don't know if there's any kind of custard element to this juice. But this helps add body and  helps bring out that slight vanilla flavor to the glaze\r\n\r\nCAP Super sweet: I've got this at 2% which is really high, but the commercial juice is SWEET. Omit if you don't like sweetener.\r\n\r\nV3 notes:\r\n\r\nAdded some FA meringue and cap sugar cookie. Theres a bakery element I think but its light and sweet. I think cap sug cookie could work. Going to give this for a spin and see if I'm closer\r\n\r\nIf the idea of lemon sugar goo sounds appealing to you give this a try. \r\n\r\n\r\nOff the shake this attempt seems closer to the original. Gonna let it steep and test along the way.\r\n\r\n","steep_days":"7 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T20:32:47.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"1050","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Juicy Lemon","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Meringue","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Custard","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Marshmallow","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Super Sweet","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Meringue","vendor":"FA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Sugar Cookie","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":2500}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"124361","name":"Lemon Glaze v3"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
