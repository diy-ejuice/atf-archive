I am a fan of Banana nut bread -  it is   just a fantastic flavor and i wanted to use it as the cupckae base.   if you like more of banana you can add  additional banana cream .   it is a  solid cake/ bread base with a light banana  back note and some nutty texture, that becomes more prominent as  you increase the %.    The vanilla cupcake  is a very light cake with a strong vanilla  icing note, that works with the butter cream .    The butterscotch ripple adds   a creamy butterscotch top note that I wanted along with the vanilla brittle which adds some  more of that dry  nut note to the finish.    Over all this is a really yummy   simple vanilla bananna cupcake .   Best after 7 days \r\n   if you like that the sweet tooth  rattling type of  cupcake frosting then feel free to add sweetner \r\nIf you want more of a heavier butterscotch note feel free to add to it.    \r\n\r\nLOOKING for a group to learn about  mixing your own juice check out these groups and youtube channels  \r\nhttps://www.facebook.com/groups/diydownunder/\r\nhttps://www.diydownunder.com/ \r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/user/frank1360\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0xkeZFSG04","steep_days":"7","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"updated_at":"2020-12-12T15:39:57.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"2301","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Banana Nut Bread","flavor_id":"144","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":5000},{"name":"Butter Cream","flavor_id":"3","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Butterscotch Ripple","flavor_id":"1217","vendor":"FW","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Vanilla Cupcake","flavor_id":"187","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Vanilla Nut Brittle","flavor_id":"8580","vendor":"PUR","millipercent":3500}],"reviews":[{"user":"FreakShowBrewing","text":"Excellent recipe, I put this on my \"constantly\" make list","score":5},{"user":"Benoz","text":"Great recipe let it steep for 2 weeks nice job mec mod","score":5}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"100932","name":"Trippe Threat Cupcake (winner of  #DIYDOWNUNDERMAYCHALLENGE)"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
