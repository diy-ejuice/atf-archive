The coconuts are definitely the right choice here but I think coconut candy can be brought up a bit. The almond is spot on. My only real issue here is the chocolate. Australian chocolate is a good choice as far as chocolate flavors go but it suffers from bad off-notes. Perhaps bringing it down to 1% and adding something else to fill out the rest of the chocolate could work. If the chocolate is tuned in a bit more this would be absolutely perfect!"},{"user":"BigRed","text":"amazing so far"}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"163833","name":"Almond Joy / Mounds?"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
