I'm always game for a good cereal vape and this one is fantastic.  I gave it a proper test on a fresh build and as I was breaking in the cotton I could smell it.  Lucky Fuckin Charms.  The smell and the vape are as accurate as I've had in a cereal.  I get the milk  and cereal, but the best part is that bump in sweeteness you would get from one of the marshmallows at the very end of the exhale.  Very realistic.   Nice work BullDog..    ******NOTE   I had to sub with CAP Vanilla Cupcake at the same percentage and I did give this a 15 day steep.  Well worth it."}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"172090","name":"Lucky Fucks"}}}
