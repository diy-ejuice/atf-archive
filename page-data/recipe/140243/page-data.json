No sweetener needed. Fresh, soft and full of juicy flavor in your face. It’s fantastic. No steep. Inexpensive ingredients. Vape it or else. \r\n\r\nAdd menthol if you’re into it. Add sweetener if you want to punish your cotton. I don’t care. I won’t even know you did it. I’ll never even meet you. You kinda don’t even exist.

On the shake I got a tropical, mango style vape. While tasty, strawberry was no where to be seen. I mixed it again dropping the Mango and Juicy Peach each by 1% and the strawberry  came out. Not to the forefront as you would expect by the name, but it was there nonetheless. I did enjoy this experience and the vape from both mixes. Thank you for the creativity and the lesson on how these flavors interact. Flavors I may never have thought to mix myself. Kudos."},{"user":"Gordo","text":"I'm not here, . . . …. . . . .  . .  .  .  .  .&#xD;\n"}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"140243","name":"Strawberry Slayer"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
