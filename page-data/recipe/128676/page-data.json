The marshmallow isn't dry, and it has some wonderful vanilla cream notes to back it up. Then, once you've had some time to process the experience, you will begin to find the nice crispy rice texture and butter. The butter isn't in your face or dominating the recipe. It's a nice background note that let's the marshmallow take the lead. The texture is a wonderfully balanced sensation that lets you know you're getting something crispy without drying out the vape at all. On the exhale you will find even more of that awesome crispy texture, and the complexity will really start to come forward. The marshmallow actually has a nice toasty caramelized note. Nothing too extreme, but a recreation of what happens when you melt a metric ton of them in a saucepan with some butter underneath. The lingering flavor is a combination of a delicious grain note and wonderful creamy richness that will keep you coming back.\r\n","steep_days":"5 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"total_reviews":1,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:50:34.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"2735","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Cream","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":500},{"name":"Crispy Wafer SC","vendor":"WF","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Marshmallow (Vanilla)","vendor":"OOO","millipercent":1750},{"name":"Vanilla Cream Extra SC","vendor":"WF","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Meringue","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000}],"reviews":[{"user":"horizonism","score":"5","text":"Fuck yeah.
