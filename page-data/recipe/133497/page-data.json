Running my eyes over the dessert cabinet without leaving druel on the glass was a challenge I confess. \r\nThis recipe is a result of some notes I took as I enjoyed this fine Italian\"muffin like\" dessert that was dense yet fluffy around the outside with apple syrup and baked apple on top with some toasted coconut over the top. The gentle hum of vanilla through the middle was just lovely! So here is my version in a vape so I can not only re-experience that moment of delicious contentment but also share it with you! \r\n\r\nFirst I get to work on the dense cake notes which FLV Pound cake does so perfectly IMO. I add a little JF Yellow cake to fluff out the edges a little to offer the contrasting cake notes. I then splash in the FLV Apple Filling knowing this has all the apply syrupy and slightly jelly like mouth feel notes along with that perfectly cooked apple kissed pleasantly with a little cinnamon which is as close as I think is possible to replicate in a vape. However there was a unique slight spiciness in the middle that was so reminiscent of a fresh home baked gingerbread my wife made recently that I was now extra grateful she did so I could make a wise decision to use a little Caps Gingerbread. It also helps this vape with some extra slightly baked edge texture which is a big bonus here.  As I referenced back to my notes I am reminded of the slight balance of soft caramel like yumminess I experienced, so hence a bit of FA Caramel was always going to be the best concentrate for that. For the Coconut I wish there was a toasted coconut concentrate that would fit here however the excellent authentic mouthfeel that VT Desiccated Coconut offers so well, it would be a crime not to use it in this profile. A little kiss of some FLV Smoked Butterscotch to help replicate those baked edge  notes was added then the patience of a 7 day steep begins. While vapable off the shake this recipe becomes bellissimo after 7 days. The wait was well worth it!
