It's more \"pink\" and isn't nearly as harsh, but still damn sweet. If you've had the original, i'm interested in your thoughts about this remix. \r\n\r\nMade on \"Live Mixing: Pink Punch Lemonade\" \r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGYRvxWUILk","steep_days":"2 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":2,"updated_at":"2020-12-12T18:29:53.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"15202","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Italian Lemon Sicily","flavor_id":"78","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Lemon Lime","flavor_id":"83","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Lemon Round Candy","flavor_id":"1954","vendor":"OOO","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Pink Lemonade","flavor_id":"3535","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":5000},{"name":"Super Sweet","flavor_id":"2384","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1000}],"reviews":[{"user":"Dripsofrenic","text":"Itâ€™s ok but not nearly as layered the round candy also gives it to me an off note that lingers on the palate, I find this harsh compared to the original and the strawberry element is lacking in this recipe compared to the original the original I pick undertones of flv pink guava as well this recipe seems to tart  but is still a nice recipe non the less just not very close ","score":2}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"104750","name":"Lemon Twist: Pink Punch Lemonade REMIX"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
