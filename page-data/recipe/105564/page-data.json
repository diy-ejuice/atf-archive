Peach and lemonade make such a great combination.  Give this refreshing juice a try and I think you'll agree.\r\n\r\nLA Lemonade - this is my go-to lemonade, for me there's just none better. \r\n\r\nCAP Italian Lemon Sicily - I went back and forth with this flavor but I really love the way it works here to make that authentic lemon flavor really shine.\r\n\r\nLA Peach - I tried many peaches, solo and in combination but just didn't really get that flavor I was looking for.  Finally, I decided since I'm using LA Lemonade, why not try it with the LA Peach .... and it really works here.  You get a nice subtle peach flavor that you can definitely taste but isn't so overpowering that it mutes the lemonade.\r\n\r\nCAP Super Sweet - use whatever sweetener you like, or no sweetener if that's the way you like it.  I'm sure it's still great without it. \r\n\r\nI think I might try 1% Koolada in my next batch but just like with the sweetener, that's all personal preference.   I hope you all enjoy this one as much as I do.\r\n\r\nEDIT:  I actually really enjoy this after a month long steep.   You lose a little bit of the lemonade flavor but the peach is just so nice.   This LA Peach is definitely becoming one of my favorites.","steep_days":"4","temperature":"0","recipe_score":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-10T19:00:36.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"1709","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Lemonade","flavor_id":"951","vendor":"LA","millipercent":5000},{"name":"Italian Lemon Sicily","flavor_id":"78","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Peach","flavor_id":"961","vendor":"LA","millipercent":5000},{"name":"Super Sweet","flavor_id":"2384","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":500},{"name":"Koolada 10 Pg","flavor_id":"280","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":500}],"reviews":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"105564","name":"Sweet Peach Lemonade"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
