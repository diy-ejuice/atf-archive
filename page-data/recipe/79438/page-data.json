That buttered croissant can easily be interpreted as buttered toast and it is the defining flavor in Jam Monster! I started with 2% but unlike most other flavors, the more you add the more present it is. As for the blueberry, I've tried just about every combo. After hearing Wayne praise HS Blueberry, I had to try it, and he was not wrong! Juicy Strawberry in this mix pairs with the blueberries very well and in this case, it adds a candy quality to the jam. I may not love Jam Monster, but the remix is delicious while staying similar to the original!","steep_days":"3 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-05T09:51:51.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"2312","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Blueberry","flavor_id":"2076","vendor":"HS","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Blueberry","flavor_id":"646","vendor":"INW","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Croissant SC","flavor_id":"9022","vendor":"WF","millipercent":5000},{"name":"Juicy Strawberry","flavor_id":"8779","vendor":"FA","millipercent":2000}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"79438","name":"Jam Ghoul Blueberry (Jam Monster Remix) #REMIXMONTH"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
