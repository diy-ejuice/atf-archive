So i mixed it with some FA apple pie and threw in some LB vanilla ice cream. After week steep and some slight tweaking i am happy with what I came up with for the dmc Apple challenge. \r\n\r\nNeeds atleast a week steep 2 weeks is even better ","steep_days":"7","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T20:32:27.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"1070","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Double Apple","flavor_id":"45","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":2250},{"name":"Apple Pie","flavor_id":"551","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Vanilla Ice Cream","flavor_id":"1511","vendor":"LB","millipercent":4000}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"89444","name":"Apple ice cream #DMC Challenge"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
