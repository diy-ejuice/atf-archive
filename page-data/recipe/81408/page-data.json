Hints of cedar, sweet Honeysuckle, and a bright tobacco leaf. FE Angelica is probably one that not a lot of people have tried, and I’ve had it for a while and never really used it. But it’s pretty tasty here. It adds a bit of a sweet herbal taste to the mix. It’s just a tad dry, but I don’t think too dry. Vanilla Tahiti I used not so much for the vanilla, but to try to mellow out some of the higher notes I get with FLV Native. You won’t really be able to taste any vanilla- or at least I don’t. \r\n\r\nI created this for /r/mixersclub, and maybe it’s just placebo because I was thinking a lot about when I lived in the country and used to take long walks in the middle of nowhere, but to me the taste of this is very reminiscent of the smell of fresh country air. Minus the smell of farms.
