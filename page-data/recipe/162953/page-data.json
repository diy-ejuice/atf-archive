CAP cereal 27 alone is not enough to class as cornflakes and needed help so FA corn, again at a 10% dilution can work wonders in a recipe if you sparingly and correctly... golden syrup is self explanatory and sweetener is subjective so drop it out if you wish.\r\n\r\nIf you like this recipe and what I do then please rate and review ❤️\r\n\r\nATF does not have FA corn 10% dilution in the database ","steep_days":"7","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"total_reviews":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T22:33:44.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"2141","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Corn","vendor":"FA","millipercent":35},{"name":"Golden Syrup","vendor":"VT","millipercent":1750},{"name":"Apple Pie","vendor":"FA","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Cereal 27","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Super Sweet","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":500},{"name":"Saskatoon Berries SC","vendor":"WF","millipercent":250},{"name":"Jammy Berry","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":300},{"name":"Raspberry Jam","vendor":"VT","millipercent":2750}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"162953","name":"Cornflake tart"}}}
