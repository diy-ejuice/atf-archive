However it turns out that I am not really into vaping toasted juices lol.  I did have to use a different rice crispy treat and add some caramel though so that could be the issue.  I am still giving this a great review because it was very accurate and she did a great job on this recipe.  It tastes like honey nut cheerios covered in sweet sticky goo with hints of cream in the mix.  "},{"user":"ooooNaSuGamisoooo","score":"5","text":"Heaven!!! Awesome!!!
