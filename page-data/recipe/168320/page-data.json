That recipe is damn good and I enjoyed it. I wanted to add on to this for Fresh03's French episode. I will take it one step further to make a Mango-Basil Vacherin. It is a mango sorbet with a basil infused vanilla ice cream, garnished with lime zest. \r\n\r\nAfter I let it sit and try it, there might be some changes in the basil and lime wedge. The basil might be beat out right now with all the citrus, and the lime wedge fades like crazy, so the sit is required, but i might not have put enough in it.
