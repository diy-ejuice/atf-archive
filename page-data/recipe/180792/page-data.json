Australian Brush Fires!\" on SaturDIY'ing with fresh03 and Friends! and I made this recipe for Corvape who requested a strawberry macaron which is different from a macaroon (that's the coconut treat), thing is, I can't taste strawberry in vapes. \r\n\r\nMB MECH_MOD_RN helped me out with the strawberries. I do get something from VSO Strawberry which I used instead of FA Red Touch.\r\n\r\nNotes to come!\r\n\r\n\r\nEnjoy, be queer and vape on!\r\n\r\nCécile aka Queer You Vape\r\n\r\n[Photo credits: https://www.atelierdeschefs.fr/]","steep_days":"2 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"total_reviews":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-05T19:51:15.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"848","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Marshmallow (Vanilla)","vendor":"OOO","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Powdered Sugar","vendor":"OOO","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Almond Cookie SC","vendor":"WF","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Marzipan","vendor":"FA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Pudding Base","vendor":"VT","millipercent":250},{"name":"Strawberry (Juicy) SC","vendor":"WF","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Red Touch (strawberry)","vendor":"FA","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Almond","vendor":"FA","millipercent":250}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"180792","name":"Macaron à la Fraise (Strawberry Macaron for Corvape)"}}}
