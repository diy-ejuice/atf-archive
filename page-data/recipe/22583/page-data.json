TPA Banana Cream isn't too authentic, which makes it right for what we're emulating.\r\n\r\nThe Cake Base (JF Yellow Cake 2.5%, CAP Vanilla Cupcake 4%): Even though the cake we're emulating looks really yellow, any more YC than this gives us the wrong flavor. Still needing more cakey-ness, CAP Vanilla Cupcake is a perfect match in flavor.\r\n\r\nCAP Butter Cream 1.5%: This flavoring is really special in the mouth-feel department. It makes the cake seem oily, without making things too heavy. It's also very sweet, which this recipe needs.\r\n\r\nFA Soho 0.5%: Soho makes a great replacement for acetyl pyrazine (which it seems to be rich in). Helps to give a cooked effect, or a crust, to bakeries.\r\n\r\n2 week steep suggested. The flavor and texture changes considerably after the first week. Developed at 70/30.","steep_days":"14","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"total_reviews":null,"updated_at":"2020-11-25T15:31:40.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"1285","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Banana Cream","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Bavarian Cream","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Yellow Cake","vendor":"JF","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Vanilla Cupcake","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Butter Cream","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Soho","vendor":"FA","millipercent":500}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"22583","name":"Cabana in the Clouds"}}}
