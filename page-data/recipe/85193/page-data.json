The cookie is light, not overpowering with a great vanilla custard taste. The pairing of the two custards give it a good thick mouthfeel without VC1 taking over and drowning everything out. I didn't get much coconut out of this, even using Macaroon at the 2% it was very faint to where I had to search for it. It could be because I let it steep quite a bit longer than 5 days. I was still very pleased with this, and have made a little more. I personally added .25% FA - Coconut just to bump the coconut up a little and have the creamieness meld well with the custards.
