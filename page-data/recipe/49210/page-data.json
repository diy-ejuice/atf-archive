Everyday it steeps it seems like a different back note comes out to play. You get a little caramel, butterscotch, honey, and even a little mocha/coffee  all while vaping a cigar type flavor. I just accented all the back notes i already tasted in the tobacco flavors and I really like what it created. I enjoy this after a 10 day steep it seems like everyday a different back note comes out to play making this a very interesting tobacco mix.  This is my first tobacco flavor I have released to the community and would really love to here what you all think in the reviews...\r\n\r\nI used Connecticut shade as my cigar leaf wrap and the mixture of red burley and oriental tobacco as my cigar filler. \r\nI then used all the rest of the flavors  purely to help bring out the back notes in the tobaccos. I feel like this tastes just like a honey backwoods cigar. In no way do any of these other ingredients over power the tobaccos at any time. This is a tobacco through and through with some delicious back notes.","steep_days":"10","temperature":"420","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T19:14:59.000-05:00","best_vg":"75%","views":"1843","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Biscotti","flavor_id":"4403","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":250},{"name":"Mocha","flavor_id":"617","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":750},{"name":"Caramel","flavor_id":"612","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":500},{"name":"Butterscotch","flavor_id":"613","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":750},{"name":"Milk & Honey","flavor_id":"609","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Connecticut Shade","flavor_id":"4365","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":250},{"name":"Red Burley","flavor_id":"4355","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Oriental Tobacco","flavor_id":"4401","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1000}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"49210","name":"The Back Notes"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
