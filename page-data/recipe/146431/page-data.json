FE Red Demon is no longer available, so I used 1.25% INW Am4a instead, plus 0.5% FA Cocoa and 0.5% FA Coconut (Red Demon had notes of cocoa and coconut). I also put 4 drops per 30ml of FA Bitter Wizard in all my mixes. It neutralizes the sweetness of the VG and allows you to taste the flavors much more clearly. The result really works. Itâ€™s got a mild sweetness to it, enough to give a smoothness to the tobaccos but not so much that it becomes a dessert mix. This is one of my favorite of the thirty or so tobacco mixes in my rotation.","score":5}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"146431","name":"Demon Church Tobacco"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
