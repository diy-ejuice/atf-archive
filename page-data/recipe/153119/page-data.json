They work  well together for a  more lush  creamy style   cheesecake rather then a true Italian cheesecake .  The vanilla  is a top note that is perfect with the cherry and almond as it is supportive  and not overpowering here \r\n\r\n**Graham Cracker and Almond Cookie**  are used to create the  crust for this square .  FW graham cracker is  true grainy  honey graham cracker and one of my favorites .    When combined with the almond cookie  for some more of the  buttery shortbread cookie works well for the  bakery base of the square\r\n\r\n**Marzipan**  by FA is   used to really boost that almond  note ( almost like an amaretto liquor)   and add some intrinsic sweetness -  if you want to pull out  more of the cherry note  more use INW marzipan which can have a slight  candied cherry note ","steep_days":"7 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"total_reviews":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-06T22:03:27.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"1173","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Almond Cookie SC","vendor":"WF","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Almond Custard SC","vendor":"WF","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Blackcherry Jelly Bean SC","vendor":"WF","millipercent":750},{"name":"Graham Cracker","vendor":"FW","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Marzipan","vendor":"FA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Yes, We Cheesecake","vendor":"INW","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Vanilla Custard Cheesecake","vendor":"OOO","millipercent":2000}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"153119","name":"Almond Cherry Cheesecake Bars "}}}
