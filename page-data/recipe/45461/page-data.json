This was my first attempt but it turned out way better than I anticipated so I decided to share it.\r\n\r\nFLV Milk Chocolate & FLV Sweet Coconut - after tasting Hear the Girls Come (ID10-T) I couldn't separate these two. I needed more chocolate so I bumped up the percentages of both.\r\n\r\nFW Cherry Crush - I have a ton of cherry flavor concentrates and most of them taste medicinal. I needed a cherry pie filling type flavor like you would use in a real chocolate cherry cake and this one seemed like it would fit.\r\n\r\nI plowed through this as a S&V but it tasted even better after a week.","steep_days":"7 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-02T07:30:48.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"1239","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Milk Chocolate","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":250},{"name":"Cake (yellow)","vendor":"FW","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Cream Cheese Icing","vendor":"LA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Sugar Cookie","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Vanilla Custard","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Sweet Coconut","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Cherry Crush","vendor":"FW","millipercent":2000}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"45461","name":"Chocolate Cherry Cake"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
