The Year of Mixing Challenge -  \r\n\r\nMy hero, the Eleventh Doctor.  Out of the all the Doctor Who's I've watched Eleven is my favorite...cause bowties are cool. In the first episode as the new doctor, Eleven visits a young Amelia Pond where he finds he likes fish fingers and custard.  Well I'm not making fish fingers and custard as a flavor, so I'm going with deep fried apple slices dipped in custard.  So this inspired by recipe adds one of my favorite fruits - cause I'm not a super fan of strawberries.  \r\n\r\nGoing for a straight fried apple dipped in a funnel cake type of coating, no cinnamon, no spices.  \r\n\r\nIf you'd like to participate in the Year of Mixing find the Flavor-Pro group and join us for our weekly challenge - all mixers welcome - and there will be some prizes.

The apple notes were brought up a touch, but not much and just a little more custard notes. Otherwise it is quite tasty.  All changes have been made to the recipe as it reads now.

Great stuff. I need to give this a little bit more time to steep but already it's coming together wonderfully. I thought I would crave some cinnamon or spice in an apple bakery type vape, but with the deepness of the funnel cake and nuance of the custards the vape fleshes out very nicely leaving me satisfied. The apple blend is delightful, you get some brightness and tartness from the apple pop, and some more deep apple from the red apple. All in all, I will be happy to finish this bottle! Thanks for the recipe =)","score":5}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"87960","name":"Week 7 - Apple Fingers and Custard"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
