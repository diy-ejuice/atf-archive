Can appeal to non tobacco lovers, as it is non smokey or leafy, but it is complex, dense and satisfying with a tropical sweetness that makes you smile (quite rightly!).\r\n\r\nSweet Guava is such a staple, but has little to do with an actual guava fruit (which is too pungent and weird). This is a sweet, non descript dense, fruity flavor with a delicious ripe banana note. This note pairs great with the chocolaty additives Red Burley and Connecticut Shade are, Virginia is in the background to smooth out and give a little somewhat.\r\n\r\nLike the supposed meaning of Donovan's song, as he put it: \"being mellow, laid-back, chilled out.\" Nothing to do with smoking banana strands or electrical bananas, for that matter.\r\n\r\nED: I enjoy it on a few days steep as I'm accustomed to the initial zing of FLV baccos, but it will balance out in a week, as @Xist kindly points out in the review.","steep_days":"3 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:51:09.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"1173","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Connecticut Shade","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":500},{"name":"Red Burley","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1250},{"name":"Virginia Tobacco","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Sweet Guava","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":2000}],"reviews":[{"user":"Xist","text":"TBH, I didn't like this off of the shake.  I do believe I revisited after a few days as well and wasn't overly fond.  I just picked this back up after nearly two months, and BANG.  Deliciously tangy, smooth....holy shit it's good.  I'm not sure at what point it melded together to the point I like it, or maybe I was just lazy on the shake, but damn...This is going into the cycle.  I tend to like these strange, undefinable flavors.  Well done Jayway, and I'm glad I gave it a third chance."}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"166856","name":"Mellow Yellow"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
