TPA VBIC works fine on its own @ 3%, but FA Vanilla Ice Cream complements it nicely. This combination also allows the TPA VBIC to be used at a lower concentration, which will help to greatly reduce or even eliminate the \"peppery\" flavor that some people get.\r\n\r\nTPA Malted Milk + FW Hazelnut is the malt. These two flavors work amazingly well together as a malt base. TPA Malted Milk is extremely \"potent\" to me – using it at anything more than 1.25-1.5% completely overpowers everything else in a mix, while I see many recipes using it much higher. So you might need to increase the TPA Malted Milk from the 1% I am using here.\r\n\r\nCAP Whipped Marshmallow + TPA Marshmallow obviously gives the marshmallow. I chose CAP Whipped Marshmallow as the main ingredient here, since its light and airy mouthfeel is a great way to help keep things from being bogged down. I tried TPA Toasted Marshmallow, which actually worked out pretty well, but I felt the recipe was starting to get a bit too \"busy\". If you would like to try it anyways, then go with 1.5% TPA Toasted Marshmallow and 1% CAP Whipped Marshmallow.\r\n\r\nINW Shisha Vanilla boosts the vanilla flavor up a tiny bit. I didn't go very high here, because it would overpower the delicate marshmallows.\r\n\r\nTPA Whipped Cream is there because all milkshakes need whipped cream.\r\n\r\nCAP Vanilla Custard at the small amount of 0.5% doesn't alter the flavor much at all, but it helps tie everything together. I started out at 1%, but it added too much \"butteryness\", and began to encroach on the lighter flavors, like the whipped marshmallow and whipped cream.\r\n\r\nIt's definitely vapeable as a S&V, but definitely needs at least a week to meld.\r\n\r\nThis also works great as a base for other milkshake recipes. Depending on what you want to add, consider omitting the malt (the combination of TPA Malted Milk and FW Hazelnut). For example, when adding some caramel, cake / cookie, or especially some chocolate, keeping the malt might definitely be a great option. But if you want to add strawberry, banana, or other fruit, you probably would want to leave it out. One exception is when adding a cereal (like FW Fruity Flakes, or any of the dozens of other cereal flavorings available), where I'd recommend dropping the TPA Malted Milk but leaving in the FW Hazelnut. In a cereal recipe, FW hazelnut at low concentrations, as here, does a great job transforming the milk and cream flavorings into the milk left over after eating a bowl of cereal.\r\n\r\nNote: I vape almost exclusively on RDA's at fairly high wattages (100-120 watts on average, and rarely anything below 80 watts), so my recipes tend to have less amounts of flavoring than average. Depending on your hardware and preferences, you may need to increase everything slightly. Using 1.25x - 1.5x what is listed here will put the total flavor concentration at 11.25–13.5%, which is more in line with what seems to be typical.","steep_days":"7","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-06T14:09:09.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"1012","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Vanilla Bean Ice Cream","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1750},{"name":"Whipped Marshmallow","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Vanilla Ice Cream","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1250},{"name":"Malted Milk (conc)","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Marshmallow","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Whipped Cream","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Vanilla Custard","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":500},{"name":"Hazelnut","vendor":"FW","millipercent":500},{"name":"Shisha Vanilla","vendor":"INW","millipercent":500}],"reviews":[{"user":"cxxxxp","text":"This just sounds delicious.
