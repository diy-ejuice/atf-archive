Unfortunately, I've still got a 30 ml bottle on hand and I'm going to use it. Feelfree to sub it with your favorite yellow cake flavor. I've been working on this for awhile...my goal was to create something that shows the versatility of FA Fig.  It's a beautifully bright delicate flavor that doesn't get the attention it deserves and works well with Apple. The tartness of Fuji works perfectly here and is the prominent fruit flavor. Pistachio and walnut add a nice touch of nutty buttery goodness.  Salted Caramel provides balance and ties everything together. For a change of pace I try V2 with uses FA Caramel as it's also delicious. Anyways, I hope you like...just a little something different that's a departure from my normal strawberry/blueberry vapes","steep_days":"5 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"total_reviews":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-02T17:04:29.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"762","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Acetyl Pyrazine","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Cookie","vendor":"FA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Cream Fresh","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Fig Fresh","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Apple Fuji","vendor":"FA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Meringue","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Vienna Cream","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Caramel (salted)","vendor":"FW","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Cake (yellow)","vendor":"FW","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Pistachio","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Walnut","vendor":"FA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Butterscotch (natural)","vendor":"FW","millipercent":500}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"29531","name":"Caramel Fig Apple Tart V1"}}}
