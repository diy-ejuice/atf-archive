My whole plan was to take the best watermelon, strawberry and apple I had and mix them together. Thankfully it turned out really good. If you don't have PUR watermelon you could sub in LA Watermelon at a higher percentage as they both have that candied watermelon feel. The marshmallow and meringue are just there to add a little depth to the fruits, this isn't a \"creamy\" recipe at all. \r\n\r\nI hope you like it.

Accidentally forgot about it for a month. While I'm sure it's very tasty after a short steep, it doesn't hold up well over time. Something, I'm guessing the meringue, gives it a kind of warm cheesy off-note. Also the fruits are indistinct, melded together, not necessary a bad thing, just an observation. Would try this again without the meringue or without such a long steep. ","score":3}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"46842","name":"Willing Thunder"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
