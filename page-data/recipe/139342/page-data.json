We ordered the Masala Dabba and Tandoori appetizer, which features fresh naan and a selection of chutneys (the pickled mango was divine) and butters. It was all great, but one of the standouts was a cinnamon, sugar, and rose butter. The marriage of rose, cinnamon, and butter was a revelation.\r\n\r\nI knew that as a recipe I wanted it to have a starch element.  I did not have any ideas for naan (aside from using Shyndo's bread stone . . . but sliced white bread is not naan), so I opted for a rice pudding type note.  Upon further research I discovered that there was an Indian rice pudding with rose called gulab phirni.  I set about trying to recreate that experience in vape form.  \r\n\r\nThe butter is made up of a small part FA Butter and WF Buttercream frosting . . . the actual butter in the appetizer was quite sweet, so I used the WF to boost the FA and bring some sweetness to it.  FA is extremely true to form but is DAAP heavy, and  I din't want to overdo it too much.\r\n\r\nThe cinnamon is a combination of CAP Cinnamon Sugar with FLV RIch Cinnamon . . . the CAP serves to soften the bite of the FLV without taking away from the cinnamon spice itself.  The CAP Cinnamon Sugar adds to the sweetness, as well.  0.4% Rich Cinnamon can be quite heavy, but it plays so nicely with the rose at this level.  \r\n\r\nThe rose is the only one I own INW Dzika Róża - Wild Rose.  I'm excited for the release of FLV Rose Essence to remix this recipe, but, for now, this is what I've got and it works.  I may pick up FA Rose when the FLV drops and try this out with each.\r\n\r\nThe rice pudding is a combination I have used in the past  FE Sweet Rice, VT Rice Base, and FLV Vanilla Pudding.  FE is closer to a jasmine rice, where VT is more like basmati rice, in my opinion.  The two serve the starchy purpose that I intended, with the Vanilla Pudding mixing them into a glutinous pudding.\r\n\r\nLook, if you read this far, it's safe to say your interest is piqued.  This in not a vape everybody is looking for . . . maybe nobody aside from myself . . . but the buttery mixture of rose, cinnamon, and sugar is truly delightful.  It's not an ADV by any stretch of the imagination, but it serves as a welcome break from the norm.","steep_days":"2","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T22:33:25.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"987","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Sweet Rice","flavor_id":"7727","vendor":"FE","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Rice Base","flavor_id":"8954","vendor":"VT","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Rich Cinnamon","flavor_id":"638","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":400},{"name":"Cinnamon Sugar","flavor_id":"8741","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Wild Rose","flavor_id":"893","vendor":"INW","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Butter","flavor_id":"494","vendor":"FA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Buttercream Frosting SC","flavor_id":"8361","vendor":"WF","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Vanilla Pudding","flavor_id":"4433","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":3000}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"139342","name":"गुलाब फिरनी - Gulab Phirni"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
