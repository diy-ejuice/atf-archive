So, to kick off the upcoming season we created a Cranberry Thumbprint.   This is a shortbread cookie infused with an almond essence and topped with just a \"thumbprint\" of  cranberry jam.  Super simple profile, but intricately designed.

Real good. Perfect for the season. The bakery notes from the cookie help compliment the dark cranberry jammy notes. Im sure after more steep the flavors will develop even more. Thanks for sharing.
