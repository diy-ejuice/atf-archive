I don't know how to link the recipe, but definitely check his out. I didn't have to do too much to it so he definitely gets the credit. I see a lot of people asking for custard recipes so I wanted to share this. His mix was what turned me onto this profile. It just needed some changes to better fit what I wanted.\r\nIf you don't have the Cream Charlotte you can just leave it out, it's good either way. I like it because it helps push that dense bakery note and has a rich quality I haven't found in another flavoring, it's one of a kind...and no doubt loaded with DA/AP.\r\nI vape this mix more than anything else and I'm constantly tweaking it is why I never released it. The CAP graham cracker with the butter pecan adds perfect dimension to this and can't be subbed. The original uses TPA brown sugar at .75% but I prefer that dark note that this needs from FLV Milk & Honey...brown sugar can be obtrusive. Don't be afraid to play with this, or any recipe you like. That's why we DIY, to get exactly what we want. If you love custards and bakeries as much as me, I suggest you get cream Charlotte. Mix this up my custard addicts...it's seriously amazing!\r\n*The FW yellow cake can be subbed for JF if you don't want to use it.*\r\nAs with all heavy mixes, they get better with time. I actually like this a lot at one week, but if you can push it 2+ weeks you'll love it even more.","steep_days":"14","temperature":"450","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T23:35:44.000-05:00","best_vg":"65%","views":"3610","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Milk & Honey","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":500},{"name":"Butter Pecan","vendor":"FW","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Cream Charlotte","vendor":"BF","millipercent":500},{"name":"Graham Cracker","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1250},{"name":"Sugar Cookie","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Vanilla Cupcake","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Vanilla Custard","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":5000},{"name":"Vanilla Swirl","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Cake (yellow)","vendor":"FW","millipercent":1500}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"51530","name":"Custard Cake"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
