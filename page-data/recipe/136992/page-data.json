The fat that coads your mouth and lips 😋\r\n\r\nThis is probably not a all day vape, but could be used as a whipped cream base.\r\n\r\n\r\n","steep_days":"3","temperature":"0","recipe_score":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-10T19:00:59.000-05:00","best_vg":"80%","views":"1003","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Whipped Cream","flavor_id":"193","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Cream Cheese Icing","flavor_id":"2380","vendor":"LA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Butter","flavor_id":"147","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Sweet Coconut","flavor_id":"605","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":750}],"reviews":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"136992","name":"Wah-Pah!"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
