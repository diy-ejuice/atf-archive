Rhubarb being the main thought leading into this journey. The other was Game of Thrones. My friend is about 3 episodes away from her world bein rocked and it brought some inspiration to my mixing table lmao\r\n\r\nCAP rhubarb sitting comfy at 2.5% is perfect, at 3% it sorta took over the recipe, was very bright. I backed that up with FA raspberry at 1% and CAP sweet currant at 1% originally but i bumped it a smidge to 1.2% play more alongside the rhubarb. Adding in FLV apple filling at .8% to this adds some spice notes as well as a baked apple \"vibe\" to bring the other fruits all together into more of a cooked pie filling. I kept it low because of the addition of rich cinnamon and granola, and didn't want this bogged down by spices either. \r\n\r\nThe \"pie crust\" here is made from a combination of WF sugar cone and WF crispy wafer. I wanted something sweet but light and \"crunchy\", and 2% CW backing up 2.4% SC really blends into this delicious sweet sort of wafer-cone cookie addition.\r\n\r\nFLV granola at .4% and FLV rich cinnamon at .2% add the cumbly crust on top. A cinnamony baked oat addition that really adds to the recipe.\r\n\r\n2.4% tpa vanilla bean ic, 3% lb vanilla ice cream and 1% fresh cream are an optional \"a la mode\", does not need to be in the recipe, but creams things up and adds another dimention if you'd like.\r\n\r\nI used 1% flv sweetener in this.\r\n\r\nI recommend a 1 week steep for everything to calm and blend together perfectly. But it is vapeable after a day.\r\n**don't listen to me, let this sit a month ;)**\r\n\r\nLove y'all! Hope you enjoy this :)","steep_days":"21","temperature":"0","recipe_score":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-10T19:01:25.000-05:00","best_vg":"60%","views":"1310","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Apple Filling","flavor_id":"4376","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":800},{"name":"Crispy Wafer SC","flavor_id":"8366","vendor":"WF","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Granola","flavor_id":"8555","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":400},{"name":"Berryl (raspberry)","flavor_id":"412","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Rhubarb","flavor_id":"10169","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":2600},{"name":"Rich Cinnamon","flavor_id":"638","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":200},{"name":"Sugar Cone SC","flavor_id":"9050","vendor":"WF","millipercent":2400},{"name":"Sweet Currant","flavor_id":"10171","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1200},{"name":"Vanilla Bean Ice Cream","flavor_id":"186","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2400},{"name":"Sweetener (sucralose)","flavor_id":"2308","vendor":"FW","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Vanilla Ice Cream","flavor_id":"1511","vendor":"LB","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Cream Fresh","flavor_id":"540","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000}],"reviews":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"169491","name":"Red Wedding Crispie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
