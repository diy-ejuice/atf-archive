If you want something fruity, calming and lightly floral then look no further. \r\n\r\n(can make without the black tea, its good either way)\r\n\r\n\r\nDescription by /u/theamdman on reddit:\r\n\r\n\"This juice is something different to try, it's nothing like the testosterone filled bottles that caress TFV12 tanks all over the country, but rather something to taste and enjoy a juice that is just pleasant, and not something savory to leave a bland yet powerful taste, instead a flavor that becomes more and more enjoyable, as if it's a fine wine that gets better as your taste buds acquire the caressing of a gentle, tropical hibiscus used to complement an orange stage with hints of black tea putting vocals in the instrumental. It itches an itch that you never even noticed that you had and gives your self a vape that really makes you taste and smell every bit of this nebulous nebula.\"\r\nAnother thing I've noticed is that this juice also seems to be better at a lower power. It's really soft.
