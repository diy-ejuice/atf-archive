It’s all that’s been missing from LMT/LMP profiles... it brings that marshmallowey white meringue on top and the slight toasted sweet brown sugar-esque crust on top of the meringue. If you like Lemon meringue pie you can’t miss out on this :)","steep_days":"1 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:50:44.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"9549","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Flapper Pie SC","vendor":"WF","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Lemon Meringue Tart","vendor":"VT","millipercent":6000},{"name":"Lemon Sicily","vendor":"FA","millipercent":800},{"name":"Super Sweet","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":300},{"name":"Cookie","vendor":"FA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Pudding Base","vendor":"VT","millipercent":500}],"reviews":[{"user":"lionhrt9","text":"I'm flavor ADD so there's only a handful of mixes I come back to and this is one of those!  Well done sir!"},{"user":"alwayskashed","text":"so damn good. seriously. like why are you here? go make this shit."},{"user":"AAP-DAAP-DERP","text":"I'm blown away by the fact that this banger is great straight off the shake. Beautiful work, Nick! I might try to swap FA Lemon Cicily because I have a feeling that it will fade quickly, but FE Lemon should do the work for that... nonetheless it's a GREAT one! Thanks!"},{"user":"Deftohms","text":"I hate lemon flavors. I LOVE this so much that feel a lack of oxygen in my body due to how frequently I feel the need to taste/vape this. You win. Thank you. "},{"user":"wadeyloops","text":"When  I first tried VT Lemon Meringue Tart solo it didn't quite do it for me as it was a bit dry and overcooked sort of. The addition of WF Flapper Pie really fixes  that aspect up along with the touch of pudding base. This was still missing that sweet lemon tang I was hoping for so I added 5-6 drops of VT Sour Lemon to my 18ml sample and I enjoyed it even more. This might benefit from using WF lemon squares in the base too but I do not even have that flavor yet so I think that a bestest yet recipe is still in the making. This is still a great recipe and I would probably rate it 4.5 stars at the moment but I am rounding it up to a 5 as it is still 100% worth mixing if you like this profile. "},{"user":"Untitled","text":"by far the best yet, well done mate!"},{"user":"Nickinthemix","text":"Very tasty! I have already vaped 200ml of this recipe. Perfect balance here. The flapper pie is an amazing concentrate and works perfect here. Congrats for the recipe and thank you for sharing this."},{"user":"corvape","text":"Super tasty recipe Nickevz. The combination of flapper pie and vt lemon meringue tart is awesome. I was getting ready to play with both of these flavors and found your recipe, I am glad I mixed it up. This will absolutely become part of my regular rotation. Thank you for sharing!!"},{"user":"hibbadoray","text":"Dude. This is excellent. I've never tried a lemon meringue pie vape before because I thought I wouldn't like it. My bad. This is delicious. I get a very defined meringue taste, the lemon custard or curd or whatever you call it and a tasty crust. It's everything I could've hoped for in a lemon meringue pie vape. Well done."},{"user":"TamVapes","text":"Wow.  A banger off the shake, The FA Lemon Sicily definitely adds that extra something to to the Lemon, and the bakery is perfect.  Love what the Flapper Pie is doing here for the creamy toasty notes.  Just a well rounded beautiful, delicious recipe.  I will update review in a few days if any changes.
