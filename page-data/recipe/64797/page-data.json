That said it sounds good to me, and after developing this recipe, I will have to break out the ice cream machine and give it a go.\r\n\r\nüéÉ Stone\r\n\r\n\r\nLet's face it, the üéÉ flavorings on the market all fall short, in the one area that counts, the üéÉ!!! Add to that that the spices are completely out of balance, with the allspice kicking you right in the nuts. I wanted to build the üéÉ from the ground up. \r\n\r\n TFA yams- is a good base to build off of for a pumpkin. This flavoring has a nice sweet, starchy, üéÉ like taste. TFA yam is a little weak, and does lack some characteristics of a cooked squash.\r\n\r\nFA caramel- First thing first wanted to give it a roasted flavor, after trying Coke cans grilled pineapple, was certain that FA caramel would do the trick. In addition it help sweeten the profile, and  is a great accent, for butter pecan, and  pralines as well.\r\n\r\nFLV eggnog - next we needed to add those traditional pumpkin spices. Eggnog gives us vanilla, cinnamon, and nutmeg, without the ever offensive allspice, found in all üéÉ spice flavorings. The custard aspect of this flavoring, also helps give the pumpkin a smooth, creamy, and buttery finish.\r\n\r\n TFA honeysuckle - IMHO üéÉ tends to have a smooth, creamy, sweet, and somewhat floral flavor, this is where this is where honeysuckle comes into play. Known to pretty much go with everything honeysuckle, helps give the recipe light floral note.\r\n\r\nIce cream\r\n\r\n\r\nHS French vanilla ice cream - Quickly becoming a staple flavor in the community, and for good reason. It is a great ice cream flavor, that doesn't need any help. And at  higher percentages starts to take on a malty,  somewhat cheesy note, reminiscent of mascarpone.I really push the percentage on this flavoring since we are dealing with some really rich, complex, and strong  concentrates. The vanilla and custard from eggnog pair beautifully in this recipe, and I am very happy with the results.\r\n\r\nAccents\r\n\r\nFW butter pecan - There's a reason flavor West butter pecan is a staple flavoring, it is delicious!!! In this recipe, on top of adding some complexity, the nutty note pairs perfectly with all the creams, and that dark squash flavor we're going for. Butter pecan makes everything deeper, and richer. Although  butter pecan is a great flavor, it tends to bully everything around, I don't want it to take over the recipe, and at 1.5% it is well balanced and sits in the background right where I want it.\r\n\r\nFLV pralines - is something of a Hidden Gem. I have yet to see it used in a recipe here on all the flavors. That might be in park but this is such a conundrum of a flavor, I can't decide whether it taste like pecans, hazelnuts, almonds, or all of the above. this flavor is the perfect accent to boost butter pecan, and adds a great level of complexity. In  the words of Coke can, ‚Äú fuck you it's delicious, just try it assholes and thank me later.‚Äù\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSubstitutions\r\n\r\nHS French vanilla ice cream-  there is some debate about this, but personally cannot discern a difference between HS ice cream, and HS French vanilla bean ice cream, and so this is a no-brainer swap for the exact same percentage.\r\n\r\nEggnog- LA eggnog and RF eggnog are the other two flavorings in my arsenal. They both worked, but lacked some of the body, that FLV brought to the table. That said what we're looking for from the eggnog is combination of nutmeg and cinnamon and my thoughts are most eggnog should fit into the profile just fine.\r\n\r\nCaramel -  I tried a few variations here and had success with butterscotch Ripple, and plane butterscotch. Dulce de leche would also be a suitable replacement, to be honest this really just came down to preference I have been falling in love with FA caramel all over again.\r\n\r\nYam - probably the most unique flavor in the recipe, I had to order mine from Wizard labs and I'm not sure where else you can get it, except potentially buying direct from TFA. The only other flavor company that I'm aware of selling a yam or sweet potato flavoring is OOO, and I currently own none of their offerings. I would love to get some feedback from somebody who does. \r\n\r\nFW & CAP üéÉ spice, would make suitable replacements for the pumpkin Stone, keep in mind you will be getting a healthy dose of allspice with both of these flavors.\r\n\r\nAgeing\r\n\r\nAlthough good as a shake and vape, butter pecan, and the creams really stand out at the 3-weeks. And just keep getting better with time.\r\n\r\nThanks for reading hope you give it a shot. Feedback and criticism Are welcome and appreciated.
