TbH sometimes i prefer her to vape it because the room note on this one is so spot on. I wish I could say the same about the taste. Her opinions on juice dont mean shit tho. Today I made a pumpkin pie latte which came out pretty decent. Blindly she told me it tasted like a strong alcoholic sex on the beach, WAY OFF.  \r\n**Popcorn**  \r\n*flv popcorn/ cap cereal 27/ tfa butter*  \r\nIm digging flv popcorn and actually can see it being used in things other then a popcorn vape. Ive heard ppl mix it in a s&c and get good results. Its buttery and full of caramel very solid but those who know me and have been trying my stuff accuracy matters to me and 9/10 times youll see me layering the shit outta my recipes. This is no different. Rick in his flavor review mentioned adding cap 27 to help this puppy along, i ran with it. Cap 27 adds some more of that texture i craved. Maybe other AP heavy stuff will do even better? \r\nAm i the only one that ODs on the butter at the movies? Lets add some tfa butter.   \r\n**Honey Glaze**  \r\n*fa honey/ fa marzipan/ tfa brwn sugar*  \r\nI def played around more with this part of the recipe then the actual popcorn. FA Honey used very sparingly is pretty tasty to me, but am I a simple kind of guy? NO. FA Marzipan had given me sweet honey notes so that was a no brainer. The 3rd of this combo is where i tried other stuff. I have flv milk& honey in the early versions but the darkness level of that concentrate was getting to me. I landed on brwn sugar and was pretty happy with the sweet buttery sticky fingered glaze that all popcorn should have.  \r\nI was damn tired of inw sesame collecting dust and honestly i was thinking of what could i use it in and this profile came to me thanks to inw sesame sweets. Ive had some sucess with it in the past as its great for a sesame candy brittle. Us puerto ricans call it Ajonjoli.  \r\n Cant wait to see what you guys think. Maybe im way off and should stop listening to my wife. \r\n","steep_days":"5","temperature":"0","recipe_score":4.7,"total_reviews":3,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:49:39.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"3023","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Popcorn","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Sesame Sweets","vendor":"INW","millipercent":500},{"name":"Butter","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":350},{"name":"Honey","vendor":"FA","millipercent":200},{"name":"Marzipan","vendor":"FA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Brown Sugar","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Cereal 27","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":2750}],"reviews":[{"user":"ID10-T","score":"5","text":"Yes! No, no, I mean FUCK YES! Now THAT is how you create an e-juice recipe! I had the pleasure of trying an earlier version of this that had a little less Cereal 27 and less crunch and popcorn forwardness to it, but it was already delicious and interesting. I can’t imagine how much work went into this updated version to perfect it, but it’s a marvel to see all those difficult ingredients working together to perfect something like this. I couldn’t possibly have guessed something this perfect would emerge from all those ingredients, But just like he did with Golden Oreo Pudding, Mills knocked this one out of the park. It’s buttery sesame popcorn with a sticky sweet honey glaze exactly as promised and I am in love with it. "},{"user":"Cmnderb","score":"5","text":"I love this!  Sesame brittle candy has been a fav of mine since childhood.  So when I found INW Sesame Sweets I had to get it.  I'm a new mixer so had been searching for a recipe to use it.  When I found this recipe I knew it was the one and I was not wrong.  It's fabulous!  Like Tootall I was a bit leery of the marzipan but it fits perfectly.  The decsription is spot on.&#xD;\nI get the buttery popcorn and a hint of sesame on the inhale but the exhale is where it all comes through for me.  Sticky, slightly sweet sesame popcorn, honey and then just a hint of almond.  Super recipe thanks so much for sharing.  Will be added to my daily rotation!"},{"user":"Tootall","score":"4","text":"My first impression was I don't really like this but it wasn't bad I felt like the marzipan stuck out for me. But as I kept vaping it my palate must have started to except the marzipan because it stopped being so present and started to really enjoy this mix!! It is exactly what you describe in your profile and strangely addicting. I also love how you stepped outside the box with this recipe and made something so special to you!!! I am definitely gladi ordered the ingredient's to male this recipe I may try it without the marzipan but who knows I am not having a problem smashing this 30ml bottle I made the way it is now so I should probably leave it alone. Thanks for this strangely addicting recipe great work I needed something different!!!!!"}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"67771","name":"Honey Sesame Popcorn"}}}
