Potent stuff but it fits.\r\n- FA Forrest Mix (forest fruits) just fits in, as this is a berry fusion. And as forgiving as it is, we cranked this good stuff up.\r\n- CAP Golden Pineapple was one of the wilder ideas we had, as this mix needed something sweet and balancing to the berries. And it was welcomed with open arms.\r\n- FA Lime Tahity Distilled was the obvious choice to hold berries in balance along the pineapple. It's the binding element here.\r\n- INW Cactus is known to add juiciness, so that's what we did.\r\n\r\nNo sweetener is needed for this mix, but if this isn't sweet enough for you, may we suggest FW Sweetener.\r\nAdd your choice of coolant if you like.\r\n\r\nEnjoy!\r\n\r\n","steep_days":"1 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"updated_at":"2020-12-12T17:12:36.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"1785","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Lime Tahity Distilled","flavor_id":"415","vendor":"FA","millipercent":750},{"name":"Blackcurrant","flavor_id":"545","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Forrest Mix (forest Fruit Mix)","flavor_id":"453","vendor":"FA","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Yakima Hops","flavor_id":"3478","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Golden Pineapple","flavor_id":"61","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Cactus","flavor_id":"647","vendor":"INW","millipercent":250}],"reviews":[{"user":"GlassMemories","text":"I was in the discord when this was being brainstormed, and I did not think it would work. But I was very pleasantly surprised by this, and glad I picked up the Yakima Hops to make it. Dark, sweet fruits on the inhale with zesty citrus and the slightly bitter, floral notes from the hops on the exhale. Honestly I'm still not sure how this works, because it doesn't seem like it should...but if anyone knows their way around weird mixes, it's these guys - and they managed to create something pretty amazing that's quite unique, tasty, well-balanced, and greater than the sum of it's parts.
