I don't really think the ingredients need much explanation it's kind of obvious why I used what I did but here is short explanation. The tres Leches cake is the white cake and tres Leches fw. A tres Leches cake is a cream cake  of sorts so my frosting mixture actually helps with the cream cake profile. My frosting is made with a combination of cream cheese icing, meringue, and vanilla whipped cream.  It's a nice light frosting perfect for the profile. So the most obvious part is my fruit toppings I used a combination of kiwi, and pineapple flv and golden pineapple by cap. If you don't have pineapple flv just leave it out and boost the golden pineapple. Other than that I love this mix it's a delicious vape. A great fruity bakery for the summer time fun.. Enjoy!!\r\n\r\n\r\nI used .35 flavorah sweetness. You can use or don't use whatever sweetener you prefer but this is what I used.","steep_days":"4","temperature":"420","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T12:46:53.000-05:00","best_vg":"75%","views":"1742","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Tres Leches","vendor":"FW","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Cake (White)","vendor":"FW","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Meringue","vendor":"FA","millipercent":750},{"name":"Cream Cheese Icing","vendor":"LA","millipercent":750},{"name":"Vanilla Whipped Cream","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Kiwi","vendor":"FA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Golden Pineapple","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Pineapple","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":750}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"104962","name":"Tres tropical"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
