I love it from day 7. All is coming together at that point. No harsness from the Lime.&#xD;\nThe Lime and the Vanilla blend so well to such a good taste. Creamy, rich, yummy. Thanks for publishing the recipe."},{"user":"RockyHarlow","text":"Absolutely fantastic. After a week or two, this is sunshine in a plastic bottle. Deep, rich cheesecake. Crispy graham crust. Balanced lemon cream. Perfect. I did omit TPA French Vanilla, but even without it this is easily one of my most returned to mixes. I know this recipe is over two years old but it's still damn solid."},{"user":"Smoky","text":""},{"user":"tsmebro","text":""},{"user":"CriticalVape","text":"Awesome recipe. Smooth and balanced.
