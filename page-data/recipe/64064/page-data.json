I have always really liked tfa kettle corn but until last Friday on live mixing I never thought of using it as a corn bread. Well it works and I really like it!!!!üòÅüòÅüòÅ So here it is my Southern Corn Bread Pudding!\r\n\r\nCorn bread:\r\nTfa Kettle Corn and capella sugar cookie and of coarse some butter I chose tfa butter. This creates a delicious buttery corn bread.\r\n\r\nThe pudding:\r\nI used flavorah vanilla pudding and LA cheesecake and a little holy vanilla for the main pudding. I then added a little inawera creme brulee to add the caramelized/cooked feel to the mix. I used LA cheesecake because it is a more creamy cheesecake than the other options and it really seems to work in this recipe. \r\n\r\nWhen this is combined it is quite magical. It will need a 5 day steep due to the uses of capella sugar cookie and LA cheesecake and inawera creme brulee but it is worth the wait. Enjoy!!!!","steep_days":"5","temperature":"420","recipe_score":5,"total_reviews":1,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:49:35.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"3816","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Kettle Corn","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":5000},{"name":"Sugar Cookie","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Vanilla Pudding","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Creme Brulee (yc)","vendor":"INW","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Butter","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Cheesecake","vendor":"LA","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Holy Vanilla","vendor":"DFS","millipercent":1000}],"reviews":[{"user":"mlNikon","score":"5","text":"Really tasty stuff!
