It didn't actually come from him, but after working on the recipe, its so similar, I might as well right? This is a mix you want to let and sit for about a day or so and then vape. The sticky rice does get starchy if you let it steep a too long. I still enjoyed the mix, but I felt it was much better early on. My findings also fit @Shyndo and his assessment on that as well. FLV Cream is used, to meld the mix together, while bringing only a neutral cream and mouthfeel. The coconuts that are used, are both creamy and sweet as well. TFA Coconut is not used because it is a little more natural, which is no what I was aiming for in a coconut cream.","steep_days":"1 (SNV)","temperature":"400","recipe_score":3,"updated_at":"2020-12-01T11:56:05.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"1770","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Sweet Rice","vendor":"FE","millipercent":5000},{"name":"Taro","vendor":"HC","millipercent":1250},{"name":"Cream","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Coco' (coconut)","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Coconut Candy","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Super Sweet","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":250}],"reviews":[{"user":"MotherPunker","text":"I really didn't care for this, that being said, Ive come to discover that I REALLY dislike taro. To me it tastes like something found in the bottom of a teenage boy's gym bag &amp; definitely not something that should be eaten or vaped lol.....must be my palate, I dunno....If you do enjoy taro, you'd probably like this, it IS a well crafted recipe though, without the taro, its just creamy coconut rice.  I can see it being nice with other fruits added"}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"79059","name":"Purple Sticky"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
