It is just wonderful. I had to sub USA Red Mix for the Cavendish but it worked well for me. I have the Cavendish in my wish list. Thanks mgimes! ","score":5},{"user":"Rawtune","text":"Really love this recipe. The soho and vanilla give the cavendish a lot more of a well rounded flavor. I think it developed a lot more after the first week or two. Will try with FLV cream next time","score":5},{"user":"lolwtf","text":"Hell yeah.  This shit is delicious.  I have FA Cream Fresh but per Fear's comment I went with FLV Cream at the same %.  Im sure the profile is still the same though.  This one is definitely sweet and light on the tobacco, but it's perfect for me.  Thanks ","score":5},{"user":"Fear","text":"To start off with, Cavendish is \"flavored tobacco\" depending on the tobacconist it can be any variation of tobaccos and flavorings but usually a mix of Kentucky, Virginia and Burley that have been treated, pressed then fermented. The flavorings are usually dark fruits, nuts and liquor. So you have a mellow smooth sweet tobacco that is flavored. Which is pretty much what INW Cavendish Type brings to the table. The addition of the caramel and vanilla are a welcome addition to this blend, as is the FA cream fresh I would like to have seen a thicker cream used here to pair with the INW Shisha Vanilla but not a negative by any means. I would like to also mention that vaping this has a distinct \"room note\" It is a pleasant \"someone's grampa is smoking a pipe\" kind of room note but does not linger forever. This is very much a \"tobacco dominant\" recipe, but also one that is accessible to desert tobacco lovers and non tobacco vapers as well. I cannot wait to see how this develops on a longer steep. Excellent recipe!","score":5},{"user":"Seakow","text":"Not much to say. Just a simple yet damned good tobacco. Good work on this one mgrimes.","score":5},{"user":"AlexYanchunis","text":"A real banger here. I mixed this up and at first taste its everything you want from a good vanilla pipe.Its got the smoothness of the Vanilla from the shisha and cream fresh that will only get smoother and help round out the cavendish from INW. To make a long story short I am not a normal tobacco vaper however this recipe may have changed my life..
