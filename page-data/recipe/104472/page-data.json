Mixing recipes for the warmer time of year and playing around with NF Ginger.\r\n\r\nCAP Sweet Mango is the main flavor. As in a lot of punch drinks there are bright citrus supporting flavors. CAP Lemon Lime brightens the mix and the CAP Juicy Lemon pushes the sweet lemon flavor a bit more forward. NF Ginger gives a nice sweet ginger spice to the fruits. If you ever need a ginger flavor in any mix I would highly recommend this. A tad of CAP Super Sweet and it is complete. You may add 0.25% more or omit it depending on how sweet you want it. You may also add some WS-23, Koolada, or mint for some cooling/mint flavors that also play very well in this.","steep_days":"3 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-05T18:48:12.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"2065","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Sweet Mango","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":6000},{"name":"Juicy Lemon","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":500},{"name":"Lemon Lime","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Ginger","vendor":"NF","millipercent":250},{"name":"Super Sweet","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":250}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"104472","name":"Mango Punch"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
