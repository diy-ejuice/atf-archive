Splice the mainbrace! Why in th' name 'o Posideon would ye blend a milkshake wit' landlubbin moo juice when ye could mix it wit' delicious coconut milk? 'N what kind 'o scurvy corsair would ye be if ye didn' load 'er up wit' rum? \r\n\r\nCAP Vanilla Bean Ice Cream be th' meat 'n potatoes, ye sea rations 'o sorts, 'o 'tis milkshake. Avast! Don't be ye substitutin TFA VBIC in here; 'tis too buttery fer 'tis shake made fer pepper tasters, CAP's version has a wee bit more milkiness. \r\n\r\nFW Bavarian Cream be sweet, rich, heavy, 'n dense, but not so dense dat ye can't be slurpin it through a straw. And hoist the mainsail, to be sure! It makes th' difference betwixt ice cream 'n milkshake har. \r\n\r\nFA Jamaican Special: Aaarrrgh, maties! Rum! Right up thar wit' rapin' 'n pilliagin' on a pirate's priority list. 'Tis one's got some extra dark brown sugar, almost molasses, aspect t' it, which might be out 'o place in many profiles that call fer lighter rum, but them fit right in har 'n keep 'tis shake from needin' any o' dat coil rogerin' super sweetener. Yo-ho-ho! \r\n\r\nShiver me timbers! TFA Coconut Candy, when used low enough t' keep 'er from gettin' plasticy, be a jolly 'hore 'o a concentrate, a right burried booty wit' a taste reminiscent 'o th' white goop inside a Mounds bar... and o' th' coconut flavor in yer trusty Parrot Bay 'n Malibu rums, to be sure. Rums! Har, it also helps gift us more 'o dat milkshake mouthfeel, me hearties.
