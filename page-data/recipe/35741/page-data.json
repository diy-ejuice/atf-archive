Part 2 in my Seven Of Nine/Borg Trilogy*\r\n  \r\n**Description:**\r\n  \r\n\r\n*Coolness and incredible arrogance are traits of this Borg Drone. For this reason, an assimilation of Polar Blast seemed relevant. FA Polar Blast IMHO, gives a far more realistic 'cooling' effect than the traditional koolada does here. FA Fresh Cream/FA Meringue was resilient and would NOT \"adapt to service us\". Therefore, injection tubules infused the distinctiveness of FA Vienna Cream/TFA Vanilla Swirl in its' place. Believe it or not, this simple recipe was far more difficult to perfect than any of my previous recipes. But it was definitely worth all my extra work. Fortunately, taste is not irrelevant.\"*\r\n   \r\n  \r\n*This recipe, after a 5 day steep proves you don't need VBIC, CAP Vanilla Custard or Meringue to make a thick pudding or ice cream! And this one is simple to boot! Enjoy!!*\r\n  \r\n\r\n \r\n \r\n*Star Trek: Voyager & all its' characters are the sole property of Paramount. No profit has been made on this recipe.*\r\n\r\n**Do not take it upon yourself to copy and publish this recipe over to ELR.
