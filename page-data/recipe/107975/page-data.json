I figured I would share a quick and tasty recipe I've been enjoying the past few days.\r\n\r\n I won't go in depth too much with the flavor notes. LB Blue Raspberry is the star of the recipe along with a few complimentary friends.:\r\n\r\nINW Raspberry Malina: boosts those top candy raspberry notes to really make LB Blue Raz pop.\r\n\r\nFLV Boysenberry: adds another dimension of candy \"blue\" and is an all around amazing flavor.\r\n\r\nSC Green Apple: I have tasted green apple in many a blue raspberry candy/slush/popsicle and for good reason, as apple is a great friend of the raspberry and it really completes that candy blue raz profile and adds a unique flair to the recipe. By the way this flavor should NOT be subbed for other green apples unless you love the taste of acetone...it is awesome and if you don't have it I highly recommend picking it up.\r\n\r\nWS-23 because summer\r\n\r\nSugar daddy sweetener because it's the best damn sweetener out there albeit a bit on the weak side so 1% is not that crazy for a candy profile such as this. Of course you can alter to suit your taste.\r\n\r\nThere you have it, a damn satisfying blue raz that is simple and extremely tasty. Hope you all enjoy!","steep_days":"1 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-12T05:50:02.000-05:00","best_vg":"80%","views":"1389","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Blue Raspberry","flavor_id":"1479","vendor":"LB","millipercent":8000},{"name":"Boysenberry","flavor_id":"614","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":500},{"name":"Raspberry","flavor_id":"667","vendor":"INW","millipercent":250},{"name":"Green Apple","flavor_id":"8423","vendor":"SC","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Sugar Daddy (TBV Rick)","flavor_id":"9207","vendor":"OTHR","millipercent":1000},{"name":"WS-23","flavor_id":"8085","vendor":"OTHR","millipercent":1000}],"reviews":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"107975","name":"Baby Blue"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
