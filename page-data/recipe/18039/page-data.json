From sadpandavape on reddit/ELR\r\n\r\nRecipe breakdown:\r\n\r\nButterscotch ripple - This flavor is awesome. Light butterscotch flavor that feels like a mix of VBIC and Butterscotch regular. blends perfect in this recipe and gives it the fullness it needs.\r\n\r\nDouble Ry4 - Fantastic staple of tobacco flavors. At this % it gives the perfect hint of tobacco and the caramel aspect of double ry4 melds fantastic with the other creams.\r\n\r\nFuji Apple - Do I need to explain this gem of a flavor?\r\n\r\nVanilla Custard - Gives the missing vanilla twinge we felt it was missing. CAP Custard has this intangible fullness and vanilla/caramel punch that puts this recipe over the top.\r\n\r\nEthyl Maltol - Helps the Tobacco and apple not be too dry. Can be made without easily.\r\n\r\n\r\nhttp://e-liquid-recipes.com/recipe/690844/Apple-bacco%20%28Sad%20Panda%20Vape%29\r\n\r\nhttps://m.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/4n7ahw/recipe_dont_post_alot_decided_to_contribute_with/?ref=search_posts\r\n\r\n","steep_days":"0","temperature":"0","recipe_score":4,"updated_at":"2020-12-12T15:38:54.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"13077","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Butterscotch Ripple","flavor_id":"1217","vendor":"FW","millipercent":6000},{"name":"Ethyl Maltol","flavor_id":"1710","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Fuji","flavor_id":"506","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Ry4 Double","flavor_id":"379","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":3500},{"name":"Vanilla Custard","flavor_id":"131","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":3000}],"reviews":[{"user":"Ihavenoidea","text":"Holy moly. This 30ml bottle will not last a day. Gonna make a big one. Skipped the EM.","score":5},{"user":"YippYo","text":"Probably the first recipe I ever mixed up back in the day. Really great apple RY4 recipe. The Butterscotch Ripple and Fuji work very well together.","score":5},{"user":"Roadking53","text":"","score":0},{"user":"nowar","text":"I'm editing my original review to add my thoughts. This is an excellent vape and I'd recommend it to anyone. Some feedback now that I've finished a fair amount of it: I find the ripple too high for me. I'd keep it lower. Ripple can be funky to me and I think 2% is a much better level. I feel the fuji gets lost after a fade and maybe some more tobaccos that hold up to the heavier flavors.","score":4},{"user":"ObiWanCannoli","text":"This is the only recipe that has ever been close to an ADV for me. There's just something about this one that clicks with me. Its rich, smooth, and nicely balanced. Although I prefer vaping this fresh due to the Fuji being more upfront, it's still great after a steep. If you love Fuji I would bump it up to 2-2.5%. Will be trying this with some ACTUAL tobacco flavorings as I'm sure it would turn this recipe from awesome to stellar","score":5},{"user":"RemoveHasperat","text":"Everything works together well enough and all the flavors are, somewhat, there however even with a long steep I've found its nothing special. Decent enough to mix once or twice but not something I would vape regularly. ","score":3},{"user":"Mr-G","text":"yummy","score":5},{"user":"adio","text":"I waited almost a year to mix this and have decided that I'm an idiot. It's probably my top 3 favorite ever recipes I've ever mixed. It's really well balanced - not too much apple, not too sweet. It's an adv for me, I can't get enough!","score":5},{"user":"Shoe","text":"This is the best apple / tobacco vape I've ever had. It is smooth and full of flavor. I shoe horses for a living and I find horses sticking there noses in my beard when I'm vaping Apple-Bacco. Nice job Smokey ! Thank you.","score":5},{"user":"kroganeater","text":"Excellent recipe","score":5},{"user":"BuryMeInSmoke","text":"FA Fuji and TFA RY4 go together really well.  Even with the large percentage of Butterscotch Ripple this recipe comes across more of a RY4 + apple than caramel/butterscotch + apple.  Really enjoyable vape.","score":4},{"user":"Annathiika","text":"This is delicious. Somehow I vaped this all day, even though I'm not huge fan of any single flavor profile that can be found in the singular ingredients. Mix this.","score":5},{"user":"RainSong","text":"I could only let it go for 6 days before I had to have a taste. I'll be making a bigger bottle asap so it can steep longer. Very good stuff, apple and butterscotch goodness. ","score":5},{"user":"Steevsta","text":"Mixed this when first came out on Reddit its a really nice vape ! Add 2% FA Apple pie for an over the top vape","score":5},{"user":"ali","text":"This recipe is seriously fantastic. I already loved The New Pistachio RY4-U before trying this so I knew Ripple+Ry4 Double combo would work out great.&#xD;\nAll around perfect ADV. Thanks.","score":5},{"user":"Dalpho","text":"I absolutely love it. I'll be adding this to my normal rotation.","score":5},{"user":"hyperlite310","text":"This is the first recipe I've used ry4 double in and it is amazing! The caramel notes from the ry4 play so well with the apple and butterscoth ripple. This is just 4 days steep! Can't wait to see how it is after 2 weeks.  ","score":5},{"user":"RhinoOneGun","text":"","score":0},{"user":"Slash","text":"Vaping on this after a 3 week steep, its a nice light light caramel with a shot of apple on the exhale. Not too creamy not too sweet and smooth as butter, this one really hits the spot for me. This is extremely well balanced as is but If I had too change anything I would boost the caramel notes slightly with a wee touch of caramel or brown sugar.","score":5}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"18039","name":"Apple-Bacco (Sadpandavape)"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
