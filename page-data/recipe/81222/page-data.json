After receiving his Ph.D. from Princeton University in 1938, he returned to Cambridge, and then took a part-time position with the Government Code and Cypher School, a British code-breaking organization.\r\n\r\nDuring World War II, Turing was a leading participant in wartime code-breaking, particularly that of German ciphers. He worked at Bletchley Park, the GCCS wartime station, where he made five major advances in the field of cryptanalysis, including specifying the bombe, an electromechanical device used to help decipher German Enigma encrypted signals. Turing‚Äôs contributions to the code-breaking process didn‚Äôt stop there: He also wrote two papers about mathematical approaches to code-breaking, which became such important assets to the Code and Cypher School (later known as the Government Communications Headquarters) that the GCHQ waited until April 2012 to release them to the National Archives of the United Kingdom.\r\n\r\nTuring moved to London in the mid-1940s, and began working for the National Physical Laboratory. Among his most notable contributions while working at the facility, Turing led the design work for the Automatic Computing Engine and ultimately created a groundbreaking blueprint for store-program computers. Though a complete version of the ACE was never built, its concept has been used as a model by tech corporations worldwide for several years, influencing the design of the English Electric DEUCE and the American Bendix G-15‚Äîcredited by many in the tech industry as the world‚Äôs first personal computer‚Äîamong other computer models.\r\n\r\nHomosexuality was illegal in the United Kingdom in the early 1950s, so when Turing admitted to police‚Äîwho he called to his house after a break-in‚Äîin January, 1952, that he had had a sexual relationship with the perpetrator, 19-year-old Arnold Murray, he was charged with gross indecency. Following his arrest, Turing was forced to choose between temporary probation on the condition that he receive hormonal treatment for libido reduction, or imprisonment. He chose the former, and soon underwent chemical castration through injections of a synthetic estrogen hormone for a year, which eventually rendered him impotent.\r\n\r\nAs a result of his conviction, Turing's security clearance was removed and he was barred from continuing his work with cryptography at the GCCS, which had become the GCHQ in 1946.\r\n\r\nTuring died on June 7, 1954. Following a postmortem exam, it was determined that the cause of death was cyanide poisoning. The remains of an apple were found next to the body, though no apple parts were found in his stomach. The autopsy reported that \"four ounces of fluid which smelled strongly of bitter almonds, as does a solution of cyanide\" was found in the stomach. Trace smell of bitter almonds was also reported in vital organs. The autopsy concluded that the cause of death was asphyxia due to cyanide poisoning and ruled a suicide.","steep_days":"14","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:49:49.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"2794","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Florida Key Lime","flavor_id":"7699","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Lime Cold Pressed","flavor_id":"4891","vendor":"FA","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Cream Cheese Icing","flavor_id":"2380","vendor":"LA","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Meringue","flavor_id":"530","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Biscuit","flavor_id":"642","vendor":"INW","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Cheesecake (graham Crust)","flavor_id":"152","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Vanilla Whipped Cream","flavor_id":"1","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Sweetener","flavor_id":"339","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1000}],"reviews":[{"user":"corvape","text":"Excellent Key Lime Pie recipe Mophead! Let this steep a couple weeks and its delish. Perfectly balanced and smooth. I am very happy I ordered FA Florida key lime for this recipe. Florida key lime layered with fa lime cold pressed is perfect! Great job with this one.
