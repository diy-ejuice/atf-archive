For the dark fruit, I put a little splash of INW Dark for Pipe. To get a little bit of that fermented taste, FA Liquid Amber just seemed to make sense. To get a little bit of spicy, peppery kick, I’ve got INW Black for Pipe, FLV Kentucky, and FA Black Pepper. The Kentucky also helps give a bit of depth and body. \r\n\r\nVAPers are pretty popular blends, so I figured I’d toss in some sweet Virginias. To get some authentic tobacco leaf taste in there, I went with the INW Virginia Tobacco Absolute. To get things a little sweeter, I went with HS Virginia. I think FLV Virginia would also work pretty well here in place of the HS. They are pretty similar in taste, but the FLV might have a bit more bite to it.  \r\n\r\nDefinitely required a nice, long steep. I tried this final version after about 10 days and prepared to go back to the drawing board. Got busy with other things and tried it after a month and it was perfect. \r\n\r\n\r\n","steep_days":"30","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T23:35:58.000-05:00","best_vg":"60%","views":"1893","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Pepper Black","vendor":"FA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Liquid Amber","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Kentucky Blend","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":500},{"name":"Classic For Pipe Dark","vendor":"INW","millipercent":250},{"name":"Classic For Pipe Black","vendor":"INW","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Tobacco Absolute Virginia","vendor":"INW","millipercent":500},{"name":"Virginia","vendor":"HS","millipercent":1000}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"65784","name":"VA Perique for Pipe"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
