Sansa and Daenerys   should have teamed up and RULED all!!!   \r\n\r\n  Instead   the writers  turn Danerys  into an entirely different character, that  BBQ an entire  city  - which is  then supposed  to justify  the  homicide  by  the  man who knows  nothing   and to   top it all off   they placed a three eyed  raven on the  iron throne .  THE one redeeming aspect of the season was that SANSA declaring the Norths independence and   took her rightful place as queen in the north .   \r\n\r\nScone  base is mainly the Biscut, and Brownsugar cookie with a little of VT pudding  for body  - nice body with a  touch  dark  biscuit bakery on the back \r\n\r\nRaspberry jam and  Sweet currant is lovely   -   as that currant gives  you that nice tart bright note \r\nSweet cream adds a touch of cream note  with out overpowering the bakery  ","steep_days":"7","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-01T04:16:27.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"1151","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Brown Sugar Cookie SC","flavor_id":"10256","vendor":"WF","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Sweet Cream","flavor_id":"8979","vendor":"VT","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Pudding Base","flavor_id":"8948","vendor":"VT","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Raspberry Jam","flavor_id":"9373","vendor":"VT","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Biscuit","flavor_id":"8737","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Sweet Currant","flavor_id":"10171","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Vanilla Buttercream Frosting","flavor_id":"8990","vendor":"VT","millipercent":750}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"153829","name":"Sansa Stark Got  Sconed"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
