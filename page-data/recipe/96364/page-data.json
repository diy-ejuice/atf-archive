This is so delicious! This is a must try!!  \r\nSimple yet flavorful! The Flv green tea goes well with cream and Milk % honey !!The teas are a great addition to any flavor stash! \r\n \r\n tastes like a wonderful tea with some cream and a very tasty creamed honey note.  it all marries and blends together at about 1 week and steeps out beautifully!!\r\nThe green tea really is great with the milk and honey! It gives the green tea a wonderful flavor and the flv cream which is one of my favorite creams really helps blend the flavors realm well into a delicious creamed honey.. This is wonderful trio and has alot of flavor considering the % is so low.  I can't stop vapng it its so delicious!!\r\n\r\n Give it a mix if you have the flavors.  Its a simple recipe with Low percents but it sure does taste fantastic!!  It has to steep at least a few days.  I didn't add  sweetener, it doesnt need it, it sweet and very bright!","steep_days":"3 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"updated_at":"2020-12-12T14:06:20.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"1239","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Cream","flavor_id":"604","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Green tea","flavor_id":"9376","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Milk & Honey","flavor_id":"609","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":2000}],"reviews":[{"user":"Elvieann","text":"I've been looking forward to tasting this since I first saw the recipe months ago.
