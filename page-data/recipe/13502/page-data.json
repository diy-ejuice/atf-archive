Think St. Germain. I'm still waiting to be rocketed into the fourth dimension of existence.  Until then, I'm going to miss cocktails... I mix at 75% VG.  Certified shake and vape.  Actually a bit better fresh before the champagne mutes everything all to shit.","steep_days":"0","temperature":"0","recipe_score":4,"updated_at":"2020-12-12T14:04:48.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"3481","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Champagne Type (pg)","flavor_id":"347","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":5000},{"name":"Elderflower","flavor_id":"3518","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Gin","flavor_id":"519","vendor":"FA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Koolada 10 Pg","flavor_id":"280","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Lavender","flavor_id":"510","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Pineapple","flavor_id":"809","vendor":"INW","millipercent":3000}],"reviews":[{"user":"ID10-T","text":"Terrifying and beautiful, just the way I like 'em. Completely concur with Philosaphucker and Kopel reviews below. Would love to see an updated version with a better coolant, though. ","score":5},{"user":"CatWillMew","text":"This is a really interesting recipe.  I've been trying to make an elderflower recipe (St. Germain is great stuff), and it's tricky, because it's a really strong flavor with a bitter aftertaste.  I find myself trying to dial it down, but this recipe takes the opposite approach, pairing it up with other florals that can stand up to it.  The inhale is great on this.  But, my criticism for this recipe is that I still get a lot of bitter aftertaste from the Elderflower and gin.  Definitely a lot of potential here, though.","score":4},{"user":"Philosaphucker","text":"I never had a St Germain cocktail, so I am coming at this with the perspective of someone who enjoys vaping interesting profiles. I love this use of FA Gin and it has pretty much sold me on Elderflower. The use of Koolada was spot on for a cocktail vape with these flavors. Using INW Pineapple as a texturizer is some genius level tom foolery. The overall smoothness of the vape kept me coming back. This is simply a great vape, thank you!","score":5},{"user":"Kopel","text":"When I first saw the percentages on this I was taken aback a little bit. But it works surprisingly well. A fantastically realized St Germain style gin cocktail. Great work sir.","score":5},{"user":"triangulatethisdick","text":"don't stop till the miracle happens :)","score":0}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"13502","name":"4D"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
