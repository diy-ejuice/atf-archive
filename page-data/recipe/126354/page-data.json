It's a sweet buttermilk toffee that sits where you want it in a recipe. 1% FLV Toffee is complemented with caramely nutty butter notes from 1.5% FW Butter Pecan. \r\n\r\n2% VT Toffee ice cream has a pleasant toffee taste and is quite buttery but lacks body, hence the inclusion of 1.5% CAP Vanilla Whipped Cream, which thickens as well as blends everything. \r\n\r\n0.75% JF Biscuit adds a slight biscuit accent you get on the exhale. \r\n\r\n0.35% FW Sweetener because it's a dessert. \r\n\r\nThis recipe manages to be sweet and moreish yet is not too rich so is certainly ADV material. It's a nice \"comfort vape\" to get you through those dark wintery nights. \r\n\r\nEnjoy. P.
