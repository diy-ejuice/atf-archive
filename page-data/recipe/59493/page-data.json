Main notes were cherry bourbon (I used cherry blossom because most cherry flavors taste like medicine to me), Chestnut, Pistachio (made a version with pistachio added and my dad and I both preferred it without) and sweet cream. I didn't want to add sweet cream because I'm not a big fan of that flavor but I did want to add that sweetness that I smell with the candle. I added CAP Sugar cookie and it was perfect. This is a nice and unique mixture. Everyone that I've had tried it has liked it. \r\n\r\n\r\n**I mix low so you may need to increase my percentages anywhere from 50-100% (double)","steep_days":"7 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-02T08:09:38.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"942","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Cherry Blossom (pg)","flavor_id":"221","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Chestnut","flavor_id":"491","vendor":"FA","millipercent":250},{"name":"Sugar Cookie","flavor_id":"115","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Vanilla Cupcake","flavor_id":"129","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Whipped Cream","flavor_id":"193","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1000}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"59493","name":"Dad likes B&BW"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
