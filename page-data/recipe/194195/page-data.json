For a US version I guess you could substitute the lime for a green apple and the blackcurrant for a grape flavour\r\n\r\nThe shell - For me, FA Oba Oba has a kind of candy shell flavour to it when mixed with fruits.\r\n\r\nThe coating - I wouldn't say the real life counterparts had a distinct yoghurt flavour to them, so I decided to aim for a mild creamy coating. WF Frozen Yogurt along with MB white chocolate seemed to provide that.\r\n\r\nFinally, everything is gelled together with some TPA vanilla swirl.","steep_days":"3 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T17:36:22.000-05:00","best_vg":"%","views":"545","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Green Lime","vendor":"MB","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Lemon Sicily","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Sharp Blackcurrant","vendor":"MB","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Strawberry","vendor":"FW","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Blood Orange","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Vanilla Swirl","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Oba Oba","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Super Sweet","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":500},{"name":"Frozen Yogurt SC","vendor":"WF","millipercent":2000},{"name":"White Chocolate","vendor":"MB","millipercent":3000}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"194195","name":"Skitty Dippin'"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
