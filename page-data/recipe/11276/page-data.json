The sugar cookie, cookie, and biscuit create an amazing cookie base. The remaining ingredients create this fantastic vanilla, creamy, buttery almost frosting like texture that coats your mouth. If you like your cookie to have some cinnamon in it, add no more than a drop of Flavorah Rich Cinnamon per 30mL. I strictly make this recipe 60mL at a time and I only add one drop of rich cinnamon to that so if you can somehow get half a drop in a 30mL, go for it. If not, it will be just fine without the Rich Cinnamon. Steep time: after 1 week it's pretty much good to go. If you can let this sit for more than a week, you'll love it even more. Enjoy, Compadres!

I gave it a month long steep.  Could be vapor tongue but seems a little light on flavor.

It makes the vanilla dunking cream. After that, everything just falls into the right places. The hint of cinnamon is perfect. "},{"user":"HerrHut","text":"Delicious.  The hint of cinnamon is genius!"},{"user":"RudeRudi","text":"The best cookies &amp; cream BY FAR! I also subbed Holy Vanilla with INW Shisha Vanilla and it is absolute heaven. Great job!!!"},{"user":"method1","text":"Great combo of frosting and cookie, never had an actual dunkaroo but this is a delicious mix."},{"user":"MrZigglesworth","text":"5 out of 7, perfect score. Also this frosting base is delicious!"},{"user":"KRUCIAL","text":"This shit is amazing, definitely an ADV. I don't quite remember what a Dunkaroo tastes like but it reminds me of a Cinnamon Teddy Graham dipped in cake icing. I highly recommend you all mix this (no subs) you will not be disappointed."},{"user":"MrBurgundy","text":"I mixed this almost 2 months ago and forgot about it.. Oops! It's really good. A chewy, creamy sugar cookie with a nutty and spicy vanilla note. I remember dunkaroos being a little crisper, but this recipe is tasty nonetheless! Definitely one of the better cookie recipes out there. Mix it up!"},{"user":"Burritoclock","text":"Delicious! I subbed Shisha Vanilla for Holy Vanilla, but still it hits the profile and is one of my favorite \"cookie\" vapes. Great recipe."},{"user":"Kriswk","text":"A seriously delicious recipe. Holy Vanilla is awesome and used well here as an icing along with FW Hazelnut. The cookie aspect is perfect as well.. just a banger.. Great job."},{"user":"Wilkybob69","text":"Tip notch juice Jonathan cracking recipe m8 thanks for sharing"},{"user":"VapinTrucker","text":"So i tied this at various points of the steep.I mixed it on 9/18/16. Smells wonderful from the get go...its been steeping since then and I really like what it has turned into for sure.  If your a cookie vape lover you will love this...i recomend a three week steep personally..i drive a truck so i end up using a tank and at three weeks the flavors comes shinning thru.  Thanks John for sharing this recipe...it's now in my rotation!!!...BTW...I only gave four stars because i am reserving the 5 star for APPLE BUTTAH!!!"},{"user":"6retro6","text":""},{"user":"Thadentman","text":"Wayne from diyordie is right, The first hit tells you everything about an e liquid. When the cotton does break in though you get a much sweeter cookie and vanilla frosting. If you happen to like cookie vapes this will be a new favorite. ADV 4sure!!! BTW I only aged this for 6 and 1/2 days and that's all I think it needs."}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"11276","name":"Dunkaroos"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
