Complete, with creaminess, graininess and a perfect, realistic “cheesy” note as you would expect from a cheesecake.\r\n \r\nJF Strawberry Sweet- punches the fruit flavor from the WF Strawberry Cheesecake with a bright, sweet blast of additional strawberry.\r\n\r\nFA Graham Crust- enhances the crust note of the cheesecake. I chose FA, because to me it is the lightest of the Graham’s in flavor and I’m using it to enhance a crust and not introduce a new one. It adds a bit of AP that I think the WF is missing in the mix, and understandably so, being a complete cheesecake concentrate. \r\n\r\nAny and all feedback is welcomed! Enjoy!","steep_days":"5","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T14:14:34.000-05:00","best_vg":"30%","views":"628","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Strawberry Cheesecake SC","vendor":"WF","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Strawberry Sweet","vendor":"JF","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Graham Crust","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"193224","name":"3-2-1 Cheeeeese!...Cake (Strawberry)"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
