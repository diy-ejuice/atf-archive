Mix this up, give it a good shake and fill or drip to your hearts content!\r\n\r\nCake batter, Pudding base, Pound cake, Funnel cake & Pie crust - this provides a wonderful base of cake batter-y goodness! CAP cake batter is truly glorious, as I was trying to bring out the silky batter side of the flavour VT’s pudding base seemed like it would be a good companion. Oh boy was it a good choice! It really amplifies the vanilla/pudding aspects of the recipe. Pound cake “firms up” the cake side of it, whilst funnel cake adds a bit of a deep fried tinge. Pie crust adds a slight buttery/pastry note for a bit more depth.\r\n\r\nMeringue, Dairy milk, Sweet cream - playing again on the cake batter notes of the recipe, these 3 add a bit more of a moist, dairy edge which sets off the vanilla pudding aspects of the juice. \r\n\r\nApple pie filling, Fuji Apple - the Apple portion of the recipe! Apple pie filling is an interesting one, and pretty bang on for what it should be! The only problem is that it doesn’t quite have the Apple “bite” that I was looking for. This is where Fuji steps in! The combination of the two provides a deep, textured, no holds barred Apple pie filling that sits right on top of our batter base. Feel free to sub FA Fuji Apple for CAP Fuji Apple here @ the same percentage! \r\n\r\nSuper sweet - sweeten to taste, I find 0.25% to be the sweet spot for this recipe though!
