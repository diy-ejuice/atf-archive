I was messing around when I made this recipe about 8 months ago.when I tasted it it was absolutely delicious. Perfect desert vape.  The strawberries meld together nicely to create a perfect blend of strawberry. The Fresh cream and Vienna cream help to create more dairy note. I used the Bavarian Cream to give the Milkshake  the much needed mouth feel you get from a thick and creamy Milkshake. To make it sweeter add .25-.5 super sweet. Steeped for about 5 days for best results. Taste great even as a Shake and Vape.
