After hunting for quite a while I finally was able to source a large amount of Black for Pipe, and I must say, Mr. BurnVictim, the hype is real, and I can imagine much of that big bottle will be going towards this recipe. I just recently tried it with 5% French Pipe(SC)-and I'll be damned if the first pull didn't make me think I took a drag off of one of my old brand of cigarettes. I think I would drop the FP a bit, maybe down to 3.5-4% next time. Maybe a tiny touch of Black Fire(FA)? I love this recipe and I think it would make an awesome base to riff on with some other small additions. Otherwise this is a great pod recipe for going out on the town for some drinks, or perhaps finally getting that loved one off the cancer sticks for good.
