Must have vaped about a liter by now.\r\nFor me this is a topper of an ADV.\r\nHopefully you can enjoy it as much.\r\nAll the best,\r\nScrewdriver\r\n\r\nPS: Hadeley RDA or Kree24 RTA - fused 28*2/38 clapton NiChr80 - 30 to 40W","steep_days":"1 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T17:36:28.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"327","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Anise Star","flavor_id":"1554","vendor":"MB","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Sweet Currant","flavor_id":"10171","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":6000},{"name":"Persian Lime","flavor_id":"8942","vendor":"VT","millipercent":500},{"name":"Sour Gummy Candy SC","flavor_id":"9047","vendor":"WF","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Super Sweet","flavor_id":"2384","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":500},{"name":"Sweet Candy","flavor_id":"10290","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1000}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"200501","name":"Persianise Currant"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
