Period. This is the bed to receive lashings of warm duck sauce and does not detract from the star of the show.\r\n\r\nThe meringue acts as a bit of a springboard for the glaze and adds a touch of sweetness to the cookie - playing on both sides of the fence in this recipe.\r\n\r\nMix her up and dip her in your tea - you'll be back for more!\r\n\r\n7 to 10 day steep for the CCI is play nicely...\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","steep_days":"7","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T09:43:49.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"2085","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Sugar Cookie","flavor_id":"115","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Biscuit","flavor_id":"642","vendor":"INW","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Meringue","flavor_id":"530","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Cream Cheese Icing","flavor_id":"2380","vendor":"LA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Shisha Orange","flavor_id":"832","vendor":"INW","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Blood Orange","flavor_id":"1197","vendor":"FW","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Marzipan","flavor_id":"1708","vendor":"INW","millipercent":1000}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"57111","name":"Duck Sauce Cookies"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
