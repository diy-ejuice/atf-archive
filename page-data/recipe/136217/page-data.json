INW Coconut cookie is the main focus, but needs a bit of help.  JF Cookie is used to help with the crispy bottom texture, and Cap Sugar Cookie is used to give the chewy center needed for the cookie.\r\n**The coconut**\r\nThe cookie itself needed more coconut.  I used VT Desiccated Coconut to give the feel and taste of sweet coconut.  PUR Toasted Coconut Cheesecake was used to add the toasted note for the top of the cookie.\r\n**The jam**\r\nFor the jam in the center of the cookie, I used, VT Raspberry Jam, and to boost the flavor just a bit, I added some FLV Boysenberry.\r\nThis definitively ended up a very delicious Coconut Cookie with a nice raspberry jam added to it.\r\nEnjoy.\r\n  \r\n","steep_days":"5","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-11-30T22:58:41.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"1292","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Coconut Cookies (yc)","vendor":"INW","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Toasted Coconut Cheesecake","vendor":"PUR","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Raspberry Jam","vendor":"VT","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Boysenberry","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":500},{"name":"Sugar Cookie","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Cookie","vendor":"JF","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Dessicated Coconut","vendor":"VT","millipercent":750}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"136217","name":"Raspberry Coconut Cookie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
