Adding TPA French Vanilla Creme and TPA French Vanilla Deluxe on a 1:1 ratio, add both the extra vanilla needed and bring a second layer of delicate creaminess along. \r\nTPA Western is the way to go for the VCT profile, and adding just a little INW US Red Mix makes this recipe different from other VCTs, bringing a different dimension to the leathery american tobacco notes. \r\nFinally, RY4 is added for the needed maltol and also as a bridge to the VT Honeycomb, creating a nice butterscoth note. \r\n\r\nGive it at least 6-7 days of steeping to develop!\r\n\r\nP.S. INW US Red Mix could be ommited, but if you have it or have easy access to it I really recommend you to give it a try.
