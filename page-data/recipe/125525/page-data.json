Its a Malaysian Lychee rebrand (I think) Im not sure what would be closest to sub with as Ive not found anything similar to this yet.\r\n** I am sure you could sub this with another Malaysian Lychee that has a fresh Lychee Beverage profile.\r\n\r\n\r\nIve Been Chasing a Pear and Lychee Profile for a while now and could just not get the balances right. With my Lychee base tweaked its finally at a point where Im happy to share it.\r\n\r\nI was aiming for a Lychee & Pear FRUIT JUICE Combo with The Lychee (using my 'DeLychious' as a Base) being just that touch above the Pear. \r\nWhile Pushing for that Perfectly Sweet Lychee Juice that pops that Juicy-nectary Sweet Lychee Flavor on the inhale and the Pear to lay the profile out on the exhale.  Lychee and Pear The way I Like it.\r\n\r\nThe Lychee:\r\n(FRA Lychee) - I recently found a Deliciously Fruit Juice Lychee type of Lychee by Frandy Flavors (a Local house brand). This Lychee gives you that FRUIT JUICE type of Lychee and the closest I can explain this is that its Very similar if not exactly the same Lychee profile that you would get with Liqui-Fruit Lychee Juice. \r\n(CAP Sweet Lychee) - I love Cap sweet lychee as it gives that Sweetness that you would get from a Candy type of Lychee. I added this to Widen\\emulsify the lychee up a bit in terms of That sweet syrupy vibe you get from a a lychee puree (fruit but almost Candied). \r\nCAP Sweet Lychee tends to add a Bit of a 'Musky candy' note at higher % that I like it to be, thats why its added to the FRA instead of being the Main Lychee.\r\n(FA Lychee) - I felt hat the Lychee juice could be more realistic in a actual ripe fruit way so I added the FA Lychee to give you that little Touch of Authenticity, For me at higher % its tends too get Very Florally (Overpoweringly Florally, if you are not into Flora notes) and adds that Bitter as if you chew on a piece of the Lychee Skin.\r\n\r\nThe Pear:\r\n(FA Pear) I Selected this Pear for its realistic top of the harvest Fruit like flavor profile that it adds, complimenting the Realistic Fruit Juice profile with its own moistness it brings.\r\n(INW Pear) This was added to make the pear even more realistic by expanding on the Pear Skin and TEXTURE that also makes up that Grittyness of a Pear Profile.\r\n\r\nFA Cream Fresh:\r\nNothing Like some \"old mans Breath\" to liven things up :-) \r\nOn a serious note, this is there to accentuate/outline/sharpen the Lychee and pears profiles that sometimes gets lost into the back ground. Also acts a nice canvass for the other additives to mingle more.\r\n\r\nFA Apple Fuji:\r\nIt just needed a touch of Magic somewhere\r\n\r\nLemon Sicily:\r\nAdded a touch of this to Pop the Tang of the Lychee a bit more, giving it that FRESH Ripe Fruit flavor instead of the a 'Warm Ripe' or Over ripeness.\r\n\r\nWS-23:\r\nI personally Added the WS because this is supposed to be a FRUIT JUICE, and fruit beverages are normally cold.\r\n\r\nSweetner:\r\nAdd the SS, Doooo It!!\r\n","steep_days":"3 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-05T06:48:35.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"1364","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Sweet Lychee","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":3330},{"name":"Lychee","vendor":"FA","millipercent":550},{"name":"Lychee","vendor":"OOO","millipercent":4440},{"name":"Cream Fresh","vendor":"FA","millipercent":990},{"name":"Super Sweet","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":330},{"name":"Lemon Sicily","vendor":"FA","millipercent":220},{"name":"Apple Fuji","vendor":"FA","millipercent":330},{"name":"Pear","vendor":"INW","millipercent":440},{"name":"Pear","vendor":"FA","millipercent":3330},{"name":"WS-23","vendor":"OTHR","millipercent":330}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"125525","name":"Lychus Pyrus"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
