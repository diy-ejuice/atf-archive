After a 3 day steep it’s a super smooth and creamy almond cookie custard and balanced enough that you can taste everything that’s going on in the mixture. The almond I believe is what bringing it all together blended in to the back ground. Any feedback is appreciated but I really enjoy this one as it is. Hope you all enjoy it too!
