I wanted to create an Eggnog recipe but put a bit of a twist on it, an Eggnog Coffee and donuts. This is one of those recipes that may not be an ADV due to its rich sweetness, but would be great after a big Thanksgiving or Christmas meal, to be vaped in front of a roaring fire or while watching the snow outside fall.\r\n\r\nI am really enjoying the new WF SC line and although I'm not a big fan of most coffees, I do enjoy the depth and layering of the WF Crispy Coffee SC. It does however need a bit of a boost for a darker coffee and that's where the FA Up comes in, but just a touch. I wanted the eggnog to be the star of the show so, the coffee sits in the back while the eggnog and donut are in the middle of the vape.\r\n\r\nThis was the first time experimenting FLV Eggnog, and while it has an authentic eggnog flavor, it can over-power a mix. So using it at 1% would be the max I would use this at.\r\nThe whipped cream is to soften the spices from the FLV Eggnog and WF Cinnamon Pastry a bit and add a nice fluffy topping to the recipe.\r\n\r\nThe donut. Of all the WF that I have tested, this seems to be the most accurate to the profile. It is the perfect blend of pastry, creamy sugar glaze, and cinnamon. \r\nI added a bit of CAP Super Sweet as well but you don't have to use it if you like a less sweet vape. \r\nCan be a shake and vape but is best after a 3 day steep.\r\nVisit Freedom To Mix on Discord https://discord.gg/SmSc8Ef\r\nVisit Freedom To Mix on FaceBook https://www.facebook.com/groups/415341418920740/ \r\n\r\nPlease comment, mix, and or rate,....it makes us all better mixers. Enjoy :)\r\n","steep_days":"3 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":4.7,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:49:41.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"2447","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Eggnog","flavor_id":"4396","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Crispy Coffee SC","flavor_id":"9021","vendor":"WF","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Whipped Cream","flavor_id":"193","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Super Sweet","flavor_id":"2384","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":250},{"name":"UP (coffee)","flavor_id":"4473","vendor":"FA","millipercent":100},{"name":"Cinnamon Pastry","flavor_id":"6049","vendor":"WF","millipercent":4000}],"reviews":[{"user":"lionhrt9","text":"Was looking for a holiday recipe and found this gem. Im only at a 1 day steep and love this stuff. Fantastic blending of flavors. I personally like rich flavorful vapes and this is one of those. I recently added arabica and Brazilian coffee to my stash and detected off notes in up flavor as compared. So I decided to use Brazilian in its place at same percent and its it's a keeper for sure. Was after a coffee creamed with eggnog as that's the way i fix coffee during the holidays. The pastry note compliments it perfectly. "},{"user":"ID10-T","text":"If you've ever found a coffee recipe you truly enjoyed, you'll probably love this one. If you never have, maybe you'll enjoy this one. It has come the closest for me to date, but still isn't quite there. I love the very original profile idea here, and I get 100% of everything promised in a recipe that tries very hard to be very delightful. Unfortunately, I'm also picking up just a touch of something else that spoils the experience for me, even after a six-week steep (I first tried it at 3 days as recommended, then set it aside hoping that something would steep out).  It's a funky off note that's like trying to indulge in my eggnog coffee and donut in the living room while someone has burnt popcorn in the kitchen and someone else as run over a skunk a block or two down the road. It's hard to really luxuriate in anything with your senses being even gently assaulted by that. I'd like more people to try this recipe as written so I can more accurately assess just how damaged I am when it comes to coffee flavors. "},{"user":"TamVapes","text":"Someone in a Facebook group posted this recipe asking how it was, my first comment was, Folkart made it, it will be great. But I mixed it since I had the concentrates. Excellent!  Creamy coffee inhale then definitely the eggnog lies perfectly in the middle. On the exhale, I get a delicious cinnamon pastry. Just perfect. I reported back to him and said it was a must mix and definitely mix it up. 5+ stars to one of the best mixers I know.
