I think I simply killed off many of those brain cells in my delinquent adolescence, but I do have one fond memory that I doubt I'll ever forget.\r\n\r\nI remember I was maybe 3 or 4, in pre-school, and my dad had been working odd hours all week so we had barely seen each other at home. This particular day, he didn't have to go in. My mom typically took me to school, but this time my dad offered -- except when we make it to the school, he simply keeps driving his 70s Ford Explorer straight past the drop off area. Confused, I ask him where we're going and he smiles while answering \"we're playing hookie!\" I'd never heard the term, so that didn't help relieve my confusion at all, but it sounded fun so I went with it.\r\n\r\nWe went and got some cheap McDonalds pancakes, played some minigolf, and saw a movie for the day. \r\n\r\nWith the story of quality time spent doing goofy shit with a loving father as inspiration, I'm submitting this as my entry to December's mixers club theme. The theme this month (and last?) is telling a story, and this just felt like the right thing to share. This is a simple, fast food pancake & maple syrup. How about some recipe notes?\r\n\r\nFW Waffle +  CAP VCC + PUR Cookie + FLV Cupcake batter: This is the pancake. FW waffle does a pretty good job as the foundation here, but to myself and most others it's just not cakey enough. That's where Van Cupcake comes in, except VCC is pretty hefty on the palette and has a strong icing kinda vibe to me for some reason. So I kept it low and helped mellow out some of it's heavy vanilla and icing notes with FLV cupcake batter. Add some soft crumble with PUR Cookie, chose this over FA cookie as it's a bit softer of a cookie IMO.\r\n\r\nFA Butterscotch + FA Maple Syrup: These sort of team up with the nice maple notes in FW Waffle to provide a great gooey, buttery syrup without being overpoweringly MAPLE.\r\n\r\nFA Joy + CAP LMP: Bit of a twist. My dad nowadays likes to cook his pancakes with a bit of lemon juice in the batter for some sweet zing and almost fries them so they have a really nice crispy ring around the edges. So I tried to include those notes in this, still unsure if they're coming through but I feel like I taste some fried stuff and soft lemon in the background somewhere occasionally.\r\n\r\n\r\nOFFNOTES: As a certain reddit flavor review put it, FW Waffle can taste like you're just licking a hot iron. I tried to keep it at a respectable but low enough range to avoid this but sometimes I still get a hint of it. If you like slightly burnt pancakes from a cast iron pan, it may not bother you though. Hoping that with time a long steep will help the syrup and cakes blossom enough to cover it up.
