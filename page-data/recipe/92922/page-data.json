Shoofly pie  began as a crust-less molasses cake called Centennial cake in 1876, to celebrate the 100th anniversary of the signing of the Declaration of Independence in Philadelphia    The name comes from a particular brand of molasses, Shoofly Molasses\r\n\r\n. The dry-bottom version is baked until fully set and results in a more cake-like consistency throughout. The wet-bottom version is set like cake at the top where it was mixed in with the crumbs, but the very bottom is a stickier, gooier custard-like consistency\r\n\r\n As a  kid my family would vacation in Lancaster PA with a large amish community and they would sell wet bottom shoofly pie at road side stands, I love that pie !!!! \r\nfor this pie the Molasses and , butterscotch cream  pie  create the  main note .  The molasses is a brown sugar/ maple syrup  and needs a a little body to support it  so the butterscotch cream  pie by WF,  along with the condensed milk to create that wet bottom of the pie. .  The recipe actually has a stick of butter  for the  crumble top hence the butter base by VT  combined with some of LB bakers touch to add a cinnamon for the crumble like texture.    The sugar cookie and cookie  are my go generic butter pie crust. and will also help with the crumble top .  This is an over the top sweet pie so it needed a touch a supersweet\r\n\r\nThis brought back some great memories for me - This is pretty much spot on  and  needs bout 2 - 3 days to really begin to come out and 5 days to get the deeper molasses notes \r\n\r\nLOOKING for a group to learn about  mixing your own juice check out these groups and your tube channels  \r\nhttps://www.facebook.com/groups/diydownunder/\r\nhttps://www.diydownunder.com/ \r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/user/frank1360\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0xkeZFSG04","steep_days":"5","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"total_reviews":1,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:50:02.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"2280","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Bakers Touch","vendor":"LB","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Butter Base","vendor":"VT","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Butterscotch Cream Pie","vendor":"WF","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Condensed Milk","vendor":"PUR","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Cookie","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Molasses SC","vendor":"WF","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Sugar Cookie","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Super Sweet","vendor":"PUR","millipercent":300}],"reviews":[{"user":"DIYDownunderPippa","score":"5","text":"I love a different profile of something I haven't thought of or tried before.
