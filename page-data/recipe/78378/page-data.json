Aftermath E-Liquids was born. The original flavor was the #1 selling juice in the shop for about a year. The owner and I parted ways about a year and a half ago, but the original recipes are still on the shelf at in stores. So instead of posting the OG recipe I decided to do a remix of it. In my eyes it's about perfect.\r\n\r\nThe flavor\r\n\r\nIt's a apple bread pudding. Thabks to Max Dixon and his recommendation of Baked Bread this recipe is 100% complete and perfect in my eyes. I feel like everything in the recipe is pretty much self explanatory so I'm going to skip actual notes. Just enjoy! \r\n\r\nDoes great after a shake, but even better after 5 days.","steep_days":"5","temperature":"0","recipe_score":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-10T16:00:25.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"1901","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Fuji","flavor_id":"506","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1500},{"name":"French Vanilla Icecream","flavor_id":"2129","vendor":"HS","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Super Sweet","flavor_id":"2384","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":500},{"name":"Vanilla Pudding","flavor_id":"4433","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":500},{"name":"Rich Cinnamon","flavor_id":"638","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":300},{"name":"Sugar Cookie","flavor_id":"115","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Vanilla Whipped Cream","flavor_id":"1","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":500},{"name":"Baked Bread â€“ SC","flavor_id":"7446","vendor":"RF","millipercent":250}],"reviews":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"78378","name":"102 a #Remix "}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
