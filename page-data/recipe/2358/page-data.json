Taste exactly like the vanilla almond milk from the store in my opinion. I like the sweetened version of this milk from the store personally. So I mixed it exactly to the recipe and let it steep before trying so that I would get exactly what the mixer got. As I said it's very accurate but I prefer sweeter almond milk myself. So after I vaped first tank I went back and added a bit of super sweet to remaining mix to bring it up to where I like my almond milk. Spot on for me. Very creamy milky mouthfeel with a great gentle not in your face almond throughout. Great balance. I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys almond milk. Well done Vurve."},{"user":"ID10-T","text":"This is perfection in a bottle. Good lord, I should have tried this sooner. Like Runtdastardly said when nominating it for 2016 recipe of the year, \"There are a million recipes you can keep humping, but, this is the one you marry.\""},{"user":"dreadymark","text":"I've been intrigued by this recipe for a while. Finally ordered the Marzipan (which I hate in rl) in order to make this and... HOLY DAMN! Been so long since I've liked a flavor this much and never would have expected it to be a simple almond milk. Amazing job! I know it's perfect, but I'm always trying to find a way to sneak a tobacco flavor into my juices; wondering which (if any) would play well here. Any suggestions welcome. Thanks for a great mix :) "},{"user":"bhamcatmaybe","text":"man i don't what sorcery this is, or how you create this magic, but i'm almost angry about it. this is the 4th recipe of yours that i've tried and fucking loved. it's just so perfect. so creamy, yet not heavy- an exact milky creamyness. so nutty without being *too nutty. A+++, again, i wish i had made more then 15ml from the start. "},{"user":"horizonism","text":"Can't get enough of this. Waited a long time to get hold of INW Marzipan, then a long time again to let this steep a good few weeks. The results are in and it's exceptional. Beautifully layered profile with different notes popping out each vape. Solid mixing that deserves more praise. Thanks for sharing, Vurve! "},{"user":"Thadentman","text":"Never big on Almond milk IRL but this stuff is awesome. Much better in my opinion in a vape then drinking it"},{"user":"LB","text":"This is great.  Very creamy vanilla and almond.  Definitely make again"},{"user":"RuntDastardly","text":"Creamy without feeling heavy, sweet without tasting saccharine, and the almond &amp; vanilla play off of each other wonderfully. Another sensational recipe, Vurve! "},{"user":"TheGrouch","text":"LOVE this recipe man!!"},{"user":"6retro6","text":"Delicious, well balanced recipe! Will mix it again."},{"user":"Mixepic","text":"I'm reviewing this recipe with .5% FA Marzipan subbed and with a 2 week age: Very creamy vape with a subtle almond that creates a realistic almond milk. The aroma is gives off has a great almond smell. The recipe blends together very well and makes for a relaxing vape, it's not in your face or over the top flavor. Just a real smooth vanilla almond cream. "}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"2358","name":"Vanilla Almond Milk"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
