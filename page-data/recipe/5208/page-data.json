This is a recipe that I've been working on for a long time, it started of as an attempt to clone a juice called white lady for a friend but it kind of steered off into it's own direction and now my friend prefers this to the original. Although the Almond is quite high % it is mellowed out nicely with the creams. Perfect with a cup of good coffee.","steep_days":"10","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"total_reviews":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T03:30:16.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"2064","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"New York Cheesecake","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Graham Cracker Clear","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Vanilla Custard","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Vanilla Swirl","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Toasted Almond","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Carmel (caramel)","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Acetyl Pyrazine ","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Meringue","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Sugar Cookie","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Marshmallow","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1000}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"5208","name":"Homemade Almond Vanilla Cheesecake"}}}
