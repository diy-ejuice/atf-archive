And with many failures, I believe I have gotten about as close as I can to that profile with Mayan Milk.\r\n\r\nAs all mixers know, chocolates are one of the hardest profiles to tackle. The reason being that most, if not all, chocolate flavorings have off notes. But this shouldn't be surprising in that chocolate flavorings in the cooking world are bitter, chalky, and just down right nasty. Chocolates are derived from the cocoa bean or cacao(/kəˈkaʊ/) bean. The beans are dried and fermented, then made into a powder. Chocolate is made from this powder with the addition of sugars and fatty ingredients. So in essence, chocolate flavorings are like a spice and they need to have supporting flavors to make a good chocolate. \r\nSo, in my quest for the \"perfect\" chocolate milk vape, I approached chocolate flavorings as a spice. Now, I don't believe there has ever been a \"perfect\" recipe, but for a chocolate milk, I think this is as close as I can get,.... for now ;) .\r\n\r\nI began testing chocolate flavorings very early in my mixing career and the testing continues today. I have found a few that seem to work better than others and have the least \"off notes\", and those are the ones I used in my batching of this recipe.\r\n \r\nFor this recipe, I settled on CAP Double Chocolate V2. This is a highly under-rated flavoring in my opinion being that I don't see it much in other's recipes. It's a thick, deep chocolate, almost a dark chocolate, that only needs that sweet and fatty infusion to make it into a nice chocolate.\r\n\r\nMost of my chocolate supporting flavorings have an inherent sweetness, FLV Cream, FA Meringue, LB Vanilla Ice Cream. These help add sweetness while adding creaminess and body to the mix.\r\n\r\nI have noticed that most chocolate flavorings need either a coconut note, or a caramel note to simulate either cocoa butter(which is in most chocolates), or the caramel to simulate a richness like a caramel chocolate. In this mix I decided to go the caramel route. It seemed to be the better choice for a \"Chocolate Milk\" rather than using a coconut flavoring which seems to be better when going after a \"Milk Chocolate\" if that makes sense. FA Butterscotch was my choice at just 1%.\r\n\r\nThe secret weapon here to make this into a chocolate milk that would stand out among the others is HS Chocolate Cream. I absolutely love this flavoring. It gives the mix a certain \"sourness\", kind of like a yogurt but with more emphasis on the creaminess. It really makes the mix stand out.\r\n\r\nIn cooking, to make any real chocolate recipe, you have to sweeten it up. I added .75% CAP Super Sweet to accomplish this. If you find it too high, feel free to lower it. But trust me on this, CHOCOLATES NEED TO BE SWEET! \r\n\r\nIf there's one con to this recipe, I would say that when vaping this, I have to change my cotton about every 2 days. It's a pain, but so worth it.\r\n\r\nThis needs to steep for 4-7 days, but if you can, a 2 week steep is so worth the wait.\r\n\r\nJust to let everyone know in the UK and EU,.... VanillaVapes now has Hangsen Chocolate Cream in stock! So, for those in the UK and EU, that were wanting to mix up Mayan Milk, now you can! \r\n\r\nhttps://www.vanillavapes.co.uk/chocolate-cream-concentrate-30ml/?ctk=c6612cf1-cf49-49e1-8f90-b2ac58206af9&fbclid=IwAR0HvbL34iYrOIATB2Y8am_nQTLr4VPhyxcrJVU3fDlTCReJjuSlGA95F-o\r\n\r\nI hope you will mix, comment, and or rate, it make us all better mixers. :)\r\nVisit Freedom To Mix on Discord https://discord.gg/cMUjtPf\r\nJoin our Freedom To Mix FaceBook group https://www.facebook.com/groups/415341418920740/ \r\nVisit https://freedomtomix.com/ for resources and information on DIY mixing!

My wife vapes it exclusively. All the heat around this recipe is warranted - it is as close to a chocolate milk experience you can gets. Just exceptional."},{"user":"cxxxxp","score":"5","text":"I tested it a couple of times throughout the steep and something magical happens at the 2 week mark and this forms the perfect chocolate milk vape. THANK you folkart for this, it's divine 8) easily 5 stars, I learnt a lot from mixing this up."},{"user":"Grfxman","score":"5","text":"Everyone said what I wanted to say below... this is a winner winner chicken dinner banger of a vape. The very best chocolate recipe ever! I have mixed so many bottles of this, it is my absolute favorite pairing with a cup of coffee or cappuccino. It is perfectly balanced and all the typical notes you get with a chocolate vape are not present in this mix. You just get a thick dark rich creamy chocolate cream. Happy to give this 5 stars!"},{"user":"MaschelleMEcfs","score":"5","text":"This is, by far, my favorite chocolate vape I've ever had!  I have tried countless chocolate flavors via DIY and Manufactured searching for one that really does taste like chocolate.  I got close with a commercial flavor but went taste blind to it quite rapidly.  This beauty holds it's own to the last drop.  I vape it every day and I love the creamy, velvety mouthfeel and the authentic chocolate taste of this vape!  It's sweet without being too sweet and very milky!  I don't think it can be beaten in it's category!  Easily 5 stars! "},{"user":"AAP-DAAP-DERP","score":"5","text":"The best chocolate-themed juice I had in my experience! Perfect amount of sweetness as well. Steeped it over two weeks and it's blissful! Thank you Folkart!"},{"user":"Deftohms","score":"5","text":"I highly advise that you a:mix this and b: DEFINITELY let it steep 14 days. I got a band aid flavor after the first 7 days, but after 14 days this turns into easily the most satisfying and full chocolate milk flavor. I can vape it for hours/all day without getting a band aid flavor and without getting tired of it, which was surprising because its incredibly rich. I also found that it treats your cotton a little better after 14 days. Thanks for this one! It''ll be in my rotation for a while for sure."},{"user":"Sebastien","score":"5","text":""},{"user":"goosegirl","score":"5","text":"In over 6 years of vaping, I have never tried a chocolate vape, but all the hype over Mayan Milk got me off the fence.  I steeped 2 weeks as recommended, and I could smell it changing into chocolate milk.  It was a fascinating science experiment.  The flavor is perfect, but I do feel it is a 2% milk chocolate milk.  I prefer less creaminess, as I can vape it longer, but it would be interesting to intensify the cream for an after dinner vape.  This recipe was a total game changer for me, and everyone should mix it, if for no other reason, just to smell the effect time has on a mix.  Outstanding work, Folkart.  You have my respect."},{"user":"rcm1968","score":"5","text":"I'm like a kid all over again, omg omg omg, lol. This is a very delicious vape. could only wait till day 7, but luckily I made a 140ml, so hopefully be able to try at 2 weeks:) This will be in my rotation easily, even as summer comes, be perfect with my coffees:), nice job folkart, well done, would give more stars easily."},{"user":"kitu5","score":"5","text":"This is one hell of an amazing vape. Rich, chocolatey, just a spot on chocolate milk. The part that makes this amazing is the slight, oh so very slight touch of nuttiness that gets enhanced by the variety of creams and the sweetness of the butterscotch enhancing everything. A hair too rich to be an all day vape, but something well worth experiencing repeatedly."},{"user":"Ebc88","score":"5","text":"This good and is a well executed chocolate vape. It is cream and the chocolate is smooth with no funky off notes. My only knock is it is a little too sweet for my ADV likings. Other than that it is perfect I believe you created an excellent chocolate base with HA Chocolate Cream and CAP Double V2, going to try it in a few recipes i have been tinkering with. "},{"user":"CriticalVape","score":"5","text":"Wow, well done. I know this had to take some time. Especially dialing-in that chocolate and cream, but you succeeded. The chocolate does have a super creamy feel, and it does evoke chocolate milk. A masterful combo. Even off the S&amp;V this works, with just slight off-notes, but it really gets better with time. It's awesome how well FA Meringue can play as a fatty cream when paired well. After a few days the blend comes together and smells wonderful. Excellent. You definitely went hunting the Unicorn on this trip and scored a hit. "},{"user":"BigFoot1","score":"5","text":"Mixed it after first 7 day got a slight bandaid flavor from something in it. After 14 days it was a nice chocolate milk going in my rotation for sure."},{"user":"AlfredPudding","score":"5","text":"This is easily a five star recipe. You can almost taste the amount of work that went into getting it right. While it's still not completely perfect due to the lacking chocolate flavors available, it's the closest thing I have tried to date. I have no doubt that folkart will continue to work on this and make it into something even more incredible. I was in the same boat as Graham before trying this; I was convinced that chocolate e-liquid would always be a mildly unpleasant experience. This changed my mind. It's an unbelievably delicious chocolate vape, and the tricks folkart applied are insanely beneficial to anyone else working on a chocolate profile. HS Chocolate Cream has the the perfect combination of usable chocolate and heavy dairy quality to provide the foundation for a chocolate milk. It's bolstered by CAP Double Chocolate V2, which is unique in that it can be used in the background instead of bullying the other flavors. While it's still not a perfect chocolate, I completely see why it was picked for this endeavor. FLV Cream, FA Meringue, and LB Vanilla Ice Cream provide a wonderful, thick body to the experience, and help tone down the aggressive chocolate notes in the mix. Finally, what really completes this recipe and keeps me coming back is FA Butterscotch. You find it on the tail end of the exhale, and it does a great job of keeping you interested and smoothing everything out. While .75% Super Sweet might seem like too much in any other situation, it fits in here and doesn't come across as overly sweet at all. This beautiful creation is the only chocolate recipe I can recommend to anyone, and I will certainly be coming back to mix it again in the future.
