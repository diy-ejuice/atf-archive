A nice soft dessert tobacco, with warm leather and woody undertones, nestled under layers of graham cracker and toasted marshmallow, with a smooth layer of creamy hazelnut made even more creamy by the Milky Undertones, with a soft spiced fig note floating near the top.  \r\n\r\nThis recipe doesn't need much more in the way of sweetener, but if you're adding any I'd stick to the 0.25% to 0.75% amount just to accent the sweetness of this recipe.
