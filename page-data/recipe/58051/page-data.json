It's 8% VBIC, 3% Kentucky Bourbon, 2% Toasted Marshmallow, 1% Brown Sugar. If you like TFA VBIC and are patient, I highly recommend trying it. However, that stuff requires a three-week steep to be good and a month to be amazing. And pepper tasters can't enjoy it. A straight sub for TFA VBIC using CAP or FW just isn't the same. So I tried making my own faster-steeping, pepper taster-friendly, version.\r\n\r\nLB VIC + HS VIC is my favorite replacement for TFA VBIC if I want to make something for the pepper people. LB is a just a bit too light and fluffy by itself but a lil touch of HS makes it so rich and satisfying. \r\n\r\nTFA KB + TM, if you haven't tried these two together, catch up, please. See Coop's Kiwi Bourbon recipe for details. The way that toasty thick sweetness melts into the bourbon is sexual. \r\n\r\nJF Dulce De Leche - There's the brown sugar flavor that Bourbon basically begs for, without the long wait. The problem with vaping Taclite's recipe without the long steep is that TFA Brown Sugar at 1%. Taste it too soon, it's like the brown sugar is very angry and punishes you for your impatience. But if you just use less, it won't reach the eventual perfection of month-old Taclite BIC. This JF DDL, on the other hand, settles into the cream just as fast as the bourbons do. And if you overdrip a bit when mixing, no big deal. Can't say that for TFA Brown Sugar, an extra 0.15% of that could be catastrophic. \r\n\r\nFLV Bourbon - Even at just 0.5%, this is the real star here. It's not as sweet corny sour mash flavored as TFA's (but also not as watered down), it doesn't have the alcoholic bite of FA Whiskey (which isn't a bourbon anyway), and it's not as well-rounded as RF SC's bourbon (but it doesn't need a steep to not be gross and then promptly fade out like that one either). What it does is absolutely nail that oak barrel aged thing like nobody's business. This flavor might not make you want to ditch other liquor flavors, but it'll certainly make you think twice about reaching for TFA Red Oak or FA Oakwood.  \r\n\r\nThis recipe (and the one that inspired it) goes so well with a cup of coffee in the morning, it's ridiculous.

So Coop's kiwi bourbon sadly never took off with me. This mix though has enough going on to make me like the flavor. I really recommend this mix, I find it to be very tasty and nuanced!"},{"user":"TamVapes","text":"My first drip of this, I felt any minute I was going to get a bit tipsy.  I envisioned a time of sitting at a bar with a drink in one hand and a cigarette in the other hand.  I don't think that smoking is allowed in bars anymore, I don't know, that was another lifetime for me.  This is day 3, and WOW!  This is amazing   It is a nice smooth creamy inhale and then bam a slightly sour boozy exhale.  Awesome.  I still think I might get tipsy from vaping it.  Great Vape!  This will definitely go great with a cup of a coffee as it has steeped  Thank you for sharing your creation!    "},{"user":"shyndo","text":"EVERY SINGLE DAY THIS GETS BETTER AND IT'S ALREADY AMAZING! It's sweet, deep, nuanced, and it doesn't take 3 weeks to get there! This is taclite's on steroids! This is going in a few of my friend's stockings this Christmas! Thank you for introducing the world to jf dulce de leche and this masterclass recipe!"}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"58051","name":"Bour-BAM!"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
