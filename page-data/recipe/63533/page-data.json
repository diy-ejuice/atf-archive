Just like you walked in to a congressman's office to do some shady shit. \r\n\r\nThis is an all artificial version of an NET mix I was working on a while back, but it just wasn't coming together. The problem was most likely that I was using RF SC Bourbon, but I eventually just moved on to other things. Got some of these FLV in, and decided to give it another go. \r\n\r\nRed Burley and Kentucky Blend make a really nice combo here to create an earthy, smoky tobacco with a bit of ash. \r\n\r\nBourbon and Wood Spice top off that bold Tobacco with a bit of manliness. There's a bit of oak in the bourbon, which plays really well with the Wood Spice, which tastes the way I wish I smelled. The actual bourbon part is quite nice as well. I'm not really a bourbon drinker, but if I were, I'd want it to taste like this. It's a fancy bourbon. It's got body, and it's thick. It's more than just a bourbon flavor, it beefs everything up and makes it all feel full in the mouth. \r\n\r\nHeat is here to give it a little punch. It's not real noticeable, but you'll be able to tell it's there. It's not quite enough to turn the bourbon in to Hot Damn, but it's enough to feel. \r\n\r\nI recommend making 10% dilutions of Heat and Wood Spice since they are pretty strong. A drop too much in a 30 ml could turn this in to hot cologne. Stay safe out there. \r\n\r\nI liked this quite a bit fresh, and it just gets better as it ages. Wood Spice is a bit strong at first, but it calms down after a couple days.
