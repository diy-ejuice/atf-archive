I dont have the other 2 flavorings to try but ill def order the ws-23. Ive been looking for something to give an ice cold effect without changing the flavor. For the fizz try 1-1.5% cap lemon. The cola overpowers any lemon notes and the added citrus gives it a slight fizz effect. Cool to see other mixers coming up with similar liquids in a sea of flavor concentrates!","score":4}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"59033","name":"Vanilla Coke "}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
