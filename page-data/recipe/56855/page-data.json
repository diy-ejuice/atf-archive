Flavor is a warm and buttery cookie dough recipe rolled up into an RY4. There's more a focus on the cookie dough in this recipe compared to the original. It's great for those who don't enjoy Pie Crust.\r\nFULL DEV NOTES HERE -> http://diyordievaping.com/2017/08/10/tweaked-obsidian-cookie-dough-ry4-diy-e-liquid-recipes/","steep_days":"7","temperature":"0","recipe_score":4.8,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:49:30.000-05:00","best_vg":"50%","views":"20979","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Ry4 Double","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Graham Cracker Clear","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Cookie","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Vanilla Custard","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Butterscotch","vendor":"FA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Super Sweet","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":500}],"reviews":[{"user":"BigRed","text":"i like this one better i used custards v2 tho"},{"user":"Mr-G","text":"was very sceptic after i smell it but it's outstanding "},{"user":"SlashaLO","text":"Out of the two, I prefer the original. Part of it to me is how FLV Cookie plays with RY4D vs how Cookie Dough. There is some sort of off-note to me that I am not a fan of here, and I don't know why. It was still a good vape, but there was that thing in there that stopped it from being great. Compared to the original, personally I got no offnotes in it, where I know some did with the Pie Crust. Still a good job with the tweaking"},{"user":"TamVapes","text":"I enjoyed the original Obsidian, but this version is amazing.  This will be part of my ADV rotation for sure.  FLV Cookie is amazing.  Thank you for introducing me to this great flavor."},{"user":"TheDrStore","text":"This is a really great, bright cookie dough flavor. Really love this new tweaked one!"},{"user":"Chewymidget","text":"This is a great mix. I like it more than the original. Worth the cost of the FLV Cookie for entry.
