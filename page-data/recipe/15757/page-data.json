This started out pretty complex but after trying to hit all the right notes it wound up being simpler than I would have expected. I want to continue tinkering and getting feedback but I'm happy enough with this that it's ready for public consumption.\r\n\r\nIt's ok as a S&V but really comes into its own after 2 days and it incredibly badass.","steep_days":"0","temperature":"0","recipe_score":4,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:48:50.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"2555","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Razzleberry","vendor":"FW","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Koolada 10 Pg","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":750},{"name":"Cactus","vendor":"INW","millipercent":1000}],"reviews":[{"user":"BuryMeInSmoke","text":"Great recipe - and awesome way to use up the FW Razzleberry I have that I can't seem to find any other use for.  INW Cactus really makes the Razzleberry pop and Ithe TFA Koolada helps it out quite a bit too.  Nice and simple flavouring that's by no means boring.  Best consumed fresh as the Razzleberry fades a lot faster than the Cactus, by the two week mark I found the Cactus a little over powering."},{"user":"Jthectic","text":"Subtle but refreshing. After 2 week steep, it is quite mellow but pleasant. May lack a strong flavour, in which case raising razzleberry to ~8% or higher may help (I find it to be a weaker flavour below 8%).
