My first ADV! It is a lot sweeter than I was expecting but that isn't necessarily a bad thing. Definitely has a lot of IPA characteristics, including a fermentation note that I really enjoy. I love IPAs so this was definitely something I was going to like. My only criticism is that the Cactus is a bit too noticable in the recipe. I'll mix it at 0.4% next time to see if that changes.","score":5},{"user":"tw2k","text":"","score":5},{"user":"ID10-T","text":"I didn't think this could really taste this much like a nice citrusy IPA without something at least a little overtly fermented but somehow the bit of funk in the Guanabana and Pink Guava gets the job done beautifully. Not only is it refreshing and all-day delicious, I feel like a grown up vaping it. Cheers!  ","score":5},{"user":"kitu5","text":"Oktoberfest...need a beer vape...sooo...&#xD;\n&#xD;\nThis is hilarious. I'm not a beer guy. I hate IPAs. Too heavy. This tho, this makes me understand the appeal. It's a nice heavy beer flavor, good amount of hops, dark, delicious. The pink guava and the blood orange add just the right touch of citrus to make this absolutely delicious. I had to track down the beer that inspired it/goes with it, and whelp...still hate IPAs. It was good for an IPA, but...yeah. Anywho. Seriously tho, if i could bottle this stuff and add booze to it, I might finally be able to get the appeal. My only regret is I did not make a bigger bottle. Thank god it's practically a shake and vape.&#xD;\n&#xD;\nDamn, this is good adult flavored stuff. Do yourself a favor and try it. Easily what it says on the tin. This one's ADV worthy.","score":5},{"user":"Drawaes","text":"I am a bit skittish when it comes to juice but this has become a solid in my ADV rotation. It is brilliant if you like a nice ice cold beer, or if you just feel you are an adult and are sick of vaping candies and strawberry milk. Its got a solid fruit bite and really does remind me of a fruity citrus IPA sitting by the river on a hot summers day.","score":5}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"78350","name":"All Day"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
