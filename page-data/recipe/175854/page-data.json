The goal here was quite simple... get as close to my all time favourite chocolate bar using the least flavourings and letting quite possibly 3 of the best caramel/toffee concentrates do all the talking. These 3 concentrates work in harmony with each other to create a deliciously smooth,sweet vape that isnâ€™t to taxing on the tastebuds. Itâ€™s quick,itâ€™s simple and itâ€™s fucking delicious!!! I added 0.5% Capella super sweet and I recommend you do the same to really make this recipe pop. **S&V approved** please mix it up,rate and review my recipe and as always happy mixing fam ðŸ’™","steep_days":"3 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:51:14.000-05:00","best_vg":"75%","views":"1657","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Creme Brulee","vendor":"VT","millipercent":3000},{"name":"English Toffee","vendor":"VT","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Caramel Toffee","vendor":"HS","millipercent":1000}],"reviews":[{"user":"RudeRudi","text":"This simple 3 ingredient masterpiece is a winner on all fronts.
