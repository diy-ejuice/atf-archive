I took inspiration from skiddlz all cap recipe , needs 2 weeks to steep, tastes pretty funky before 2 weeks.  \r\n\r\nIts pretty strange to me that it doesn't taste like cake, it is very creamy and a little rich.   After a week I noted \"this tastes fucking weird\"  I took it down today after 2 weeks and I've almost vaped the entire 30ml if that says anything about it.
