If you usually vape at low temperature, you may want to cut the lemon in this recipe.  Also in general the lemon will start stronger and mellow out the longer the juice steeps.\r\n\r\nI published a recipe a while ago called Lemonberry Cheesecake.  It was inspired (but not cloned) from a commercial juice of the same name.  I never really thought the base was perfect, though.\r\n\r\nI recently tried Simply Cheesecake and like it a lot.  I think it comes together a lot better than many other cheesecakes I've tried.  So I added the lemon and berries from my other recipe to it.  I think the end result is pretty good.  The lemon really serves to highlight the berries.\r\n\r\nI debated whether to use just the Forrest mix or to mix TPA Berry Mix together with it.  If you prefer you could probably leave out the TPA Berry Mix and double the Forrest Mix.\r\n\r\nThis is vapable after a few days but the cheesecake takes a bit of a steep to get its full depth.","steep_days":"10","temperature":"0","recipe_score":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-12T01:41:36.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"1271","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Cream Cheese Icing","flavor_id":"2380","vendor":"LA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"New York Cheesecake","flavor_id":"90","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":5000},{"name":"Shisha Vanilla","flavor_id":"841","vendor":"INW","millipercent":500},{"name":"Vanilla Custard","flavor_id":"131","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":500},{"name":"Custard","flavor_id":"484","vendor":"FA","millipercent":300},{"name":"Juicy Lemon","flavor_id":"79","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Lemon","flavor_id":"660","vendor":"INW","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Forrest Mix (forest Fruit Mix)","flavor_id":"453","vendor":"FA","millipercent":750},{"name":"Berry Mix","flavor_id":"5899","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1000}],"reviews":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"112149","name":"Simply Lemonberry Cheesecake"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
