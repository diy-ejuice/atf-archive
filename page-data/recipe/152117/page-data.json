I have recently embarked on the nic salt journey and this is my first NicSalt for pod systems release, I chose a really simple and not complex flavor profile with known flavors for easy mixing by anyone... I shouldnt have to leave any flavor notes as these flavors are known  well enough and used broadly. After adding my Nicriver salts @6mg i was really pleased with the outcome of this mix it tasted like strawberry watermelon slighty sour and sweet with a nice brightness the pear brought to the party. I hope anyone who tries this has the same experience.... Happy mixing\r\n","steep_days":"3 (SNV)","temperature":"20","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-02T07:32:23.000-05:00","best_vg":"60%","views":"1492","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Double Watermelon","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Big Watermelon","vendor":"MB","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Sweet Strawberry Rf","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Pear","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Super Sweet","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1000}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"152117","name":"StrawMelon  Tha Buddha Puff   \"For pods\""}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
