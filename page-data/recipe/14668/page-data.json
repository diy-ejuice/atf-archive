Ever imagine what would happen if FA Fuji and FA Black Currant made sweet love and reproduced? Now well you have. This is a beautiful love child, indeed. Strong in character, this is quite tart and tasty as a shake and vape and gets sweeter as it matures. After 4 days, it maintains a crisp (yet juicy) texture. Past that point, who knows? Let me know if it lasts that long. Replace INW Pineapple with 0.5% TFA Pineapple if you must.","steep_days":"3 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":4,"updated_at":"2020-12-12T14:04:49.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"4286","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Fuji","flavor_id":"506","vendor":"FA","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Blackcurrant","flavor_id":"545","vendor":"FA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Golden Pineapple","flavor_id":"61","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":750},{"name":"Pineapple","flavor_id":"809","vendor":"INW","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Cactus","flavor_id":"647","vendor":"INW","millipercent":750}],"reviews":[{"user":"rougeislander401","text":"I absolutely love this mix!! I had a bottle of FA blackcurrant sitting around doing nothing so I finally decided to give it a try using this recipe and boy was I glad I did!! It may sound like 2% fa blackcurrant is a lot but it works wonderfully here! Great balance with currant and the front letting you know of its existence, I will be mixing this again thanks philo!","score":5},{"user":"Jthectic","text":"Had this steeped for a month now, and its been very solid from shake and vape all the way till now. Still sweet and holds up the tartness. There is a complex intertwining of fuji and blackcurrant, with some pineapple top and base notes throughout. Solid fruity mix ðŸ‘Œ","score":5},{"user":"Satellite324","text":"Wanted a fruity vape with black currant, so tried this one.  Smooth &amp; tasty.  I might drop down the fuji a bit next time, but this hit the profile I was looking for.  ","score":4},{"user":"horizonism","text":"Perfectly balanced blending right here. I don't know how you managed to make this work. Everything I try with these two pineapples ends up tasting weird. This is just smooth and delightful, and never gets old. Great work!

Mine certainly didn't last 4 days.","score":4}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"14668","name":"One Night"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
