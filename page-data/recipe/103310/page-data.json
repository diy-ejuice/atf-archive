So simple yet so smooth and nice. As someone who has a tough time with strawberries, I can actually taste something, even if a little starbursty. Sadly, after the first vape or so, I can no longer get strawberry but I do get a nice thick pudding, so it's still a win for me. Like ID10-T said, I need to play with this combo and mix other 2%-ers in here."},{"user":"ID10-T","score":"5","text":"This is terrific for such a simple recipe, just FLV Vanilla Pudding with enough strawberry to make it taste pink and both the added weight and emulsifying from the FLV Cream perfecting it. Iâ€™m definitely going to borrow this concise 3% Vanilla Pudding + 1% Cream + 2% something else format to try mixing up some more 1-2-3 puddings.
