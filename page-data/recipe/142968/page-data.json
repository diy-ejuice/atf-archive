The combination of flavor seemed so obvious that I had to give it go! \r\n\r\nFW Blackberry is, in my view, the king of Blackberries as it encapsulates the essence of a true, fresh, blackberry in every sense. It is beatifully tart with the perfect amount of sweetness with zero floral notes, which is the nemesis of this fine berry. The innate earthyness compliments the earthy notes of the pear to perfection, resulting in a delishious medley of these unlikely bedfellows.\r\n\r\nMy trusty pear combo does the heavy lifting here to provide an unbelievably realistic, fresh pear flavor. FA Pear brings the juicy, run down your chin, pear whilst INW Pear adds the gritty texture, crunch and mouth feel. \r\n\r\nFA Cream blends our heroes together and adds a fabulous,  creamy, mouthfeel to the stereotipal ‘watery’ fruits used. You could use FLV with pleasure but I have a secret love affair with FA Cream and I can simple not find it in myself to cheat!\r\n\r\nThis baby is pretty good off the shake but will meld to perfection after 3 to 5 days.\r\n","steep_days":"5 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:50:47.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"2042","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Blackberry","flavor_id":"1194","vendor":"FW","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Pear","flavor_id":"411","vendor":"FA","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Pear","flavor_id":"665","vendor":"INW","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Cream Fresh","flavor_id":"540","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000}],"reviews":[{"user":"Gordo","text":"this is delicious off the shake"},{"user":"DumHed","text":"This is a great recipe, its even better with shape up pear instead of FA pear."}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"142968","name":"Blackpear"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
