This is going up in my top 5 recipes, excellent job, thanks!! ","score":5},{"user":"MrBurgundy","text":"Another delicious mix, Moose! I love the cereal base you conjured up. It has loads of texture and takes to the blueberry really well. Apple Snacks and Sweet Cereal Flakes transform Cereal 27 into something more “generic” than cornflakes or corn puffs, and I could see it working with all kinds of cereal profiles! The cream is subtle and doesn’t detract from the crunchiness. I thought the blueberry would really be out in front of everything, but it’s sitting right where it should be. The balance here is definitely on point. Tasty stuff, my dude.
