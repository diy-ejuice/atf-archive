Not alot gone into this one tbh kind of just had the idea, mixed it, vaped it & enjoyed it.\r\n\r\nThe blue raspberries with hibiscus speak for them selves as theyre pretty popular combo's although using hibiscus candy to fit the profile.\r\nSour water melon and jelly cherry are also a tasty combo and turning them blue works a treat. Using VTA sherbet as a candy like fizzy additive whilst sorbet base lifts the melon and provides some moisture for the slush rather than a straight candy. Also using sour apple as an additive as it carries little apple flavouring and more of a sour note.","steep_days":"3","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"total_reviews":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T21:33:28.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"861","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Sour Blue Raspberry Candy","vendor":"WF","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Blue Raspberry","vendor":"LB","millipercent":5000},{"name":"Sour Watermelon Candy","vendor":"WF","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Blackcherry Jelly Bean SC","vendor":"WF","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Hibiscus Candy","vendor":"WF","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Fizzy Sherbet","vendor":"VT","millipercent":1250},{"name":"Sorbet Base","vendor":"VT","millipercent":1250},{"name":"Sour Apple","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1500}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"202868","name":"BRDZ Candy Slush"}}}
