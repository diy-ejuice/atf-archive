Apple is \r\nThe perfect filling for a nice fluffy roll.  Fuji is acting as our top note.  2% puts it right where I want it.\r\n\r\nTPA STAW RIPE 3.5%\r\nAgain no CinAppleBerry roll would be complete without everyone's favorite strawberry.\r\nThe Strawberry is supporting but not outdone by the Fuji.  Strawberry ripe is propping up our top note while adding that ever elusive complexity we are all chasing.\r\n\r\nCAP CIN DANISH SWIRL 2%\r\nCin. Danish Swirl is acting as our base and really forming the roll of this delicious desert.\r\nThe is no other Danish I would rather wrap my AppleBerry in.\r\n\r\nJF BAV. CREAM 2% \r\nUnlike some other super sweet desert rolls we are filling this one with Bavarian cream.\r\nNot only does this add a nice bridge between the fruit and the Danish but also provides a silky smooth vape. \r\n\r\nJF YELLOW CAKE 4%\r\nI want my roll to have a cinnamon coated outer layer but a nice cakey\r\nlayer between the cinnamon and the filling.  Yellow cake provides this layer nicely. \r\n\r\nFA MARSHMELLOW 1.5%\r\nMarshmallow is fluffing up all the ingredients while adding a touch of sweetness to the creamy filling\r\nof this desert vape.  Nothing brings a recipe like this together quite the way marshmallow does.","steep_days":"0","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"total_reviews":null,"updated_at":"2020-11-26T09:49:44.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"800","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Fuji","vendor":"JF","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Strawberry (ripe)","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":3500},{"name":"Cinnamon Danish Swirl","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Yellow Cake","vendor":"JF","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Bavarian Cream","vendor":"JF","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Marshmallow","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1500}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"17438","name":"Cinnamon AppleBerry Roll"}}}
