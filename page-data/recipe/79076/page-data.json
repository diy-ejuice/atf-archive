I'd say vape this after 3 days, and try to not let it sit for long because the flavors do mute. Shouldn't be a problem since this is a delicious mix.","score":5},{"user":"cxxxxp","text":"This is a banger off the shake and I actually preferred it in the first two weeks than the next two! For me most of the strawberry faded but I'm also a non-taster at the best of times. Thanks for this recipe, I really enjoyed the dragonfruit in the front and backed up by the strawberry. I haven't had the original for years, but this has to be pretty close Wayne and you've created a delicious, smooth and perfectly sweetened juice right here! Loved it.&#xD;\n&#xD;\n(Edit &amp; Note; It's the TPA ripe for me that I can hardly taste that anytime, the TPA S/b did help, as I said first two weeks great so mix small batches ðŸ˜Š I've got some more strawberries (OOO, WF, PUR, RF, JFAU) coming in soon and I'll give this a try and let y'all know how it goes!","score":5},{"user":"kitu5","text":"The smell on this stuff is amazing. The strawberries mix well with the whipped cream, with the dragonfruit actually being noticable, and giving everything a zing that just sets it off (opened up the mtl into partial DTL to get a real feel for the flavor). I'd say it's muted, but well, the original tasted that way to me as well, so you definitely nailed the hell outta it. As I love the original, I have to say job done, man. Nice one!","score":5},{"user":"DavidAnanda","text":"This muted very bad. The main profile is good at smell but it has no strong flavor about a month later. I will try this using dragon fruit 6%, then lowering straw ripe at 1% and strawberry at 5%. I think the problem is with the strawberry ripe amount of EM .Thank you, you got the profile very well, first time I say dragoin fruit at that level and it really amaze me.&#xD;\n&#xD;\nPD: After long step the straw ripe does his trick, mute to hell. Next time I will add +1% to dragon fruit and low down -1% the straw ripe or even clean it and add sweet strawberry +3%.","score":5},{"user":"cdaniell30","text":"This is the first recipe I've tried with this much dragonfruit that I still enjoyed.","score":5},{"user":"SpankyMcyanky","text":"This turned out great.","score":5}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"79076","name":"Milk of the Poppy by Vapetasia #REMIXMONTH"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
