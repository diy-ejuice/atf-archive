Puck suggested this one to give it a try. I tried a few pulls and it wasn't for me but I dont really like candy flavors much. This comes a across as a powdery blue fun dip straight up. I was a little distracted by that powdery taste myself, but my brother loved it. I probably mixed him up three blue raspberry mixes and this was his top choice. So, I would suspect this is appealing to candy lovers who want that gritty sugary blue feeling because that's what he loved. Maybe it's not even all that gritty, but I can't get the bottle back from him long enough to test it again to see if I'm crazy. Either way, bro the candy lover gives this a full five stars. You made his half numb taste buds happy.","score":5}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"160915","name":"Blue Fundip"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
