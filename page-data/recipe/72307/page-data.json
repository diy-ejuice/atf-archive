Banana Milk is my favorite banana cream recipe, so I thought it would make the best base.  This is based off of a version of Banana Milk I tweaked a little.  I have a bit of an issue with both TPA Banana Cream and LA Banana Cream when used alone...they're very much a candy banana flavor to me, and remind me of Runts.  I usually use a combo of FA Banana and HS Banana to get what I feel like is a more realistic banana flavor.  I tried it with just HS/FA Banana, but I felt like it went too far the other direction.  So I ended up compromising by using a mix of the original Banana Cream flavors from the recipe and the more realistic bananas.  I also removed the sweetener from the original recipe, which I felt wasn't necessarily.  The resulting Banana Milk base was a bit less sweet and more realistic version, but I still felt like it kept the nice creamy flavor from the original.\r\n\r\nWhile i liked this version of banana milk, I didn't feel like I could ADV it.  So I decided to try adding some strawberry flavor to it.  I'm a fan of ID10-T's \"holy trinity\" of strawberries, because I find that it doesn't suffer from the vaper's tongue I always get when I use TPA Strawberry/Ripe Strawberry.  However, my banana milk already had over 15% in flavorings, and there really wasn't room for more ingredients.  I decided to try something I'd thought about a few times before: I took the entire recipe, and scaled down all of the percentages using an Excel spreadsheet to bring the total closer to 10% before adding the strawberry.  This step is the reason for the odd percentages in the recipe.  Then it was just a matter of getting the best ratio of strawberry to banana milk base.\r\n\r\nI'm really pleased with the end result.  A creamy banana milkshake topped with sweet strawberries.  I ADV this during the summer time.  I know it's a lot of ingredients, but I wouldn't recommend subs.","steep_days":"7","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T17:34:28.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"3571","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Banana","vendor":"HS","millipercent":1430},{"name":"Banana","vendor":"FA","millipercent":2140},{"name":"Banana Cream","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1430},{"name":"Banana Cream","vendor":"LA","millipercent":360},{"name":"Butter Cream","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":710},{"name":"Cheesecake (graham Crust)","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1430},{"name":"Marshmallow","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1430},{"name":"Red Touch (strawberry)","vendor":"FA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Shisha Strawberry","vendor":"INW","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Strawberry Sweet","vendor":"JF","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Sweet Cream","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1430}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"72307","name":"Banana milk with Strawberry"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
