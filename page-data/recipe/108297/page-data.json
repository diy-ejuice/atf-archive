I was watching mixing vixens on you tube and they were doing all flavorah recipes and i happen to love making all flavorah recipes. SO i set out to use some flavors i either hadnt used ever like flv apricot and flavors i dont use very often.  I was aiming for a sour peach gummy and what i got was more of a realistic juicy peach!! I mean it may have a slightly artificial taste but for me its more of a juicy peach in a sugary syrup absolutely delicious if you ask me. I haven't done it yet but i feel like this delicious peach would work great in a peach ice cream or frozen yogurt or just plain yogurt  or peaches and cream. I am sharing this because i dislike almost every peach other than a select few but  i cant seem to put this peach down. It is a dripping juicy peach with a sugary sweetness. Sweeten to taste with your preferred sweetener or dont sweeten at all your call. Enjoy!! \r\n\r\nIts a dam good peach!!!!","steep_days":"2 (SNV)","temperature":"420","recipe_score":5,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:50:17.000-05:00","best_vg":"75%","views":"2515","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Peach Gummy","flavor_id":"4313","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Sour Apple","flavor_id":"4379","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":750},{"name":"Apricot","flavor_id":"8549","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":500},{"name":"Cotton Candy","flavor_id":"4377","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1000}],"reviews":[{"user":"tw2k","text":"Adding apricot to an already succulent Peach Gummy was masterful, and tasty.
