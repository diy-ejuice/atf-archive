I used Wayne's ice cream base he posted and added caramel. By adding LA Caramel, it gives a heavier richness to the VBIC. I think you could pair just about any fruit with this base. I am very new to mixing and would appreciate any critiques of this base.  Most of my recipes  are mixed at maxVG.","steep_days":"2 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"total_reviews":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T11:43:18.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"2532","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Vanilla Bean Ice Cream","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Caramel","vendor":"LA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Vanilla Custard","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":500}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"25921","name":"Ice Milk"}}}
