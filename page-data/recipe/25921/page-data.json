I used Wayne's ice cream base he posted and added caramel. By adding LA Caramel, it gives a heavier richness to the VBIC. I think you could pair just about any fruit with this base. I am very new to mixing and would appreciate any critiques of this base.  Most of my recipes  are mixed at maxVG.","steep_days":"2 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-10T14:51:45.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"2540","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Vanilla Bean Ice Cream","flavor_id":"186","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Caramel","flavor_id":"929","vendor":"LA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Vanilla Custard","flavor_id":"131","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":500}],"reviews":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"25921","name":"Ice Milk"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
