Who doesn't want to celebrate with a tropical Christmas?  A creamy, buttery fruity delight that brings pecan to the party for something different.\r\n\r\nCAP Mango when combined with other fruits maintains it's themed taste and picks up sweetness.  The back end musky taste so many complain about from mango is eliminated here because of the other fruit additions.\r\n\r\nCheesecake Graham Crust and VBIC are the base and here for the the creaminess I wanted for this mix.  The percentages are just enough to make it the main profile over the fruit.  Sometimes you want a cream with fruit instead of a fruit with cream...There is a difference, and is intended here.\r\n\r\nButter Pecan is the star of the show here, and puts the creaminess on another level while adding a nut highlight.  It accentuates the already added cream notes with buttery goodness.  Biscuit is in there to add to that effect without increasing the nut profile.\r\n\r\nThis recipe was made for drippers.  A week steep is necessary to let the butter pecan settle in and let the fruits figure out how they will lay in this mix.  In the end, it's a different take on a mango presentation, and not another overwhelming fruit mix.  Mango Mas to all. \r\n\r\n","steep_days":"7","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-06T20:41:52.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"2153","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Sweet Mango","flavor_id":"120","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Strawberry (ripe)","flavor_id":"271","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Raspberry (sweet)","flavor_id":"267","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":750},{"name":"Cheesecake (graham Crust)","flavor_id":"152","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Butter Pecan","flavor_id":"1212","vendor":"FW","millipercent":1250},{"name":"Vanilla Bean Ice Cream","flavor_id":"186","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Biscuit","flavor_id":"642","vendor":"INW","millipercent":1000}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"23203","name":"Mango Mas"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
