I worked at a B&M about a year ago and this was made for a co-worker of mine. I still make it from time to time for myself and a few others. Roughly a week steep time just to let the custard and icing meld things together and let the lemon mellow out.\r\n\r\nCookie base - FA Cookie and CAP Sugar Cookie mixed is always a winner, no explanation needed here.\r\n\r\nIcing base - FA Lemon Sicily is the main attraction here, but the mix between the LA Cream Cheese Icing, FA Meringue, and the FA Custard really make it a nice sweet and creamy frosting.","steep_days":"7","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"total_reviews":1,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:49:04.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"2099","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Cookie","vendor":"FA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Lemon Sicily","vendor":"FA","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Sugar Cookie","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Cream Cheese Icing","vendor":"LA","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Custard","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Meringue","vendor":"FA","millipercent":500}],"reviews":[{"user":"cdaniell30","score":"5","text":"I really enjoyed this one.
