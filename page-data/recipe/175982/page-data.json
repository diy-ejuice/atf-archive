Literally right off the shake this is on par with actual cooked apples. I was a bit scared of the apple filling at this % but it works well if you enjoy cinnamon, which I do. Wonderful apple flavour. Exactly what I've been looking for. I'd love to play with some custards, creams or crumble toppings with this. Well done, this is a wonderful mix and the taste in your tongue is like the real thing :) this is what FLV Apple Filling SHOULD taste like and if it steeps well you could just make a base flavour out of this for apple desserts üôÇ üçè","score":5}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"175982","name":"Country Apples (Apple Filling, Thai, Caramel, Butter Toffee, Pear, Pop)"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
