A little Almond FA is added to round the crunchiness of Cookie FA.\r\n\r\nRaspberries:\r\nRaspberry (Sweet) TPA is the main raspberry here, with a touch of Berryl FA and Raspberry (Malina) INW added to make it a little more realistic, tart and sweet.\r\n\r\nCreams:\r\nCustard FA is one of the best creams to add in most fruity vapes, because the lemony notes blend great with sour/tart fruits. Custard Premium FA is added to enhance the buttery feel a little more, and Mississipi INW because it's a great bridge between raspberries and biscuits/cookies. \r\n\r\nThe Super Sweet here is kinda needed, don't omit it if possible.\r\n\r\nNeeds some days of steep, for the butter to calm down.","steep_days":"5","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"total_reviews":1,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:50:36.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"2684","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Almond","vendor":"FA","millipercent":400},{"name":"Biscuit","vendor":"INW","millipercent":700},{"name":"Cheesecake (graham Crust)","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Cookie","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Butter","vendor":"FA","millipercent":200},{"name":"Custard","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Custard Premium","vendor":"FA","millipercent":700},{"name":"Mississippi","vendor":"INW","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Raspberry (sweet)","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Berryl (raspberry)","vendor":"FA","millipercent":300},{"name":"Raspberry","vendor":"INW","millipercent":300},{"name":"Super Sweet","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":400}],"reviews":[{"user":"nks","score":"5","text":""}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"130662","name":"Raspberry Tart"}}}
