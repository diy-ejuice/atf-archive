Light, sweet cake with just enough blueberry to give it a little something on the side.  I really enjoyed this one."},{"user":"heatbbx","text":"Just mixed this up, S&amp;V'd it. Delicious. Super light and fluffy, slight bit of lemon and you weren't kidding when you said you had to look for the blueberry. It's there but its so perfectly melded in you really have to search to notice it. 5* A+ Will mix again."},{"user":"SweetPoisonKim","text":"After 24 hour steep I dripped this in my hadaly, gotta say it's pretty damn yummy! Light and fluffy, I actually think the slight lemon twang compliments the blueberry wonderfully. Didn't think I'd get much blueberrry at 1% but it comes through at just the right amount. Great stuff!üëç"},{"user":"Jscoggs81","text":""}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"46737","name":"Angel food cake with light blueberry frosting"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
