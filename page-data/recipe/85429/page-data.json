I introduce Butternut Custard!\r\n\r\nButternut has a mild squash/pumpkin flavour with sweet and nutty nuances without being too \"pumpkiny\". It can be enjoyed sweet or savoury and in this version, I explore its inherent creamy and sweet characteristics to provide body and creaminess to the custard.\r\n\r\nThe INW Creme Brûlée and Custard combo is my go to and just works - without fail - and, I believe, the best brûlée out there.\r\n\r\nLA Vanilla Butternut celebrates the beauty of butternut by providing a well balanced and realistic butternut favour, enhanced by subtle vanilla undertones.\r\nINW Shisha Vanilla provides that little extra vanilla boost to take the Butternut from great to stupendous!\r\n\r\n1 drop of Rich Cinnamon per 30ml is plenty to provide the cinnamon , which a a natural pairing for butternut. \r\n\r\nThis starts popping from day 3 and is best after 5 days. The cinnamon takes some time to settle, so don't rush it...\r\n\r\nEnjoy!!!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  ","steep_days":"5","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"total_reviews":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T19:15:21.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"1612","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Creme Brulee (yc)","vendor":"INW","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Custard","vendor":"INW","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Vanilla Butternut","vendor":"LA","millipercent":6000},{"name":"Rich Cinnamon","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":10},{"name":"Shisha Vanilla","vendor":"INW","millipercent":1000}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"85429","name":"Butternut Custard"}}}
