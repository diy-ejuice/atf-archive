To make the best butterscotch vape out.  This was the first not to bad if I say so.  A butterscotch custard with whip cream and just a hint of almond.

Not picking up a whole lot of Butterscotch for some reason.  I'm getting a nice creamy yet plain vape.  I've made some similar mixes to this and the butterscotch took quite a while to come out of the background.  I'm hoping this does the same.  Updates to follow after another week of steeping."},{"user":"ianerb","score":"4","text":"yep this is good, been through the tester and a 30 and now a 100ml. I haven't vaped many butterscotch profiles but I like how it is laid back and not in your face and let it steep well past the 1 week mark"},{"user":"yeahIvape","score":"5","text":"Trying this now after 3D steep and wow, I really enjoy how naturally sweet it is! Surprised! Usually add sweetener to a lot but this is smoooooooooooth! Definitely gonna have to make another one to enjoy a full steep!"}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"65664","name":"The Butterscotch Theory Vol. 1"}}}
