It's a fairly thin candied/gummy black currant flavor so it makes an AWESOME base for a juicy soda profile. I don't get much gummy candy from this one but others seem to. \r\n\r\nAdding the combo of FA Fuji Apple and FA Pear does a ton of work to make this more of a beverage. They fill out the bottom notes of the mix and add a lot of juiciness. The apple and the pear compliment each other really nicely to get a full fruit profile with texture and mouth feel. \r\n\r\nLast, VT Fizzy Sherbet adds just the slightest hint of creamy bubbles and a really pleasant citrus note that finishes off the exhale . \r\n\r\nI use 0.5% CAP super sweet in this. \r\n\r\nSweeten to Taste. \r\n\r\nThis is a recipe that could benefit from cooling (WS23) or menthol if that's your sort of thing. \r\n\r\nWatch the Video Here:\r\n\r\nhttps://youtu.be/YQ7i4pjh1iA","steep_days":"1 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"total_reviews":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T21:33:31.000-05:00","best_vg":"80%","views":"304","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Fizzy Sherbet","vendor":"VT","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Pazzo RE (King)","vendor":"FA","millipercent":5000},{"name":"Pear","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Apple Fuji","vendor":"FA","millipercent":2000}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"207697","name":"King Fizz"}}}
