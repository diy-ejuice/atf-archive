Throat hit will be there for at least 7 days, so keep that in mind when selection  your peaches for mixing.\r\n\r\nINW Cherries is about as good as it gets for cherry imo.  Versatile enough for playing the role of most cherry flavors you can imagine without heading to cough syrup town. \r\n\r\nBrown sugar and vanilla bourbon cream give you a light burnt effect to your fruit (Thank you for the lesson CokeCan!) and adds a touch of light creaminess.\r\n\r\nFLV Apricot is just lovely, it has apricot with hits of brighter berries and citrus, at .5 we get hits of all of this while pushing our peach and cherry up to the front of the recipe at the same time.\r\n\r\nFLV Boysenberry adds some dark berry richness and syrup notes to the vape.\r\n\r\nItalian cream is here to add a sour'ish cream cheesey'ness note to contrast the sweetness and add some balance to the recipe.\r\n\r\n","steep_days":"7 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-11T21:44:27.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"1448","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Juicy Peach","flavor_id":"81","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Peach White","flavor_id":"543","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Cherries","flavor_id":"757","vendor":"INW","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Brown Sugar","flavor_id":"313","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":250},{"name":"Vanilla Bourbon with Cream","flavor_id":"7795","vendor":"PUR","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Apricot","flavor_id":"8549","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":500},{"name":"Boysenberry","flavor_id":"614","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":250},{"name":"Italian Cream","flavor_id":"2132","vendor":"HS","millipercent":1000}],"reviews":[{"user":"Mr-G","text":"Snv?","score":0}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"91178","name":"Burnt Sour Stone Cream"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
