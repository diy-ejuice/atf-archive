Now I'm not into healing stones at all, but I give out Amethyst for graduations at my work and the meaning of that stone and it got me thinking.  What would this taste like in a recipe.  I've wanted to make out of the box recipes for variety and creative reasons and this turned out well so I'm going to run with it.  \r\n\r\n- Amethyst is a meditative and calming stone which works in the emotional, spiritual, and physical planes to promote calm, balance, and peace. It is also used to eliminate impatience.\r\n\r\nEmotionally, amethyst is used in crystal healing  to help heal personal losses and grief, bringing one gently past. Amethyst has a gently sedative energy that ca promote peacefulness, happiness, and contentment. It also is said to bring emotional stability and inner strength. This stability and strength not only helps one hold firm in one's life, but it can enhance flexibility and cooperation. To be flexible at need is a sure sign of strength.\r\n\r\nAmethyst is very well known -- as from the ancients -- as a sobriety stone. It has been used for millenia to prevent drunkenness, and is used to assist in getting rid of addictions to alcohol, drugs, smoking, etc, and destructive compulsive behaviors of all kinds. - \r\n\r\nTaking this into consideration I wanted to embody the purple color, creamy texture, smooth appearance, and calming feeling.  The grape, plum, and dragon fruit create the purple color and bright flavor.  This combines with the marshmallow and whipped cream to create a thick smooth vape.  The oba oba gives a a candy like depth.  All in all is tastes really good and was fun to create.

Just from reading the description and reviews I was intrigued and this delivers all that and then some. To me at least it has an almost gummy feel to it, which I love. It's inherently purple too, but the plum and the grape meld well and turn it into some sort of heavenly aura of just delicious mist. This is me trying it right off the shake, forcing myself to put it in my vape cupboard now for the recommended five day steep. I am very excited. Thank you !"},{"user":"ID10-T","text":"This is a masterpiece. On the first few draws I didn't care for it, I found it too floral and even almost medicinal. But before I needed to redrip, I was in love. It doesn't taste like grape and plum mixed together, it just tastes purple. Purple on a thick bed of fluffy white slightly vanilla-flavored creamy serenity. And while all that healing stones nonsense is bull, there is such a thing as healing flavors, and that's what this is. It's calming and meditative -- everything promised in the description is delivered. Think partly cloudy purple sunset in bottle. Beautiful recipe. "},{"user":"ObiWanCannoli","text":"Oh man this is amazing! I just recently fell in love with INW Plum and this is an excellent recipe to showcase what a great flavor it is. The taste is beautifully balanced and very flavorful without being too intense. I get an almost gummy vibe from this mix as well. All in all great job! This is probably my new number one fruit/candy profile. Will definitely be remixing this over and over again."},{"user":"horizonism","text":"We've got a winner right here. Can't say enough good things about this. I love the idea behind it, and I think you emulated the characteristics of amethyst with ease. It's a very smooth, dark purple profile. Grape and Plum bring those purple notes beautifully, with Dragonfruit bridging them together, and Oba Oba, Cream Whipped and Marshmallow encircling it all in a soft pillow of peace. It's like vaping grape juice, tinged with droplets of tropical rainwater, whilst sitting on a purple cushion, and staring out into a purple sea. Heavenly work!"}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"35771","name":"Amethyst "}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
