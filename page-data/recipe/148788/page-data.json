Here we go again.  The profile I was going for was a dark berry forward yogurt smoothie with a hint of lemon.  The VT Yoghurt drink takes care of the yogurt with the hint of lemon, but it's not thick enough on its own for a smoothie and FW yogurt provides that thickness without making it overly creamy.  I wanted to make sure the Forrest Fruit didn't get overpowered by the yogurtness of this mix so I boosted all the dark berries.  The FA black currant adds that syrupy sweetness and the FA Bilberry gives it an additional fresh blueberry vibe.  TFA Blackberry is notoriously strong and I didn't want it to overpower the mix, but it just belonged in the dark berry mix.  This started as a collab on the DIY_eJuice Discord with @isuamadog, but we veered in different directions as he wanted to bring the yogurt to the front.   As always fun times on the discord and delicious recipes.","steep_days":"5","temperature":"0","recipe_score":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-12T10:15:51.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"2634","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Yoghurt Drink","flavor_id":"9901","vendor":"VT","millipercent":5000},{"name":"Forest Fruits","flavor_id":"4890","vendor":"FA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Blackcurrant","flavor_id":"545","vendor":"FA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Blackberry","flavor_id":"214","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":250},{"name":"Bilberry","flavor_id":"533","vendor":"FA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Yogurt","flavor_id":"1471","vendor":"FW","millipercent":1000}],"reviews":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"148788","name":"Berry Berry Yogalicious"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
