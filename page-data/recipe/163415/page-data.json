This one is a winner, it turned out lovely and you can vary the darkness of the coffee without hurting the raspberry or the latte.\r\n\r\nINW Raspberry/FLV Red Raspberry = my usual raspberry maneuver. It tastes like the real fruit and it holds its own.\r\n\r\nWF Brazilian Coffee = it's a gorgeous coffee flavor and the only one that I actually like. You can start at 0.25% and go up to 1% depending on how you like it, but beware it grows the longer it steeps.\r\n\r\nOOO Creamy Milky Undertone/WF Smooth Cappuccino Cream = The latte and the froth, smooth and creamy. This will start quite milky and then steep into quite the coffee latte after a week and more.\r\n\r\nOOO Marshmallow (Vanilla)/LB Vanilla Ice Cream = They're there for the mouthfeel, the buttery thickness and a touch of vanilla in your coffee.\r\n\r\nYou can absolutely shake and vape this recipe, but it will grow into more and more of a coffee vape the longer you let it steep.\r\n\r\nEnjoy, be queer & vape on !\r\n\r\n[ Photo Credits: www.nespresso.com ]","steep_days":"7 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-11T14:09:22.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"789","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Raspberry","flavor_id":"667","vendor":"INW","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Red Raspberry","flavor_id":"4367","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":500},{"name":"Cream Milky Undertone PG","flavor_id":"6539","vendor":"OOO","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Smooth Cappuccino Cream","flavor_id":"6060","vendor":"WF","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Brazilian Coffee SC","flavor_id":"9016","vendor":"WF","millipercent":750},{"name":"Marshmallow (Vanilla)","flavor_id":"1798","vendor":"OOO","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Vanilla Ice Cream","flavor_id":"1511","vendor":"LB","millipercent":3000}],"reviews":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"163415","name":"Perthshire Delight (Raspberry Latte)"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
