The flavors kind of speak for themselves but I chose JF Sweet Strawberry because it is one of the few strawberries I can taste. I think the CAP Sweet Strawberry helps out the JF and adds some sweetness.\r\n\r\nTFA Cheesecake GC, CAP NY Cheesecake and Sweet Cream make up the main body of the cheesecake it's creamy, rich and delicious.\r\n\r\nTFA Graham helps boost the graham in the cheesecakes and Biscuit and Acetyl Pyrazine are there to give it some more grainy, buttery goodness.\r\n\r\nI love a bit of FA Coconut so I added it for something extra.\r\n\r\nThis is the first recipe I have made that I feel is worth sharing so feedback is welcome.\r\n\r\nI like my recipes strong so I think the 20% flavoring is necessary. Sweetener is optional.\r\n\r\nI recommend at least a 2 week steep.\r\n\r\nPlease rate it if you mix it!","steep_days":"14","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T14:12:26.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"1795","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Strawberry Sweet","vendor":"JF","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Sweet Cream","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Sweet Strawberry","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Biscuit","vendor":"INW","millipercent":500},{"name":"Acetyl Pyrazine 5%","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":300},{"name":"New York Cheesecake","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":5000},{"name":"Cheesecake (graham Crust)","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Graham Cracker Clear","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Coco' (coconut)","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Sweetener","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1000}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"51636","name":"Strawberry Cheesecake V2"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
