All of the cream and this does a great job of balancing out the coffee along with the sweet cookie makes this a enjoyable Coffee vape.","steep_days":"7 (SNV)","temperature":"420","recipe_score":4.5,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:48:45.000-05:00","best_vg":"69%","views":"4368","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Sugar Cookie","flavor_id":"115","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Biscuit","flavor_id":"642","vendor":"INW","millipercent":750},{"name":"Vienna Cream","flavor_id":"516","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1250},{"name":"Cream Fresh","flavor_id":"540","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1250},{"name":"Hazelnut","flavor_id":"1312","vendor":"FW","millipercent":400},{"name":"Butter","flavor_id":"147","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Bavarian Cream","flavor_id":"1187","vendor":"FW","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Dark Bean (coffee Espresso)","flavor_id":"504","vendor":"FA","millipercent":500}],"reviews":[{"user":"Boomdog07","text":"Well let me start by saying I may have cheated a little bit. I had a nice large batch of Sugar Cookies and Cream (300ml) sitting around that has been steeping for at least 90 days. That being said, I looked over the differences and the only real change I saw was the addition of the Dark Bean, and a small percentage of Bavarian Cream.. so why not just add it to a 60ml bottle and see what happens. I did just that and let me tell you the results were absolutely spot on for me. I am talking about a 1 day extra steep and the coffee is there, but not overwhelming at all. The added cream I am guessing will continue to come to the top as it sits a little longer. So far after however I am definitely in love with this one. Thanks Chrisdvr1 for the work on this one it is definitely going into my rotation from this point forward. I am using it in a TFV8 with the T10 coils at 140w. I have also tried it on my Temple with dual claptons at .21 at around 100w and it was great there too."},{"user":"mk0","text":"I let it steep for 3 weeks+ now, i still can't taste any of the sugar cookie.  Awesome coffee vape, but that's really all you can taste. "}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"10057","name":"Sugar cookies and coffee "}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
