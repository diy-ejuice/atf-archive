Simple is an approach i wished more people embraced.  I don't care how good your taste buds are.  No one is tasting all the individual components of a 10 ingredient recipe.  And since I have a hard time finding flavors in my inventory, its nice to pull out 3 bottles and be done.  My wife appreciates not having to help me find \"cream fresh\". Oh yeah its real good off the shake."},{"user":"BigCloud","text":"There should be more recipe's like this out there!! Simple to make and delicious to vape.

And for a Simple cereal, its awesome!! &#xD;\nIt is a bit short on the crunchy sugary complexity, but hey Its called Cereally EASY pebbles, so for what it is, its awesome, thanks and well done"},{"user":"SatJoe563","text":"Thanks for the recipe.  I bought Fruity Flakes probably 6 months ago, and forgot about it.  As a S&amp;V, taste fairly good.  Will let it sit a week and see what Cream Milky Undertone steeps into.
