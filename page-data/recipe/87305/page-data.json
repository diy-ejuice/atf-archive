So i went on my way for a mix of the two,but which tobaccos was the big question. I find the black mile plus a little weak on its own but i thought itll be good as a base for a better tobacco mix so in steps flv red burley with a little help from kentucky blend. The peach mix ive seen around on a few recipes and have enjoyed them +- %s.\r\n\r\nI tried 60-40 which for me gives a good throat hit but on my next batch ill be trying 70-30 to see how it turns out.\r\n\r\nIve put 14 days for steep time as i think i first tried it after around 16 days wanting the peach to settle and the tobaccos to blend nicely .\r\n\r\nSo to round it off its a mouth watering peach with a nice blend of tobacco backing it up. Hope you like it and leave any pros or cons for me down below.","steep_days":"14","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"total_reviews":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-06T09:37:10.000-05:00","best_vg":"60%","views":"1087","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Armenia (apricot)","vendor":"FA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Peach White","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Red Burley","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":750},{"name":"Kentucky Blend","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":250},{"name":"Black Mile Plus","vendor":"FE","millipercent":1250},{"name":"Peach","vendor":"FA","millipercent":500}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"87305","name":"PEACH LEAF"}}}
