I love it! Anyway I was just messing around and wanted to create my own recipe with it. After a bit of picking I decided on Kiwi (FA) & Sweet Guava (CAP). I found that these flavors are similar, but have enough character to stand out on their own. Mixed this up and wow. It's perfect as is. Very sweet & juicy tropical fruit profile. Reminds me most of a Starfruit. Mix and enjoy!\r\n\r\nFlavor Comments\r\nGuanabana (FLV): Originally wanted this to be the star of the recipe, but after mixing and trying it I found it's most present on the finish.\r\n\r\nKiwi (FA): This flavor is actually the most present in this recipe, even at only 2%. Meshes very well with the Guanabana & Guava.\r\n\r\nSweet Guava (CAP): This is meant really just to pair with the Guanabana but it actually adds quite a bit of character by itself. I believe it is also the main source of sweetness ","steep_days":"0 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"total_reviews":7,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:50:58.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"4658","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Guanabana","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Kiwi","vendor":"FA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Sweet Guava","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":3000}],"reviews":[{"user":"97funk","score":"5","text":"Parts unknown!&#xD;\nSo I mixed this last night having forgotten why I originally bought Guanabana in the first place.

"},{"user":"ID10-T","score":"5","text":"OMFG that is a great vape!  The kiwi gets gets all tangled up with the strawberry+pineapple-esque top half of guanabana and it’s all juicy and tangy, while the sweet guava drenches the funky, creamy, banana+coconut like base in sweet red wonderfulness. It’s like adding Hawaiian punch to a tropical fruit smoothie. I've had a very hard time putting this one down.   "}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"153649","name":"Green Bastard"}}}
