I hope you enjoy it as much as me.\r\n\r\nHere are a few notes;\r\n\r\nVT Sherbet \r\n\r\nBy far the best sherbet flavour out there very real to its flavour and captures some fizz very well, it doesn‚Äôt taste like burnt sugar either when you vape it. Excellent flavour that should be useful in other recipes if requiring something with fizz.\r\n\r\nFE Lemon\r\n\r\nAgain a perfect combination no other lemon comes close it‚Äôs bright and vibrant and it‚Äôs versatile in many combinations both fruits to bakeries. Feel free if you want more lemon in here to add more it will work.\r\n\r\nWF Sour Ball Candy (SC)\r\n\r\nI used this as the base sherbet lemons have that hard candy outer and this does the job while adding additional experience to the sherbet to what can only be described as a mouth explosion!!!\r\n\r\nTFA Marshmallow \r\n\r\nAdded here at a small amount to create additional mouthfeel and a rounder to the citrus flavours.\r\n\r\nCAP Super Sweet \r\n\r\nCandy is sweet and it balances out some sharpness of the lemon.

From the actual fizzing sensation of the sherbet to the sweet but tart lemon hard candy this recipe is very, very accurate. Trust me I‚Äôve probably eaten more sherbet lemons than Dumbledore in my time. Cannot recommend this enough. ","score":5},{"user":"Pam","text":"You nailed Bassetts Sherbet Lemons in this recipe. I added 2% Vape Train Sour Lemon and .5% WS-23 because I like my hard candy straight out of the freezer. Fabulous!","score":5},{"user":"kitu5","text":"Made this in honor of September 1st...didn't last that long. It's a perfect sweet yet tart lemon drop that definitely brought to mind all things Harry Potter. The lemon and citrus notes in fizzy sherbet really mixed well together making a vibrant candy lemon. The rest of the fizzy sherbet (candy notes) and the sour ball just made the whole deal that juuuust right amount of tart to really sell the lemon candy. Didn't notice the marshmallow per se, but since it's there for mouthfeel, yeah, okay. THAT I got. And yeah, it's just the right amount of sweetness to offset that tartness and keep me wrecking it. &#xD;\n&#xD;\nI'ma be making more of this and hitting it harder than a pack of third years hit Hogsmeade on their first weekend. Holy hell. Wrecked 15 ml in 3 days, and for me, that's a lot.&#xD;\n&#xD;\nAn absolute treat, and one to revisit often. Nicely done!","score":5},{"user":"SweetPoisonKim","text":"Wasn‚Äôt too sure about this at first, but after a couple of hours it really grew on me. You‚Äôve come the closest to a true sour/fizzy flavour in a juice that I‚Äôve ever tasted! The lemons nice and bright and if you swish the vapour round your mouth a bit you get that lip puckering sourness. Very addicting and yummy! 30ml tester disappeared in 3 days! Great job once again üëç","score":5}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"84791","name":"Dumbledore.... Bearded No. 1"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
