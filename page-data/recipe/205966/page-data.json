She took my recipe, which is my most mixed for my friends, and she tweak it a little bit...the challenge was \" let's see if I can't make one of your best recipe better\". I didn't tell my friend but they seems to enjoy it even more. Thanks to Pippa for making my recipe better and give her a follow, she's a fantastic mixer! Hope you like it!","steep_days":"3","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:51:45.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"796","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Cactus","vendor":"INW","millipercent":250},{"name":"Cherimoya SC","vendor":"WF","millipercent":500},{"name":"Dragonfruit","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Double Apple","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Golden Pineapple","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":3500},{"name":"Super Sweet","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":500},{"name":"Hibiscus","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":500},{"name":"Peach White","vendor":"FA","millipercent":2000}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"205966","name":"Tropical summer"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
