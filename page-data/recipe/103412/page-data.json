IMO Flv vanilla pudding needs a little help in the vanilla dept.\r\n\r\nThis is a creamy Vanilla pudding with a nice Pound cake flavor\r\nI mixed up a 30 ML tester and after 3 days Began to destroy it. After a week its already a nice smooth tasty vape.\r\nThis will be one of my ADVs.. For a while anyway\r\n\r\nPlease drop a review if you decide to mix this\r\nThanks for checking it out!","steep_days":"7","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"total_reviews":1,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:50:12.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"1873","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Vanilla Pudding","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Pudding Base","vendor":"VT","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Bourbon (vanilla Bourbon)","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Pound Cake","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Shortbread Cookies SC","vendor":"WF","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Super Sweet","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":250}],"reviews":[{"user":"BadaG","score":"5","text":"Delicious!! Deep dense flavoured recipe where all the individual flavours come together and work as a whole, with enough going on to keep it interesting and no overbearing top notes. The vanilla is smooth and velvety and lingers on nicely afterwards. This oneâ€™s a keeper"}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"103412","name":"NILLA PUDDIN POUND CAKE"}}}
