We were going for something fresh, crisp, and cold, and I think we hit the mark.

I'm not a fan of cooling, so I mix without it, but it is still really very good."},{"user":"goosegirl","score":"5","text":"I have not been a fan of watermelon vapes, but this recipe made me a convert.   The lime and cream really made a difference and the mix is more of a sherbet to me than a candied watermelon.  I am going to try this with a raspberry as well.  "},{"user":"Scism","score":"5","text":"Tried it without hibiscus, kinda thin. Subbed in sweet currant at the same % it was better than without.   Later on, I got the hibiscus in and made another batch, was an improvement over both.  Overall, good mix thanks for sharing.    "},{"user":"mlNikon","score":"5","text":"It's so refreshing to have a really good watermelon dominant recipe. The balance between the lime and watermelon is just superb boys. I love what the flv cream and vt fizzy sherbet bring to the mix as well. I am not a huge fan of fruit mixes but I've been vaping this nonstop since I mixed it. Good Job!"}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"152341","name":"Gallagher's Ice Pop | DEVELOPED"}}}
