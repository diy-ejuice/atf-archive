Blackberry lemon scone.\r\nStill in progress but I feel it's worth releasing to the public.\r\nA delicate powdery cookie with a blackberry background and pronounced lemon zing! Sweet Jesus we're getting fancy.\r\n\r\nFW Blackberry: Why would I use anything else? Tastes like blackberry jam. Doesn't really taste like a fresh blackberry.\r\nOOO Beignets & JF Biscuit: Buttery soft pastry and dry butter biscuit together make a very delicate crumbly cookie flavor. Originally I tried to use FA Cookie and it just wasn't right,\r\nCAP Juicy Lemon: Just a little bit gives it a lemon rind taste which is exactly what I was going for.\r\nFA Meringue: Sweet and creamy feel.\r\nFA Almond: I don't know why I decided to add this, but I'm glad I did. Almonds! They're delicious.\r\nFA Marshmallow: Adds that missing sweetness and mouth feel that I just wasn't getting from Meringue. I may replace Meringue with Powdered Sugar\r\nThe %'s may seem oddly strict but every revision just needed a little something extra and this is where I arrived.","steep_days":"10","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"total_reviews":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-06T07:15:00.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"1008","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Beignets","vendor":"OOO","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Blackberry","vendor":"FW","millipercent":5000},{"name":"Juicy Lemon","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":2700},{"name":"Meringue","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1800},{"name":"Almond","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1200},{"name":"Marshmallow","vendor":"FA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Biscuit","vendor":"JF","millipercent":1600}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"46321","name":"I wear a tophat when I'm sconed"}}}
