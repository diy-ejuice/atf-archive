A real winner ADV,  congratz and many thx M.  ;)"},{"user":"ObiWanCannoli","score":"5","text":"Nice simple summer recipe and a good excuse to use up some of my FW Kiwi. The recipe is very tasty and nicely balanced. The kiwi seems to shift the wild melon slightly into honeydew dominant territory and the cucumber is at a perfect level. Mixed max vg so while still tasty I'm probably not doing this recipe much justice so I will try again at 70/30. Great job here, thanks for the recipe"},{"user":"praotec","score":"5","text":""}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"111094","name":"Green Breeze"}}}
