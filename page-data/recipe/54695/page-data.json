(My blueberry custard, that is). \r\n\r\nWhat's going on y'all, Parkus Maximus the Third coming all over y'all again with another recipe! I know that for the majority of vapers and mixers out there that custards and bakeries are more of a fall/winter type vape but I'm one of those weird fucks that enjoys a nice thick custard year-round. So since I started DIY over a year ago, I found this clone of 13 Monkey's Congo Custard on ELR when I was a normie and didn't realize that all the good shit was on ATF. However, I really enjoyed that recipe and still vape it even to this day, (granted I no longer mix it with 3% sweetener anymore). Anyways, my father is like me and enjoys bakeries and shit like that year-round and wanted me to make him a variation of the Congo Custard so here is what I came up with!\r\n\r\nFA Bilberry, FW Blueberry - this is what makes the blueberry portion of the mix. The FW blueberry provides the sweet blueberry that one would expect from this recipe but lacks in authenticity, so the FA bilberry helps provide that authentic blueberry taste. \r\n\r\nCAP French Vanilla, Sweet Cream and VCv1 - these help to make a rich and deep vanilla custard. We all know why VCv1 is here so I don't need to explain that, but the sweet cream and French vanilla help to make the custard more deep. \r\n\r\nSweetener is always subjective. \r\n\r\nShake and vape approved but I believe this recipe will benefit from at least a 5 day steep. \r\n\r\nSo there you have it: My BBC! Honestly really enjoying this recipe so far and this is just a V1 so I will definitely be updating this recipe as it progresses. Please mix it up and let me know what you think, even if you think I'm crazy as fuck for making a custard recipe in the summer while everyone else is vaping their lemonades and watermelon shit.
