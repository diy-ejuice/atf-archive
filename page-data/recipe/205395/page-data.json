They were spiced cookies with a little bit of almond in them. I quite liked them as a kid. (not as common to find now and last I had them, were disappointing in comparison with what I remembered) So this is my attempt to turn that cookie into a cake with some glaze on it.\r\nOOO cake has an inherent almond note in it already with a little glaze note. FW White cake to add to cake note. JF Cookie butter for the spice note. Toasted almond to enhance almond. VT frosting to add slightly to the glaze as it was not pronounced enough and to add sweetness and vanilla note as well.","steep_days":"5","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T02:17:58.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"283","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Cake (White)","flavor_id":"8470","vendor":"FW","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Norwegian Ring Cake","flavor_id":"1866","vendor":"OOO","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Cookie Butter","flavor_id":"10319","vendor":"JF","millipercent":500},{"name":"Toasted Almond","flavor_id":"294","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":250},{"name":"Vanilla Buttercream Frosting","flavor_id":"8990","vendor":"VT","millipercent":100}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"205395","name":"Rin's Spiced Almond Cake"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
