Try #1 was up around 20% flavours, tasted good - on the right track. So this is a scale back plus added in some super sweet. \r\n\r\nCereal: FW Cake (yellow),  TPA Vanilla Cupcake, AP and Hazelnut is my attempt at the cereal component. My previous recipe was pretty good but I feel the cereal is not 100% there yet.\r\n\r\nMilk: Bavarian Cream, Cream Fresh and vanilla swirl and meringue provides the milk. \r\n\r\nMarshmallow and Blueberries should speak for themselves, though I think the marshmallow gets a bit lost in the milk.  Need to find a way to separate it out. I though the super sweet might help with that...\r\n\r\nTrying to find the balance between the cereal, milk, & blueberry with a bit of marshmallow. Any comments/critiques welcome.\r\n\r\n","steep_days":"3 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"total_reviews":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:49:36.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"1237","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Bavarian Cream","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Cream Fresh","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Vanilla Swirl","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Acetyl Pyrazine 5%","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":250},{"name":"Blueberry (wild)","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Marshmallow","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Meringue","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Cake (yellow)","vendor":"FW","millipercent":1250},{"name":"Vanilla Cupcake","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1250},{"name":"Hazelnut","vendor":"FW","millipercent":250},{"name":"Super Sweet","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":500}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"64490","name":"Boo Barry (Light)"}}}
