Made a 2nd batch and added 1 drop to 30ml and it still turned out nice and smooth with more pronounced coffee flavor. \r\nI have tried several Coffee Flavors and mixed 100 mixes (of my own as well as others recipes) and have not found a true, but smooth coffee flavor. WF has out done themselves with the Smooth Cappuccino Cream. It is the perfect coffee flavor IMO. It is def coffee but it is sweet, creamy and so smooth. To me it is border line cappuccino and a medium to mild roasted coffee. I added the FLV Biscotti to this one at 0.5% because I think it has more of a deep bitter coffee flavor than a bakery flavor. I'm not even 100% sure what a Biscotti is supposed to taste like honestly lol. But at this % in this mix it blends so well with the WF SCC and helps keep the coffee flavor from being lost in the creams. I added WF VIC for the Vanilla as well as the rich Creaminess I get from it. It is another awesome new WF flavor that I am loving. and the FLV WC and Cream are to help back it up in the creaminess. This has turned out so well. I gave it a hot bath uncapped for about an hour capped it shook it good again and let it cool then gave it a go. It was delicious , the second day it was a little more blended and rounded out but still dang good. If you like smooth creamy and sweet coffee mixes I hope you give this one a mix and let me know what you think.. \r\nMy husband said this mix is almost a dead ringer for Deja Brew's Cinnamon Coffee just minus the cinnamon note. lol..
