I sneaked in and watched him. Watched him make his stupid little peach shoes, taunting...\r\n\r\n\"Nobody's going to wear those, \" I'd say. \"They're stupid. \"\r\n\r\nBut on he worked.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is a V2 recipe. I dropped the ice creams to focus on the dessert, and changed CAP sweet mango 2% to JF Honey Peach at 2%. (V1 is on ELR as well as Deux.)\r\n\r\nWf peach pie n cream plays the biggest role here at 7%. Back that up for depth with the JF and the FLV apple filling at 1.6% to really push that sticky pie filling, and add some spice.\r\n\r\nI really love the mix of FLV granola and rich cinnamon at .4% and .2%, respectively, but i know some find .2 rich cinnamon strong so i tuned it back and .15% is just fine with the apple filling in there as well.\r\n\r\nWf bavarian cream for a nice deep vanilla note to round things off.\r\n\r\nI'd give this at least a week, mostly for apple filling to do its work.\r\n\r\nThanks fam!","steep_days":"7","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"total_reviews":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T17:36:18.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"710","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Peach Pie & Cream","vendor":"WF","millipercent":7000},{"name":"Apple Filling","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1400},{"name":"Granola","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":400},{"name":"Rich Cinnamon","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":100},{"name":"Honey Peach","vendor":"JF","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Sweetener","vendor":"FW","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Bavarian Cream SC","vendor":"WF","millipercent":750}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"190483","name":"Stupid Little Peach Shoes (deux)"}}}
