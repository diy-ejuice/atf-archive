This is made for the Developed Pie Challenge\r\n\r\nI start by using possibly one of the best boysenberries out there,\r\nFLV Boysenberry, next I use JF Boysenberry to add a slight bit of stickyness to the pie filling.\r\n\r\nFA Apple Pie is used on the lower end here as it provides a good pie crust base while CAP SC softens up the crust to give it a delicate mouthfeel.\r\n\r\nNow onto the creams! CAP Sweet Cream is just fantastic all around and helps provide the sweet almost whipped like cream base to a pie. I added a little FA Fresh Cream here to help boost the cream profile and also thicken the cream base.\r\n\r\nCAP SS is optional but I think it really helps provide a more authentic pie. I use it at 0.25% here as I don't want to mute out the flavors and oversweeten it, just enough to provide the every so sticky sweet taste a gooey pie has\r\n\r\nSUBS: If you want a slightly more baked crust, replace CAP Sugar Cookie with FW Pie Crust at 0.75%","steep_days":"4","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"updated_at":"2020-12-12T15:41:10.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"621","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Boysenberry","flavor_id":"614","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1750},{"name":"Boysenberry","flavor_id":"4573","vendor":"JF","millipercent":1750},{"name":"Apple Pie","flavor_id":"551","vendor":"FA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Sugar Cookie","flavor_id":"115","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":500},{"name":"Cream Fresh","flavor_id":"540","vendor":"FA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Sweet Cream","flavor_id":"117","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Super Sweet","flavor_id":"2384","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":250}],"reviews":[{"user":"RUG_ly","text":"Yeah itâ€™s good ","score":5}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"197765","name":"#DevelopedPie Boysenberry Cream Pie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
