So far I have no idea what I'm doing. But, one thing I do know pretty well is desserts. So I figured I would start with the most non intrusive tobacco I could think of. RY4. I eye **Holy Grail RY4** by DIYFS every time I re-up on Holy Vanilla or see mentions of *Cardinal*, and I finally bit the bullet a few weeks ago. Here is my first *tobacco* recipe that I can say is super tasty.\r\n\r\n**Holy Grail RY4** as I'm sure most of you know, is thick and creamy. Delicious sweet tones of caramel and vanilla really serve as the backbone for this recipe. It has a touch of tobacco that peaks out every now and again that plays well with others. I was actually surprised at how much I enjoyed this concentrate, I can see it serving as a main caramel note with out much fuss in tons of other recipes. I will definitely be keeping this stocked!\r\n\r\n*The Coconuts:*\r\n\r\nThis combo has never steered me wrong. I first saw it used in *Leche de Coco*. **FA Coconut** is a nice creamy coconut, much like the meaty part of the fruit, that serves as an accent to our main coconut note. This stuff is super tasty and finds it's way into a lot of my recipes when I want a little nuance and added creaminess. **FLV Sweet Coconut** is hands down my favorite coconut flavoring. It's an amazing start to any recipe where you want a milky and smooth coconut taste. It almost gives off a coconut candy vibe, but really meshes well with caramel to add some silkiness and vibrance. Coconuts and caramel are a match made in heaven.\r\n\r\nBody time. I think I use **FW Graham Cracker** too much. It's my favorite GC for sure. It's crunchy and buttery. It has some honey. It tastes cookie-like, and after a nice long steep it has some coconut tones. Seemed like a no brainer.\r\n\r\nI wanted to keep this recipe simple. It ended up being far more complex taste wise than I anticipated. \r\n\r\nIt's like a graham cracker dipped in milky, coconut infused caramel. Sometimes I get the tobacco. Sometimes not. Either way it's staying in my rotation, a definite winner in my book. Enjoy!\r\n\r\nAfter feedback and testing I have changed FW Graham Cracker from 2% to 3%.","steep_days":"7 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":4.8,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:50:26.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"3614","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"HOLY HOLY GRAIL RY4","flavor_id":"5037","vendor":"DFS","millipercent":8000},{"name":"Coco' (coconut)","flavor_id":"416","vendor":"FA","millipercent":750},{"name":"Sweet Coconut","flavor_id":"605","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1750},{"name":"Graham Cracker","flavor_id":"1297","vendor":"FW","millipercent":3000}],"reviews":[{"user":"bjorama","text":"I really enjoyed this mix.

"},{"user":"SlashaLO","text":"Let me start off by saying this is amazing. I loved this stuff from the day I made it, had trouble wanting to let it sit for your steep time. If this is your first tobacco I would say holy grail is a good choice for several reasons. First, it’s not really a tobacco, but an amazing caramel and vanilla. If you wanted to add a hint of tobacco I would suggest .25% of either red burley or cured from FLV. That’s not to put this down at all as holy grail has a slight slight hint, but it gets too covered up. The coconut pairing is one of my favorite as well and it shines here with the other flavors. It has a great flavor and lends a hint of creaminess to the mix which is amazing. I would have to agree with @AlfredPudding in that the graham cracker seems to fall under in the steep. I can taste the spice a little bit, but would prefer a hint more. For my personal taste I think I’ll bump it to 3%. I suggest many people who like this profile to mix this up. "},{"user":"AlfredPudding","text":"This is an awesome, rich coconut caramel recipe. I wouldn't say it's much of a tobacco recipe, but that doesn't take away from how delicious it is. Starting out with 8% HHGRY4 is never a wrong move, and the idea of blending some coconut into it was absolutely brilliant. I enjoy the combination of FA Coconut and FLV Sweet Coconut in this immensely. My only critique is that the FW Graham Cracker is getting covered up quite a bit in this mix."}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"118763","name":"Four Coco"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
