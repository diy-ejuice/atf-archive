Blackberry's there to give it a full mouthfeel with its jammyness and adds just a bit more tart to the overall cherry sour.\r\n\r\nWith all that said, in the end, it really feels like tasting like a Chazzberry with how everything fits together. Very wet, very sweet, sharp, and just enough sour and tart.\r\n\r\nPerfectly acceptable after a SNV but give it 24 hours to settle and the sourness gets brought out more. I'm sure more days could really flesh this out.\r\n\r\nReddit link: https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/gh6u71/better_business_bureau/?","steep_days":"1 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"total_reviews":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T07:01:42.000-05:00","best_vg":"65%","views":"1482","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Blackberry","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":750},{"name":"Cherryl (cherry, Black)","vendor":"FA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Blue Raspberry","vendor":"LB","millipercent":6000}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"194071","name":"Better Business Bureau"}}}
