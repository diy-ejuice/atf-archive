An authentic Grape soda recipe with layers and depth. Work in progress for a very long time and I'm glad to release my very first finished recipe. Shake and vape certified but best after 3-4 days.\r\n\r\nSince I started mixing I've been trying to perfect this to my tastes. I wanted something that tasted like those KA Grape drinks or Grape Fanta. It's not there, it's close but it satisfies the grape thirst. \r\n\r\nI started out relying on INW Grape for the main Grape note but I it always took over and wasn't the same profile I wanted. I then turned to TFA Grape juice with INW Grape supporting but again this came off too perfumy and wasn't the right profile. From there I brought in bilberry to add some darkness, this brought me much closer to what I wanted but that Grape still wasn't right. \r\n\r\nAfter buying all the grapes I could find I brought in WF Sweet and sour purple drink as the main Grape ingredient and this was it man, this was what I wanted to base this recipe around. It has an authentic Grape soda taste with the right amount of sweetness. I used this alongside TFA Grape juice to carry the recipe with a touch of INW Grape to add that artificial candy Grape note and FA Concord grape for little boost of authentic Grape to collectively give a well rounded Grape note. \r\n\r\nI chucked in some FW Lemonade to lift everything up and add brightness to the mix. \r\n\r\nFA Pear to add a touch of juicyness while giving the recipe a different dimension. \r\n\r\nTFA Dragonfruit purely for its emulsifying abilities to give everything a stir. \r\n\r\nLastly Marshmallow, this acts as a smoothing agent while adding more sweetness.
