This is what I came up with. Neither guava flavor tasted like I wanted on their own so I combined them. I tasted hints of pear in addition to the guava. It also needed to be really juicy so that is where the INW-Cactus and FA-Wine Champagne come in. Alfred Pudding was nice enough to give it a taste test for me and give it his seal of approval. He also created the image for my recipe with his mad Photo Shop skills.  You can SNV this but it will get smoother after a few days.","steep_days":"3","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"total_reviews":3,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:50:29.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"4725","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Apple Fuji","vendor":"FA","millipercent":400},{"name":"Cactus","vendor":"INW","millipercent":400},{"name":"Pear","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":400},{"name":"Pink Guava","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":600},{"name":"Sweet Guava","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Super Sweet","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":300},{"name":"Wine Champagne","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000}],"reviews":[{"user":"ID10-T","score":"5","text":"It is what it says it is. It takes that Sweet Guava thatâ€™s already very reminiscent of guava nectar and adds the right accoutrements to make it super taste like Jumex canned guava nectar. Sweeter, juicier, and a little more acidic tartness than Sweet Guava alone, without so much of the grassy peel and bubblegummy notes that I get from Sweet Guava by itself. Beautiful recipe.   "},{"user":"MECH_MOD_RN","score":"5","text":"This  is a  spot on nectar type  profile.   Of the shake  this has  a nice  sweet thick syrup guava profile  with slightly tart finish on the exhale .  The FA wine adds a nice brightness to the mix that I really enjoy.  This can easily  be an  ADV for me.  "},{"user":"AlfredPudding","score":"5","text":"Unfortunately I had to try this without FA Wine Champagne, but that doesn't matter. It is an insanely authentic recreation of the sweet guava nectar you can find in a can. If you try this as a shake and vape the cactus will stick out and do some weird things with Pink Guava, and I like it. After that it calms down, and adds a perfect wet effect to the recipe along with Pear and Fuji. If you try this with the Champagne it will probably be a hundred times better, and truly capture the nectar of the gods in vape form. "}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"123370","name":"Nectar of the Gods"}}}
