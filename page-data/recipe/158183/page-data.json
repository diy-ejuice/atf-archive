First, this is great of the shake but really shines after at least 1 day steep. A few days or a week is best and helps the flavors pop imo. I add 1% WS-23, otherwise recipe is mixed as is. Iâ€™ve already gone through about 100ml of this and it is now my ADV. just mixed up 240ml "},{"user":"Scism","score":"5","text":" "},{"user":"robolto78","score":"5","text":"Blue Pineapple? I was skeptical at first, but given my love for blue raspberry and pineapple being my favorite fruit, the recipe intrigued me very much. I mixed this up about 3 days after it was posted (mail time) and off the shaked all skepticism vanished. On the inhale I get that unmistakable \"Blue\" flavor that you would expect to be paired with Raspberry. Then...Surprise!!! Pineapple. Aaanndd it was AWESOME! I vape it in my Kennedy 25 with a .17 build and this is my new ADV where nothing else is even close! Thank You DIYorDIE. "},{"user":"DIYDownunderPippa","score":"5","text":"Oh Wayne, what have you done!! This is a collection of your knowledge &amp; experience in a recipe that is a massive gift. On point, balanced and can't be faulted.  Sure it can't be compared with a real thing but so what, that's what makes this fun. Flavour and texture is 100% and just lovely!!! I enjoyed this on a Recurve dual RDA at 0.14ohm 65W. Thank you!!! "}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"158183","name":"BLUE PINEAPPLE"}}}
