I wanted to create a cooked berry cupcake with a custard icing.\r\n\r\nI used the Raspberry, Ripe Strawberry and Blueberry to create a more obscure, cooked berry note - it is richer and evolves in the vape on certain hits you get this bending more strawberry and raspberry. Still playing with this idea. Looking for thoughts on this.\r\n\r\nThe other part of the recipe - the bakery base. I made solo using Vanilla Custard v2 when I first got it. I have put Vanilla Cupcake and Frosted Donut together before. I threw in a dash of caramel to marry the bakery and fruit with that sugary edge note.\r\n\r\nOverall, I am very happy with this, I do wonder if a dash of VBIC or Cheesecake would not cement this all with a little heavier mouth feel. But I wanted to really feature the bakery and not lose it in the cream (fearing it become a berry custard only).","steep_days":"5 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-11T18:25:27.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"666","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Strawberry (ripe)","flavor_id":"271","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Blueberry (extra)","flavor_id":"218","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Raspberry (sweet)","flavor_id":"267","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Sweetener","flavor_id":"339","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Caramel","flavor_id":"151","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Frosted Donut","flavor_id":"171","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Vanilla Cupcake","flavor_id":"187","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Vanilla Custard 2","flavor_id":"10427","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":3500}],"reviews":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"193663","name":"Berry Custard Cupcake #TPACHALLENGE"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
