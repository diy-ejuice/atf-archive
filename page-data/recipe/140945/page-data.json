And what better way to eat lemon cake than with blueberry.\r\n\r\nBlueberry - FLV Blueberry Muffin to add a baked blueberry and FW Blueberry to add just a bit of brightness to the blueberry\r\nLemon Cake - INW Lemon Cake alone makes up the cake layer. It is a bit light on texture but seems to come across here.\r\nFrosting - VT Vanilla Buttercream Frosting for a great cream frosting, VT Sweet Cream for mouthfeel and FA Meringue for added sweetness.\r\n\r\nThis is early in the process but after 3 days, it seems pretty full flavored. It still needs a longer steep test, which may require some tweaking later.","steep_days":"5 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T17:35:31.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"1569","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Meringue","flavor_id":"530","vendor":"FA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Lemon Cake","flavor_id":"661","vendor":"INW","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Blueberry Muffin","flavor_id":"608","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Vanilla Buttercream Frosting","flavor_id":"8990","vendor":"VT","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Sweet Cream","flavor_id":"8979","vendor":"VT","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Blueberry","flavor_id":"1201","vendor":"FW","millipercent":1000}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"140945","name":"Lemon Blueberry Cake"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
