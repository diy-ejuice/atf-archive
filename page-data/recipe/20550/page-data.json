This needs to age at LEAST a week and It will blend in nicely with the VBIC. The Dbl Choc was added as an afterthought...... just because it seemed like it would work.

But the recipe as a whole is stellar. One of those recipes that you find weird at first, but appreciate more and more as you vape it. A chocolate peppermint milk with a slight hint of strawberries. Milk and vanilla flavors provide a rich base, chocolate is upfront, peppermint gives it a fun twist, and strawberries give it a friendly pink note. This already feels like something i would miss if not vaped for a while."},{"user":"Bogey_Again","score":"5","text":"Over all good mint ice cream vape. Unfortunately strawberry is hard for me to taste even when swapping out CAP for INW 2%."}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"20550","name":"Strawberry Peppermint I Scream"}}}
