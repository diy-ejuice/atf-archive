Here we have a rich, warm, sweet, and fulfilling combo to go with a nice doppelbock. I am floored that I haven't seen this combination of flavors before now. They just make sense. TFA KB + TFA TM is an amazing pairing. CAP VCv1 + TFA RY4 Double are known to play very nicely for a dessert-style custard-tobacco. TFA GCC brings a bit off sweet body and depth to the profile. This recipe is complete in its simplicity, but feel free to add a bit of butterscotch, torrone, brown sugar, or some sort of nut flavor. Go crazy.

These flavors compliment each other so well, it’s like they were meant to be together. It is indeed rich, warm, deep, and sweet, it’s also mostly satisfying, but something seems to be missing, as others have noted. It seems a bit under-flavored, and lacking, for lack of a better term, an identity. But rather than doing any of the things others have suggested, or taking the creator’s advice and adding “a bit of butterscotch, torrone, brown sugar, or some sort of nut flavor,” I think the best thing do with this tasty combination of flavors is crank that VCV1 up to 6 to 8%, steep it for at least 2 weeks, maybe 4, and give it an identity as a custard recipe. It might be best custard recipe ever, who knows. "},{"user":"HerrHut","text":"Nice!"},{"user":"CatWillMew","text":"I didn't like this when I first tried it, but I came back to it after letting it steep another week and it's much improved.  I would recommend steeping it for at least 2 weeks (I think that's true with most recipes that involve custard).  I see this as a night time, going out to the bars when you know people will be smoking around you kind of vape."},{"user":"Deschain","text":"I'm giving this 4 stars because while it is delicious, I don't find it to be an ADV style recipe. I definitely enjoy it once in a while in the dripper, but once a day or so. "},{"user":"altneurose","text":"All the flavors here mingle and fit really well with each other, and the flavor profile is tasty. The balance could be better, 2 week steep and I get a sort of tweaked RY4D throughout the vape, and the kentucky sticking out a bit with it. This is rare, but I think this is just a bit underflavored, I'd bump every flavor up a notch to get that extra depth and richness. Maybe up the Toasted Marshmallow bit more than others, as already said here. Still a great recipe."},{"user":"timonv","text":"Vaping this after 10 days on a Goon LP, 0.35ohm, dual coil SS316. The RY4 is very nice, caramelly on the inhale, with the subtle bourbon on the exhale. I feel like the vanilla custard is there as well, but it's subtle. I don't really taste the graham cracker (althought I suppose it might be acting more as binding the flavors together) nor the toasted marshmellow.&#xD;\n&#xD;\nRecipe is delicious however. Agree with the KRUCIAL's review that bumping the toasted marshmallow might further improve it."},{"user":"KRUCIAL","text":"Ok my 7 daysteep/wait time is over and these flavor combos work very well together even though I'm not a fan of TFA Kentucky. This recipe provides a great tobacco custard base that is slightly sweet with the bourbon note on the back end. I feel the toasted flavor of the toasted marshmallow gets lost in the tabacco note but the creamy side of the marshmallow is there and flows nicely with the custard. If I were to make changes to this recipe i would bump up the toasted marshmallow to 2% to try to get that toasted note to come out and add FA Soho at 1.5% to further sweeten the mix and and add a more nutty brown sugar note to deepen the profile if that makes sense. Also the addition of the soho should help round that bourbon note out because in my opinion its kind of standing out on the end of the vape by itself. All that being said this is a this is a very tasty recipe and can be tweaked and played with in a lot of different ways. Its definitely worthy of a 4.5 but not a 5 and only because it doesn't seem complete. Good job I will surely be looking for version 2."}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"23933","name":"Awwww Sheeeeiiiit!"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
