It's the first official utilization of my cake layer, which is 2.5% WF Angel Cake, 1.5% OOO Corn Bread, and 1% JF Yellow Cake. Then I added LB Lava Cake to bend it into chocolate cake territory, FLV Coconut to add some serious richness and depth to the chocolate note, and finally VT Chocolate Mousse to add the finishing touch of well... chocolate mousse. \r\n\r\nEdit: Adjusted FLV Coconut to .25% because Dave was right.","steep_days":"5 (SNV)","temperature":"450","recipe_score":4.5,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:50:41.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"3381","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Lava Cake","vendor":"LB","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Angel Cake SC","vendor":"WF","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Corn Bread","vendor":"OOO","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Yellow Cake","vendor":"JF","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Chocolate Mousse","vendor":"VT","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Coconut","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":250},{"name":"Super Sweet","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":500}],"reviews":[{"user":"ID10-T","text":"EDIT: I WROTE THIS WHEN THE RECIPE HAD 0.5% FLV COCONUT. It's since been update to call for 0.25%. I'll have to try it again with the coconut cut in half. In the meantime, here's the previous review:  Why am I giving my friend's absolutely, unequivocally delicious chocolate-frosted chocolate cake recipe only four stars? One word: Coconut. I love coconut, so I'm not really complaining. I'll happily vape up every last drop of this deliciousness. But for those coconut haters out there, beware. I'm getting enough of it here to be a little less than halfway between a plain chocolate cake and German chocolate cake. Picture a two-tier chocolate-frosted chocolate cake otherwise prepared perfectly, yet for some reason the inside, where a layer of chocolate frosting should separate the two cakes, has inexplicably been replaced with that German chocolate coconut icing goop stuff. Sadly, I don't know how to \"fix\" this in a way that will still be as enjoyable as this. I'm guessing that any reduction in the FLV Coconut here is going to proportionally reduce the luxurious richness and depth here. Fine by me because I don't think it's broken and in need of fixing, as I'd love a chocolate cake made that way, but a sad day for coconut haters.

After toying with the wattage a tad this came across to me as an authentic chocolate cake with a decadent chocolate icing.  If you have the ingredients and like chocolate cake you should mix this one up.  It was beautifully executed!  I suppose that I should have mentioned that I had to sub the FLV Coconut for the FLV Sweet Coconut."}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"136238","name":"Indulgence"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
