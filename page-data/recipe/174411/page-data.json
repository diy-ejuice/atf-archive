I believe the strawberry ripe, and the LNW loops really smooth out the lemon pledge taste and replace is with a bright and smooth fruity cream flavor that really pulls this recipe together. \r\nI am still new in diy and any criticism or comments would be greatly appreciated.\r\nPlease enjoy. I know Liquid Nicotine Wholesale isn't to common a flavor but it really works well here.  Much love my diy family and keep mixing.","steep_days":"3","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T09:45:34.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"793","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Bavarian Cream","flavor_id":"145","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1250},{"name":"Fruit Circles","flavor_id":"139","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":6000},{"name":"Loops","flavor_id":"8518","vendor":"LNW","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Marshmallow","flavor_id":"332","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Strawberry (ripe)","flavor_id":"271","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1750},{"name":"Sweetener","flavor_id":"339","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1000}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"174411","name":"Toucan Sam Style Cereal"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
