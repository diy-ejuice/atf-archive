I believe the strawberry ripe, and the LNW loops really smooth out the lemon pledge taste and replace is with a bright and smooth fruity cream flavor that really pulls this recipe together. \r\nI am still new in diy and any criticism or comments would be greatly appreciated.\r\nPlease enjoy. I know Liquid Nicotine Wholesale isn't to common a flavor but it really works well here.  Much love my diy family and keep mixing.","steep_days":"3","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"total_reviews":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T09:45:34.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"793","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Bavarian Cream","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1250},{"name":"Fruit Circles","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":6000},{"name":"Loops","vendor":"LNW","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Marshmallow","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Strawberry (ripe)","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1750},{"name":"Sweetener","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1000}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"174411","name":"Toucan Sam Style Cereal"}}}
