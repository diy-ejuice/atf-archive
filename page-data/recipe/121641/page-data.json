It's a little too banana fwd for me and that's due to TFA Ripe Banana... I'm not sure if I find that flavoring really strong or that I can just pick it out of a recipe (kinda like CAP CDS) because the % isn't that high,  especially for TFA... I just find it overpowering the mix a bit for me... on the other hand my wife loves this recipe,  so there's \"taste is subjective\" in action.. lol üòÅ in the future I might just leave out the Ripe Banana or sub it out for VT Banana Custard... either way I'll most likely mix this again,  the rest is a balanced banana caramel milkshake... nice and creamy... good job! üëçüëç"}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"121641","name":"Circus monkey "}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
