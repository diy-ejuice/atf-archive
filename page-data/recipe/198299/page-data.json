After over 2 years of trying every strawberry/cream/custard/cookie type combo I could come up with I have arrived at my destination!\r\nMeet \"Custard's Last Stand\", my final achievement. \r\nAs with all great achievements, I rode the coattails of those before me, biting at the heels of their combined knowledge. Most important here is the \"Daveberry Trinity\" by ID10-T.\r\nSweet, sticky strawberry from the \"Trinity\" tops a wonderful vanilla custard made easy with TFA  Vanilla Custard 2 & INW Custard, all in a light crispy pastry shell from JF Biscuit and WF Sugar Cone. \r\nTastes great right after the shake, however after a week is when it starts to really shine. Best liquid I have ever tried, hands down.
