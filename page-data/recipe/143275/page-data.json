This recipe is spot on to those packs of carrot cakes you would get wrapped in plastic with the white cream cheese icing on top. My profile is desserts and bakeries and this recipe works on many levels. I did a ten day steep on this and found it really comes in at that 10 day mark. The carrot was very present at first and the cream icing was not as rich and thick as it is now. On the inhale I get a thick, creamy, sugary icing followed by a carrot cake undertone in the exhale. Really lovely = thanks!
