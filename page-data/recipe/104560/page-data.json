It is a green tea with forward apple and strawberry notes. The hibiscus comes and plays a little, and the lemon grass and rose are subtle notes that linger with the taste of the green tea at the end of the exhale.  This is a shake and vape for sure, doesn’t need to sit long at all, maybe a day if you want. It’s fairly sweet as is, but if you are one that likes it a little sweeter, I suggest Super Sweet to your liking as it makes the fruit pop a little better than regular sucralose. You can also add a coolant of your choice. There are so many out there, I used FLV Ice and WS-23 just to try them out and test them. I do not recommend a mint as a coolant as many of them will turn this into a bubble gum type thing, at least to me.
