I used this to get the thick, bready taste from the unfiltered beer. I added FLV Wheat to hit the wheat top notes, to get a flavor all the way through the vape. FA Orange is the perfect lemon zest taste, and the hint of FA Mandarin gives a hint of sweetness to the mix, emulated the bit of orange juice that melds into the beer while it sits. \r\n\r\nIt is pretty tasty shake and vape, but the baked bread does take a while to steep. At a week it will be a deeper wheat taste.
