Don't be afraid to bump up the TPA Rice Crunchies quite a bit – I usually go with 6–7.5% if it is the main flavor of a recipe. I don't taste any \"off\" flavors even though I'm using so much of it; it's a rather light flavor.&#xD;\n&#xD;\nFA Meringue at 1% will definitely help as mentioned by cdaniell30. It's pretty much a magic bullet for any recipe which calls for a sweet, sugary glaze.&#xD;\n&#xD;\nI've found that in recipes like this, where marshmallow needs to be pretty forward, using a mix of small amounts of marshmallows from different vendors is a good idea. TPA and FA are \"must-have\" marshmallows. 1 – 1.5% each of those plus the CAP you are already using would be a good place to start. Mixing multiple vendors' versions of a single flavor like this prevents you from getting \"off\" flavors from going too high on any individual one, and each vendor's version is different and can bring something new to the table."},{"user":"cdaniell30","text":"I didn't get rice crispy treats with this so much as I got sweet rice crispies cereal with a fluffy mouthfeel.  It's still a tasty recipe if you like rice crispies, and this is a solid first attempt.  FA Meringue at 0.5-1% might help to emulate that sticky goo that holds the cereal together a little more strongly."}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"53421","name":"Rice Crispy Treats Plain"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
