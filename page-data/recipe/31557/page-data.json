Sweet blackberry layered in with a buttery cream in a delicious coffee drizzled with white chocolate. The inw milk chocolate is just enough to bring out the white chocolate flavor.","steep_days":"1 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:49:06.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"2510","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"UP (coffee)","vendor":"FA","millipercent":100},{"name":"Blackberry","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1400},{"name":"French Vanilla Icecream","vendor":"HS","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Milk Chocolate","vendor":"INW","millipercent":100},{"name":"White Chocolate","vendor":"FW","millipercent":5000}],"reviews":[{"user":"SeLeV","text":"This is actually quite pleasant!

Going in I thought it odd as I've never had a blackberry coffee before, Nor have I ever seen one. It's different, But in a really good way. Good job Em. It's oddly, very tasty. I don't get a lot of coffee from it but I think that's part of it's charm."}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"31557","name":"White Chocolate Blackberry Mocha"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
