I used (Tpa) Sweetener because I was waiting on (Cap) Super Sweet to come in the mail so feel free to use that instead at 0.75 or 1 ","steep_days":"0 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:51:14.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"1078","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Creme De Menthe","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Koolada 10 Pg","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Cool Menthol","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":750},{"name":"Peppermint","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Sweetener","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2000}],"reviews":[{"user":"Parad0x357","text":"I really like this when I got the ol' vaper's tongue. Have to say, never had the original, but you can't get wrong with this. I left the sweetener out, but on my next mix of this I try it with some. Also Subbed the FLV Cool Menthol for Smoking Bull Kristall, but I think most decent menthol flavors will work here. Recommended!"}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"176113","name":"Kringle's Curse Remix"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
