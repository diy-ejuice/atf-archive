Very dessert-like flavor.\r\n  \r\n**TOBACCO:**\r\nNobody does NETs like Ty Edwards of Stixx Mixx. And SM Black Cavendish is one of my favorites!\r\n  \r\nCavendish(in the cigar world) refers more to the process of curing rather than a 'type' of tobacco. The result of fermenting tobacco via pressure and heat/steam(into 'cakes') is a very sweet & mild tobacco. \r\n  \r\nIt was Sir Thomas Cavendish, in the 16th Century, who discovered that dipping tobacco leaves in sugar provided a sweeter and milder experience. It is due to this sweetness that I chose SM Black Cavendish as my centerpiece.\r\n  \r\n**DESSERT FLAVORS:**\r\n  \r\nIt didn't take too long to decide on what I wanted to add to my Black Cavendish. Basically, all my favorite things. \r\n  \r\nTFA Peanut Butter is so creamy and authentic, so this choice was simple. I also wanted more sweetness and an airy quality to this particular mix. Thus, the addition of the very authentic TFA Marshmallow.\r\n  \r\nTFA Cinnamon Sugar Cookie is so underrated imho. Much better utilized in this recipe than CAP Sugar Cookie ever could be. \r\n  \r\nTFA Brown Sugar/Brown Sugar Extra, CAP Coconut & TFA Kentucky Bourbon are a great threesome that add an almost mouth-watering finish bringing it all together for your vaping pleasure.\r\n  \r\n**65/35% ratio recommended. Great as a SNV, as all Stixx Mixx NETs are. Let it set 1-3 days and the dessert flavors come out more.**\r\n  \r\n**It's my opinion there should be more tobaccos out there. Somehow they died down and fruits took over. Which is okay. I'm not a fruitophobe. But I believe it's time for great NETs(like Stixx Mixx) to GO VIRAL!!**\r\n\r\n\r\n**Do not take it upon yourself to copy and publish this recipe over to ELR. THIS ACTION IS STRICTLY FORBIDDEN.** \r\nRespect mixers, they are not your ticket to success...They are your friends.\r\n\r\n\r\n#EJUICEMAKERS","steep_days":"1 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-01T05:18:07.000-05:00","best_vg":"65%","views":"1817","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Cinnamon Sugar Cookie","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Marshmallow","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Peanut Butter","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Brown Sugar","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":750},{"name":"Coconut","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Black Cavendish","vendor":"SM","millipercent":6000},{"name":"Kentucky Bourbon","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":400}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"48225","name":"Go Viral"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
