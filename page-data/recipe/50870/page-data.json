This is a departure from my normal bakery and cream recipes. Some times you just got to get away from the same-old same-old. I've been wanting a juice to take me to another place,... a secluded island in a distant land. This recipe strips away all the heavy bakeries, creams, and sweeteners to just enjoy a great \"tropical fruit\" vape on a secluded nude beach somewhere in the Pacific(I wish). It's quite hard to explain but I will try.\r\nTop note: FA Orange and FA Lemon Sicily not to over-powering though\r\nMiddle note: CAP Golden Pineapple and CAP Kiwi\r\nEnd note or bottom note: FA Lemon Sicily and INW Cactus. It has a slight floral note but not so much that it gets in the way of the other flavors. I don't like most floral notes in juices but this sits well with this juice. \r\nNice refreshing vape for a change of pace.\r\n5 days steep for best results but can be a shake and vape\r\n\r\nPlease comment, mix, and or rate,...it make us all better mixers. Enjoy :) \r\n","steep_days":"3 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":4,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:49:23.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"3273","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Golden Pineapple","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Orange","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Kiwi","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Lemon Sicily","vendor":"FA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Cactus","vendor":"INW","millipercent":500}],"reviews":[{"user":"cdaniell30","text":"I love how the orange and kiwi play off each other in this.  It's a very bright and sweet juice, which is not usually my thing, but it works here.  Probably the best use of FA Orange I've tasted.  The longer I vape this, the more I enjoy it."}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"50870","name":"Nay-Ked"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
