I've tried this next to the original in identical setups and they are pretty close. My version is a little more forward with the blueberry, but I like it that way. While I don't believe LB Greek Yogurt is is in the original, it's what I had on hand and it does the job nicely. FW Yogurt is was an obvious choice and FW Blueberry is king. To add the granola in this parfait recipe I used CAP Cereal 27. Off the shake it is good but after about a week, it really comes together. I chose not to use sweetener (it really doesn't need it) but feel free to add to taste.","steep_days":"7 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-12T10:16:21.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"627","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Greek Yogurt","flavor_id":"1490","vendor":"LB","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Yogurt","flavor_id":"1471","vendor":"FW","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Cereal 27","flavor_id":"4163","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Blueberry","flavor_id":"1201","vendor":"FW","millipercent":5000}],"reviews":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"188935","name":"Blueberry Parfait (Rocket Man Clone)"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
