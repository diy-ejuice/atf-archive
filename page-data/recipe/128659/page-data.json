This is creamy peanut butter cream filling sandwiched between two oatmeal cookies. On the inhale you get oatmeal cookies and on the exhale you get a delicious peanut butter cream filling. I personally love it on a shake but it best after a few days of steeping.","steep_days":"3 (SNV)","temperature":"420","recipe_score":5,"updated_at":"2020-12-12T17:12:09.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"2934","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Oats & Cream Cookie SC","flavor_id":"9032","vendor":"WF","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Oatmeal Cookie – SC","flavor_id":"7522","vendor":"RF","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Dx Peanut Butter","flavor_id":"288","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":3500},{"name":"Vanilla Pudding","flavor_id":"4433","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Sweetener (sucralose)","flavor_id":"2308","vendor":"FW","millipercent":500},{"name":"Vanilla Custard","flavor_id":"131","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1000}],"reviews":[{"user":"Deftohms","text":"Damnnnnn this is amazing stuff! If this kind of profile is up your alley, I highly recommend starting off with a 60ml. But if you don’t, it’s no problem, because it’s delicious off the shake as well. Thanks for this one!","score":5},{"user":"ID10-T","text":"This is stellar. The only way I could imagine anyone being let down by it is if you're expecting a lot of oatmeal cookie. It's there, but it definitely takes a backseat to smooth, thick, and rich peanut butter creme. I tried it as a shake and vape and it was promising, but even at 1% that raw greasy vanilla of unsteeped CAP Vanilla Custard was sticking out like a sore thumb. Give it a few days and it dies down. Give it two weeks and it's even better; the oatmeal cookie comes out more and picks up a bit of bakery texture that was missing before, and pairs so well with peanut butter and cream flavors eventually melt together into something like a giant gooey spoonful of peanut butter cream filling. A lot of peanut butter recipes have problems with fading but this one is still strong three weeks out and hard to put down.
