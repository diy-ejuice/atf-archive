It needs a good week for everything to shine through, especially for the caramel and cream but you can get an idea of the profile after a couple of days\r\n\r\nTested on  a single coil flavour RDA (Hussar RDA V2) with an alien at 0.24 ohms","steep_days":"7","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-06T20:45:59.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"682","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Biscuit","vendor":"INW","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Flapper Pie SC","vendor":"WF","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Caramel Butter","vendor":"WF","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Vanilla Whipped Cream","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Super Sweet","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":500},{"name":"Carmel (caramel)","vendor":"FA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Vanilla Custard 2","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Caramel","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":500}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"197488","name":"#DevelopedPie Caramel Cream Pie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
