I'm thinking the bakery notes might be working similarly to how graham cracker clear can effect creams (adds a kind of malted note to the cream). \r\n\r\nLet me know what you think or if there is anything I can do to improve the recipe! I am always looking to learn :) ","steep_days":"7","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"total_reviews":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T17:35:20.000-05:00","best_vg":"75%","views":"1173","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Banana Nut Bread","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Banana Pur√©e","vendor":"WF","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Cream","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Vienna Cream","vendor":"FA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Sweetener","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Eggnog","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1500}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"128739","name":"Banana Nog #mixenvixens"}}}
