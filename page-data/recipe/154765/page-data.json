This is one of mine.\r\n\r\nSo I decided to reproduce a cranberry infused ice cream vape.\r\n\r\nFor the French parfait glacé (ice Cream base) i used the usual egg yolk-thickened pudding from FLV Vanilla Pudding and FA Gelato Vaniglia.\r\nI needed some tartness to balance the sugar and cream, so i layered FLV Apple Cranberry with FLV Cranberry and a pinch of FLV Berry Blend. It compliments this recipe beautifully. \r\nIt is certainly a magical combination.\r\n\r\nNo extra sweetness needed in this one.\r\nGive it 5 day's to blend and you get a very rewarding and refreshing French parfait glacé. \r\n\r\nEnjoy ","steep_days":"5","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-06T20:44:55.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"2341","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Apple Cranberry","flavor_id":"4372","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Cranberry","flavor_id":"2493","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Berry Blend","flavor_id":"4395","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1250},{"name":"Vanilla Ice Cream","flavor_id":"9957","vendor":"FA","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Vanilla Pudding","flavor_id":"4433","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1500}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"154765","name":"French Cranberry Parfait (Ice Cream)"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
