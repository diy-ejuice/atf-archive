Then it turned into popcorn bars. \r\nThis of course is has popcorn which I choose FLV Popcorn, it is a great almost Kettle Corn popcorn. To help with the texture and candy aspect of the flavor, I used WF SC Sesame Candy, this also boosts the nuttiness just perfectly. I chose WF SC Walniut as the main nut, this gives a smooth roasted Walniut. \r\nNow for the fruit mixed in this bar is supposed to be a dried cranberry. This seemed like it could be a challenge; however, rather than over complicate the vape, I choose Cap Cranberry backed up with RF SC Yumberry. This gives that perfect tartness that a dried cranberry has, and with the other ingredients working together, the texture is there. \r\nFinally, to have an authentic popcorn bar, you must have a marshmallow. I went with TPA Marshmallow.\r\nAs you vape this, you get a sweet tart fruit throughout with a Slight nutty note. Just delicious.
