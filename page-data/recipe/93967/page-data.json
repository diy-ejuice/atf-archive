The 27 bears  is a great gummie  base  but it does add  a slight pineapple back note that really works here  helping to push the strawberry upfront- \r\n\r\nyou could add TFA  straberry or   FA juicy strawberry  to really enhance the strawberry - as it is a candid strawberry but Liquid barn strawberry cheesecake is a solid strong flavor  with some creaminess add by the cheesecake at the recommend percentage. This is good as a shake and vape but needs 3 days to come together","steep_days":"3","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"total_reviews":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-06T12:55:21.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"1359","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"27 Bears","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Vanilla Swirl","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Strawberry Cheesecake","vendor":"LB","millipercent":8000},{"name":"Sweetness","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":300}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"93967","name":"Strawberry Cheesecake Jelly Bean  "}}}
