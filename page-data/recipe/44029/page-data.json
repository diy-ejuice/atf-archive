Then last month i finally picked up the last ingredients to mix dazcole's \"Dinner Lady A Lemon Tart Remix\" and loved it, but still i wanted something more creamy, so with what i learned from my earlier tests i changed some things up a bit.\r\n\r\nI made the creams a little heavier and put them a bit more upfront by reducing the lemon, using TFA's Butter instead of CAP's Golden Butter and added some Marshmallow for some of the Meringue as well as using CAP's Vanilla Custard instead of FA's Custard Pi.\r\nTo meld everything together i used TPA's Dragonfruit which worked really well and rounded everything up nicely.\r\n\r\nI really love this recipe with a little Menthol added. Polar Blast should also work really well.\r\nIf you like it, please leave a rating.\r\n\r\nBest after 3-5 Days but it's also good as S&V\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nSpecial Thanks to [dazcole](https://alltheflavors.com/users/dazcole) for his original work on [\"Dinner Lady A Lemon Tart Remix\"](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/12504#dinner_lady_a_lemon_tart_remix_by_dazcole), his inspiration and permission to share this recipe.\r\n","steep_days":"5","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:49:17.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"2887","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Lemon Meringue Pie","flavor_id":"1335","vendor":"FW","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Lemon Sicily","flavor_id":"524","vendor":"FA","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Biscuit","flavor_id":"642","vendor":"INW","millipercent":500},{"name":"Juicy Lemon","flavor_id":"79","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Butter","flavor_id":"147","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Graham Cracker Clear","flavor_id":"325","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Meringue","flavor_id":"530","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Super Sweet","flavor_id":"2384","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":500},{"name":"Vanilla Custard","flavor_id":"131","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Marshmallow","flavor_id":"473","vendor":"FA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Dragonfruit","flavor_id":"226","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1000}],"reviews":[{"user":"muchafraid","text":"Total banger, my dude.
