At first glance HS Blueberry seems to be the star of the show, but it is quickly stolen by the lingering,chocolaty exhale. Maybe you are a tootsie pop fan, or you just have a thing for owls stealing candy from little kids. Who am I to judge? \r\n\r\n\r\nHS Blueberry: This blueberry is the star of the show. HS Blueberry is just strong blueberry candy to me. Not much floral or realism to mention. Just the blue hard candy you would expect on the outside of the center of a tootsie pop. \r\n\r\nFLV Blueberry Muffin: I know. It seems like an odd choice since this is not a bakery. This blueberry lies somewhere in the spectrum between that purple huckleberry pancake syrup and the more realistic ripe blueberries. It lends a bit of juiciness to the main blueberry. Like when you've been holding that sucker in your cheek for awhile and finally slurp down that dissolved candy. It also seems to take a slight edge off of HS Blueberry. It forms that bridge between sucker and chocolate. \r\n\r\nFLV Milk Chocolate: This flavoring is amazing. In its full strength it has a somewhat pleasant aroma with an odd note in the background. Once you make a 10% dilution it smells EXACTLY like a Tootsie Roll. This flavoring acts as the back note just as the blueberry candy begins to leave your tongue.\r\n\r\n*I entered the % value at 2% only so that the calculator would give you the weight of dilution to use. Please DO NOT make this recipe with the non-diluted FLV Milk Chocolate at that percentage. If you want to get close without diluting just use .25%(roughly 1 drop)*\r\n\r\nGive this one a 3 day steep for the blueberry to mellow out and the milk chocolate to shrine through a bit. \r\n\r\nEnjoy!
