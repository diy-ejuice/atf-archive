Is it a stretch thematically? Absolutely. I wanted to do a NOLA inspired recipe but I wanted to stray from what would generally be expected and this is what I came up with. I'm not going to bore you with the details of the trip around the world my mind takes when I brainstorm so here's my flavor notes.\r\n\r\nVT Rice Base - Honestly I ordered this FOR this recipe and it just worked. It imparts a sweet sticky rice taste and texture to the whole mix. You get that grainy taste and mouthfeel from rice and a sweet undertone.\r\n\r\nCAP Horchata - Sticking with the rice theme and adding a bit of cinnamon and flair to the recipe as a whole. I tried it higher and it gets to be a bit overpowering for me so I settled at 1.5 on this one to just add that touch of cinnamon evocative of fall.\r\n\r\nFLV Vanilla Pudding - Brings a creamy mouthfeel to the recipe after a few days steep and knocks off some of the graininess from the Rice Base. Honestly I probably need to bring this down some, but this is more or less my first iteration of this recipe.\r\n\r\nFA Coco/TPA Coconut Candy - I wanted to add some coconut to this and this is the combo and percentage I settled on. You may or may not taste it, I get it faintly and it helps add some sweetness to the rice base and brighten the recipe a touch.\r\n\r\nHS Pumpkin Pie - yup. this is the \"sweet potato\" base. It's what I've got so I can't say much about it. Planning on experimenting with other things here in the future. \r\n\r\nFA Carmel/FW Butterscotch Ripple - This is my go to combo for a buttery caramel note and it works well here. It adds some darkness and heaviness to the body and gives a buttery undertone. Really helps bring out the pumpkin pie in correlation with the CAP Horchata's cinnamon note. \r\n\r\n\r\nThis is very much a work in progress and a bit of a learning experience as well. Any and all criticism or advice is much appreciated.","steep_days":"3 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"total_reviews":null,"updated_at":"2020-11-29T03:54:11.000-05:00","best_vg":"60%","views":"871","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Rice Base","vendor":"VT","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Horchata","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Vanilla Pudding","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Coco' (coconut)","vendor":"FA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Coconut Candy","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Pumpkin Pie","vendor":"HS","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Carmel (caramel)","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Butterscotch Ripple","vendor":"FW","millipercent":2000}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"126407","name":"Bywater Reserve"}}}
