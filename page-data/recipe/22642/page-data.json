What does a monkey do with barrels besides throwing them like crazy towards unwanted guests? On my way through the flavor-jungle called \"Beginner Blending: Mixxed Competition\",  I found the answer. The only logical purpose must be: he uses these barrels to steep his favorite e-juice ;)\r\n\r\n\"Donkey Kong's Secret\" is a composure of creamy bananas and peanuts with a nutty RY4-tobacco note, steeped in old oak barrels. Enjoy!\r\n\r\nTPA Banana Cream\r\nNo doubt: Donkey Kong loves bananas. And what else should a banana-expert use than the best banana flavor out there.\r\n\r\nTPA Peanut Butter\r\nEvery monkey likes peanuts. TFA Peanut Butter adds a nice peanut taste to the juice that blends good with the banana and the nutty aspect of FA Soho.\r\n\r\nTPA Bavarian Cream\r\nAdds more creaminess and a tasty vanilla note to the mix.\r\n\r\nFA Soho\r\nFA Soho is a RY4-like tobacco flavor with a very nutty and woody character. Being a weaker flavor, compared to other FA flavors, I used it around 5-7% depending on how much of a tobacco note I wanted.\r\n\r\nTPA Red Oak\r\nRed Oak adds a more woody note to the juice, creating the impression that the juice steeped in Donkey Kong's oak barrels.\r\n\r\nFW Butterscotch Ripple\r\nFW Butterscotch Ripple adds a caramel note and turns the FA Soho even more to a RY4-tobacco. Moreover it adds some sweetness to the juice and blends together the whole mix. If you like it a bit darker and more sweet you can substitute FW Butterscotch Ripple for FA Butterscotch @ 0.5%.\r\n\r\nTPA Sweetener\r\nTake a look at Donkey Kong's hostage (I think her name was Pauline) and you'll know: he likes it sweet ;)  Add to your liking between 0.2 to 1% TFA sweetner.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nMixed at 70/30 (VG/PG). Steep: minimum Steep over night, best after 3-5 days.\r\n","steep_days":"4","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"total_reviews":2,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:48:56.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"6949","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Banana Cream","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":3500},{"name":"Bavarian Cream","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Soho","vendor":"FA","millipercent":6500},{"name":"Butterscotch Ripple","vendor":"FW","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Peanut Butter","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":3500},{"name":"Red Oak","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Sweetener","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":200}],"reviews":[{"user":"phried","score":"5","text":"Donkey Kong's livin' large if this was his ADV. I'm getting a really strong peanut butter with the bananas perfectly supporting it. The butterscotch ripple, creams, and red oak help with the fullness of the recipe. And where's the soho? It just blends wonderfully with the peanut butter and banana that it almost doesn't taste like a tobacco recipe at all - but you know it's there, lending its spice-laden tobacco sweetness to the mix. I eat a lot of peanut butter but haven't thought of vaping it - this changed my mind and has earned a place in my rotation. Great recipe."},{"user":"crisk","score":"5","text":""}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"22642","name":"Donkey Kong's Secret"}}}
