Oddly, I used to strongly dislike blue raspberry vapes and now, they're one of my favorites.\r\n\r\nSour blue raspberry candy WF and River Supply  blue raspberry make up the foundation.\r\n\r\nRaspberry TFA is used to boost the raspberry note, do not use sweet raspberry.\r\n\r\nSour lemon VT is used to brighten the recipe.\r\n\r\nRaspberry Sherbet Sasami is a flavor that completes the recipe. It's excellent in candy recipes. If you do not have this, you can omit it and boost the sour lemon by 0.25%\r\n\r\nSweeten to your liking, 0.75% CAP super sweet is perfect for my liking in this mix.\r\n\r\nSteep - Shake and Vape (comes together after 1 day)\r\n\r\nVG/PG - 70/30\r\n\r\nDeveloped in the Barrage and Reload S with N80 Quad Core (0.2-0.3)\r\n\r\nPlease leave a review and comment.
