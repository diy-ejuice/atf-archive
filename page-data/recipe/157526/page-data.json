I've never tried it myself but I do know how to make a tasty cupcake!\r\n\r\nJust an easy & tasty Strawberry Frosted Cupcake. Cap vanilla cupcake with some support all around. \r\n\r\nGonna layer this one from the top down:\r\n\r\n**Top of the cupcake:** Taking the bit of frosting from the cap cupcake and building it up with a nice layer of flv Frosting. Cap I feel almost mixes from the top down. I mean that as in use lower for almost all frosting, start cranking it to get the body of the cupcake.\r\n\r\n**The Strawberry:** a combo of candied strawberry sweet & the thicker slightly jammy RF Strawberry SC. This is my favorite combo of strawberries at this time. Little cap super sweet to brighten these a little bit as well as being a general sweetener. Besides, what kind of sick Nazi wants an unsweetened cupcake?! \r\nCap Sweet Strawberry will work alright as a sub if you don't have jf. Flv sweetness at double duty for less gunk.\r\n\r\n**Cupcake body:** once again cap is good for this part as well but also needs some help. Bolstering it with tasty jf yellow cake, which also needs a little help. Awwwww....friends helping friends. This is also tasty af with fw yellow cake, same %.\r\n\r\n**The steep:** Good at 3 days when the strawberry sweet calms down & everything starts to come together. Shines at 5+ like most bakeries. Recommend giving it a week however.\r\n\r\nEnjoy ðŸ˜ŽðŸ’¨ðŸ’¨\r\nRemember feedback good or bad helps us all as mixers especially since comments aren't working :)\r\n[Visit DMC on Facebook!](https://www.facebook.com/groups/dmcdiy/)\r\nTank tested, tank approved.\r\n\r\n**Sweetener:** Preferred level is 1 chubby gorilla drop of cap ss\\10ml to sweeten & help the strawberry. Use your personal favorite sucralose based sweetener @ 2 times recommended % as cap is strong af & the only one I measure by the drop.\r\n\r\n**Subs\\other uses: Many.**\r\nTake out the strawberry & replace with your fruit of choice. Leave it out & add .25-.5 cap cake batter or (unsure percent) fw cake batter dip (sugar warning) for a nice plain cupcake.\r\nSub flv Frosting for la cream cheese icing, NR Vanilla Frosting, Vt\\wf  buttercream frosting, you get the idea.","steep_days":"5","temperature":"666","recipe_score":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-11T17:21:30.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"1225","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Strawberry Sweet","flavor_id":"4745","vendor":"JF","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Strawberry â€“ SC","flavor_id":"7550","vendor":"RF","millipercent":1750},{"name":"Vanilla Cupcake","flavor_id":"129","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":3500},{"name":"Frosting","flavor_id":"4412","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1250},{"name":"Yellow Cake","flavor_id":"4560","vendor":"JF","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Super Sweet","flavor_id":"2384","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":180}],"reviews":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"157526","name":"K's Strawberry Cupcake"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
