Either way, you won't be disappointed.\r\n\r\nFLV Jackfruit and VTA Sugarloaf Pineapple combined gives the most natural pineapple vaping experience I ever tasted.\r\n\r\nNo Pina Colada without rum, the SA White Rum used is perfect for this recipe as it is a soft tasting rum if used with the right % it adds a perfect boozy taste a pineapple recipe deserves.\r\nI was planning to use VTA Light Rum but my supplier still not carries it or was not available on the creation date of this recipe.\r\nVTA Light Rum, even so, I never tasted it, but seeing the reviews about it I can safely say that it can be subbed for the Solubarome Rum at the same %\r\n\r\nFLV Sweet Coconut added for a background tropical sense.\r\n\r\nThe real secret for this juicy tropical combination is FA Candy/Jammy Wizard, it serves as the glue for the other ingredients softens the mix and gives that candy sweet sensation you would expect from a first-class cocktail.\r\nWS-23 is used to get this Pineapple Rum a slush sensation.\r\n\r\nAs a sweet tooth, I added some CAP Super Sweet to round this off, this can be omitted at will.\r\n\r\nShort steep time off 3 days, but if you are willing to wait till the 10-day mark, (FLV Sweet Coconut needs more days than the other ingredients to develop) this Pineapple Rum Slush/Piña Colada get even better.","steep_days":"10 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"total_reviews":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T14:13:31.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"2736","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Jammy/Candy Wizard","vendor":"FA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Jackfruit","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1000},{"name":"RHUM BLANC","vendor":"SA","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Sugarloaf Pineapple","vendor":"VT","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Super Sweet","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":150},{"name":"Sweet Coconut","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1000},{"name":"WS-23","vendor":"OTHR","millipercent":1250}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"123829","name":"Pineapple Rum Slush"}}}
