This is my first in a series of recipe releases that I will be calling my \"Infinity Stone\" line. AETHER, the Reality gem, is the gem to manipulate reality. It is depicted in the Marvel Universe as a red gem. As such, I thought a strawberries and cream recipe would be an appropriate fit.\r\n\r\nNot much to mention on flavor notes, just a awesome strawberries and cream! Shake and vape but is best after a 3 day steep.\r\n\r\nPlease comment, mix, and or rate. Enjoy :)\r\nVisit Freedom To Mix on Discord https://discord.gg/SmSc8Ef\r\nVisit Freedom To Mix on FaceBook https://www.facebook.com/groups/415341418920740/ \r\n\r\n ","steep_days":"3 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"updated_at":"2020-12-12T18:29:20.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"4436","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Dx Sweet Cream","flavor_id":"165","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2250},{"name":"Sweet Strawberry","flavor_id":"121","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":2000},{"name":"New York Cheesecake","flavor_id":"90","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Super Sweet","flavor_id":"2384","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":250},{"name":"Strawberry – SC","flavor_id":"7550","vendor":"RF","millipercent":1500}],"reviews":[{"user":"TamVapes","text":"Excellent recipe!
