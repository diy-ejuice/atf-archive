A delicate, smooth sweet velvety mouth feel with vanilla accents and sweet undertones. Each cream compliments one another to support cappella's custard with the marzipan/sweetner giving it that melt in your mouth sweet goodness. I was going to keep this private but just want to give back to the diy community.  It is imparitive that this mix steeps for atleast one month and be at a 75/25 vg/pg. Comments always welcome. Enjoy.

Tried it around the 30 day mark and it was not so special.  Came back to it at the 6 week mark, and DAMN,  Very Delicious and Sweet Custard.  If you mix this and vape it before it's ready, your missing out cause the Sweet Mother didn't show up until day 42 for me."},{"user":"justjasontm","text":"This is delicious stuff. I dont have vanillin unfortunately so I used .25% Madagascar.  I'm sure it's not 100% accurate but its damn good. Amazing creamy, thick custard but not too heavy if that makes sense. Good stuff!"},{"user":"KylezKloudz","text":"I made this mix so I had a Christmas Custard after a month steep and boy am I glad that I did. This is a nice bright vanilla custard! Sweet creamy thick and vanilla present just as described.  Mix up 120ml at least if your gonna even bother... I made 100 and I wish I made more... nice job! üëçüëç I gotta agree with folkart,  the recipe reads like it'll be a muddled muted mess of EM (that's what kept me from mixing it earlier) but it's not.  It's just a great very vanilla custard. Definitely one for the recipe locker,  I'll be mixing up more üòÅ"},{"user":"HerrHut","text":"OMG this is lovely!  After &lt;1 week it's a nice light creamy pudding with sweet vanilla notes.  I hope my 60 ml tester survives the full 30 days so I can get the complete picture. "},{"user":"folkart","text":"I was little apprehensive to mix this recipe because of the number of different flavorings. However, I'm glad I did. This is one of the smoothest, creamiest custards I have ever mixed! It has a brightness and freshness that most custards lack. It's not too heavy on the eggy note that most custards have. Very tasty! I will defiantly mix this again and again! Nice work 007! :) I suggest steeping this for at least 1 week."},{"user":"wadeyloops","text":"This recipe is exactly as described and is totally smooth and addictive. There are not many juices that I keep in rotation but this one has made the short list. I have not waited the full month to review this as it was 5 stars within 2 weeks. I may go 1.2 on the sweetener next time but that is just my personal preference.  Do yourself a flavor! mix this mother up now."}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"41344","name":"Sweet mother of custard"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
