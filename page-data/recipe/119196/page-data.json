Sweet cola and vanilla on in the inhale with the  rum and  mint on the exhale, can be a shake and vape but flavor deepen 3 - 5 days \r\n**cola base**     VT cola is a straight up cola syrup  adding the holy vanilla adds some sweetness, spice and pushes that vanilla note up front.  The Fizzy shertbet adds that citrus note that is essential to a cuba libre  and also gives a slight impression of  effervescence \r\n**rum**  I like the combination of VT light rum and FA Jamaican run for a  spiced rum \r\n**sorbet**   adds a slight minty cooling and fruity back note  that is used as a top note  here with the cooling on the exhale\r\n**SUBS** you can use INW cola which would work pretty well here,  FA cola  does have a bit of a carbonation and a bit more citrus notes  but  the syrup is a bit thin so would need a boost  - caramel or a cream soda \r\n\r\n**NOTES**:  Add sweeter to your liking  or a bit more lime if you  like   that bright pop up top.   If you want more cooling I would add a touch of polar blast but the sorbet does add that on the exhale .  if you want more Boozieness then bump the VT light rum . \r\nBest vapes at 40 - 60 watts in a RTA/ RDA \r\n\r\n**Learn more about mixing here**\r\nhttps://www.facebook.com/groups/diydownunder/\r\nhttps://discord.gg/kH4Fqbc\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCTCwb7ULyfJALQlehomZZQA\r\nhttps://www.diydownunder.com/\r\nHave you tried this recipe?!\r\nPlease rate this recipe and comment below!
