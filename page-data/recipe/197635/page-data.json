This is my first public recipe because I think I've simply crushed it with this mix. I was a huge fan of the original Naked 100 version and vaped it by the gallons. I have also tried many versions of this submitted by mixers and although many were good, most were missing something or over did others. This version was actually created by accident. \r\nMy earlier version used FLV pink guava and FA passion like most recipes use. I love pink guava but ran out and mixed with out it and man I'm glad I did. Something about it was just made it taste way different than the original. I ended up picking up VT Yellow passion thanks to ID10T's review from the passion Noted episode and have never looked at FA again. I've mixed this with dragon fruit like most but just didn't like the taste it added. I went with a touch of TPA Nectarine because I love that flavor and think it made the mix a little juicier without adding a noticeable note in the background at this percentage like dragon fruit did for me. Shisha Vanilla is my favorite for my fruit mixes. To me it kind of just bonds to fruit flavors and mellows out any funkiness or brightens the dull ones. Sweet tangerine makes up all the citrus I believe that is needed in this profile. I immediately scrapped all my versions with CAP Juicy Orange once I tried without it and I don't have any other oranges to test with this. Cap Sweet Guava didn't need any help IMO. It's just delicious as it stands in the front of this mix. \r\nI have a massive sweet tooth and half percent of super sweet does it for me. I'm pretty sure this will still be good without it so take it or leave it up to you. I'd love to get some feed back to see if I was on to something with this or if I was just delusional. If you liked the original, please try this and let me know what you think. Thanks everyone.\r\nOh yeah I forgot this is 100% shake and vape certified. I honestly couldn't tell you how it is with a steep. It may suck. This has never lasted long enough for me to tell. Thanks again.","steep_days":"0 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"total_reviews":1,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:51:37.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"904","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Yellow Passion","vendor":"VT","millipercent":1750},{"name":"Passion Fruit","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Shisha Vanilla","vendor":"INW","millipercent":750},{"name":"Sweet Tangerine","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Nectarine","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Sweet Guava","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Super Sweet","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":500}],"reviews":[{"user":"sunsetsandpalmtrees","score":"5","text":"Delicious! Thank you for this great recipe. It is bursting with tropical flavor. My husband loves it so much - he enjoys sweet, fruity vapes.  We have vaped 200 mls of it in a week and I just made another 100 mls  - you are right, it isn't around long enough to know how it would be with a steep. Thanks so much for sharing it!"}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"197635","name":"P.O.G HOG Juice"}}}
