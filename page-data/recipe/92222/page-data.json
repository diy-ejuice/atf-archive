This is my rendition of something I had seen when I first started to D.I.Y. and I have struggled with in the beginning and I think I have the right amount of everything for the correct tastes so what better then the best of 2 worlds.. Banana Nut Bread with Strawberry Cheesecake combined into one hell of a vape.. Slight coconut hint with the right cream and vanilla. \r\n","steep_days":"7","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:50:01.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"2581","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Banana Nut Bread","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":3500},{"name":"Cheesecake (graham Crust)","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"New York Cheesecake","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Shisha Strawberry","vendor":"INW","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Vienna Cream","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Coconut","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":150},{"name":"Shisha Vanilla","vendor":"INW","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Banana Pur√©e","vendor":"WF","millipercent":250},{"name":"Strawberry (ripe)","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":500}],"reviews":[{"user":"tw2k","text":"Really well balanced Banana nut recipe.
