FA Liquid Amber was also a No-brainer.It brings some fermented,warm feel to the table which turns that fruits/meringue combo into something that has slowly being cooked and stirred for some time .Meringue and Liquid Amber together brought me the Compote taste i was going for.\r\n\r\nThe Conclusion: A sweet,warm Apple Strawberry Compote freshly made with some Cinnamon Crisps on top\r\n\r\nSteeping:after 4 days everything comes together nicely and especially the Pie crust tones down a bit.\r\n\r\nSidenote:After i had the recipe together i realised the i have been using V2 of Capellas CDS.I know i'm an idiot but i hope that V1 is not completely different than V2.I don't know if you guys see it as a major mistake,but now it's too late anyway because i can't get V1 in time here.\r\nThanks for this awesome Competition!\r\n\r\nFeedback would be highly appreciated especially if i won't make it into the next round!\r\n\r\n\r\n ","steep_days":"0","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"total_reviews":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T05:56:50.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"879","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Strawberry (ripe)","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":6000},{"name":"Fuji","vendor":"FA","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Meringue","vendor":"FA","millipercent":750},{"name":"Liquid Amber","vendor":"FA","millipercent":750},{"name":"Cinnamon Danish Swirl","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Pie Crust","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Ethyl Maltol","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":500}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"16412","name":"Mixxed Round 1- Apple Strawberry Compote with Cinnamon Crisps"}}}
