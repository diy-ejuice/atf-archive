Most of the cherry options are bleh and Molinberry has manged to create a winner here! This is a juicy, sweetened, red cherry, minus the medicinal cough syrup vibe - enough said! This get truly better with time and develops a fantastic deep and juicy cherry after the 2 week mark. The Red Cherry is filled out with a touch of INW Cherries (NOT INW CHERRY!) to fill in the gaps  and allows the full cherry to shine.
