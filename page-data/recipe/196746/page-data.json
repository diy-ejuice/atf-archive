Grape, peach, raspberry, watermelon,and strawberry gummified. This is a different take on the og skull candy which is one of my favorite adv's..The flv peach gummy really compliments flv grape and tfa grape juice.  cap strawberry taffy/wf strawberry gummy/ wf sour ball candy/ fw razzleberry create a slightly tart chewy gummy base while tfa raspberry sweet and la watermelon help round it out and add some complexity. I like the original but the redux is easily my favorite of the two. This one could use a 7-8 day steep for everything to show up but it is pretty good off the shake.","steep_days":"7","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T21:33:25.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"738","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Grape","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":2650},{"name":"Grape Juice","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":3700},{"name":"Peach Gummy","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":650},{"name":"Raspberry (sweet)","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Razzleberry","vendor":"FW","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Sour Ball Candy SC","vendor":"WF","millipercent":1250},{"name":"Strawberry Gummy Candy SC","vendor":"WF","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Strawberry Taffy","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Sweetness","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":300},{"name":"Watermelon","vendor":"LA","millipercent":800}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"196746","name":"Skull Candy (Redux)"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
