It has just a drop of koolada btw. That's all you'll need for a 30ml. Maybe a drop and a half-2 drops (Unless you just love koolada). But really this recipe should barely taste it. I'm saying basically if you dont even like koolada you should still enjoy this, that's how little goes in here lol! Ok now take a bottle of Vape Wild \"Blue Harvest\" and put it next to this recipe. What I'm  going for, is I'm trying to completely imitate it. I'm close! I'm not there 100% but it's hard for me to tell the two apart just off smell now so that's progress. LA \"lemonade\" is for sure the best lemonade for this so far, I've never tried Vape Wilds lemonade though, that is another option I thought may be what goes in it. The blueberry as well could be the one from Vape Wild, also need to buy that. If you have tried those and can give me any feedback on if you think they go in this, please let me know. So I wasn't sure if cap \"harvest berry\" was in \"blue harvest\", but now I'm 95% sure that it is. At least that's what my personal tests have concluded lol. TFA \"watermelon\" is what they use for sure, that's an easy one to spot in there. Idk if they used 2 watermelon flavors or not. And like I said, I wasn't sure on the bberry so I thought maybe FW Bluebery or TFA BBW. I went with \"bbery wild\", I thought it tasted right in this so hopefully I got it right. You can try both or maybe tfa \"BBXtra\" or maybe a bberry from another company. Anyway I think I'm pretty close but if you have any knowledge on what Vape Wild \"blur harvest\" tastes like, give it a mix and leave me some feedback. Thanks. Enjoy.
