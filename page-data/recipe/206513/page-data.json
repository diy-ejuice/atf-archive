Solo RY4x2 has a bit of a dirty bite to me, but in conjunction with the PB and AP they seem to smooth out or hide that edge.\r\n\r\n\r\nTPA Vanilla Custard 2- my crutch custard, develops into a really nice vanilla custard that can stand up against some other dark flavors.\r\n\r\n\r\nTPA Bavarian Cream- used in concert with the custard we get another element, more vanilla and some additional sweetness.\r\n\r\nI'm good with no super sweet in this but as always add to taste.","steep_days":"2","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T23:39:19.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"503","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Vanilla Custard 2","flavor_id":"10427","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2900},{"name":"Bavarian Cream","flavor_id":"145","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1600},{"name":"Ry4 Double","flavor_id":"379","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Acetyl Pyrazine 5%","flavor_id":"1709","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Dx Peanut Butter","flavor_id":"288","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":4000}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"206513","name":"Solace"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
