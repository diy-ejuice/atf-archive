There is very little difference in flavor between American & Jamaican hibiscus in my opinion. The American type is much easier and cheaper to get ahold of. \r\n  \r\nOccasionally, I will add about 1/8 cup of Jamaican Rhum to mine(also traditional in Jamaican culture). I did not add it here, because frankly-I add so little that I can barely even taste it(I've never really enjoyed the effects of alcohol).\r\n  \r\nIn the *real life* recipe that I will include after all my notes, I include rum measurement. \r\n  \r\n**NOTES:**\r\n  \r\n\r\n**FLV LIME WEDGE** is the ONLY freshly 'chopped' lime flavoring that compares to the real thing. Lime Cold Pressed, etc., does NOT mimic the taste of fresh chopped lime with *these* particular concentrates. Sorry. This flavoring is potent as hell, so one 15ml(or 10ml) bottle will likely last you at least a year!\r\n  \r\n**CAP HIBISCUS** was the only match for the flavor of dried Hibiscus buds that I usually order from Nuts(dot)com. I am only mentioning that site because it's the best bargain if you want to make the real life recipe. I've tried all other concentrates and they were pretty nasty here.\r\n  \r\nFor my cracked pimento(called 'allspice' here in the States), I utilized **CAP PUMPKIN PIE SPICE**. TFA's version didn't even compare. I also buy my whole pimentos from Nuts(dot)com and crack them myself. Our powdered allspice in the supermarkets is pitiful in comparison.\r\n  \r\n**I used only 1 drop of **FLV RICH CINNAMON** per 20-30ml eliquid here. You don't want it to overpower anything...but you definitely want it flexing its' muscle.\r\n  \r\n**VT GINGER ROOT** is the key to getting this just right. In the real drink, I use anywhere from 1/4-1/3 cup of fresh peeled ginger root(depending on how much *bite* I want my sorrel to have). VT's version of Ginger Root is the most accurate. I even went as far as purchasing NF's ginger to try out(it was very close...but not a perfect fit & had an indescribable off note when mixed with these specific concentrates). And again...if you are making the real life recipe below? Powdered Ginger from your spice rack will not work. At all. Just don't do it.\r\n  \r\n**WS-23** is not listed in the above recipe but was used at 2 drops per 20-30ml eliquid. \r\n  \r\n**FLV SWEETNESS** was used at a high 1.25% to mimic the sugar syrup added to sorrel drink. \r\n  \r\n**STEEP:SNV-3 DAYS(I usually SNV it)**\r\n  \r\n**VG: 70%**\r\n  \r\nAs always, I humbly ask that you don't produce this for commercial gain, as it was shared in good faith. And if you like this please rate it. Your ratings are the only way us mixers know if we are doing a good job or not. Thanks so much & enjoy!\r\n  \r\n\r\n*I will include the recipe for this delicious drink below for anyone that wants to try it out. With the real drink, the longer you steep-the stronger the hibiscus flavor. I usually steep mine anywhere from 4 hours to 24 hours(it depends on my level of patience!).*\r\n\r\n  \r\n**Jamaican Sorrel Drink:**\r\n  \r\n\r\n•2 cups Dried Hibiscus Flowers\r\n  \r\n•1 finely chopped peeled fresh lime(I pulse mine in a food processor)\r\n  \r\n•1/4-1/3 cup fresh ginger(peeled), chopped fine(I pulse with a food processor)\r\n  \r\n•1 1/2 to 2 teaspoons of cinnamon sugar or 1 cinnamon stick\r\n  \r\n•4-6 Cracked Pimento(I usually place between paper towels and give them one good *whack* with a hammer. You dont want them crushed, like allspice powder--you just want to crack them open. These babies are potent).\r\n  \r\n•2 cups white sugar.\r\n  \r\n•2 cups of water\r\n  \r\n•10 cups water\r\n  \r\n•a *fine* sieve\r\n  \r\n•**OPTIONAL: 1/8-1/4 cup Jamaican Rhum**\r\n  \r\n\r\n**Directions:**\r\nPlace dried hibiscus flowers, ginger, lime, cinnamon sugar & allspice in large bowl or large pot & set aside.\r\n  \r\nIn one small pot, bring 2 cups of water & 2 cups of sugar to a boil and remove from heat. Allow this to cool. It will be a thick sugar syrup. \r\n\r\nIn large pot, bring 10 cups of water to a boil. Pour over hibiscus flower mixture and allow to steep at least 4 hours(if steeping overnight, place in refrigerator). \r\n  \r\nAfter steeped to your preference, stir sugar syrup(this is also when I add my rum) into mixture. Final mixture **must** be run through a fine sieve before being poured into a 1 gallon pitcher and chilled. A regular strainer will not work. If you can't wait until your sorrel drink gets cold(like me), serve over ice. I generally make mine at night, so I can enjoy a glass over ice before bed, knowing that by morning, my pitcher in the fridge will be *perfectly* chilled with no need of added ice cubes.\r\n  \r\nTrust me...you have never tried any drink like this. It is *highly addictive*!!
