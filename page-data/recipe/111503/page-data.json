The two apples blend together to make an apple filling with a touch of cinnamon.  Combining strawberry and rhubarb is something I personally prefer, because I like the taste combo.  I see red in that pastry so my red bits are the strawberry and rhubarb.  The Rhubarb Cuddle from DV has a nice creamy note to it that brings a softness to the crust...if you really like your deserts with custard drizzled over them add a touch more of your favorite custard to this to create that effect.  I didn't add sweetener because it didn't need it for me, but if I were going to sweeten this for folks who are used to more commercial style, I'd add 0.5% FW Sweetener or a touch of stevia.

Thank you Jennifer Jarvis for the original here. You‚Äôre mixing is insane, in a good way! This recipe showcases how to achieve flavour separation, blending fruit flavors while achieving amazing contrast, flavour consolidation and more. The only concentrate I replaced was OOO Pie ü•ß crust &amp; instead I used WF Croissant at 1%. While I respect it was a slight change I respect that the pastry layer will be possibly a little more buttery than the original yet at the same time, with that small change to the recipe it has helped me to appreciate mostly what Jen achieved here. Thank you to Dustin Freshly for mixing the original version of this first &amp; making me jealous to the point that I had to have a go at this to. This is what mixing is all about IMO. Sharing experiences, learning with from others &amp; being blown away with what can be achieved! Mix this!!! &#xD;\n5 1/2 stars out of 5 ‚≠êÔ∏è ‚≠êÔ∏è ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏èüí´&#xD;\n&#xD;\n"}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"111503","name":"Mixin Vixens Episode 21- Apple Pastry with Red Bits "}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
