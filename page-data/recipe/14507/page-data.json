They are incredible, sweet, creamy, buttery, but not overwhelming. I knew I had to recreate this in a vape. Super simple and super easy.\r\nGood to SnV but better with 3 days steep.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you don't have HS caramel you can use FLV in place, or FA. If using FA adding in .25-.5% FLV butterscotch helps creating a creamy, buttery caramel.","steep_days":"0","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:48:48.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"3172","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Banana Cream","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":3500},{"name":"Ban√≤ (banana)","vendor":"FA","millipercent":750},{"name":"Caramel","vendor":"HS","millipercent":1250},{"name":"Brown Sugar","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Meringue","vendor":"FA","millipercent":500},{"name":null,"vendor":null,"millipercent":0},{"name":"Rich Cinnamon","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":100}],"reviews":[{"user":"tw2k","text":""}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"14507","name":"brazilian bananas"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
