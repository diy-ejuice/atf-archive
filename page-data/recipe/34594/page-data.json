The lemon especially seems a bit watered down, both by the lower than average concentration of a fairly weak flavor, and by the cactus, which pokes out a bit without a more bitey lemon to overpower it. I would add some other lemon to this, like FE Lemon, VT Sour Lemon, or even just some FA Lemon Sicily, and maybe push the Boysenberry up to 3% as well.
