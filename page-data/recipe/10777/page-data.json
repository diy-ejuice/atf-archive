I used MF strawberry to tone down the Hickory smoke. Part of the Pineapple base is borrowed from ID10-T but instead of INW  I went with fw natural pineapple its similar and half the price but both work well at the same percentage. DO NOT MIX!!! Very terrible recipe, I will be making a new one in the future with totally different flavorings. But, If you did mix this please rate it 0 out of five stars that it deserves.
