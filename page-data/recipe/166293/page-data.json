I use Bitter Wizard in every recipe I mix, unless it’s meant to be very sweet. Bitter Wizard neutralizes the sweetness of the VG and uncovers the subtleties of the flavors. This is the first mix that’s entirely my own invention, and I’m very pleased with it. It tastes good without steeping, but the herb and spice flavors don’t show up until a week or two after you mix, so I recommend steeping it. Adding a little coconut makes for a good variation.","steep_days":"14","temperature":"0","recipe_score":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-10T19:01:23.000-05:00","best_vg":"50%","views":"801","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Lemon Sicily","flavor_id":"524","vendor":"FA","millipercent":5000},{"name":"Cucumber","flavor_id":"43","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Sicilian Mix (citrus Mix)","flavor_id":"508","vendor":"FA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Lemon Mix","flavor_id":"698","vendor":"INW","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Lime Tahity Cold Pressed","flavor_id":"581","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Zen Garden","flavor_id":"478","vendor":"FA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Pepper Black","flavor_id":"565","vendor":"FA","millipercent":250},{"name":"Cardamom","flavor_id":"498","vendor":"FA","millipercent":250},{"name":"Bitter Wizard","flavor_id":"464","vendor":"FA","millipercent":100}],"reviews":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"166293","name":"Dee Froot of All Knowledge"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
