Just wanted to try my hand at a profile I've been meaning to get to for a while.\r\n\r\nButterscotch Ripple\r\nHands down my favorite butterscotch. 4% felt right to be perceptible in this recipe, Without completely overtaking the donut.\r\n\r\nFA Zeppola, FLV Sweet Dough\r\nBoth contribute to the donut portion of the profile.\r\n\r\nFLV Vanilla Custard\r\nSmooth rich Vanilla. Perceptible but not cloying at 2.5%. A thoroughly thick body provides a wonderful mouthfeel as well.\r\n\r\nSalted Caramel\r\nUsed as a booster for the butterscotch.\r\n\r\nBrown Sugar\r\nPlays the role of blender/sweetener with a tiny contribution to mouthfeel.\r\n\r\nButter Cream\r\nMore diacetyl!! Gives me all's of it! Kidding. This finalizes the thick mouthfeel while contributing to the bakery sensation.\r\n\r\nFW Hazelnut\r\nNut tones for complexity but adds grain to the mix to give it a more perceptible donut texture.\r\n\r\nCAP Super Sweet\r\nJust a dash to add some lacking sweetness.\r\n\r\nSteep Time: 10 days","steep_days":"10","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"total_reviews":1,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:49:17.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"6903","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Butterscotch Ripple","vendor":"FW","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Zeppola","vendor":"FA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Vanilla Custard","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Sweet Dough","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":500},{"name":"Caramel (salted)","vendor":"FW","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Brown Sugar","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Butter Cream","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":500},{"name":"Hazelnut","vendor":"FW","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Super Sweet","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":500}],"reviews":[{"user":"Jscoggs81","score":"5","text":""}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"43863","name":"Butterscotch Custard Donut"}}}
