So in an effort to  add a hint of what might taste like bacon to a maple frosted donut, I added FA oak wood and FA Black Fire to add that smokey wood note to it. It works for a hint of bacon, more like donuts deep friend in bacon grease, rather than slices of bacon on it, but that was as close as I could get it.  It does need a 2 to 3 week steep. It's not a shake and vape for me.
