I took Wayne's Cheesecake layer and added the Blueberry Trinity. This juice is so fricken amazing. Blueberry Cheesecake was one of my earliest flavors when I quit smoking. I had searched and tried to recreate that for a long time and then this came to pass. It is easily three times better than the juice I was trying to make, by combining some simple layers from other recipes - you can do so much. Give this a mix, pull the Blueberry Trinity layer if you have not seen it before, it works very well in other ways.\r\n\r\nYou can shake and vape this - but if you put it in a closet for a couple weeks or so... you will enjoy it even more.","steep_days":"15 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T07:01:30.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"1987","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Bilberry","vendor":"FA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Blueberry","vendor":"FW","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Blueberry (extra)","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Meringue","vendor":"FA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Super Sweet","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":500},{"name":"Yes, We Cheesecake","vendor":"INW","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Yogurt","vendor":"FW","millipercent":3000}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"177716","name":"Booberry Cheesecake an Ode to DIYorDIE"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
