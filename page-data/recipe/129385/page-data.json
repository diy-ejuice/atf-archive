This concentrate is brighter than FA Forest Fruit.  \r\nFor my Cheesecake, I am using a Cheesecake Trinity, of **INW Yes We Cheesecake**, **Cap NY Cheesecake**, and **TPA Cheesecake Graham Crust**.  I have heard this called the Alfred Pudding cheesecake trinitY.  It works perfectly. ðŸ’•\r\nTo enhance the Forest Mix, I added thesome **VTA Raspberry Jam* and **FLV Boysenberry**, this is almost like a topping for the cheesecake.  \r\nEnjoy \r\n","steep_days":"5","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"updated_at":"2020-12-12T18:30:10.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"1449","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Forest Mix Berries","flavor_id":"8879","vendor":"VT","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Raspberry Jam","flavor_id":"9373","vendor":"VT","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Yes, We Cheesecake","flavor_id":"9272","vendor":"INW","millipercent":3000},{"name":"New York Cheesecake","flavor_id":"90","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Cheesecake (graham Crust)","flavor_id":"152","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Boysenberry","flavor_id":"614","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":250}],"reviews":[{"user":"8062282","text":"Really enjoying this.
