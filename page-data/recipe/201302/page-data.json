FA Anise and FW Black Licorice give it that subtle dark tone that goes well with the berries. \r\n\r\nAlso added .75% WS23 to really give that cooling, although not totally necessary as Berry cooler also has coolant in. \r\n\r\nEnjoy :)","steep_days":"1 (SNV)","temperature":"","recipe_score":0,"total_reviews":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T17:36:28.000-05:00","best_vg":"60%","views":"499","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Berry Cooler","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":7000},{"name":"Berryl (raspberry)","vendor":"FA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Blackcurrant","vendor":"FA","millipercent":750},{"name":"Black Licorice","vendor":"FW","millipercent":750},{"name":"Super Sweet","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":750},{"name":"Anise","vendor":"FA","millipercent":500},{"name":"WS-23","vendor":"OTHR","millipercent":750}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"201302","name":"Heisenburg2"}}}
