I blew through my first bottle so fast that I almost forgot that I made it because I was immersed in other projects. I'm glad I decided to circle back to it a few weeks later because I feel this is too good to not share.

This is insanely good. My tester disappeared in a few minutes, which is unusual, as I usually take some time getting to know what I'm vaping before just blowing through it. ID10-T is right. Anton and LA Watermelon are the perfect couple. The balancing act between these two is masterfully done here. I found that if I mix this 80/20 VG/PG, there's no throat hit whatsoever, even as a SNV, yet the flavour holds up without any problems. "},{"user":"ID10-T","score":"5","text":"First of all, this is a Strap-On recipe, one of the early ones, way ahead of the recent phenomenon. Stacks on Deck even sounds like \"Strap On Dick\" and on the off chance that wasn't intentional, it was at least a subconscious connection. Secondly, this is a mouthwatering, exciting fruity combo. Anton and LA Watermelon seem made for each other. It has some throat when fresh for me, but still delicious and more tart. However, let it steep for two weeks and it's juicy goodness that goes in super smooth like apple and watermelon jolly ranchers lubed up with a little strawberry syrup and is hard as hell to put down.
