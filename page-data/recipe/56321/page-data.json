Perfect for a hot day or as a palette cleanser.\r\n\r\nCapella's Cucumber is semi sweet and has the taste the inner portion of a ripe cucumber. It has some nice weight/mouthfeel, and is a delicious flavor.\r\n\r\nFlavorah's Cucumber is very refreshing and less ripe than Capellas offering. This flavor tastes more like the outer half of a less ripened cucumber. It to has a little sweetness, and helps round out Capella's Cucumber.\r\n\r\nFlavour Art's Lime Cold Pressed is crisp and refreshing. \r\n\r\nCapella's Lemon Lime helps round out the citrus note of this recipe.\r\n*This flavor was added after the initial posting.\r\n\r\nInawera Cactus adds extra succulence.\r\n*This flavor was added after the initial posting.\r\n\r\nTo finish off the recipe, I added Inawera's Natural Mint.

Lime is probably an even better pairing than the much more commonly seen melon with cucumber. I do wish it had a little more chill, like some Polar Blast on the end. As it stands, it kind of tastes like dressing up a glass of cucumber-lime gatorade with a slice of cucumber and a sprig of mint, but forgetting the ice. It also tastes like it could use a punchier lime, like maybe some VT Persian Lime instead of, or in addition to, the Cold-Pressed.  "}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"56321","name":"Cucumber Cooler"}}}
