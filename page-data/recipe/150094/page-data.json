After trying Joker we both found that it would be ideal to try and build a funnel cake around .   On the inhale  you get that bright sweet powder sugar  that transitions to that dark sweet fried dough with a  brown sugar apple cinnamon finish and a light fried coating  feeling that lingers.    Tested on a reload S RDA with a .17 alien coil at 60 watts\r\n\r\nGrowing up we would go to upstate New York for vacation,  always around the   time of the dutches county  fair.  This is where I had my first funnel cake  and every year  there after  .  So needless to say I have eaten a few in my time .    \r\n\r\nIn creating the fried  dough with a a nice dark crisp outer edge of a funnel cake  we found that   **Joker** with a little bit of  **sweet dough**   worked.   We tried several different options and by far this captured that mix of soft inside and crisp dark fried dough outside . \r\n\r\nAdding some mouth feel and some additional  accent notes  **apple  filling**  and  **cinnamon sugar** work well for that dark sweetness   that is needed for a funnel cake \r\n\r\nSo anyone  knows that the most important part of a funnel cake is the powder sugar .    When applied  to a warm  funnel cake  it  almost  becomes an icing.    **powder sugar** and   **FW sweetner**    create that  bright in  your  face, over the top   sweet powder note.  \r\n\r\nSo  the one thing that was missing here was that lingering coating of grease  after eating a funnel cake  this is what **golden butter** does for this mix  - just a touch believe  it or not  is enough to give that impression.
