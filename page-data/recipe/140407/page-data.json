Also adding some (FA) Pear for juiciness and that fruity sweetness.\r\n(TPA) Sour is added to lift up the whole recipy and make it fresher overall.\r\nSuper Sweet is entirely up to your liking, but I would say 0.25% is a minimum for these fruity vapes.\r\nDo enjoy and all the best ;)\r\nScrewdriver","steep_days":"3 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-11T07:44:32.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"1103","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Blueberry","flavor_id":"2076","vendor":"HS","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Blueberry","flavor_id":"1201","vendor":"FW","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Blueberry","flavor_id":"9202","vendor":"MB","millipercent":4500},{"name":"Pear","flavor_id":"411","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Shape Up Pear","flavor_id":"1531","vendor":"MB","millipercent":5000},{"name":"Cream","flavor_id":"604","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":800},{"name":"Super Sweet","flavor_id":"2384","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":750},{"name":"Sour","flavor_id":"336","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":750}],"reviews":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"140407","name":"Pear and Blue"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
