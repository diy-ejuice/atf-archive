This was my intro to Tobacco vapes.  I was hesitant to try but it's so rich, creamy, and delicious.  Not overly sweet.\r\n\r\nFrom their description:\r\n\r\n\"An RY4 (Vanilla, Caramel, Tobacco) shines in Sagamore, but is followed up with notes of bakery cinnamon, and a bit of cake and cream to give you a satisfying, full flavored experience.\"\r\n\r\nTFA RY4: Obvious choice here.  Delicious vanilla-y creamy tobacco.\r\n\r\nTFA VBIC: This flavor is so versatile and delicious.  It was pretty well detectable in Sagamore to me.\r\n\r\nCAP Cinnamon Danish Swirl: A solid bakery cinnamon pastry.  Fits well in this flavor profile and seemed to me to be the exact cinnamon note used.\r\n\r\nTFA Vanilla Cupcake:  This was my last addition that really brought the recipe together.  The picture and description really clued me in that there was some sort of cake ingredient, and after trying a few others, this was the closest.  It's *possible* they use FW Yellow Cake but I know that's a no-no in DIY for many.\r\n\r\nCAP Sugar Cookie: For that unmistakeably awesome mouthfeel and bakery richness that it brings.\r\n\r\nFW Butterscotch Ripple:  This one just adds to the depth of the RY4 and compliments and accentuates the Caramel.\r\n\r\nFA Soho: In my first iterations I found RY4 not to deliver enough of a tobacco note, and boosting it with a comparable counterpart did it some good.  \r\n\r\nCAP Butter Cream:  Adirondack juices are all so rich and creamy, and this really brought it all together with that wonderful aftertaste in the mouth of sweet buttery cream.","steep_days":"1 (SNV)","temperature":"500","recipe_score":5,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:49:04.000-05:00","best_vg":"81%","views":"2972","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Ry4 Double","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":5000},{"name":"Vanilla Bean Ice Cream","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Cinnamon Danish Swirl","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1250},{"name":"Vanilla Cupcake","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Sugar Cookie","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Butterscotch Ripple","vendor":"FW","millipercent":1250},{"name":"Soho","vendor":"FA","millipercent":750},{"name":"Butter Cream","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1000}],"reviews":[{"user":"AutomaticFailure","text":"I don't know what it is about this recipe, but I can't stop vaping it. I don't have TPA VC but I've been subbing it with CAP VC and it's just amazing. There is a nice creamyness with that hint of RY4/soho mix that just blends together perfectly. Works amazing in both tanks and rdas."}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"29877","name":"Sagacious"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
