She's  looking beautiful, feeling glamorous but keeping it real! This is my version of an Australian CWA (home made) Lamington.  For those overseas that aren't familiar this is a national icon recipe that is baked by many for good causes and steeped in tradition that makes up the fabric of a lot of our fundraising drives! \r\nIt is essentially a home baked sponge cake with a thin layer layer of cream through the middle and sometimes has a little jam as well. \r\nThen rolled in a thin layer of melted chocolate, then rolled again in a thin layer of shredded coconut. \r\n\r\nAs I like to do these days as I concentrate on making the best possible recipes I can, I immerse my self in the experience. That includes licking ,smelling, feeling and using all my senses to the fullest to try and best get the most authentic feel of a profile.\r\n I think I've done an alright job here but i welcome your comments. \r\n\r\nThe MB Bounty gives a great start to the top layer of this recipe with very genuine dairy chocolate and coconut notes.\r\nThe VT Chocolate has the feel of the same chocolate texture I experience on a lamington and works well with the MB.\r\nThe VT Coconut completes the mouthfeel of real shredded coconut and makes me roll my tongue over my teeth to get those little bits of coconut free. \r\nThe WF Princess cake is the hero here as she makes a gorgeous appearance in her leading roll. Her cake is on point and offers a lovely mouthfeel and a real homemade spongecake feel to the middle of this recipe! Thank You Princess! You saved the day!\r\nThen the princess found her charming in RF Deep Fried Spongecake  and together they made amazing love that brings the middle of this recipe up offering some more generous mouthfeel in this recipe.\r\nWhat more is needed you ask? The Cream! The FLV Cream has sat well in this recipe making you roll you tongue under looking for more beautiful cream. \r\n\r\nI hope you enjoy this as much as I did creating it, regardless enjoy the journey of mixing and stay Glamorous with a \"Glamington\" in your mouth! :) \r\n#DIY Downunder \r\n","steep_days":"3","temperature":"0","recipe_score":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-11T20:41:28.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"1115","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Bounty","flavor_id":"1570","vendor":"MB","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Chocolate Base (Clear)","flavor_id":"8851","vendor":"VT","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Coconut","flavor_id":"8855","vendor":"VT","millipercent":500},{"name":"Princess Cake SC","flavor_id":"9038","vendor":"WF","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Deep Fried Spongecake â€“ Super Concentrate","flavor_id":"7882","vendor":"RF","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Cream","flavor_id":"604","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":500}],"reviews":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"91061","name":"The Glamington"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
