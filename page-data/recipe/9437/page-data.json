Blueberry and blackberry do a magical wood sprite dance in the background, where the background is a meadow illuminated by fireflies looking for a date. Its a warm summer evening where the air is sweet with libidinous anticipation and it is time to gather around the fire.\r\nI included bilberry to add some musky aspects of that ever-so-sweet FW blueberry. The pear is present to help smooth the whole thing out (don't get me wrong, it still has a bit of a bite though and that is quite okay). The cactus is added to juice it all up a bit more (just as the right amount of booze can provide the right amount of lubrication for summer evening socialization). Plan the event a week in advance and the stars should align to gather this group. Just come prepared to have a good time and go with the flow!","steep_days":"7","temperature":"0","recipe_score":4.5,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:48:45.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"2867","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Blueberry","flavor_id":"1201","vendor":"FW","millipercent":3500},{"name":"Bilberry","flavor_id":"533","vendor":"FA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Pear","flavor_id":"411","vendor":"FA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Blackberry","flavor_id":"214","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Honeysuckle (pg)","flavor_id":"306","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Cactus","flavor_id":"647","vendor":"INW","millipercent":300}],"reviews":[{"user":"cdaniell30","text":"Finally, a good recipe using tfa blackberry.  I was starting to think there was just no way to make it work to my taste, but this turned out very nice indeed."},{"user":"flipper7","text":"I get blueberry and honeysuckle in the top note, cactus blends everything together while the blackberry gives it a darkness. The pear seems to brighten everything up. I can't say enough how awsome this recipe is. Yum! I added a bit of sweetner to mine. If you love fruit vapes this is a must try!!!!"}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"9437","name":"Black N Blue Suckle"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
