I had a craving for something different, something fresh, something fruity and out there. And the end result is a sweet and tangy fruit, with a bit of cream to help the palate digest this bizarre flavour. I've never had Goji Berries before, so it's extremely difficult to even explain how it tastes.  All I know is I can't stop vaping it!\r\n\r\nGoji Berry FW here is used as the main profile, I used Dragonfruit TFA and JF Sweet Strawberry to bend that Goji Berry a little to try and calm that bitterness whilst adding a touch of juiciness. \r\n\r\nThe creams here introduced are nothing new.  FA Meringue, TFA VBIC, and FA Vienna cream at these percentages just adds a base of cream that rounds everything together. \r\n\r\nJust mix, and enjoy.
