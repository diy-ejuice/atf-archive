I've managed to create its profile very well with sharp lemon curd followed by a creamy fluffy meringue finishing off with a buttery pastry crust.\r\n\r\nnotes...\r\n\r\nFW Lemon meringue pie\r\n\r\nI needed a profile to start with and this flavour seemed to work,its profile works very well with the other ingredients its lemon flavour is very bright and more forward and stronger than capellas offering. The meringue and pastry wasn't an issue at the time because i knew that could be worked on. The 3% was enough as a starting point without it taking over the recipe.\r\n\r\nFA Lemon Sicily/Capella Juicy Lemon\r\n\r\nThis was the most tricky part of the recipe theres so many lemons to chose from it was a minefield and completely had my headspinning. I tried them all in various percentages and combinations. some were to authentic taking on a sour aspect that didn't suit the profile. I knew i already had a good lemon within the FW lemon meringue pie,but it wasn't bright enough. Everyone knows FA lemon sicily is a fantastic lemon so i had to use it. I pushed it to higher percentage because the lemon was the main profile of dinner lady lemon tart. It's vibrant and not sour and it really started to work in what i was trying to achieve. Again this was probably enough to complete the lemon profile but i was concerned overtime it might fade so another lemon i really liked and thought it would complement is capella juicy lemon. Adding a small percentage just built on each other creating a bolder lemon with some added sweetness and juice. They really work well together and that was the lemon complete.\r\n\r\nFA Custard PI 3.14\r\n\r\nI needed something to create the curd aspect i tried alot of variations and to this day this is one aspect that still bugs me and is something i'll go back to. However this seems my best option so it stays for the time being. It seems to work very well with combining with the lemons and the pie. Its not a heavy custard like capella vanilla custard which i did try and to some degree it works,but it does add vanilla which i didn't want in the recipe. Custard pi gives it that creamy curd feel and the custard also has citrus notes which is a win win and really works well into the lemons to create a kind of curd.\r\n\r\nTFA Graham Cracker Clear/INW Biscuit/Capella Golden Butter\r\n\r\nThese 3 created the pastry base and worked excellent into the lemon meringue pie base. I love graham cracker clear and i think its in the original it lends to a nice creamy biscuit base and adding the biscuit at a lower percentage and the butter works its magic in creating a nice pastry filling.\r\n\r\nFA Meringue\r\n\r\nWe all now about this flavour it just works!!!! its in the original and it had to be in here. it's really forward in the original and pushing it to 1.5% is enough to give you that fluffy light mouthfull.\r\n\r\nSweetner\r\n\r\nI added 0.75% mainly down to it being mainstream juice the original is sweet so why not,a little of whats good doesn't hurt . I also feel it tones down the lemons and turns them more into a cooked lemon rather than a sour fresh squeezed lemon. you can leave it out should you wish its still great without it.\r\n\r\nTFA Bavarian Cream\r\n\r\nI added this at a small percentage just to combine the whole recipe ,it also works well into the custard and lemons and hopefully ups the curd aspect aswell as adding a little glue to the recipe and not drying it out.\r\n\r\nSTEEP TIME 3+ DAYS","steep_days":"7","temperature":"0","recipe_score":4,"updated_at":"2020-12-12T11:50:18.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"154158","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Custard","flavor_id":"484","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Golden Butter","flavor_id":"60","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":300},{"name":"Lemon Meringue Pie","flavor_id":"1335","vendor":"FW","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Lemon Sicily","flavor_id":"524","vendor":"FA","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Juicy Lemon","flavor_id":"79","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Graham Cracker Clear","flavor_id":"325","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Meringue","flavor_id":"530","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Bavarian Cream","flavor_id":"145","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Biscuit","flavor_id":"642","vendor":"INW","millipercent":500},{"name":"Sweetener","flavor_id":"339","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":750}],"reviews":[{"user":"damazone","text":"Caveat: I never tried Dinner Lady Lemon Tart so my review is based on the flavor of a lemon tart. I was so looking forward to this recipe and although it is a decent representation of a lemon tart, CAP Juicy Lemon is not the right lemon for me. It adds an overpowering lemon flavor and is quite astringen. It's like all I get. I understand you're going for that lemon zest flavor but lemon zest is sprinkled lightly over the top. The lemon zest in this recipe is the main note. Not good.. Also, a tart shell is more like a shortbread cookie instead of a graham and NIlla wafer combo. Don't get me wrong, it is a good recipe but for my tastes it has some rather large problems.","score":3},{"user":"s2k","text":"The newly released Lemon Cream wafer from CNV needs to be worked into this mix!! Pretty good, not close as we'd all liked it to be to the OG but we see why now. Flavors that aren't even public being used to make commercial liquids...You never had a chance to make this till now","score":4},{"user":"gilco","text":"Can't understand the hype. It's vapeable but far away from being the real \"Dinner Lady Lemon Tart\" which is by far much much more enjoyable. Tastes more than a cream or Pudding as a tart. Sorry, but this one is not spot on. And I had the direct comparison to the original Lemon Tart.","score":2},{"user":"cbunker35","text":"I dig it.","score":5},{"user":"groceryboy_jr","text":"Truly delicious, this will go in regular rotation for me.

Much respect.","score":5},{"user":"bjorama","text":"Some say Lemon Tart... I say it tastes like Trix Cereal..  And that might be the most spot on \"Trix\" flavor out there.

Pretty good off the shake but gets better and better each week:)","score":4},{"user":"Illegal_Immigrant","text":"I cannot imagine a more spot on Lemon Tart recipe. I mixed at 60/40 and the flavor is amazing as a SNV. I had to make a bigger batch as I went through my tester on day 1. I honestly don't care how much better it tastes like after a good steep, it's fantastic to me right now.

Can't stay out of it. So I mixed more so I will be able to discover what it develops into after a good steep.

You can pick out all the individual elements in this: the meringue, the buttery biscuit base and the creamy rich lemon filling.","score":5},{"user":"Whooptidooh","text":"This stuff is amazing as a shake and vape, and will have to mix 120 ml now since the 30 ml I mixed last night is clearly not enough to get through thos hot as fuck weekend.

Vaped some of it at the 1 week steep time, and wasn't too impressed. Came back to it at the 3 month mark, and it is absolutely AMAZING. The lemon somehow faded but then came back later in the steep and the meringue/custards all melded together into a perfect, sweet creamy base for it to sit on. I am truly impressed.","score":5},{"user":"Mr-G","text":"Great recipe,thanks","score":5},{"user":"Bradmaden","text":"Great recipe, dinner lady lemon tart was one of my favourite commercial juices, imo this is better, well worth the mix.

","score":5},{"user":"juiceIQ","text":"I ended up mixing this with FA Custard rather than FA Custard Pi, and despite the substitution, it is absolutely incredible.  Having never tried the original, I can't vouch for how closely this resembles it, but I can say that it is has the sweetness, zest, and texture required for a brilliantly compelling lemon desert profile.  Thank you for sharing the latest addition to my daily rotation.","score":5},{"user":"SweetPoisonKim","text":"Bloody brilliant!
