I honestly didn’t expect all of the flavors to shine through as much as they are, I normally don’t have great luck adding fa almond to tobaccos but it seems the wf ruyan is the one backing that up really well. This is really well balanced, but also very satisfying! Great job, and thank you for sharing!&#xD;\nEDIT: btw I forgot to add, I left out the sweetener as I don’t like adding sweeteners to tobaccos. Without it is still a very full and semi sweet flavor! ","score":5}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"175978","name":"Southern comfort "}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
