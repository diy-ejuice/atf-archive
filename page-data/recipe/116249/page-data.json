It's modeled after the tangy, sweet, and spicy frozen Mexican confection. Doesn't taste quite the same, but scratches the same itch for an icy spicy treat. I used both WS-23 and Polar Blast for a well-rounded inhale and exhale cooling, and lots of it.. For the spiciness of chamoy, there's FLV Heat and Apple Filling. The cinnamon in apple filling doesn't quite taste like cinnamon used so low with other strong ingredients, but it gives some body to the heat so it's not just disembodied capsaicin-type heat. The gooey apple part contributes to Jelly Candy and Sweet and Tart creating something reminiscent of the sweet and tangy part of chamoy. Jelly Candy also helps clean up some of CAP Sweet Mango's overripe nonsense. Super Sweet, like Apple Filling, also does double duty. Besides the obvious sweetening, it helps drag that Heat onto the lips and tongue and makes it linger, resulting a long-lasting fire and ice sensation. Finally the mangoes. I was surprised how much how much FLV Mango and CAP Sweet Mango it took stand up to all this other stuff, but with each new version I kept adding more and more until it worked. I also tried using VT Shisha Mango but it was too piney that didn't play well with the rest of the mix.  \r\n","steep_days":"15","temperature":"420","recipe_score":5,"total_reviews":3,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:50:25.000-05:00","best_vg":"69%","views":"3784","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"WS-23","vendor":"OTHR","millipercent":1750},{"name":"Polar Blast","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Heat","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Jelly Candy","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Sweet And Tart","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Super Sweet","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":500},{"name":"Mango","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Sweet Mango","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Apple Filling","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1250}],"reviews":[{"user":"kitu5","score":"5","text":"Made a batch of this before I went traveling, and what a treat to come home to. The tart appley taste(best description I can give of chamoyada...) meshes brilliantly with the mango, but that's only really detectable after the mind encompassing  sensation that is the burning cooling combination subsides entirely. Holy shit, is that sensation ever so addictive. This stuff is brilliant, and an absolute must try, for that intriguing sensation that'll turn your ass into a zombie, as well as the tasty treat lurking beneath the ooohOUCHoooh."},{"user":"shyndo","score":"5","text":"I think the reason I mixed this was purely because if apple filling does what I think it does in this then it's a fucking genius move. Well, it does and it deserves to be mixed just for the purpose of education. The fact that it's delicious and addictive is just a bonus. Well done sir."},{"user":"AlfredPudding","score":"5","text":"This recipe is an amazingly addictive mad science experiment. It will turn you into a fire-breathing ice zombie, and you won't be able to put it down. My favorite aspect is the perfectly balanced hot and cold sensation it leaves in your mouth. On the inhale your brain will cease function for approximately three seconds, while it attempts to decipher what is happening downstairs. After the perplexity calms down you will be left with a tiny bit more of the capsaicin burning than cooling, and there will be only one place to go for relief: back into the icy glass of spicy mangonada. Underneath this wonderful additive concoction there is a fantastic chamoy filled mango profile that shouldn't be forgotten. I've never had the IRL version, so I cannot discuss the authenticity. However, I struggle to think of a more perfect application of FLV Heat, WS-23, and Polar Blast. I struggle to think of anything since being converted into a zombie. Make sure you let this steep for a week or so to let the Apple Filling calm down, you can use that time to prepare yourself."}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"116249","name":"Spicy Icy Chamoyada Mangonada  "}}}
