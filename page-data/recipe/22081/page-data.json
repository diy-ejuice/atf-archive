What could be better?*\r\n  \r\n \r\n**NOTES:**\r\n  \r\n**TFA Banana Cream & JF Bavarian Cream:**\r\n  \r\n\r\nThese 2 flavorings complement one another so perfectly. With these 2 flavors, I was able to bring out the bananas perfectly, as well as develop an incredibly rich and thick pastry cream that is unmatched by any other concentrate I tried previously for this mix. I only needed 4% Banana Cream here. JF Bavarian Cream at 2.5% also made the Banana Cream a fluffy airy delight. Any more of either ingredient, and you throw everything out of balance.\r\n  \r\n**FA Soho:**\r\n  \r\nI have to admit, I had never tried FA Soho before this competition, and actually had to wait on this flavor's delivery before I could begin to formulate this particularly magical mix. This flavoring has a wonderful dessert RY4 scent that immediately piqued my interest. Delicate caramel, vanilla and light tobacco are its' features. Nice. I only used 2% here, as I only wanted to highlight the caramel/vanilla aspect. I've seen this flavoring used from 5-6%(considered \"high\" for Flavour Arts flavorings), but in this mix anything higher gave it a weird almost purple grape-like aftertaste. Bananas and grape? No thank you.\r\n  \r\n**FW Graham Cracker:**\r\n  \r\nI truly love this flavoring. It's so on point and realistic. This was the ONLY choice for my flakey, buttery graham base! Flavor West's Graham Cracker has all but erased any memory of TFA's version from my mind.\r\n  \r\n**TFA Dulce De Leche:**\r\n  \r\nIn every recipe I make, there's that ONE flavor that just enhances every aspect of each mix, making it totally unique. Dulce De Leche was that ingredient that just made everything pop! It adds so many things to a recipe and I'm surprised it's not used more frequently by DIYers. The gifts TFA's Dulce De Leche gave me in this mix were:\r\n  \r\nCreaminess(to enhance the pastry cream), buttery caramel(that caramel drizzle), and a hint of nuttiness(?) I can pick up that takes an ordinary graham crust from 'average' to 'outstanding'. I tried JF's version of DDL, but holy crapola--nothing \"works\" quite like TFAs version! TFAs Dulce De Leche is also a true \"bridge\" between flavorings in every sense of the word. And without this bridge, this mix would've been a confusing mess of flavors & sensations.\r\n  \r\n**FW White Chocolate:**\r\n  \r\nThe flavoring I couldn't live without. Flavor West hit this flavoring out of the park. It's creamy. And thick. So much thicker feeling than TFAs version which is partly why I chose FW over TFA here. I also chose this version due to its' nearly imperceptible hint of wafer. I could use that wafer to enhance my graham slightly(not that it needed enhancing, but it WAS a nice feature)!\r\n  \r\n**TFA Sweetener:**\r\n  \r\nI used the sweetener here at 1.5%, which for my recipes, I consider a bit high. But white chocolate is sweet. Even more so than milk chocolate. Sweetener was added solely to make the white chocolate shavings taste authentic.","steep_days":"4","temperature":"425","recipe_score":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-12T10:14:10.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"2886","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Banana Cream","flavor_id":"210","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Soho","flavor_id":"413","vendor":"FA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"White Chocolate","flavor_id":"1462","vendor":"FW","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Graham Cracker","flavor_id":"1297","vendor":"FW","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Dulce De Leche","flavor_id":"160","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Sweetener","flavor_id":"339","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Bavarian Cream","flavor_id":"4466","vendor":"JF","millipercent":2500}],"reviews":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"22081","name":"White Chocolate Banana Cream Pie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
