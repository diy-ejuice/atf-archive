It was this sweet tobacco that left a nutty vanilla scent just lingering in the air. It wasn't offensive like a cigarette, it was a smell I really enjoyed. It's one of those nostalgia scents, and when I smell it to this day it reminds me of him sitting on the porch just puffing away enjoying life. Prince Albert is a Burley tobacco, and until I tested FLV Red Burley, no other Burley flavors brought me back to that place in time, they all missed the mark of what Burley really was. So now that I found it, I give you...Prince Albert's ​Gold!\r\n","steep_days":"5","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:49:23.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"2232","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"555 Gold","vendor":"INW","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Butter Pecan","vendor":"FW","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Butterscotch","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":500},{"name":"Caramel","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":500},{"name":"Holy Vanilla","vendor":"DFS","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Red Burley","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Vanilla Swirl","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":4000}],"reviews":[{"user":"Deftohms","text":"I don’t know how this recipe hasn’t been reviewed yet.
