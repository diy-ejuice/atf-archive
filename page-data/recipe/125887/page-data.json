A luscious blend of creamy white chocolate & peppermint milk topped with whipped cream.  Mix some up for the holidays or just because you want to.  I also hear the FLV-Fire Cinnamon could be a nice addition to bring a bit of warmth to the mix.  I did not have any to try it out but if you do then you are welcome to give it a try.
