So I should have said this when I first posted recipe. There is no coconut specific flavors in this. I get light coconut notes from cheesecake graham crust. So if you don't get these notes than this is more of a toasted almond milk. Enjoy\r\n\r\nCheesecake graham crust:\r\nThis is the coconut flavor with thick cream. \r\n\r\nCream fresh:\r\nThis boost milky aspect of recipe. \r\n\r\nAlmond/marzipan:\r\nThis combo is a sweet almond. \r\n\r\nToasted marshmallow:\r\n\r\nThis adds that toasted taste to coconut and also adds overall sweetness to mix. \r\n\r\nTell me what you all think\r\n\r\n\r\n","steep_days":"3 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"updated_at":"2020-12-12T11:50:45.000-05:00","best_vg":"75%","views":"2227","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Cheesecake (graham Crust)","flavor_id":"152","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Almond","flavor_id":"528","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Cream Fresh","flavor_id":"540","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Marzipan","flavor_id":"467","vendor":"FA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Toasted Marshmallow","flavor_id":"340","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":500}],"reviews":[{"user":"MrEx","text":"I've been vaping this almost exclusively for two years.&#xD;\nRecently I used it as a base for a pitachio and a coconut vape...both came out dry till I added TFA Vanilla Swirl...now perfect.","score":5},{"user":"Seef","text":"It does what it says on the tin. However, I'm one of those who don't taste coconut in Cheesecake Graham Crust. So to me it's an almond milk. But it's very good. I might experiment with adding a bit of coconut to see what it does, but as it is, it is a very delicate and smooth almond milk that is lightly sweetened. It is very balanced, Almond on the inhale, the marzipan on the exhale, with the toasted marshmallow bringing a slightly robust and darker sweetness and the cheesecake and cream fresh being a solid cream to support it. There is no dairy note, but there isn't in almond milk anyway :). I wouldn't call it thick. But I have issues with tasting thickness anyway, so I can't comment on that.
