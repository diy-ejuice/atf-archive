This is just a Tribute, an apple bread pudding a-la mode\r\n\\\\\\Mixed at: 70vg\\30pg\r\n\\\\\\Steep Time: 10-14 days\r\nUpdate: A slight decrease in FW Hazelnut and bump to dragonfruit helps it blend in much better with the other notes in this recipe. Give it a new mix!\r\n\r\nThis is my chef-d'oeuvre, my opus, the main reason I started mixing over 2 years ago, and would be my ADV if I had to be stuck with just one profile. This recipe is my tribute to one of my favorite juices of all time that was made by a friend who worked in a vape shop. \r\n\r\nDuh Apple Cinnamon:   \r\nFor me my favorite go to for an apple cinnamon combo has been a combination of FA Fuji, TFA Dragonfruit, and CAP Cinnamon Danish Swirl (Thanks ID10T for your Cinnamon Roll Apple Danish). For a long time I actually didn't use TFA Dragonfruit in this recipe because I really didn't feel that it was needed. The issue I always ran into with this recipe is after about 3 weeks steep  you would still be able to taste the apple cinnamon, but FLV Vanilla Pudding became too forward in the profile. TFA Dragonfruit serves two purposes: 1.) To help boost the apple cinnamon in the recipe to keep it strong and 2.) To help FLV Vanilla Pudding stay in check.\r\n\r\nDat Bread Pudding:   \r\nThe main flavors in our bread pudding base are a combination of TFA AP and FLV Vanilla Pudding. AP helps give our bready notes with FLV Vanilla Pudding making up a portion of the pudding. I spent a long time trying to find the sweet spot for FLV Vanilla Pudding because of the issue of long steep times mentioned above. For the longest time it was at 2.5%. Going down to 2% the AP would be too forward, 2.5, it took over the Apple Cinnamon, so I eventually arrived at 2.25%. CAP Sweet Cream serves a two purposes in this recipe as well: 1.) To support our bread pudding base and 2.) to help support our ice cream that's on top.\r\n\r\nDis Ice Cream:   \r\nFrom CAP, to LB, to HS, to all of the other Vanilla Bean Ice Creams out there, TFA's VBIC is still my favorite. At 3% it works great in this profile and gets just a little kick from CAP Sweet Cream. For Pepper tasters I would suggest swapping TFA for CAP VBIC 1:1, but honestly it's just not the same.\r\n\r\nDafuck is FW Hazelnut doing in here?:    \r\nLong after my friend stopped working at his shop he gave me some clues as to what he used in his recipe, and one of them is that he used a Hazelnut flavor in it. FW Hazelnut really does an amazing job anyway in flavor, and it really blends well with our bread pudding base and the ice cream.   \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMan, I just love this recipe, after so many iterations and and tinkering I think this is as good as it will ever be. It's sweet, it's bready, it's creamy, it's nutty, it's got apple cinnamon in it, what more could a guy who loves this profile ask for? With fall coming up I think this could easily slide right into your rotation. I hope you are willing to give it a try and leave me a review. I'd love to hear feedback on what you think.
