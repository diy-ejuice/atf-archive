I added just enough Juicy Lemon to  accent the grape and brighten it a bit. A little dragonfruit to smooth and sweeten, and Supersweet for the cup of sugar sweetness.\r\n\r\nFeel free to adjust the sweetness to your taste , or add Koolada or WS23 to chill it down a bit","steep_days":"1 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":4.5,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:49:55.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"2501","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Grape Soda","vendor":"FW","millipercent":8000},{"name":"Juicy Lemon","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":500},{"name":"Dragonfruit","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Super Sweet","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":750}],"reviews":[{"user":"BryanF","text":"I was looking for somewhere to use my grape soda, this one hits the spot.
