Foreground is the fruit mix (here normal People will probably taste strawberry) and on the backend it gives a super nice tropical vibe with the pineapple + coconut combination. I really enjoyed this vape and the missing star is not because any lack of taste but my inability to rate this accurate due to not tasting strawberry."},{"user":"cdaniell30","score":"4","text":"I subbed TPA coconut for coconut extra and this still turned out excellent.  I got some coconut extra while this was waiting to be tasted, so I'll mix the legit version later on.  "},{"user":"G-pots","score":"5","text":"Wow!!
