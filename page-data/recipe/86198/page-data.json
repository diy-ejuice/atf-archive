It's a rich tobacco with a tasty aromatic feeling to it. I'm all about the aromatics, so in my 2am dazed fog, I thought that INW plum would fit the bill perfectly. It turned out better than I expected in all honesty. Plum mostly added a slightly darker note to the mix along with a touch of tart.&#xD;\n&#xD;\nFor a tobacco base, this recipe is superb on it's own, or something you can easily add a couple other flavors to in order to give you own touch to it. Thank you for this recipe Fear!","score":5}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"86198","name":"Arabian Night's"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
