The cooling compliments the peach so well. I'm gonna remix this one in the summer. Thanks for sharing. "},{"user":"Ilbvaping","text":"Excellent mix!! Great peach flavor, great balance of sweet syrupy and coolness!! Cant put it down!! "},{"user":"DIYDownunderPippa","text":" I have mixed the \"Developed Version\" of Peach Slush now and it is good. The texture of the ice was under sold by the crew IMO on today's show rather it was about the syrupyness that was talked about more. It was near unvapable at my preferred setting of 60w on a single SST 0.2ohm coil on a recurve rda because it was way to heavy with cold. I had to drop it down to not only get something with flavour but to avoid my tonsils &amp; nasal passage from freezing. At 45w the flavour came through after i rested my throat will some water and around 5 mins. Although still very very cold the texture of the ice became present and the honest flavour of the peach started to come through. After around 10 puffs a slight medicinal note seems to linger that I can only guess is from the lack of steeping &amp; I'm guessing may have been from the nectarine. None the less it wasn't overly offensive and I was certainly sold with the flavour and authenticity of the overall flavour of the profile. I think for some people the challenge will be to overcome that Polar Blast &amp; WS-23 coldness that is blasted at you in this. The texture (mouthfeel) of the granules of ice by bouncing off the citrus soda is a stroke of genius here. IMO the peach could be better but that's just me. Before I go on, I love to be challenged and challenge myself and enjoy when others create a better mix than I think I can or mix something that I normally wouldn't, as is the case here. Rather I was inspired and challenged myself to see how I would go about mixing this profile to challenge myself. So being frank and honest, how does my recipe compare? I'm not just going to say it's better to \"big note\" myself but for my pallette and olfactory I enjoy it only fractionally more than the developed recipe. Why? The peach is better IMO due to the use of a slightly better use of flavours that I enjoy. I used VT Sorbet base and there is a slight watermelon back note and due to single flavour tests of working with that my head goes to that but it is faint and I think most wouldn't notice it if it wasn't pointed out. The combination and use of Cap Lem Lime with the Flavorah Ice, Flavorah Frosting &amp; VT Sorbet certainly sells the granular ice mouthfeel on a par with the \"Developed recipe\" but also compliments the fruits just as well. Honestly if it wasn't for that \"cold blast\" and that slight lingering note I suspect from the nectarine (should go after a steep )in the \"Developed\" peach Slush recipe I would say that they are both equally as good. In my version the flavour is more present and balanced due to not being overpowered with nasal freeze. If I was to rate the boys (only my opinion, judge for your palette &amp; olfactory!) out of 5 stars I would say 4 stars. If I was to rate my version honestly I would say 4.5 stars. At the end of the day it's about what pleases ourselves and what inspires us to keeps us from those stinkies with this wonderful craft of DIY eLiquid creation. Do It Your Way! &amp; thanks guys of the developed crew for having a show like you do even if it's only 90% DIY lol, You gotta leave space for some fun right, keep on keeping it fun!! :) My version: http://tjek.nu/r/wEd9"}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"162177","name":"Peach Slush | Developed"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
