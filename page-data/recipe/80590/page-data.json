It doesn’t lend a Apple flavour when used low but more a buttery crumbled pastry.\r\n\r\nFa cookie \r\n\r\nThis compliments the Apple pie perfectly adding another level to the Apple pie adding texture and a deeper baked pastry.\r\n\r\nCap lemon meringue pie\r\n\r\nOriginally I loved fw lemon meringue pie but unfortunately I feel this is a more balanced profile it doesn’t shout lemon but it’s other properties fit perfectly in what I’m achieving so it’s a given and a perfect base to the recipe to build around.\r\n\r\nFe lemon \r\n\r\nIf only this was available first time round it’s a perfect lemon which doesn’t fade much when bumped up in percentages. It sits wonderfully in the recipe and I wouldn’t use any other lemon in making this profile. It works great in dessert recipes but may not work in other profiles.\r\n\r\nCap butter\r\n\r\nWouldn’t be a pastry recipe without a little butter it adds additional properties to the pastry as well as curding the lemon.\r\n\r\nFa meringue \r\n\r\nIt was in the original and it returns this time round. It’s a remix of the original dinner lady and it’s profile states meringue so it has to stay. However this time less is more 1% sits perfectly and melds together the whole recipe.\r\n\r\nCap super sweet \r\n\r\nA Remix needs some commercial sweetness.","steep_days":"5 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":4,"updated_at":"2020-12-12T18:29:36.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"21213","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Apple Pie","flavor_id":"551","vendor":"FA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Cookie","flavor_id":"490","vendor":"FA","millipercent":750},{"name":"Golden Butter","flavor_id":"60","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":500},{"name":"Lemon","flavor_id":"1655","vendor":"FE","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Lemon Meringue Pie","flavor_id":"84","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Meringue","flavor_id":"530","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Super Sweet","flavor_id":"2384","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":500}],"reviews":[{"user":"MixerMatt543","text":"Love this recipe!&#xD;\nOh I didn't have cap lemon meringue, just tfa","score":5},{"user":"BigRed","text":"not into lemon but this is a good one ","score":4},{"user":"Torill","text":"Perfection!","score":5},{"user":"WalleBiela","text":"Absolutely fantastic right of the shake. Same opinion on the crust note. I think it comes from the CAP Lemon Meringue Pie. And even as that note fades after mere houres this is by far my favorite lemon bakery vape. Will make it lot of times. Thank you .","score":5},{"user":"DumHed","text":"Excellent, the first few vapes of this I got a wonderful crust note, but now I cant taste the crust at all.

Dont get any harshness or chemical notes that i have gotten from some lemons. Excellent job and thanks for sharing.

The FE lemon is a shining star here, and there's a wonderful complexity to the end result. It's been in my rotation for months now - and my friends love it too.

But one of my top 5 favorite premium e-liquids is lemon tart by verdict Vapors and this blows that out of the water! If you like lemon vapes this will be your ADV for sure!","score":5},{"user":"BigCloud","text":"Great recipe, well ballanced and really delicious!! At first I had my doubts about the 3% FE Lemon, but it fits in perfect. Another ADV for me! Thanks ;)","score":5},{"user":"kindground","text":"Excellent recipe. This nails the profile. I had to order CAP LMP but I think it's worth it. The balance between crust, meringue, custard and lemon is perfect. The lemon is very forward in the best way but in perfect balance with the other elements. Great job! ","score":5},{"user":"AlfredPudding","text":"This is my absolute favorite lemon pastry recipe. It builds perfectly on the lemon meringue pie base, adding the necessary flavors to take it from good to great. The combination of apple pie's crust flavor and cookie gives the recipe a perfect mellow crust quality. I had to pick up FE Lemon to make it, and I'm glad I did. The lemon in it is sweet and not overpowering, and fits in this profile amazingly. I definitely recommend this to anyone that enjoys a lemon dessert, it will not let you down. ","score":5},{"user":"corvape","text":"Excellent recipe. I am so glad I got FE Lemon for this recipe.  I personally prefer this one over V1. Flavors are perfectly balanced making for a perfect lemon bakery recipe.

Maybe it should be called something else, because you are right, there is no comparison!","score":5},{"user":"Asire","text":"For me this is the best Iteration of this profile and even puts the Dinner Lady original in the shadows. &#xD;\nSmooth, well layered liquid, awesome lemon taste that perfectly complements the cake base. &#xD;\n&#xD;\nThe last part really is what impresses me because most lemon bakery liquids cant manage to combine the mostly sharp fruity lemon flavors into a full bodied bakery. &#xD;\nThanks for this outstanding recipe Daren ","score":5},{"user":"HerrHut","text":"","score":5},{"user":"dwinans","text":"Well crafted recipe that stands on it's own (as compared to V1).  I really enjoyed this quite a bit, 30 ml gone in 4 days!","score":5},{"user":"RdaJunkie","text":"I know it’s not supposed to be compared to the original but damn this is better. The out of box thinking with apple pie sends this recipe to another level. Not only should you mix and enjoy this but also learn from it, that it can pay off to take risks and push the boundaries of what we know. Amazing and inspiring recipe Mr. Cole","score":5}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"80590","name":"Lemon tart remixed "}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
