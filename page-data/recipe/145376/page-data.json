Pizza and dawg has succeeded in using HHGv1 (R.I.P) with something a RY4 normally don't go with. It's nicely balanced recipe and oddly, that VT Shisha Lime pairs perfectly with HHGv1. The cheesecake trinity does what it does and just fits. This is one dirty lime cheesecake and I love it. A good solid old school eyemakepizza recipe, before he turned into a self-loathing baby-making ice cream lunatic.","score":5}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"145376","name":"Lime Why Ar Cheesecake"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
