It is quite difficult to buy the JAM Monster series in Germany.\r\nI've heard the hype around this liquid and researched the recipe. \r\nAfter some attempts, I can say that I wouldn't buy the original because I like this version and it's satisfying for my tastebuds.\r\n\r\nThis recipe is in no way a clone. I just got inspired by the profile.\r\n\r\n","steep_days":"3","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T14:14:06.000-05:00","best_vg":"75%","views":"3812","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Succulent Strawberry","vendor":"OSD","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Cereal 27","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Custard Premium","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Strawberry Jam with Toast","vendor":"RF","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Super Sweet","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":500},{"name":"Dx Peanut Butter","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":4000}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"161099","name":"Jam Monster - PB & Jam Strawberry (Remix)"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
