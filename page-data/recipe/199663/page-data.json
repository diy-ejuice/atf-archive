But it tastes good, some I’m not really complaining. The strawberry and lemon are indeed just hints, like a small amount of lemon added to the cheesecake and maybe some strawberry puree added as well, or strawberry bits inside it, rather than a full-on strawberry topping. Has a lingering sweet finish that’s very nice, even without sweetener. This isn’t exactly what I personally want from a cheesecake, I’d prefer a heavy amount of a distinct topping, but it’s probably exactly what someone else wants, and I can’t find anything wrong with it. It’s a lighter, fluffier type of cheesecake but clearly a cheesecake, with a solid amount of crust, though the crust is a bit mixed in or emulsified, like a chewed up bite rather than tasting the layers separately, which also isn’t a bad, since that crust can lend itself to a drier finish if it’s separated while this is plenty moist throughout. &#xD;\n"}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"199663","name":"Cheesecake Love - eJuice fairy "}}}
