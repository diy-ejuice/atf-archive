Tried all the bubblegum flavors out there & many of them just don't cut it.\r\nThe flv, inw combo gives a authentic tasty bubblegum flavor. \r\nAdding a hint of inw's shisha Banana pushes it even closer. \r\nA touch of cap's sweet Strawberry for its sweetness & candied like feel. \r\nTfa's Marshmallow adds to the fullness of the vape & takes some of the dry harchness a bubblegum gives away.\r\nThis all on a bed of Vanilla Swirl results in a delicious full bubblegum vape.\r\n\r\nGreat as shake & vape, yet better after 2 days.\r\n\r\nPlease comment if you mix it up.

I am pleased enough to come back and let folks know that this stuff is delicious authentic and easy on the palette enough to be an ADV. You nearly sense the powdery paper wrapping and feels like blowing bubbles on the exhale! Well done! *UPDATE 2/15/19 - This is my new all time favorite recipe! It's so satisfying in so many ways, it's just an exceptional profile, thanks!"},{"user":"MotherPunker","text":"Just mixed up a sample of this last night and must say, its fabulous!  Went though the whole sample already and will be mixing more.   Its very juicy &amp; authentic classic bazooka joe type gum, exactly what I was craving.  Its so authentic that I almost felt like I had to chew the vapor.  I did up the super sweet to 1% but just because I felt that, in order to get closer to that very sugary bubblegum, this was one of the few recipes that deserved it lol.  Though this is a personal preference.    Oh &amp; I didn't find it harsh at all.   Thank you kindly for the recipe :)"}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"86670","name":"Bubblicious"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
