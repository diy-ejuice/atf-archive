I mix low % wise, so you may need to increase this. \r\n\r\nI usually add pear to apple to give it texture. This recipe, I added apple to the pear to make it more juicy and add body. FLV apple is nice because it's more like the actual fruit opposed to most flavorings that taste more like apple juice. I added the FA Graham because I had not used it before and it's supposed to be a nice thick unseasoned graham crust. I added the CAP Cinnamon sugar because it's a nice blend that is lightly sweet and the cinnamon is not overpowering. FLV Pastry zest helps with the crumbly texture and adds the citrus zest that compliments most fruits. The components for the crust apparently work in many different applications. (cheesecake, esp) \r\n\r\nThis one Mixin Vixens recipe of the month and I quite like it. \r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6NA5dUkgoSQ","steep_days":"5","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T02:16:47.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"1136","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Apple","flavor_id":"4364","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":500},{"name":"Cinnamon Sugar","flavor_id":"8741","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":750},{"name":"Graham Crust","flavor_id":"9950","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Pastry Zest","flavor_id":"8562","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":250},{"name":"Ripe Pear SC","flavor_id":"9040","vendor":"WF","millipercent":1500}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"134961","name":"Cinnamon Pear Tart"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
