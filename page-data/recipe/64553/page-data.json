Having said that time for the truth.... The inspiration for this mix came from accidentally mixing some of my Prapple Bacco into a squonk bottle almost half full of @rageisalotofwork https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/23772#sadlad_toast_crunch_by_rageisalotofwork\r\n\r\nThis is to me a fall vape, it evokes some of the fondest memories of mine with my father and uncles, shotguns, flannel, pheasants and food. This is NOT a tobacco vape, it is a woodsy dessert ensemble that changes a bit to more desert or more woodsy and even a good tobacco hint depending on wattage and airflow.\r\n\r\nIt got me thinking for a combo of the two, while that accidental mix was really good I felt the abundance of bottom of the bowl thickened sweet milk was too much for the tobacco.\r\n\r\nFLV Red Burley and Turkish for the tobacco note in Prapple.\r\nFLV Granny Smith and Toffee for the combo that I loved there.\r\n\r\nFrom Rage's Sadlad we have the bakery cinnamon components leaving out the cereal (for now)\r\nI added FLV Cream in to give the entire recipe some cohesiveness and bring everything together limiting to 1% to keep it from going creamy again.\r\n\r\nI have done several versions of this over a few weeks. I keep coming back to my original idea of the modified mix of the two recipes. Raising the tobaccos to get them to break through more made the mix too heavy, lowering the desert profile made the mix weirdly watery.","steep_days":"1 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"updated_at":"2020-12-12T11:51:13.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"7269","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Red Burley","flavor_id":"4355","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Turkish Tobacco","flavor_id":"4429","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1200},{"name":"Granny Smith","flavor_id":"4423","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Toffee","flavor_id":"4425","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1200},{"name":"Cinnamon Danish Swirl","flavor_id":"35","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Toasted Marshmallow","flavor_id":"340","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Cream","flavor_id":"604","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Pie Crust","flavor_id":"179","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":750}],"reviews":[{"user":"NickG","text":"This was a nice surprise. Wasn't sure what to expect when I saw the ingredients, but I liked the idea behind it and also all of Fear's recipe's, so I figured this was worth a shot. Hard to really describe what it tastes like, but somehow it encapsulates fall better than any other recipe I've tried and beyond that doesn't something that is in my opinion supremely artistic. Take an idea, a feeling, and translate that into a medium that other people can experience and enjoy. Not sure if this is an all day vape, but it certainly is a work of art. Thank you for sharing this great recipe with us !","score":5},{"user":"Gordo","text":"I love the finish,how just the slightest taste of toffee and granny smith apple lingers on my lips... 5 stars, excellent flavor...","score":5},{"user":"RdaJunkie","text":"I can’t say anything the others haven’t already, other than this recipe gets me hard ","score":5},{"user":"SlashaLO","text":"I hate you with how good this really is. I'm a YUGE aplle cinnamon lover and this was just too damn good. I vaped it off the shake and even then, its very balanced and great. This is a perfect fall adv as well. It's not really a \"tobacco\" but just...I don't know how to describe it. I feel like a good Robert Frost poem would do it justice though. ","score":5},{"user":"TamVapes","text":"This is an excellent fall ADV. The combination of the apple and CDS with tobaccos gives such a pleasant taste.  A surprise for sure. Another great recipe. Thanks for sharing. ","score":5},{"user":"ID10-T","text":"Holy hell, this stuff is off the charts!!! Fear showed this recipe to me Saturday night and I'm vaping it now with about a 24 hour steep. At the time, I had no description at all, only the recipe. The feedback I gave him before he published it is suspiciously close to the description. \"It tastes like one of those rare occasions when we get winter-esque weather for Thanksgiving. That's how perfect for fall it is... Doesn't really come across as a 'tobacco' juice to me but rather something more abstract... It's like a manly, outdoorsy cinnamon bakery... Like going dove or quail hunting on a crisp fall morning and stopping to snack on a still-warm cinnamon bun that was packed for you.. Feels weird vaping this and looking down to see a black t-shirt and not red flannel... I'm not saying it tastes like a cinnamon bun, I'm saying it tastes like all of that put together. The red flannel shirt, the shotgun hunting, the fall, the morning, the fresh cinnabunn, the fact that someone (little lady) packed it for you, it tastes like all of that... Unless it steeps into something unpleasantly weird after five or six days and doesn't come back to being amazing after two weeks, stop fucking with it... I think I love you.\" Those were my exact words, with ellipsis representing breaks when I stopped messaging him to suck down some more Pheasant Ridge and leaving out some boring discussion about the rise and fall of CAP CDS. Anyway. Abuela, Cardinal, and now this. Marry me, Fear. We'll make beautiful recipes together and live happy ever after.
