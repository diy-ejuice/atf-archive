Just fuckin wow.\r\nWe get a Rhubarb Jam/ Vanilla Custard\r\n\r\nIn a small village, there once lived a girl with the name Barbara.\r\n\r\nAnd Barbara was known everywhere for her wonderful rhubarb cake.\r\n\r\nTherefore she was also called Rhabarberbarbara (Rhubarb Barbara).\r\n\r\nRhabarberbarbara noticed quickly that she could make money with her cakes and opened a bar: The Rhabarberbarbarabar (Rhubarb Barbara Bar).\r\n\r\nThe Rhabarberbarbarabar went well and quickly had regular customers.\r\n\r\nAnd the three most well-known of them, three Barbarians, came so often to the Rhabarberbarbarabar to eat Rhabarberbarbara’s delicious rhubarb cake that they were called the Rhabarberbarbarabarbarbaren (Rhubarb Barbara Bar Barbarians) for short.\r\n\r\nThe Rhabarberbarbarabarbarbaren had beautiful beards. And when the Rhabarberbarbarabarbarbaren wanted to maintain their Rhabarberbarbarabarbarbarenbärte (Rhubarb Barbara Bar Barbarians Beards), they went to the barber.\r\n\r\nThe only barber that could handle such a Rhabarberbarbarabarbarbarenbart (Rhubarb Barbara Bar Barbarians’ Beard) was called Rhabarberbarbarabarbabarenbartbarbier (Rhubarb Barbara Bar Barbarians Beard Barber).\r\n\r\nThe Rhabarberbarbarabarbarbarenbartbarbier also liked to go to the Rhabarberbarbarabar. And in addition to eating Rhabarberbarbara’s delicious rhubarb cake, he liked to drink a beer, which he ceremoniously called Rhabarberbarbarabarbarbarenbartbarbierbier (Rhubarb Barbara Bar Barbarians Beard Barber Beer).\r\n\r\nThe Rhabarberbarbarabarbarbarenbartbarbierbier could only be purchased at a very specific bar.\r\n\r\nAnd the person selling the Rhabarberbarbarabarbarbarenbartbarbierbier at the counter of the Rhabarberbarbarabarbabarenbartbarbierbierbar (Rhubarb Barbara Bar Barbarians Beard Barber Beer Bar) was named Bärbel.\r\n\r\nAnd so the Rhabarberbarbarabarbarbaren, together with the Rhabarberbarbarabarbabarenbartbarbier and Rhabarberbarbarabarbarbarenbartbarbierbierbarbärbel (Rhubarb Barbara Bar Barbarians Beard Barber Beer Bar Bärbel), went to the Rhabarberbarbarabar to eat Rhabarberbarbara’s delicious rhubarb cake and to clink a glass of Rhabarberbarbarabarbarbarenbartbarbierbier.\r\n\r\nProst!","steep_days":"1 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T17:36:19.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"579","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Rhubarb","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Sweet and Sour Rhubarb SC","vendor":"WF","millipercent":2250},{"name":"Jammy Berry","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":500},{"name":"Boysenberry Raspberry SC","vendor":"WF","millipercent":650},{"name":"Vanilla Custard 2","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":5500},{"name":"Super Sweet","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":250}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"191060","name":"Rhabarberbarbara"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
