I vape it often, and I like it, but even after a steep, it's missing depth. In the chase for popcorn, this is very caramel, or butter finger popcorn, which I enjoy, but not all the way to a corn bread or a pudding. It's nice and sweet and a good vape."},{"user":"Ebc88","score":"5","text":"Ive tried 3 different corn bread style vapes this is the only one i can actually taste something that reminds me of corn "},{"user":"Aritria","score":"5","text":"I gotta say Wayne you crushed this.  The OG Eliquid is HEAVY and a coil gunker.  This however, I mixed this as written with the exception of the super sweet (used erythritol instead at 3 drops per 30 ml).  Shake n vape it had a plastic flavor but day 2 - BANGER.  I think you got this just right and better than the OG. If you wanted more of the OG heavy syrup, maybe bump up that custard to 1% but I actually PREFER this to the original.  Thank you!"}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"68228","name":"Live Mixing: 10/13 Sweet Corn Bread Puddin Pops"}}}
