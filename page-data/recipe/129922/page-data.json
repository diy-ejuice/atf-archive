No strawberry degradation at all.\r\n\r\nI am one of those unlucky people who rarely taste strawberries, i can guaranty, in this recipe, i do taste them strawberries!

Love that you didn’t make it syrupy sweet so I can taste the layers. Excellent job!"},{"user":"MotherPunker","score":"5","text":"really enjoyed this, made up a small bottle before i went out of town, it was in my pocket so the warmth prob helped but I vaped it after a few days and found it exceptional. I can taste all the layers, the cake, cream and strawberries.   I subbed VT vanilla cream as I didn't have WF, dont know if that made a huge difference.  Making a bigger bottle now so I can see how it steeps!  thanks for the recipe :)"},{"user":"mlNikon","score":"5","text":"This tastes pretty close to the picture.
