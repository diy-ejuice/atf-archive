I've worked on this recipe for months and finally feel ready to release it, so here goes! The inhale is where the banana really shines, sitting in a smooth, thick, and simple custard. Definitely heavier than a banana pudding. On the exhale, the banana sticks around for a bit and then gets taken over by the peanut butter flavor - a slightly sticky but all natural tasting PB. TPA PB is used to get the texture, but to me the flavor is just redskin peanuts - and a PB made of peanut skin is nasty AF. So Hangsen is used at low percents to provide a natural, peanut (no skin) taste that covers up the flavor from TPA. Alright guys, that's it! Please let me know what you think in the comments, I can take the heat if you think it's complete shit. ;)  ","steep_days":"8","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"total_reviews":3,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:49:09.000-05:00","best_vg":"65%","views":"3142","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Banana","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Peanut Butter","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2750},{"name":"Vanilla Custard","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":3250},{"name":"Banana Cream","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":3500},{"name":"Peanut Butter","vendor":"HS","millipercent":750}],"reviews":[{"user":"Deejay_mills","score":"5","text":"Finding it hard to put this stuff down. I mixed it 1-1 but i cant help to think cheeba ls suggestion of hs banana would prolly be wonderful. As is it is a very smooth vape. The combo of tfa pb hs and vcv1 is one id prolly go back to when going for a pb flavor. I love recipes that are multi dimensional. I get the banana on the inhale and more and more pb throughout the exhale.. great job"},{"user":"CheebaSteeba","score":"5","text":"I'm all aboard this train! Peanut Butter + Banana has always been one of my favorite profiles, but I've never really gotten \"peanut butter\" from vape before, just peanuts, until I tried this. The CAP VCv1 really gets in the mix to thicken up and smooth out those peanuts to give you a good essence of peanut butter. &#xD;\n&#xD;\nI didn't mix this 1:1 since I didn't have HS Peanut Butter, but FLV made a fine substitute. I also tried this swapping out the FA Banana for HS Banana @ 0.75% and was very pleased with the results. This is definitely one I'm glad I have on hand!"},{"user":"Thadentman","score":"5","text":"This is the best I have ever tried, The banana sits perfect at the bottom of this vape and doesn't encompass the vape which most banana  mixes do and I hate. The peanut butter mix is perfect as well. Definitely a smooth thick feeling but not robust at all. 30 ml bottle was gone in 1 day. Mix this up guys, you won't regret it."}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"34053","name":"Nutty Monkey Custard "}}}
