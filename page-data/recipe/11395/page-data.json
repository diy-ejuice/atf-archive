I drink Anton Apple juice everyday and love raspberries.\r\n\r\nThis juice is fruity, and a bit tart.  I use as a shake n vape. Koolada & Sweetener can be left out or adjusted to taste, but the sweetener does take the edge off.  The Koolada is nice on those hot summer days! \r\n\r\n(INW) Anton Apple is amazing, especially when mixed with Fuji it helps to bring out the flavour.\r\n\r\n(INW) Raspberry is an extremely strong flavour, hence the small % here.","steep_days":"0","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T23:35:04.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"934","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Anton Apple (yc)","vendor":"INW","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Cactus","vendor":"INW","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Fuji","vendor":"FA","millipercent":6000},{"name":"Koolada 10 Pg","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Raspberry","vendor":"INW","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Sweetener","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":500}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"11395","name":"Owocowy"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
