The cream base has been talked about enough, but it goes to show how versatile it is. The dark berry combo on this was perfectly picked and I highly recommend everybody who enjoys any sort of cream recipe to mix this one up. A constant in my ADV cycle.","score":5},{"user":"wolfwheeler","text":"I like this one better than DAAPled Pears. Itâ€™s light enough to ","score":0},{"user":"TheJuiceJackBuilt","text":"Berries? Check. Scrumptious creamy base? Check. Perfect balance of the two? You know it is! OK, I must admit I wasn't able to mix this recipe with all of the stated ingredients. This is due to me being a cheap skate &amp; not coughing up for the Jammy Berry yet. But with Foooo being the helpful chap that he is, he gave me instructions to sub it for Cap Blueberry Jam at 1.5%. I have added JB to my next buy list, as I want to do this recipe justice &amp; vape it how it was created. But given how moreish my slight variant of it is, I'm sure I won't be disappointed.  Great recipe Fo, thanks for sharing! ","score":5}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"170442","name":"DAAPleberry cream"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
