I wanted to do something I haven't really worked with much, so I went for raspberry.   This recipe went through 5 revisions and trying to fit that into a single month was a challenge in itself.  \r\n\r\nFor the raspberry I found FA raspberry was the main type of raspberry I wanted to go for, it's just a delicious raspberry, not too candied, not too bitter, just right in the sweet spot for a bakery.  I did want  a little bit of a syrup feel along with the natural raspberry so I bulked it up with TFA sweet raspberry and added a little bit of lemon to keep the tartness.  \r\n\r\nThe icing/glaze I built with cream cheese icing and TFA sweet cream to keep it more of a cream cheese type glaze, then a little Bavarian cream for sweetness and mouthfeel.\r\n\r\nTrying to keep each layer prominent was tricky.  With the first few revisions I either really liked the icing or I really liked the bakery aspect.  How I got the bakery to play nice with the icing was this combination of Cereal 27, Graham Cracker Clear, and Cinnamon Danish Swirl.  The CDS also added a nice touch of cinnamon spice that compliments the raspberry and gives the whole recipe a more bakery feel.  \r\n\r\nThe last touch was a tiny bit of Super Sweet, not a sweetener I use often, but here it has its place.  It just adds the sugar for the whole recipe and brings it to more of a dessert level.","steep_days":"14","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:50:11.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"2093","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Berryl (raspberry)","flavor_id":"412","vendor":"FA","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Cream Cheese Icing","flavor_id":"2380","vendor":"LA","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Lemon Sicily","flavor_id":"524","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Sweet Cream","flavor_id":"183","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Cereal 27","flavor_id":"4163","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Raspberry (sweet)","flavor_id":"267","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Bavarian Cream","flavor_id":"145","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Cinnamon Danish Swirl","flavor_id":"35","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Graham Cracker Clear","flavor_id":"325","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Super Sweet","flavor_id":"2384","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":250}],"reviews":[{"user":"cdaniell30","text":"Way more flavors than I like to use in one mix, but everything works together to make a damn good vape.
