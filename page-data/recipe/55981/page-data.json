I really loved the mix but TFA Honeydew isn't a ADV to me. This is a lot more mild as JF Honeydew isn't such a abrasive flavor as TFA's version. You can use CAP Cantaloupe here is you wish. I prefer using FA's version. I kept the TFA Circus Cotton Candy as I really liked the candy finish in the mix.\r\n\r\nGive the original a try if you haven't yet!
