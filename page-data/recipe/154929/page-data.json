The lemon needs about 5 days to mellow out, but once its steeped its the perfect balance IMO\r\nThe crust base uses INW Biscuit and pastry zest (Which carries a nice lemon note)\r\nThe lemon base uses WF Lemon squares, another delish flavor, along with FE Lemon and cap lemon meringue pie.\r\nFa Custard premium brings it all together.\r\nFeel free to leave out the super sweet if thats not your thing, but I feel it contributes to the recipe and makes everything pop\r\nReally have been enjoying this one.\r\nIf you choose to mix it, please let me know how you like it.","steep_days":"5","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:50:59.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"1653","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Lemon Squares SC","vendor":"WF","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Lemon","vendor":"FE","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Pastry Zest","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":500},{"name":"Biscuit","vendor":"INW","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Lemon Meringue Pie V2","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Custard Premium","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Super Sweet","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":500}],"reviews":[{"user":"Untitled","text":"The Profile is wonderful and i bought WF Lemon Squares only for this recipe.
