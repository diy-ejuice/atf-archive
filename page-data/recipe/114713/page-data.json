Exactly what the creators notes say, I mean EXACTLY! &#xD;\nI added WS23 and I can recommend it, goes very well with the zesty Tartness from the Lemon profile. My simple description would be a Lemon meringue Ice cream. The zest part of this almost reminds me of the tartness form a lemon Cheesecake. Loads of Flavor especially considering is a low 8.5% on total flav % from these 3 concentrates.  I vaped this as a shake and vape and enjoyed it all the way to the recommended steep date, it does improve with steep, but goes well for me as a SnV.&#xD;\nThank you and Well Done on this Zugmaschine, I enjoyed this one!!","score":5}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"114713","name":"Lemon-Vanilla Ice Cream"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
