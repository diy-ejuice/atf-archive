It's tobacco . . . it's dessert.  There's nothing new under the sun.\r\n\r\nI wanted a buttery, nutty, caramel tobacco with a little bit of vanilla and graham cracker, so I started pulling flavors down that I thought would scratch that itch.  I went through several iterations (some involving chocolate at small percentages) and landed on this.   There are a ton of flavorings in this recipe . . . so if you are looking for minimalism . . . apologies, but for me it just works.  I tried to build each piece (caramel/pecan, tobacco, graham cracker/marshmallow) and then put them together.  In my opinion, all meshes together to form the profile I was looking for.  Works great as a SNV . . . but, as with most things, it gets better with age.  I mix this 60vg/40pg.  If it makes any difference (I know it doesn't), my wife really enjoys the room note.  \r\n\r\nAll go unto one place; all are of the dust, and all turn to dust again.  Who knoweth the spirit of man that goeth upward, and the spirit of the beast that goeth downward to the earth?  Therefore I perceived that there is nothing better than that a man should rejoice in his own works, for that is his portion; for who shall bring him to see what shall be after him?","steep_days":"1 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"total_reviews":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T09:26:52.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"1546","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Butter Pecan","vendor":"FW","millipercent":3000},{"name":"HOLY HOLY GRAIL RY4","vendor":"DFS","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Nut Mix","vendor":"FA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Pralines & Cream","vendor":"FW","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Red Burley","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":750},{"name":"Graham Cracker","vendor":"FW","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Marshmallow","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Cured Tobacco","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":500},{"name":"Oriental Tobacco","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":500},{"name":"Holy Vanilla","vendor":"DFS","millipercent":500},{"name":"Graham Cracker","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":750}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"89085","name":"Ecclesiastes"}}}
