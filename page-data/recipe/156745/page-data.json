But never really thought they were good. After trying Fw Jawbreaker in the Hold Fast Jaws clone by C6-R, I decided it was a good candy and would fill in some body of the vape. Boom has always tasted ok but never struck me as a stand alone flavor. All the other flavors are to boost the aspect of Bomb Pop.\r\nSweeten to taste(its a candy, its supposed to be sweet).","steep_days":"1 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T17:35:47.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"1281","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Jawbreaker","flavor_id":"1324","vendor":"FW","millipercent":6000},{"name":"Boom!","flavor_id":"1204","vendor":"FW","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Super Sweet","flavor_id":"2384","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":500},{"name":"Blue Raspberry","flavor_id":"1479","vendor":"LB","millipercent":3400},{"name":"Black Cherry","flavor_id":"703","vendor":"INW","millipercent":350},{"name":"Lemon Mix","flavor_id":"698","vendor":"INW","millipercent":800}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"156745","name":"Bomb Pop Jawbreaker"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
