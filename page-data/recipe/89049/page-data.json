I get chocolate cake, Oreo crumbs, coconut, Peeps, and a hint of something pudding-ish. It could use a little more chocolate pudding flavor - maybe something like a touch of VT Chocolate Mousse or CAP Double Choc V2 would drive that all the way home - or maybe something like FLV Vanilla Pudding or a bit of INW Custard - or both - but it's already a yummy thing and it's probably best to just enjoy it as-is and not overthink it.
