It's a muddled flavour and not to my liking. I'm convinced a lot of WF flavours are better off in food recipes. \r\n\r\n3% VT Creme Caramel is quite a weak flavour but after it steeps a bit those creamy caramel/ butterscotch notes come out. \r\n\r\nHowever, it has zero body so  2% FA Custard Premuim adds a creamy custard base.\r\n\r\nFinally 1% DYFS Holy Vanilla adds that smoky vanilla top-note and a little cream without detracting from the recipe. . \r\n\r\nâ€¢ 0.35% Flv Sweeteness (optional)\r\n\r\nDig in if you like but benefits from a 3 day steep.\r\n\r\nDisclaimer\r\n\r\nAny resemblance to actual \"1-2-3\" recipes is purely coincidental.","steep_days":"3","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"total_reviews":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T20:33:03.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"936","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Custard Premium","vendor":"FA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Creme Caramel","vendor":"VT","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Holy Vanilla","vendor":"DFS","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Sweetness","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":350}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"152705","name":"Creme Caramelish #2"}}}
