That's where the \"shave\" came from. Beyond that, the rest was purely inspired by him and interpreted by me. This profile is a creamy marshmallow and cinnamon cookie with a touch of authentic banana. It is a light airy vape and each note seems to set right on top of the next without being muddled at all. .10% of FLV Rich Cinnamon is essentially 1 drop per 30ml do not exceed even if your scale doesn't acknowledge the one drop. You can sub out PUR Marshmallow with an extra 1.5 of TFA Marshmallow, but I highly recommend getting Purilum Marshmallow as it is the closest to those big puff marshmallows. Thanks for checking it out, mix it up you will love it, and any feedback is definitely appreciated.
