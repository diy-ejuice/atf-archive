Fuck the lemonade, you make a lemon tart infused with minted blueberries instead. This delicately balanced mix is so complex yet refreshingly tasty, it will leave you coming back for more time and time again. Everyone knows what a great combination blueberry and lemon is, but the little bit of mint adds a richer layer that adds an original touch. The blueberries deepen the lemon while the mint keeps it light and fresh.  This recipe is like a very healthy couple, you have the light and head in the clouds aspect, but you also have the realism and keep you grounded part as well.\r\n\r\nFW Blueberry - This blueberry is the perfect flavor for bakeries. It is jammy yet still authentic. It is sweet without being a generic \"blue\" flavor. I went with FW because the minted blueberries are almost a compote, I wanted them to have a slightly cooked note and Flavor West handles this perfectly.\r\n\r\nFA Custard - As the main body of the cream note, custard works perfectly to add some richness to the tart and the citrus note in this flavor helps boost the lemon flavoring of the mix. \r\n\r\nHS French Vanilla Ice Cream - I wanted my tart to be smooth and buttery with a slight vanilla note and that is exactly what this flavoring does. It is a very potent flavor and since I didn't want my mix to taste like ice cream, it is used at this percentage to just add to the cream base as a delicious accent. \r\n\r\nCAP Lemon Meringue Pie - This is the bulk of the citrus flavor, as well as adds the much needed crust element and a little fluff and sweetness the meringue brings out. I wanted to use this flavoring so I could include all of the nuances a tart such as this brings to the table with as few ingredients as possible.\r\n\r\nINW Natural Mint - Mint is, I believe, the key to what makes this mix special. I added just enough to freshen the lemon without overpowering the mix with a mint flavor. This flavoring provides a very organic and natural mint flavor that isn't too candy-ish or chemical tasting. \r\n\r\n\r\n","steep_days":"7","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"total_reviews":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T17:33:52.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"3036","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Blueberry","vendor":"FW","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Custard","vendor":"FA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"French Vanilla Icecream","vendor":"HS","millipercent":700},{"name":"Lemon Meringue Pie","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Natural Mint","vendor":"INW","millipercent":200}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"31543","name":"Eat Your Tart Out!"}}}
