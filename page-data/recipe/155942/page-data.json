Best cola you can vape.\r\n\r\nThis recipe is a thing i wanted for a long time Jack & Coke.\r\n\r\nUsed 007 Cola base and added a touch of FLV Bourbon to get a bit of charred oak and bourbon sweetnes and the good old TPA Kentucky bourbon to add bourbon warmth and more bourbon sweet notes.\r\n\r\nIncreased ws-23 to fight a bit KB warmth and maintain the essence of 007 cola. ( 2% ws23 is my go to % so this is quite low for me but i think it fits better the profile)","steep_days":"7 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"total_reviews":1,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:51:00.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"1477","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Blood Orange","vendor":"FW","millipercent":500},{"name":"Fizzy Sherbet","vendor":"VT","millipercent":3500},{"name":"Bourbon (vanilla Bourbon)","vendor":"FA","millipercent":500},{"name":"WS-23","vendor":"OTHR","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Rich Cinnamon","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":70},{"name":"Bourbon","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":250},{"name":"Kentucky Bourbon","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Super Sweet","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":500}],"reviews":[{"user":"ID10-T","score":"5","text":"This turned out terrific! It might not have the quite the booziness of a strong bourbon &amp; coke but it has the right flavor and the cold and acidity gives it enough of a bite that I’m not really missing the booze. That little bit of FLV Bourbon gives it a nice charred oak that shows up well. There’s a delicate balance with 007 and you can’t just throw anything in there and have it still work as a cola, but this does, and I dig it. Upping the WS-23 seems to combat the bourbon warmth and keep it from getting weird, but not upping it so much that it floods out the flavor with ice - tastes like a smart play. Thanks for this! &#xD;\n"}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"155942","name":"Old No.7"}}}
