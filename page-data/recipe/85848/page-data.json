The AP, Graham cracker, sugar cookie and Biscuit made up my cookie stone, with the frosting and butter frosting making up the filling, since I only had the 1 peanut butter I needed it to come across all the layers and stand on its own without fading or muting. On the shake it seemed to do that but time will tell after the steep.. This is enjoyable on the S&V, and I'm confident it will only get better.(as long as you vape it up in 3 to 4 days,) as I'm told the TPA PB fades to a nuttiness in that time frame..... Boo oooooo\r\nHappy Vaping All.....
