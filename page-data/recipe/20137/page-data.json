I felt it needed some additions.\r\n\r\nI added the honeysuckle, I am not sure why really. I was vaping it and thought damn man, honeysuckle would be perfect here.... So, there it is. At 2% it is there enough to shine through and even complement the other flavors in the profile. Earthy Sweet and slightly floral, but not overbearingly at this percentage.\r\n\r\nI added the honeysuckle, I am not sure why really. I was vaping an iteration of this and thought damn man, honeysuckle would be perfect here.... So, there it is. At 2% it is there enough to shine through and even complement the other flavors in the profile. Earthy Sweet and slightly floral, but not overbearingly floral or earthy at this percentage.\r\n\r\nPear, I am using TPA here, mostly because I have a lot of it :) There are other pears, better pears, less overpowering, sweeter, etc. This was more of a convenience thing for me. It works, sweetens and does everything it is supposed to while bring a good solid pear note to the mix. A mix of INW Pear and FA Pear would maybe be a little nicer, if there was less going on in this recipe.\r\n\r\nCantaloupe/Honeydew... My longest running favorite melons are TFA Honeydew and LA Watermelon. This was not a place for watermelon. TFA Honeydew needs a little help to flesh it out a little bit, this is where Cantaloupe comes in. I did at one time use TFA Cantaloupe for this but then CAP came along with theirs and it just blows the others out of the water. Anyways, perfect use of it here.\r\n\r\nStrawberry, I thought about omitting this one all together and going for a darker berry profile but strawberry just works so well here. I am really liking either CAP Strawberry Sweet or JF Strawberry Sweet these days. Both suffer from muting over a few weeks, both are really sweet, syrupy and \"bright\" which is where TFA Strawberry comes in, it is a little more artificial tasting, but it can really boost and flesh out a strawberry in the right mix. Also, this may just be me but it seems to me to fix some of the muting that JF and CAP S Sweet as well as TFA Strawbery Ripe suffer from over a longer steep.\r\n\r\nINW Cactus, why the hell cactus? WET, that's why, this profile screams mouth full of wet fruit and INW Cactus delivers on that. I have been playing around with the percentage on this also, maybe nice to shine through? Maybe nice to peek through? I kinda like it where it is, not enough to notice CACTUS but enough to be WET.\r\n\r\nSweetener... I try and use as little as possible. To be quite honest I do not put it in every batch. I also sometimes just use CAP Super Sweet in this, at about half or less of the 1% shown. \r\n","steep_days":"2 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:48:54.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"7151","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Pear","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Cactus","vendor":"INW","millipercent":750},{"name":"Sweet Strawberry","vendor":"JF","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Strawberry","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Honeydew","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Cantaloupe","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Honeysuckle (pg)","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Sweetener","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1000}],"reviews":[{"user":"ObiWanCannoli","text":"By far the best honeydew vape I've tried. To me this tastes quite candyish just like I imagine a honeydew flavored sucker tasting. Very juicy and flavorful. I too was sceptical of honeydew at 4% but it works well here especially with all of the other fruits to flesh out the body and mask the soapiness. That honeysuckle is great at the level it is and adds a nice twist. All in all this is awesome. Great work!"},{"user":"shyndo","text":"If you like honeydew and want something mouthwateringly juicy, this may be your all day vape. Honeydew is a potent flavor and Fear does a perfect job of cutting out the soapiness many get by introducing a fair amount of counterbalance. This may be the \"juiciest\" thing I have ever vaped and that is mainly due to using cactus a bit higher and disguising the flavor of it with honeydew. Pear adds a perfect crispy juiciness as well and the strawberry kills the soapiness and adds an inherent sweetness along with the pear. This is how you do a honeydew vape right. One of the easiest 5 stars I have ever given. If you have ever had honey-perry, this is superior in every way. If you love fresh juicy fruit bowls, make this right now. Simply liquid gold."},{"user":"Wiingy","text":"This stuff is delicious!  Nice mix dude!"},{"user":"ID10-T","text":"Hot damn this is some fruity yumminess! After a 6-day steep, it is so juicy, like fruit salad with featuring juiciest ripe honeydew just dripping down my face, none of that crispy underripe melon crap. I have two similar, older recipes in this same Honey Pearry vein and I think I'm going to have to delete one and rework the other because Honey Sucker is just that superior to them. Amazing work, Fear!   "},{"user":"Thadentman","text":"One of the best fruit vapes I have ever come across, It's mostly a honeydew/honeysuckle vape that is sweet and leaves the taste in your mouth after vaping. Assuming the other fruits are to sweeten the honeydew or maybe knock off harsh edges, At the end of the day this juice is a winner. Great job Fear!"}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"20137","name":"Honey Sucker"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
