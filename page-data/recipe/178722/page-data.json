The combination really shines through with even a hint of the candied melted sugar glaze with hints of that burned sugar you get on the edges. The white cake has a creamy aspect as though itâ€™s topped with frosting already so I added a little meringue to create a confection sugar topping that has pistachio on top kinnako soy is in there to bend the fake pistachio note into one that gives the illusion of a few pieces of nuts in the frosting. \r\nI hope you enjoy! ðŸ˜Š ","steep_days":"5","temperature":"0","recipe_score":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-11T16:21:41.000-05:00","best_vg":"75%","views":"846","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Cake (White)","flavor_id":"8470","vendor":"FW","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Honeycomb","flavor_id":"8901","vendor":"VT","millipercent":750},{"name":"Kinako soy","flavor_id":"9379","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":250},{"name":"Macadamia Nut","flavor_id":"8922","vendor":"VT","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Meringue","flavor_id":"530","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Pistachio","flavor_id":"293","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Biscotti","flavor_id":"4403","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":250}],"reviews":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"178722","name":"Pistachio Cream Puff - JW"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
