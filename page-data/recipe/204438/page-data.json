VT Banana Custard is a subtle tasting banana that has awesome creaminess and a slight hint of vanilla. The banana aspect with VT Banana Custard definitely needs help. I used TPA Banana Nut Bread to really bring out the banana and make it more prominent in the recipe. I paired JF Biscuit and FW Graham Cracker as the base for the crust. For my cheesecake I used INW Yes, We Cheesecake.  It works really well with Custards.\r\n\r\nIf you're a fan of banana creams you'll love this.\r\n\r\nPlease enjoy and share you're feedback!\r\n\r\n","steep_days":"5","temperature":"0","recipe_score":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-12T14:08:13.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"952","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Banana Custard","flavor_id":"8825","vendor":"VT","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Banana Nut Bread","flavor_id":"144","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Biscuit","flavor_id":"4487","vendor":"JF","millipercent":750},{"name":"Graham Cracker","flavor_id":"1297","vendor":"FW","millipercent":2250},{"name":"Yes, We Cheesecake","flavor_id":"9272","vendor":"INW","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Super Sweet","flavor_id":"2384","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":500}],"reviews":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"204438","name":"Banana Custard Cheesecake"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
