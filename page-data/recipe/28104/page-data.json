Since then it's has been my girlfriend's ADV and I tried fucking around with it and changing it up, but it has never been as good as this revision. It wasn't created with any particular food in mind, although I have been told that it smells and somewhat tastes like an apple and raspberry granola bar, it's an abstract recipe that was created by having my girlfriend pick up two flavorings and creating a recipe based around it.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nThe thing that is definitely up front and carries over entire vape is Fuji that is accentuated with lime and raspberry. TPA Banana Cream forms a solid base on its own (pretty much alone), together with nuttiness provided by FA Hazelnut, while Torrone binds it really nicely to the fruits and plays along the lime. I would probably call this my best recipe to date.\r\nIt can be enjoyed as a shake and vape, but it really needs some time for the fruits to somewhat calm down. I'd say it's pretty near it's full potential  after 3 days steep, and straight up amazing after a week. Bold, bright yet not cloying.\r\n\r\nMore notes at: https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/5pekmv/mox_abstract_fruity_thingy/","steep_days":"3 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"total_reviews":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T22:31:54.000-05:00","best_vg":"60%","views":"1023","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Banana Cream","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Apple Fuji","vendor":"FA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Berryl (raspberry)","vendor":"FA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Hazel Grove (hazelnut)","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Torrone","vendor":"FA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Lime Tahity Cold Pressed","vendor":"FA","millipercent":500}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"28104","name":"Mox"}}}
