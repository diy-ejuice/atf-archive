I will use Alfred's original description of the trinity because I feel like he broke it down very well and frankly cause he probably did a better job then i would do ALso Laziness  (The INW - Yes, We Cheesecake is the best cheesecake flavor available and creates the base for the trinity. Capella - New York Cheesecake is the first support flavor, bringing an additional note of caramelized sugar for the crust, adding some serious creaminess, and opening the bridge to vanilla flavors a bit more. Lastly, the TFA - Cheesecake (Graham Crust) completes the crusty undertone portion of the trinity and adds another hint of dairy.) https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/99cd5h/the_cheesecake_trinity/\r\nGive it a week steep and your ready to go enjoy. \r\nBe safe and stay healthy during these times \r\nVape On","steep_days":"7","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:51:25.000-05:00","best_vg":"72%","views":"2132","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Sweet Coconut","flavor_id":"605","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Coco' (coconut)","flavor_id":"416","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Meringue","flavor_id":"530","vendor":"FA","millipercent":750},{"name":"Yes, We Cheesecake","flavor_id":"9272","vendor":"INW","millipercent":3000},{"name":"New York Cheesecake","flavor_id":"90","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Cheesecake (graham Crust)","flavor_id":"152","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1000}],"reviews":[{"user":"tw2k","text":""},{"user":"cxxxxp","text":"MAN, IS THIS TASTY! The way the meringue interacts with the coconut is something special! I'm getting a sweet creamy inhale, the meringue melts on the tongue and makes way for a brilliant coconut experience on the exhale, which actually feels slightly toasted with the graham crust from TPA. The cheesecake trinity really makes for a wonderful base - rich, thick and a creamy mouthfeel with just a slight tang. The whole thing is dense, moist and full of flavour. Great job with the coconut profile. I'd been recommended these two coconuts and this recipe made them shine! ~3 days of steep time and it just tasted so good after eating a coconut yoghurt, so if you like coconut, like I do, I'd give this recipe a go. &#xD;\nIt's as if those Rafaello Balls (think Ferrero Rocher - but with white chocolate &amp; coconut) have been smashed into a good cheesecake and in the best way possible. Thanks for this! I'll definitely mix this one up again! You let this steep for a month+ and it's simply amazing"},{"user":"MikeRaf23","text":"All around a nice coconut Vape.
