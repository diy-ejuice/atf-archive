Well done. Very buttery and rich, right up my alley. The roasted pecans and cream at 1% is just enough to add a nice roasty note without the sort of coffee note I can get from that flavor. ","score":0},{"user":"MrBurgundy","text":"Delicious. I love the custard base. Vienna Cream adds some depth and an ice cream twist while Butter Cream gives it a waxiness that I find appealing. The triple threat of FW Butter Pecan, WF Pecan Pie, and WF Roasted Pecan create a robust nutty note that stands up to the hefty custard base. Itâ€™s roasted, buttery, and crunchy. Very authentic butter pecan in a thick, rich custard.. Perfect time of year for this kind of recipe.","score":5},{"user":"kafordtn3","text":"I was new to DIY and was looking for a pecan pie mix to make for my husbands replacement ADV, and this was it. Thank you. It's delicious. Perfect blend of sweet, creamy custard and buttery, nutty goodness.","score":5}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"25804","name":"Adams Pecan Custard Perfection "}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
