My take on Unicorn Milk by Cuttwood.. \r\n                       \r\nSuper decadent creams and sweet sugary strawberry. One of my go-to recipes when I don't feel like mixing. \r\n                                    \r\nI wasn't happy with the Unicorn Milk clones around so I just had to come up with my own. Now, while this isn't a clone, it's the exact same profile so call it what you will. \r\n                \r\nI mean, you *could* shake and vape, but it's not going to be as amazing as it is after a solid 10-12 days.  Just hide it and wait for the vape-gasm. \r\n                \r\nI designed this recipe specifically to be steeped so that the creams are nicely homogenized and I wanted the strawberry to last all the way through as a top note, which is quite difficult paired up with those heavier creams but I think I managed by just pure intensity....so please, ENJOY!\r\n::for best experience, wait until it turns a golden amber color...I promise you won't regret it::","steep_days":"10 (SNV)","temperature":"420","recipe_score":4.5,"total_reviews":2,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:48:48.000-05:00","best_vg":"68%","views":"2967","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Bavarian Cream","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Vanilla Bean Ice Cream","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Strawberry (ripe)","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Sweet Strawberry","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":3000},{"name":"New York Cheesecake","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Butterscotch Ripple","vendor":"FW","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Raspberry (sweet)","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1000}],"reviews":[{"user":"photohap","score":"5","text":"Nice all day vape, this is my wifes favorite and she is pretty picky."},{"user":"cdaniell30","score":"4","text":"Nice S&amp;C.
