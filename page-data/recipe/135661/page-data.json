Since I've gotten into DIY, I've been cloning and remixing these 3 often. Sagamore is simply a RY4 with a bit of cupcake, creams, cinnamon, maybe graham cracker. In this remix, I forego the cracker, the extra creams, and the obvious choices like TFA RY4 Double, CAP CDS, or CAP Vanilla Cupcake. Instead, I went in a different direction but aimed to keep it simple. Think I struck gold. A thick, smooth caramel, touch of tobacco that cuts through all the heft, a nice cakey base to build it all upon, with a hint of that good ol' cinnamon tickle.\r\n\r\nThis one's solid, cost effective, and easily an ADV or big-batch worthy. Give it a go :)","steep_days":"7 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"total_reviews":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T17:35:26.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"1183","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Dulce De Leche","vendor":"JF","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Yellow Cake","vendor":"JF","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Cinnamon Ceylon","vendor":"FA","millipercent":150},{"name":"RY1","vendor":"HS","millipercent":2000}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"135661","name":"The Switch"}}}
