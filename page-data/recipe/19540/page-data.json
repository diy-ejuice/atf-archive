Does not need any help, IMO\r\n\r\nLB Pink Lemonade 2.5% this adds the citrus effect, a good sub for it would be CAP Pink at the same percentage.\r\n\r\nCapella Sweet Mango, I adore this stuff, for a truer Mango you can add others, but this does just fine on it's own as well.\r\n\r\nTFA Sweetener - This mix really needs it, I was using just EM in it but felt it really needed the \"True Sweet\" effect that nothing but Sucralose can give it.\r\n\r\n\r\nSo, what this is...\r\n\r\nAn interesting Dream Bar, it will change from an Orange Cream Bar to a Mango Cream at different wattages and airflow.\r\n\r\nGOOD.\r\n\r\nFeel Free to add Koolada to taste for a cold one :)\r\n\r\nEdit, if you vape this during the first week the ice cream is not fully developed, the citrus is heavy and separate from the Mango. After a week is when this truly comes together.","steep_days":"7","temperature":"0","recipe_score":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-11T14:06:50.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"2445","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Vanilla Ice Cream","flavor_id":"1511","vendor":"LB","millipercent":5000},{"name":"Sweet Mango","flavor_id":"120","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Pink Lemonade","flavor_id":"1500","vendor":"LB","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Yogurt","flavor_id":"408","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Sweetener","flavor_id":"339","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1500}],"reviews":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"19540","name":"DREAM"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
