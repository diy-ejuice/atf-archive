I absolutely love the way lemon really brightens raspberrys and they both are perfectly layered in this recipe. I like my cheesecakes with a more pronounced graham crust, so the cheesecake w/ graham crust, along with lemon meringue pie, and FW graham cracker all play off each other forming that perfect graham base and add complexity to the filling. This can be a shake and vape, but I find it does get better and gives the raspberry a little more pop with some aging. Enjoy!","steep_days":"3","temperature":"400","recipe_score":5,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:49:09.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"2335","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"New York Cheesecake","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Cheesecake (graham Crust)","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Graham Cracker","vendor":"FW","millipercent":750},{"name":"Lemon Meringue Pie","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":500},{"name":"Lemon Sicily","vendor":"FA","millipercent":750},{"name":"Vanilla Custard","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":500},{"name":"Raspberry (sweet)","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Raspberry","vendor":"INW","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Super Sweet","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":500},{"name":"Vanilla Whipped Cream","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1500}],"reviews":[{"user":"KRUCIAL","text":"This shit is so dam good.
