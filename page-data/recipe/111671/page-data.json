Ladies in their large hats and finery, gentlemen smoking their cigars and drinking their brandy, the rich in their boxes served luxury items and the poor in the dirt and muck screaming for a chance to win it big.\r\nYou've been invited to dine in the luxury booths with the likes of Rockefeller and Morgan and all the big wigs and their wives, maybe even a president or two during the big race. Let the scene take you away and inspire a juice to fit the time and how you might experience that day. \r\n\r\nNothings says Kentucky Derby more than Bourbon and Mint Juleps.\r\n\r\nThis an apricot mint julep crossed with a fine tobacco.  \r\n\r\nThe julep: TFA Apricot, FLV Apricot, TFA Kentucky Bourbon, VT Bourbon, INW Natural Mint, and WS-23.  \r\n\r\nThe tobacco: FLV Cured, FLV Native, and TFA Red Oak.\r\n\r\nOff the shake, I get a cold blast of slightly boozy, stone fruit and mint over the top of a down to earth, smooth tobacco. The tobacco note here is extremely nostalgic for me . . . it reminds me of youthful days spent in my grandfather's tobacco barn.  Though mint juleps were not on the menu, he had apricot trees and acres of tobacco.  To be more representative of my younger days, I would have to 86 the mint julep and white trash this up with Lord Calvert and Sun Drop . . . but nobody wants that (with the exception of my Uncle Willie and he's been long gone for years).  So, I'm going to keep it somewhat classy.  \r\n\r\nYou can't have a julep without mint and lots of ice . . . so I went relatively heavy on the INW Natural Mint and WS-23.\r\n\r\nWhen all is said and done, this is a cool, minty tobacco laced with bourbon and apricots.","steep_days":"1 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"total_reviews":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-06T20:44:09.000-05:00","best_vg":"60%","views":"1196","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Kentucky Bourbon","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Bourbon","vendor":"VT","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Natural Mint","vendor":"INW","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Apricot","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Apricot","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Native Tobacco","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1500},{"name":"WS-23","vendor":"OTHR","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Cured Tobacco","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Red Oak","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1000}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"111671","name":"Apricot Julep Tobacco #yearofmixing"}}}
