I always look forward to the whole in the wall food stand at the local fair that makes these delicious caramel rice crispy corn ball. I used kettle corn by tfa because it adds a great sweetness and texture it is perfect for this mix and is a great flavor overal.l I then added caramel rice crispies another good flavor both this and kettle corn have a sweetness  to them which when you add caramel original by tfa  you definitely shouldn't need sweetener. Caramel original and kettle corn both by tfa  have plenty of sweetness to go around. I added rice crunchies by tfa to add a little more of the rice cripies  grainy properties. I add caramel by flavor art to help push the caramel original into having a more authentic taste.  I added toasted marshmallow to pull it all together and help bLend all the flavors while also adding almost a creamy caramel feel to this Vape.  I feel that this recipe is at its best after a 7 day steep its definetly a quality Vape after a day or two but it really comes together after 7 days the kettle corn and caramel rice crispies start to melt together into there own magically balanced sweet treat.","steep_days":"7","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"total_reviews":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T17:33:54.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"1712","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Kettle Corn","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Caramel Rice Crispy Treats","vendor":"WF","millipercent":3500},{"name":"Rice Crunchies","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Caramel (original)","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Toasted Marshmallow","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Carmel (caramel)","vendor":"FA","millipercent":500}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"34183","name":"Caramel crispy balls"}}}
