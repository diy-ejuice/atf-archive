Sugarloaf pineapple and pineapple INW paired together, is delicious. A splash of pineapple TFA adds that extra top end kick. Yogurt, sweet cream, and a touch of vanilla bean ice cream complete the smoothie base. To finish it off, add a splash of ws-23 and Purilum super sweet (adjust cooling and sweetner to your liking). \r\n\r\nI use a 0.25 - 0.30 ohm N80 quad core fused clapton between 30 - 50 watts. I use both an rda and rta.\r\n\r\nI did update the recipe... The original recipe was getting to dry after a few days and pineapple juicy was the cause.","steep_days":"2 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-12T10:15:56.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"1308","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Sweet Cream","flavor_id":"8979","vendor":"VT","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Pineapple","flavor_id":"809","vendor":"INW","millipercent":4500},{"name":"Sugarloaf Pineapple","flavor_id":"8978","vendor":"VT","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Yogurt","flavor_id":"1471","vendor":"FW","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Super Sweet","flavor_id":"7787","vendor":"PUR","millipercent":400},{"name":"Vanilla Bean Ice Cream","flavor_id":"186","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"WS-23","flavor_id":"8085","vendor":"OTHR","millipercent":300},{"name":"Pineapple","flavor_id":"259","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":750}],"reviews":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"154636","name":"Swanky Pineapple : Pineapple Smoothie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
