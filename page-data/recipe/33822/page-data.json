Firstly, (TPA) Cheesecake tastes like Dirty socks so I would take that out and only use (TPA) Cheesecake (Graham Crust)  (CAP) NY Cheesecake. Secondly, with this many flavorings it is bound to get pretty muddy. I would take all the blueberries out except Blueberry (Extra) because it is perfect for bakeries. I would bump it up to 6%.I would also omit the (CAP) Super Sweet, (TPA) Dairy/Milk, (TPA) Vanilla Cupcake, and (CAP) VBIC. This should leave you with a Blueberry cheesecake that has very distinct flavors in it. If you are not very happy with this recipe, I would make these changes but if you are happy with it, keep vaping it. Taste is all subjective. Happy Mixing!","score":2}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"33822","name":"BlueBerry Cheescake remake"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
