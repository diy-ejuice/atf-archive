It, in conjunction with the custard and Catalan cream makes for a velvety smooth cream base. Vanilla bourbon amps things up a bit to further enhance the flavor value of the pudding feel of the vape while marshmallow creates a solid and impactful body/mouthfeel. \r\n\r\nCookie and biscuit make for a delightful cookie note even if the percentages are small. They're not overpowered by the banana at all and provide their own intricacies to the recipe to make it come off as a pudding with wafers sitting on top. \r\n\r\nSweetener is optional and up to the individual mixer. I use .50% here because it makes it all the more scrumptious. Enjoy!","steep_days":"4","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"updated_at":"2020-12-12T10:16:02.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"1298","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Banana Cream","flavor_id":"916","vendor":"LA","millipercent":5000},{"name":"Ripe Banana","flavor_id":"269","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":400},{"name":"Cookie","flavor_id":"490","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Biscuit","flavor_id":"4487","vendor":"JF","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Bourbon (vanilla Bourbon)","flavor_id":"420","vendor":"FA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Catalan Cream","flavor_id":"483","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Marshmallow","flavor_id":"473","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Custard","flavor_id":"484","vendor":"FA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Super Sweet","flavor_id":"2384","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":500}],"reviews":[{"user":"bjorama","text":"I think this recipe is easily the finest Banana Anything I've ever vaped.  I think I finally tore into it on day 3 and it didn't stand a chance.  There it lay on the night stand, tipped over in disgust that I only made a 30ml .  Like some of the best self-titled debut Albums: Led Zeppelin, The Doors, Van Halen, Black Sabbath and 1975's Daryl Hall and John Oates, this BananaSlam by BananaSlamma will be flagship recipe for this mixer.   Its freaking delicious.","score":5}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"162422","name":"Banana Slam"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
