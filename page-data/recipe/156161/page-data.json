This is a hybrid recipe created with a blend of flavours that I imagined would offer warmth and comfort. That is what this mix is about. Sure there is technique here, but what I would rather you the mixer do is mix this and with each vape of this, try and pick out how each flavour plays and how it melds. Pull it apart by single flavour testing each flavour. See how each flavour works with another at these percentages. \r\nThat is mixing, real DIY mixing IMO.\r\nThe only thing that will be burning besides your desire for more will be your battery power as you enjoy this vape full of richness and balanced flavours that don't really belong together, \r\nbut somehow they do. \r\n\r\nThis is Campfire! \r\n\r\nEnjoy! \r\n\r\nIMO this is a very pleasant and enjoyable vape on a single coil RDA at 60W with a SST Alien single coil at 0.2 ohm \r\n\r\nSteep Time 5 Days for best results. \r\n\r\nI hope you enjoy this just as much as I enjoyed creating this little recipe, but let me know what you thought in the comments below. \r\n\r\nSeriously if you like a solid recipe that works give it a go!\r\n\r\nCheers for reading this far, now go and get mixing!\r\n\r\n\"Together, Let's Discover!!!\"\r\n\r\n& don't forget to #ReturnTheFlavour \r\n\r\nFacebook - https://www.facebook.com/groups/diydownunder/\r\nDiscord - https://discord.gg/kH4Fqbc\r\nYoutube - https://www.youtube.com/c/diydownunder\r\nWebsite - https://www.diydownunder.com/\r\nInstagram IGTV : @diydownunder","steep_days":"5","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-06T12:56:17.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"1578","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Brandy","flavor_id":"8841","vendor":"VT","millipercent":500},{"name":"Caramel Butter","flavor_id":"6046","vendor":"WF","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Golden Syrup","flavor_id":"8887","vendor":"VT","millipercent":500},{"name":"Marshmallow Vanilla","flavor_id":"10092","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Orange Marmalade","flavor_id":"9895","vendor":"VT","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Pear","flavor_id":"665","vendor":"INW","millipercent":500},{"name":"Rich Cinnamon","flavor_id":"638","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":150}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"156161","name":"Camp Fire "}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
