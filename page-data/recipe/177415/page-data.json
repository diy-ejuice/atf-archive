Seeing what I can make. I would say wait a couple days for the harshness to die out. Idk if it's the raspberry or just the 27 fish but it has a throat kick the first few days then it fades out after about 3. Taste good but similar to all the swedish fish recipes.","steep_days":"3","temperature":"0","recipe_score":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-12T10:16:11.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"638","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"27 Fish","flavor_id":"8736","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":6000},{"name":"Juicy Strawberry","flavor_id":"8779","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Raspberry","flavor_id":"667","vendor":"INW","millipercent":250},{"name":"Jammy/Candy Wizard","flavor_id":"9955","vendor":"FA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Super Sweet","flavor_id":"2384","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":100}],"reviews":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"177415","name":"The Red Fishy"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
