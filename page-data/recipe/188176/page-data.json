That being said, I'm a stubborn son of a bitch. I've always thought it was missing some kind of vaguely green, earthy note. FA Kiwi isn't the best kiwi, but it does help push the green tea more forward. FE Green Tea is the most like matcha to me, a little grassy  and earthy. I'm not the biggest fan of Eisai Tea just because it's a little to dry and floral to me, but feel free to add it in here. This recipe is similar to my other attempts before I had FA Milk, I've tried other milks, creams, but there if you want straight up milk you need to get FA Milk. Finally CAP Vanilla Whipped Cream for some froth.\r\n","steep_days":"3 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T20:33:22.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"589","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Milk","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1250},{"name":"Green Tea","vendor":"FE","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Kiwi","vendor":"FA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Vanilla Whipped Cream","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":3000}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"188176","name":"Jade"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
