The biscuit and the redness comes through brilliantly but what I like best is the touch of ginger on the exhale that pickles my tongue and it's delicious. I will mix this again because I love it! Another brilliant SlashaLo recipe and I hope you'll be awarded on the DIY or Die best everything in 2018, you already deserve it.","score":5}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"73692","name":"Give Thanks for Cookies!"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
