Sweet Fig is that surprise flavor I placed smack in the middle of this mix that makes vaping this tobacco quite a unique experience because in this mix it almost taste like a plumb note.\r\nTo round out the recipe I finished it off with sweet and smokey tobacco it does exactly what is expected adds a smokey sweet finish.","steep_days":"7","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"total_reviews":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T21:33:28.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"411","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Bourbon Aged Cream SC","vendor":"WF","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Clove","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":50},{"name":"Desert Ship","vendor":"FA","millipercent":750},{"name":"Dk Tobacco Base","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Honey Bee","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":100},{"name":"Maxx-blend","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Sweet and Smokey Tobacco","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":100},{"name":"Sweet Fig","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":500}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"202803","name":"Jen W's Clove Honey Bourbon Cigarillo"}}}
