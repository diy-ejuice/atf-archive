Feedback and Suggestions Welcome \r\n\r\nVT White Grape (2%)-Spot On Sweet White Grape has a chemical aftertaste that I tried to cover up.\r\nFLV Pink Guava (2%)-I love the Hoppy-ness this bring the recipe and how the white grape accentuates it.\r\nFW Pink Champagne (1.5%)- The \"Champagne\" in this works with the hoppy-ness of the Pink Guava, The fizzy-ness works with my soda base and it has white grape notes which help out the White Grape.\r\nVT Fizzy Sherbet (1%)  & FLV Citrus Soda (0.5%)- This is what I used as my soda accent, you could probably push the citrus soda higher in this soda base but for me when I push it over 0.75% I get headaches feel to bump that up.
