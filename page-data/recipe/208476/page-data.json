I've been really enjoying vaping this during the miserably cold winter weather. \r\n\r\nFLV Apple Filling and PUR Country Apple are a really lovely combo. They taste very autumnal, especially with that lovely cinnamon note Apple Filling has. \r\n\r\nI used FE Sweet Rice for the main rice note. VT Rice Base adds a little more dimension as well as helping the Sweet Rice not to fade. I wanted to make the rice pudding layer as simple as possible so I started off with just the FE and VT rice layer and TFA Bavarian Cream. But the little bit of FLV Cream really helped add more creaminess and just overall improved it.\r\n\r\nI often don't use sweetener but I found this mix needed some. I thought it wasn't quite sweet enough for the profile. It also subdued the apple slightly to allow the rice pudding to come through more. I don't think you'd necessarily need to use FW. I've used CAP SS in another rice pudding recipe and it worked fine. \r\n\r\nCan vape after an overnight steep. But the apple comes through more after 2 days and I found it really improved after 3 days. The apple is more present and its overall better balanced. It also gets creamier, richer and the layers blend together better.
