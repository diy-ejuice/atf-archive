I just chose a strange concentrate's name to take the place of the ACTUAL strange concentrate I used since it's another one ATF don't list. Get FRA Mango v2. It's a banger on it's own. And I'd know!\r\n______\r\n∙∙∙ ∙∙∙ ∙∙∙\r\nABOUT\r\n∙∙∙ ∙∙∙ ∙∙∙\r\n\r\nThis was originally a quick mix to test some new flavours (DIY-EJ Mangoes are excellent BTW) but it turned out to be one I REALLY enjoyed, I even decided it was worthy of being my first shared recipe. I remade it with some more accessible Mango flavours and the result is better than the original! I also played with apricots and peaches, but the mango really shines on it's own here.\r\n\r\nYa'll reading this better get your hands on Frandy Mango v2 (its a banger) in the meantime!\r\n______\r\n∙∙∙ ∙∙∙ ∙∙∙ ∙∙∙ ∙∙∙ ∙∙∙\r\nFLAVOUR NOTES\r\n∙∙∙ ∙∙∙ ∙∙∙ ∙∙∙ ∙∙∙ ∙∙∙\r\n\r\n∙ FRA Mango v2 / FE Mango / FLV Mango ∙\r\n\r\nWe're going for a bright and juicy mango here, ripe, juicy, bright & sweet. We've essentially built a Mango sandwich with FE Mango (A.K.A SC Mango) in the middle. FE Mango @ 1.5% is bringing much of the body and juicy thickness, it is a realistic, sweet and bright mango. We have FLV Mango supporting the base, bringing just a touch of deeper, thicker, dark & ripe aspect but just a touch.\r\nSitting on top and cascading over all we have FRA Mango v2 which is bright and juicy and sweet without being candied. It's a wonderful juicy mango and brings all the top notes plus adds a great bright mango flavour on the exhale.\r\nIt should be noted that FE Mango is a great flavour off the shake but is prone to fading over time. However, in this mix I have found the mango has lasted til the end.\r\n\r\n∙ NR Smooth Cream/NR Vanilla Milkshake/FW Vanilla Bean Ice Cream ∙\r\n\r\nAs noted, I was mixing up some new flavours. When I first mixed it, my intention was to build a sweet, creamy base for the mango to sit upon, but what you're actually getting here is a full on fresh mango with a creamy base that is very much in the background. NR Smooth Cream adds a creamy mouthfeel without imparting any dairy notes @ 1%. NR Vanilla Milkshake and FW Vanilla Bean Ice Cream are used to bring a thicker body and creamy mouthfeel, as well as a slight touch of vanilla that plays well with the next ingredient.\r\n\r\n∙ WF African Horned Cucumber ∙\r\n\r\nThis mix has a refreshing twist with the sweet, juicy, *almost* minty flavour of WF African Horned Cucumber. This is essential and is worth getting if you enjoy juicy fruit mixes! It's function here is similar to how some mixers will use INW Cactus low to add juiciness. Unfortunately, my tastebuds don't much care at all for the humble cactus and so finding this concentrate has been great for me. I love the juiciness and flavour it brings at 0.5% without overshadowing the Mango.\r\n\r\n∙ CAP Super Sweet / WS-23 (Coolant) ∙\r\nMangoes are a sweet and full-flavoured fruit which is why I added SS @ 0.5% but you're of course free to tweak the % or omit it completely and the same goes for WS-23. This is the highest % I've added WS-23 and it's on par with the fruity Malaysian juices which inspired this recipe. You can reduce it to 1%, or even 0.5% if you prefer, I haven't tried this recipe without it.\r\n______\r\n∙∙∙ ∙∙∙ ∙∙∙ ∙∙∙ ∙∙∙ ∙∙∙ ∙∙∙ ∙∙∙\r\nSUBS / Other Changes\r\n∙∙∙ ∙∙∙ ∙∙∙ ∙∙∙ ∙∙∙ ∙∙∙ ∙∙∙ ∙∙∙\r\nThese are just suggestions for potential subs, drop a comment with what works for you\r\n\r\n∙ NR Smooth Cream 1.5% → TPA Whipped Cream 1.5%\r\n∙ FW VBIC → Your preferred VBIC concentrate (LB, FA, TPA, CAP...)\r\n∙ NR Vanilla Milkshake → Increase FW VBIC or other VBIC\r\n\r\nThe reasons for not recommending a sub for FRA Mango V2 is it's taken me a while on this mission for mangoes to find ones I really enjoy. These are just the ones that work for me (but sub where you need!) Plus, it's the best mango concentrate I've tried and I have about 30 I think so it may well be worth getting it from BLCK flavour if you can and you enjoy a great-tasting juicy mango on the in- and the ex-hale.\r\n\r\nDIY is all about customisation. This recipe can be used as a building block and you can change anything from the VG:PG ratio, to the %'s of Sweetener or WS-23 in your mix, or even sub flavours when you have to.\r\n\r\nIt's true, it won't be exactly the same, but just do what works best for you and if you do mix this up (or some variation of it) I hope you enjoy it.\r\n______\r\n∙∙∙ ∙∙∙ ∙∙∙ ∙∙∙ ∙∙∙ ∙∙∙\r\nHAPY MIXING\r\n∙∙∙ ∙∙∙ ∙∙∙ ∙∙∙ ∙∙∙ ∙∙∙\r\n\r\nI'm relatively new to this and want to learn more, feedback/comments are always welcome!
