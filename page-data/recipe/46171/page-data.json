This also made the vape much more smooth as Bahraini Gold has a bit of a throat hit.\r\nLowering the INW Bahraini Gold left a bit of space in the tobacco department and FA Maxx Blend was perfect for the job (imho) as it brought a sweet tobacco to the table that blends in perfectly.\r\n\r\n\r\nOptional: Increase Maxx Blend to 0.5% or even more if you want more tobacco in the vape, remove it all together, or replace it with your own favorite sweet tobacco flavor.\r\nOptional2: For a more authentic hookah experience I'd add 0.25-0.5% Anise depending on brand.","steep_days":"3","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"total_reviews":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T17:34:04.000-05:00","best_vg":"60%","views":"2189","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Maxx-blend","vendor":"FA","millipercent":250},{"name":"Shisha Apple","vendor":"INW","millipercent":2200},{"name":"Tobacco Bahraini Apple Gold","vendor":"INW","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Two Apples","vendor":"INW","millipercent":750}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"46171","name":"Triple Apple Hookah"}}}
