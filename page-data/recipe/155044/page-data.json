Flavorah is great, but I’ve never made a successful full FLV recipe and they happen to have some flavors that really pop in the fruit line. \r\n\r\nWayne already showcases this in his water Malone recipe with wild melon and watermelon, I added cantaloupe and green apple. I add ws-32 to my water Malone at around 1%, to keep it FLV I went with cool menthol, possibly the strongest menthol on the market. It’s useful because it doesn’t mute, and you really only need a drop or two per 30-60ml.  Feel free to skip the menthol or sub your own. \r\n\r\nPersonally, I think it’s great. Try it?

I've mixed the OG water malone and it was harsh and apple fronted so I mixed this and now I see how it should've been done... And the Cantaloupe hit the jackpot! Crazy what publicity and hype can do... You deserve it more! Thank you, sir!"}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"155044","name":"Flavorah Malone (a take on Water Malone) "}}}
