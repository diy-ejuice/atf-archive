Right of the bat with no steep it's pretty damn tasty. But it'll take a few days for the strawberry to calm and let everything else pull through. Thanks ID1O-T for the base. I know I won't be the only one to utilize it!

I put it down for a few days and then came back to it and I'm glad that I did.  Ive only had Macarons a few times so its hard to compare, but this is a tasty recipe.  The creams really come together after a few days and meld with the strawberries.  Awesome recipe!"}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"46517","name":"Strawberry Macaron (ID1O-T Ripoff)"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
