I am using Flv Chocolate Deutsche for the chocolate chips because it has a really great chocolate note with some coconut that I think will blend into the creams really well. The mint is a combo of LB White Chocolate Peppermint with some Flv Peppermint just to give the mint more of an edge. The rest of the ice cream is made up of FA Vienna Cream and Flv Cream","steep_days":"3","temperature":"0","recipe_score":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-12T05:50:40.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"1470","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"White Chocolate Peppermint","flavor_id":"6795","vendor":"LB","millipercent":5000},{"name":"Australian Chocolate","flavor_id":"2657","vendor":"HS","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Vienna Cream","flavor_id":"516","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Cream","flavor_id":"604","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Peppermint","flavor_id":"8563","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":250}],"reviews":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"168735","name":"Mint Chocolate Chip Ice Cream #mixinvixens"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
