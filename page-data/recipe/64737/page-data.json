This recipe is bright and very well balanced. A little too sweet for my taste but the addition of the coconut gave a complete new dimension and character to a very popular profile. You wouldn't guess there is any coconut without reading the recipe and I will try it with more of it. This is a 5/5 and I probably put this into my rotation of ADVs"}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"64737","name":"Stroconut"}}}
