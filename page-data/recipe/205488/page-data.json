Was talking to my friend ID10-T and his ingenious Idea to drizzle it in butterscotch was well, Da Bomb!!! But in the first version as Wayne said it was a tad muddled and just didn't have the Cheesy in the Cheesecake.Well here it is the best in my humble opinion, Chocolate Banana Cheesecake Drizzled in Butterscotch!
