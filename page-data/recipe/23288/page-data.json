At this low of a percentage it has a fantastic milky flavor and is lightly sweet. \r\nSweet cream deepens out the milk flavor. \r\nVienna cream is a necessity of this recipe, it blends fantastic with HV And whipped cream creating a wonderfully unique and balanced cream/milk flavor. \r\n\r\nOba Oba is the secret ingredient of this recipe. Honestly, I won't tell you what it does. You'll have to taste that yourself. \r\n\r\nThe Bavarian cream is here to complement the milk base and add more sweetness to the mix. The light caramel notes you'll taste create that sugar coating on the loops/flakes. \r\n\r\nLooking for a great mixing group on Facebook?

What holy vanilla and oba oba do underneath this mix.... its like boobs, you dont know why they're so great but they just are.  I subbed in FLV sweet cream at 1.25% cuz its what I had but I cant see that making a massive difference.  Thank you so much for this well crafted recipe, Ive thoroughly been enjoying it, at the moment I am waiting on a new bottle of fruit rings cuz I actually ran out and I am just jonsing for it!   I have vaped it straight off the mix, after a warm bath and its good but certainly comes together nicest after 1-2 wks.  Gotta give that vienna cream time."},{"user":"wadeyloops","score":"5","text":"Mixed on the 1/7/17. Tried it daily after 1 week steep to see how it transforms. Today 20/7/17 and it is all it says it is in the description. The flavors have melded together beautifully. If you are after a fruit loops creamy milk cereal look no further as you have definitely hit the jackpot!   "}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"23288","name":"The Fourth Horseman *updated*"}}}
