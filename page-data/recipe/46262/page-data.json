I was going to try t release it for St. Patricks Day but I wasn't sure how it was going to turn out. I came up w/ the idea from a Fred Meyers email I got around that time. Im not much into bakeries but I think this one is pretty good & I hope you enjoy. Best after 2 weeks steep. Positive Feed back & constructive criticism is always welcome, Thanks <3","steep_days":"14","temperature":"65","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-11-26T11:54:50.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"1349","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Butter Cream","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Cake (yellow)","vendor":"FW","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Chocolate Cream","vendor":"INW","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Cream Cheese Icing","vendor":"LA","millipercent":3000},{"name":"CrÃˆme De Menthe","vendor":"FW","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Holy Vanilla","vendor":"DFS","millipercent":1600},{"name":"Marshmallow","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1750},{"name":"Meringue","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Vanilla Whipped Cream","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":2000}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"46262","name":"Grasshopper Cupcake"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
