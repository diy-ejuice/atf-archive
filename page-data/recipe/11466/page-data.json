I thought why not make something that would just use them all up at once. It was like 3am and I needed to get to bed.  So Shadow's Milk was created.  Oh well I love it.  Since this one is heavy on the creams I mix this one until frothy then I let it sit, until it's clear, then I mix until it is frothy again.  Then I heat in the baby bottle warmer for 30 minutes.  Then I let this one sit for 2 weeks.","steep_days":"0","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-05T02:12:08.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"1795","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Strawberry","flavor_id":"272","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":6000},{"name":"Graham Cracker","flavor_id":"326","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Cake Batter","flavor_id":"22","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":2000},{"name":"French Vanilla","flavor_id":"170","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Bavarian Cream","flavor_id":"145","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Cheesecake","flavor_id":"153","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1000},{"name":null,"flavor_id":"null","vendor":null,"millipercent":0}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"11466","name":"Shadow's Milk"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
