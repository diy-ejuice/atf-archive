It could easily be a Shelf Seller even without all the added sweeteners a lot of big brands pile into their juices.  Before I started DIY I vaped a lot of Colossus by Cyclops Vapor, which is a bold delicious and very popular Vanilla Custard.  When putting this recipe together I kept that Colossus flavor in mind and went for something a little more special with an added creaminess that you don't see coming nor do you know exactly where it's coming from.  My special ingredient here is NY Cheesecake! If you vape this mix as a Shake n Vape it is still very good, but you can tell and taste that the Battle between the Cheesecake and Custard has just begun. After a 4 week steep the Vanilla Custard is the clear victor but the battle leaves behind a extra sweet, thick, and creamy coat of armor that the Vanilla Custard wears with the utmost respect!  I am very proud of and love this recipe. The way my friends and family try to fight me over it if I have a bottle laying around, i'd feel confident in saying they love it too...  I'd love to hear your feedback, just make sure you make plenty because after the 4 week steep it will not last long!

Only on a 14 day steep and probably won‚Äôt make 30. Time for a bigger batch... nice job !

I am currently waiting for more CAP French Vanilla to arrive so I can mix up a small mason jar for steeping (because steeping is hard for me, especially with something so good)."},{"user":"Untitled","text":"I am amazed by the VBIC and VC combination since im a big fan of plain vanilla custards. It was delicious after mixing and I was sure it could only get better. After 3 weeks steep I can say that it will belong in my routine. Very good work!"},{"user":"empty0ne","text":"Mixed up a small test batch, and let it steep for a month.  Vaped it all in a day.  Now, I'm making a couple of 120's so they will last.  :)  Wonderful plain vanilla custard, just what I was looking for."},{"user":"cdaniell30","text":"because sometimes you just want a delicious plain vanilla custard without a lot of extra notes."},{"user":"KylezKloudz","text":"Great tasting custard!
