Sweet bread and fluffy white cake making the base bakery, and glazed makes it a donut.\r\n\r\nI add some buttercream frosting on top bolstered by some wf vanilla cream extra and flv frosting, and cover it with wf lemon orange rice candy which, to me, tastes/smells a LOT like fruity pebbles, but without any of the berry pebbles. So in comes fruit circles. I used FW here because it has less of a sharp citrus note than tpa, which i am already bringing with wf.\r\n\r\nGive this a week so settle the sharper citrus notes and bring balance to the vanilla, buttercream, and bakery notes\r\n\r\nI will be adding some CAP super sweet into this, probably around .3%, but as always sweeten to your individual tastes!","steep_days":"7","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T17:36:30.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"487","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Bread (Sweet) SC","flavor_id":"10542","vendor":"WF","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Glazed Donut SC","flavor_id":"9025","vendor":"WF","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Frosting","flavor_id":"4412","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":500},{"name":"Buttercream Frosting SC","flavor_id":"8361","vendor":"WF","millipercent":1750},{"name":"Vanilla Cream Extra SC","flavor_id":"8382","vendor":"WF","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Fruit Rings","flavor_id":"1285","vendor":"FW","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Lemon Orange Rice Candy SC","flavor_id":"10103","vendor":"WF","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Fluffy White Cake SC","flavor_id":"9024","vendor":"WF","millipercent":3000}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"202945","name":"Pebbs Deeznuts"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
