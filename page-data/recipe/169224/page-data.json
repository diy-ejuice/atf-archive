Personally I really love lychee, but by itself it can be a little off-putting to me. With the addition of cranberry, it seems to stay consistently interesting and enjoyable.\r\n\r\nIt doesn't need anything else. The combo itself is already juicy, bright, and sweet, so I didn't feel a necessity for dragonfruit, fuji, or sweetener. If you want to cool things up a bit, feel free to add 0.25% - 1% WS-23 per your preference.\r\n\r\nIt's great right off the shake, but it seems to get better every day. \r\n\r\nPlease try it out and let me know what you think.\r\n\r\nReddit link: https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/ddzsnk/lycran/","steep_days":"2 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"total_reviews":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-02T10:29:43.000-05:00","best_vg":"65%","views":"1360","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Lychee","vendor":"FA","millipercent":750},{"name":"Cranberry","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":2000}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"169224","name":"Lycran"}}}
