The butter can absolutely be swapped for TFA Butter. JF Biscuit is a softer, more buttery biscuit than it's INW cousin so a better choice in this recipe, though again can be subbed. \r\n\r\nTFA Strawberry Ripe/ TFCC Rhubarb: The filling. TFCC Rhubarb is not all that strong in comparison to the well known companies, its best described as perfectly emulating a candied rhubarb sweet flavour. The strawberry helps to fill it out, sweeten and give it more of a stewed texture. \r\n\r\nFA Cream Fresh/ TFA VBIC: Make a nice 'dollop' of cream to round the recipe off. VBIC adds just the right amount of creamy vanilla, while the Fresh Cream keeps it light and fluffy. \r\nAdd Sweetener to taste. I like 0.25% Super Sweet in this one. \r\n \r\nMy test subjects and I found it perfectly good to vape after 4 days, though this will vary dependant on the Rhubarb used. Rhubarbs usually need a bit of time to settle down so this is not a shake and vape unfortunately. \r\nReally lovely after 2 weeks. \r\nI will be trying the INW Rhubarb in this when I eventually get it in, and will update if I like it better. Feel free to experiment with the rhubarb, I realise most people are not going to have TFCC version as I've only seen it sold at MakeMyVape in the U.K, but it's the only one I have at the moment that I like.  \r\n","steep_days":"7","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-02T07:38:25.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"1157","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Strawberry (ripe)","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Biscuit","vendor":"JF","millipercent":1250},{"name":"Sugar Cookie","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Butter","vendor":"FA","millipercent":750},{"name":"Vanilla Bean Ice Cream","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":3500},{"name":"Cream Fresh","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Rhubarb (yc)","vendor":"INW","millipercent":600}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"47985","name":"Rhuberry Crumble 'n' Cream"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
