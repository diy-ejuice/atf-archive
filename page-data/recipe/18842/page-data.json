It tastes like a biscuit (cookie) you get in the UK called a Hob Nob. A real oaty taste. It comes through a little dry though so Sugar Cookie is used to soften and sweeten the base. The Almond and Torrone are there just to provide interest. The Raspberry and Cranberry combine really well here for the top note and are brightened up somewhat by the Fuji. The Vanilla Cupcake helps to blend everything together and in conjunction with the Butter Cream provides a nice creamy finish with great mouth feel.\r\n\r\nAllow 14 days to steep for the bakery elements to come through.\r\n","steep_days":"14","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"total_reviews":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:48:53.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"1341","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Acetyl Pyrazine ","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Almond","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Butter Cream","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Cranberry","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Fuji","vendor":"FA","millipercent":750},{"name":"Meringue","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Oatmeal Cookie","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":5000},{"name":"Raspberry","vendor":"INW","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Sugar Cookie","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Torrone","vendor":"FA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Vanilla Cupcake","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1500}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"18842","name":"Nimrod"}}}
