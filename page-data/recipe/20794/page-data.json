Lebkuchen is traditionally a sweet soft fluffy \"cookie\" resembling gingerbread which is typically available around the Christmas festive season. It originates from Germany and it's something I've found available in the UK supermarkets over the last few years and is one thing that I am unable to resist every year as soon as they pop up. \r\n\r\nThey typically contain ground almonds, ginger, cinnamon, a light layer of chocolate on one side, either lemon or orange juice & zest (I found lemon to be the better option in my recipe) and a light icing sugar glaze.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA few notes:\r\n\r\nCAP Chocolate Glazed Doughnut / FA Cookie - adds a bit of volume and a cake quality, it's not harsh in the slightest and it also compliments the Milk Chocolate to some degree. \r\n\r\nFA Lemon Sicily - it's at a ridiculously low percentage so if you're making a small batch, this may be tricky especially if mixing by weight. To figure out roughly how many drops would give me my 0.1% I think I needed it 0.02g and my scales aren't quite sensitive enough until a bit more weight is on them. I put a small cutting of tissue on my scales, tared them, then dripped drops until it would read a weight, I then divided the weight/drops to figure out roughly how many I would need to get the 0.01%. This is key though, too much extra lemon and it throws this recipe off, its supposed be a really low subtlety in this mix.\r\n\r\nTPA Toasted Marshmallow - this mixes with the milk chocolate and doughnut to give it quite a creamy sweetness.\r\n\r\nCAP Super Sweet - If you have just regular Sucralose / Sweetener - double this to 1.6 % (or to taste)\r\n\r\nI don't think the other ingredients really need much explanation for their inclusion as they are what they are, 7 day steep, 5 at the bare minimum, some of these flavors are pretty bold right off the bat so they need time to settle down or you're going to have a bad time. I hope you enjoy it and it can help you get into the spirit of Christmas.\r\n","steep_days":"7","temperature":"460","recipe_score":5,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:48:54.000-05:00","best_vg":"80%","views":"3426","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Almond","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Chocolate Glazed Doughnut","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":2750},{"name":"Cinnamon Danish Swirl","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":500},{"name":"Cookie","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Gingerbread","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Lemon Sicily","vendor":"FA","millipercent":100},{"name":"Meringue","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1250},{"name":"Milk Chocolate","vendor":"INW","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Toasted Marshmallow","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Super Sweet","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":800}],"reviews":[{"user":"ghweiss","text":"such a deliciously complex and chocolatey profile... the INW milk chocolate predominates, beefed up by the gingerbread without seeming \"spicy\" or dry (in fact quite velvety). notes of cinnamon, almond, and marshmallow round out the edges. the touch of lemon sicily is a master stroke! somehow it binds to the sugary sweetness of the meringue and keeps the otherwise dense profile from feeling too heavy, all without taking it anywhere confusing.&#xD;\n&#xD;\nthis was my first trial of CAP SS and the batch came out too sweet for me at .8%, but that's not to take away from the recipe otherwise. excellent job, thanks so much!"}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"20794","name":"Lebkuchen"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
