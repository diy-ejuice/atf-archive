It is the lovechild of ruby red grapefruit and a fresh navel orange and brings that authentic, real orange burst of flavour. The bitter exhale balances this perfectly to secure its rightfull seat at the Queens’ high tea. \r\n\r\nFA Grapefruit adds the crisp, bitter and eerily realistic grapefruit flavour, reminiscent of a true, fresh grapefruit. There is very little sweetness present and sits beautifully here to provide that ‘rindy’ feel to the marmalade.\r\n\r\nFE Lemon is beast of a lemon and certainly lives up to its praise. This bright, fresh lemon flavour adds the tartness and balances the bitterness from the above citrus fruits. This adds a touch of sweetness, and cuts the bitter notes with a clean, fresh burst of lemon.\r\n\r\nFA Tanger Mandarin is the final player here and adds that voluptuous, fresh mandarin flavour to pull the entire party together. The authenticness of a true mandarin is perfectly encapsulated here and brings an overall citrus feel to the mix inludimg sweet, sour and a smidgen of bitterness.\r\n\r\nSweetener is necessary to create the jaminess and flesh the citrus quartet out, just so.\r\n\r\nThis one is good off the shake and best after 3 to 5 days.\r\n","steep_days":"3 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":4,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:50:04.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"1774","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Blood Orange","vendor":"FW","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Grapefruit","vendor":"FA","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Lemon","vendor":"FE","millipercent":600},{"name":"Sweetener","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Tanger (mandarin)","vendor":"FA","millipercent":4000}],"reviews":[{"user":"ID10-T","text":"It tastes like a celebration of citrus, with identifiable grapefruit, orange, and lemon flavors. Lots of zesty tartness and wonderful balance of bitter and sweet. It punched me with flavor without being harsh or overdone. It does taste like a wonderful marmalade, with all those magical bits of citrus peel enveloped in sweet jelly. My only beef with it is is how many times the word “thick” appears in the description - there’s even a “voluptuous” in there.  It’s really not all that thick to me, it leaves me wishing there was something to fill in the base more, some more goopy sweetness. But it would have to be something that doesn’t drag down those lovely top notes too much.  Still, definitely a way better citrus mix than vaping FA Citrus Mix standalone. This is what FA Citrus Mix *should* taste like. "}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"94586","name":"Queen’s Marmalade"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
