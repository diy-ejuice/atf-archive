It really makes the raspberry flavors pop.\r\n\r\nSweetener - I really wanted to drive home the whole candy idea and needed more sweetener to do this. Jolly Ranchers are a very sugary candy.","steep_days":"3","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:48:50.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"5791","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Cotton Candy (circus)","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Raspberry","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Razzleberry","vendor":"FW","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Sour Wizard","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Sweetener","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1500}],"reviews":[{"user":"TamVapes","text":"Love this!  I realized, I had already mixed this from your recipe posted on ELR.  Made more last night, still love it."},{"user":"Philosaphucker","text":"I avoid sweetener like the plague. And upon initial mixing, I wasn't fond of the cotton candy. But then I tried this again after sitting for 10 days and I must say, this recipe pulls off a sour blue raspberry jolly rancher very well. The raspberry doesn't get lost or muted in the sour wizard and the sweeteners perform their functions beautifully to turn this into a sugary candy. Good stuff. Well done!"}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"16101","name":"Razzy Rancher"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
