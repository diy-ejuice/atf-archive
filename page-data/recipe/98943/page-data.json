Alan was a wonderful son, brother, cousin and friend. Alan is preceded in death by his grandparents, Willard (Doris) Tuomi.  Survived by parents, Jeff and Susan,  sister Tristin; grandparents, Gust & Fern ; aunt, Jean and her children David and Michael; uncle Mike and aunt Cheryl and their children, Justin, Kelsey and Katy.*\r\n\r\nAlan was the best brother,  cousin, son, and friend anyone could ask for. Everyone who got even slightly close felt like they were his best friend. \r\nFor myself, he introduced me to music that helped shape and deepen my love for electronic music, specifically electro-house.\r\nDespite not always being the best I could be I never felt that he treated me any differently than anyone else.\r\nThe world is colder having lost him.  \r\n\r\n\r\n__________\r\n\r\nPear and Strawberry - almost nonexistent, serving as back notes and sweetness. You won't really notice it unless you're looking for it.\r\n\r\nTangerine and Blood orange - up front and potent. There's no mistaking that this is orange. This is my favorite combination of oranges because it always shines through. Not particularly candy-like, but not exactly realistic either.\r\n\r\nPink Champagne - I don't fully understand what it's doing here exactly but I don't think this would have been as good without it. There's an almost fizzy, fuzzy quality to it that I believe is coming from the Pink Champagne.\r\n\r\nIf you're a fan of oranges in any capacity, give this a shot. I'm seriously surprised how this turned out.\r\n\r\n**If you copy, remix, or sell this recipe I only ask that you keep his name involved in the description in some way.**","steep_days":"3 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:50:08.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"4329","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Blood Orange","vendor":"FW","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Sweet Tangerine","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Pink Champagne","vendor":"FW","millipercent":500},{"name":"Red Touch (strawberry)","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Pear","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000}],"reviews":[{"user":"kindground","text":"Your touching eulogy made it impossible for me to NOT mix this.
