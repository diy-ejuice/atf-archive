One of my favorite beverages is a Moscow mule, which  is a ginger beer, vodka and lime beverage.  Any good cocktail has a nice balance of sweet with acid  so that is what I went after here. \r\nThe Ginger ale creates the base  note for this mix.  While the ginger is a weak note it does add some sweetness and  adds the impression of the ginger spice at 4 - 5 % \r\nThe cranberry apple and Thai apple create the mid note of  this mix  and blends well.. Thai apple is a thin sweet  bright apple with a slight pear note that adds some juicy notes   The FLV cranberry apple is a very strong flavor and needs to be used low  %  but could be boosted a bit more if you want a more prominent cranberry note. \r\nLemon lime soda and lime   work to create that citrus  and acid balance \r\nThe basil works really well as a accent note that is present on the exhale  and is similar to what you may experience with mint but  slightly sweeter and not  as   prominent.\r\nThe sweetner is added to contrast the citrus \r\n","steep_days":"4","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-01T02:15:06.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"931","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Apple Cranberry","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":900},{"name":"Basil","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":300},{"name":"Ginger Ale","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Lemon Lime Soda SC","vendor":"WF","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Lime Tahity Cold Pressed","vendor":"FA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Sweetness","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":500},{"name":"Thai Apple SC","vendor":"WF","millipercent":1500}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"89783","name":"MBs Virgin  Cran  Apple Moscow Mule "}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
