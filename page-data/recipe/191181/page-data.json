I am still not tired of it so thats something right?  Basically its a strawberry cream with some dark berrynotes and a little bakery with a light cream note.  Hope you enjoy!!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFW VANILLA ICE CREAM - Similar to liquid barns VIC it is sweet as expected from FW.  It is nto as eggy as LB and thats what i wanted here just a light creamy note to clean things up on the end of the vape\r\n\r\nFW BERRY COBBLER - TAMVAPES Turned me onto this flavor and i have to say i really like it...its a berry blend with some dark notes to it and a small amount of bakery on the tail.  For me it is a little harsh off the shake but steeps out nicely in about 4 days or so.\r\n\r\nSTRAWBERRIES -  The Juicy and Red Touch are a great combo IMO then i added the VT jam just to give some depth to the mix and bring some sweetness without needing to add sweetener to the mix.\r\n\r\nNOTE - Feel free to add sweetener if you want it  i have used it in this mix and its still good i just prefer it most of the time without.","steep_days":"4 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"total_reviews":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:51:31.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"675","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Vanilla Bean Ice Cream","vendor":"FW","millipercent":3500},{"name":"Wild Berry Cobbler ala Mode","vendor":"FW","millipercent":2250},{"name":"Juicy Strawberry","vendor":"FA","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Red Touch (strawberry)","vendor":"FA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Strawberry Jam","vendor":"VT","millipercent":2000}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"191181","name":"Covid Cream"}}}
