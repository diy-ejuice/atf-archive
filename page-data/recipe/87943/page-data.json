Adding a little FLV Apple Filling takes it from plain to subtly cinnamon-spiced. But what's still missing is all the goopy sweet stuff that's really the best part. The Apple Filling has a lot of that all by itself, and a touch of sweetener goes a long way to finishing it. But a little pat of butter is still missing. VT Golden Syrup instead of sweetner brings the sticky sweet and a just-right hint of buttery goodness in one. Overnight steep.

I absolutely loved this mix. Not only is it a cinapple side dish, it's a great fall recipe. I took it camping in late summer with cabin and a bunch of other stuff. I only vaped this. Simple mix that hits that apple cinnamon note without the bakery element to distract from it. It's got the texture and the flavor im looking for in a profile like this. Thanks, ID for putting this together and sharing!","score":5},{"user":"Thanrak","text":"Mixed this up last week and let it steep a few days.  It's almost a spot on Cinnamon Apple dessert.  I feel like the real thing has more cinnamon, but maybe that's too harsh to vape.  Already mixing another 30ml, this is almost gone.","score":5}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"87943","name":"1-2-3 Cinapple Side Dish"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
