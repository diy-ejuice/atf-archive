I mainly get pear with a slight hint of honey on the exhale.  If I put my mind to it I can detect the kiwi behind the pear, but for the most part it just blends together into one juicy honey pear.  Very nice.  If I don't forget about it, I will put INW Pear in my next order and give this a real rating.  Update:  Finally got the chance to try it with INW Pear.  Even better!  Although FA Pear is a good enough sub.  Thanks!"}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"96829","name":"Mānuka"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
