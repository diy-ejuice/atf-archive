So I thought this might be a good recipe to try. I have always loved a nice Blueberry hibiscus tea, but don't care for a tea vape. So I decided to make a nice smoothie out of this.\r\nFW Blueberry- The best and most Authentic Blueberry that I have Found and brings a nice sweet Blueberry flavor. \r\n\r\nFLV Hibiscus - This is the Best Hibiscus I've tried and it tastes so good mixed with Blueberry. It has nice Floral notes but not too overpowering at .75%. \r\n\r\nFA Black Currant- I can't say enough Good things About this flavor. It pairs well in so many recipes and brings a nice spicy tart finish to any recipe while providing a unique Flavor.\r\n\r\nCap Golden Pineapple- I Just love This flavor as it taste like fresh canned Dole pineapples. This pairs really well with the cocunut and the Black Currant really making the flavor just a bit more astringent.\r\n\r\nFlv Coconut - This is the Best Cocunut Flavor it's so good and authentic and goes great in this mix. \r\n\r\nCap Vanilla Whipped Cream- This makes it creamy and brings in a light Vanilla note and makes it a nice blended Smoothie. \r\n\r\nCap Supersweet is optional but adds the perfect amount of sweetness to this recipe. \r\n\r\nThis Recipe also pairs well with a nice mint bringing a cooling effect. I reccomend either Cap Cool Mint or Polar Blast at a .5%. \r\n \r\nBest after a 5 day steep. Mixed at 60/4oPG. \r\n\r\nFeedback would be appreciated. Thanks and Enjoy.
