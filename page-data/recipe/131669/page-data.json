I love vanilla, and Holy Vanilla is a rich, unique offering in the vanilla realm. The Sweet Cream, and Vanilla Swirl were added to smooth out, and induce the flow; while the RY4 Double provides that rich, caramel/light RY4 groove. All seem to blend very well together, and top off a great meal!\r\nYou can enjoy this after 5-7 days, but I like it after 2 weeks.","steep_days":"14","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"total_reviews":1,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:50:37.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"2159","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Sweet Cream","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Holy Vanilla","vendor":"DFS","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Ry4 Double","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":8000},{"name":"Super Sweet","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":500},{"name":"Vanilla Swirl","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2000}],"reviews":[{"user":"elsignor","score":"5","text":"A rich creamy RY4 with vanilla.
