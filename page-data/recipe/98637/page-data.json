At this percentage it is high but not overwhelming thanks to the creaminess of VBIC and VS.\r\n\r\nIf you enjoy in your face flavor, mix this, feel free to sub VBIC for whatever your preference lands. Raspberry is the star here and strawberry balances it out with a quick shout out from blueberry wild. Do not recommend subbing FW Blueberry here as blueberry is not the star of this show. \r\n\r\nTFA Strawberry can be subbed for ripe if you're looking for a sweeter inhale/exhale experience. \r\n\r\nWorks well as a SNV but really comes together after a week or two, only gets better with age as the VBIC settles in and pulls it all together.","steep_days":"14 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-06T10:37:48.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"1302","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Blueberry (wild)","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":4000},{"name":"French Vanilla","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Raspberry","vendor":"INW","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Strawberry","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Vanilla Bean Ice Cream","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Vanilla Swirl","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2000}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"98637","name":"Double Rainbow"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
