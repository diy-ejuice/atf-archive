The Riceflavor adapts to the Peanut and binds these two characters into one picture\r\n\r\nINW Tobacco Coctail/FA Up\r\nboth of these two flavors do their job to add depth and more character, darkens the flavor profile and adds that little surprise at the end of the inhale and exhale\r\nCAP Super Sweet, it's there to boost the pear and adds to the overall sweetness.\r\n\r\nNeeds a good steep. I liked it around 1 Week.\r\nFA Up could be changed to WF Brazil Coffee, bt i liked UP more cause it's closer to the slight tobacco note\r\n\r\nFeel free to comment, critique is very welcome","steep_days":"5","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"total_reviews":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-06T20:50:54.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"934","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Peanut Butter","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":200},{"name":"Tobacco C","vendor":"INW","millipercent":100},{"name":"Pear","vendor":"FA","millipercent":600},{"name":"Pudding Base","vendor":"VT","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Sweet Cream","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Sweet Rice","vendor":"FE","millipercent":200},{"name":"UP (coffee)","vendor":"FA","millipercent":200},{"name":"Super Sweet","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1000}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"102972","name":"DarkPeanut"}}}
