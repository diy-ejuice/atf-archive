There are a few variants of this recipe - the \"leaded\" one contains pink champagne instead of the traditional 7up.  Some people make this with ginger ale, some add Hawaiian punch, and I have seen it with orange juice and pineapple juice.  This reminds me of being a kid :-)   Its a sweet juice, but it is meant to be.  Enjoy a little blast from my past.  PS - it really DOES need a week to steep.","steep_days":"7","temperature":"0","recipe_score":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-12T14:08:11.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"533","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Fizzy Sherbet","flavor_id":"8878","vendor":"VT","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Lemon Lime","flavor_id":"83","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Lemon Lime Soda SC","flavor_id":"8372","vendor":"WF","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Lemon Sicily","flavor_id":"524","vendor":"FA","millipercent":250},{"name":"Rainbow Sherbet","flavor_id":"1390","vendor":"FW","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Super Sweet","flavor_id":"2384","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":500}],"reviews":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"202650","name":"Rainbow Sherbet Punch (aka Wedding Punch) #Developed Summer"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
