I like the natural taste of ripe strawberry a tad bit more than red touch strawberry hence the use of both. If and when I get some inw strawberry shisha in stock i will try subbing that only or subbing it for the red touch strawberry. A combo of creams used as most of the strawberries and cream recipes I have tried lack some depth that I want. I also wanted that sweet taste that many of the major labels have but without using a bunch of sweetener to accomplish it. And of course I had to have some custard in there for flavor and mouth feel/thickness. This continues to get better every day it is allowed to steep. If you don't have holy vanilla you could just bump cap vanilla custard up to 3-4%. I used gelato instead of the common vbic as some people experience a pepper taste to vbic. Dragonfruit used as recommended to brighten the strawberry note so it's not completely drowned by the custard and cream. Marshmallow and meringue to add sweetness and texture as well.","steep_days":"0","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"total_reviews":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T02:14:22.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"2097","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Strawberry (ripe)","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Strawberry","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Vanilla Bean Gelato","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Bavarian Cream","vendor":"FW","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Holy Vanilla (DIYFS)","vendor":"OTHR","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Vanilla Custard","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Vienna Cream","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Meringue","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Marshmallow","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Dragonfruit","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Cotton Candy","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Cream Fresh","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"4680","name":"strawberry custard and cream"}}}
