Tested on an Asmodus C4 at 50w with 0.33ohm Dual fused claptons and a Profile 1.5 0.2ohm mesh at 75w.\r\n3 weeks required for everything to blend together, this then remains stable for at least 6 months.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe main cream is made up of FLV Cream which adds some buttery and realistic dairy cream notes to this mix at 1%, Devon Cream is used to further enhance amd thicken up that cream which it achieves at 2% and Vape Train Vanilla Cream which adds a further dairy element this is very sweet cream like whillst also adding a rich Vanilla Note\r\n\r\nVanilla buttercream frosting at 1% sweetens this mix up and adds some sweet and grainy texture while adding a sweet complex Vanilla along with the wonderful buttercream notes, I originally tried 2% which made this mix a little dry and waxy, I backed it right off to 0.5% which didn't provide enough of what I wanted, finally 1% is the sweet spot for this mix.\r\n\r\n\r\nVanilla pudding at 2.5% thickens this mix up with it's silky and thick pudding like mouthfeel whilst also building on the vanilla profile,\r\nFinally FA Vanilla Bourbon is used to tie all the Vanillas together with it's own dark vanilla notes that play well with Vape trains rich and bright complex vanilla's, creating a thick Dairy Cream mix with deep and rich Vanilla notes","steep_days":"21","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"total_reviews":2,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:51:26.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"2340","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Cream","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Devon Cream","vendor":"CC","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Vanilla Buttercream Frosting","vendor":"VT","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Bourbon (vanilla Bourbon)","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Vanilla Cream","vendor":"VT","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Vanilla Pudding","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":2500}],"reviews":[{"user":"ooooNaSuGamisoooo","score":"5","text":"thick mouthfeel&#xD;\nnice vanilla &#xD;\nvery enjoyable after a 4 days steep"},{"user":"wadeyloops","score":"5","text":"I am willing to give this 5 stars from now because I have tinkered around this thick and luxurious combination for a while and this is certainly where I was heading.
