(limoncello is an Italian liquor that is made out of vodka, lemons, and sugar. Then you just wait. for months and months!!!) So of course I had to give it a go as a lover of OG home-made limoncello . \r\n\r\nShisha lemon / FW Lemonade have that tart/ sweet syrup type of lemon flavor combination that I wanted for the lemon base for this mix. When combined with the VTA sorbet and VTA Vodka this  comes really close to a pretty darn good Lemoncello. \r\n\r\nThe vodka/ sugar cane / and sorbet are ideal to bring a slight note of sweetness, cooling and alcohol to the finish. While they are not necessary they add an authentic vibe to the mix. \r\n\r\noba oba adds some body and some light vanilla sweetness and enhances some of the tartness in the mix\r\n\r\nmeringue and ice cream create the ice cream base that i wanted to blend into the lemon flavor profile. Meringue  brings the lemon and ice cream  together ( thanks das mose for that idea)   \r\n\r\nsugar cane is just added for some deeper sweetness that is part of any home made lemoncello\r\n\r\nThis can be vpaed at 3 days but better at 5 - 7 days as the harsh edge of the lemon back down and the sweet cream comes forward. If you like a really lemon forward mix you can move that FW lemonade up to 5 - 6 % note that FW lemonade will be cloudy in a mix","steep_days":"5 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"updated_at":"2020-12-12T15:39:55.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"1435","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Shisha Lemon","flavor_id":"828","vendor":"INW","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Lemonade","flavor_id":"1336","vendor":"FW","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Meringue","flavor_id":"530","vendor":"FA","millipercent":750},{"name":"Oba Oba","flavor_id":"480","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Russian Vodka","flavor_id":"8957","vendor":"VT","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Sorbet Base","flavor_id":"8970","vendor":"VT","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Sugar Cane","flavor_id":"9369","vendor":"VT","millipercent":750},{"name":"Vanilla Ice Cream","flavor_id":"1511","vendor":"LB","millipercent":6000}],"reviews":[{"user":"MotherPunker","text":"another fantastic recipe!
