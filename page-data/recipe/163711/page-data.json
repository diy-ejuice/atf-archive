It also helps to bring some extra body to the overall vape.\r\n\r\nThe FLV Sugar Orchid is the magic wand of fairy dust here that delivers a unique and magical sweetness, but she is a wild one to use and restraint is the key to success when using this flavor. \r\n\r\nOff the shake - I get a full bodied base of the ice cream with a wonderful separation of flavor over the top of that base that I can only describe as a delectable & sparkling fairy dust. I know that sounds insane but this entire profile is. However it just works and is not just a recipe to enjoy, rather it is an experience of textual & unique sweetness that I simply can't describe fully but you will understand when you mix this.\r\n\r\nShe's Magic ! She's Wild !\r\n\r\nGive it a go and let me know what you thought of this!\r\n\r\nI am really looking forward to seeing how this steeps out in the coming weeks and days to see how if she tames or stays wild ! lol \r\n\r\nEnjoy!\r\n\r\nI tested on a Wotofo Recurve DUAL RDA 0.14ohm SST coils at 65w\r\n\r\nI hope you enjoy this just as much as I enjoyed creating this recipe, but let me know what you thought in the comments below.\r\n\r\nSeriously if you like a solid recipe that works give it a go!\r\n\r\nCheers for reading this far, now go and get mixing!\r\n\r\n\"Together, Let's Discover!!!\"\r\n\r\nFacebook - https://www.facebook.com/groups/diydownunder/\r\nDiscord - https://discord.gg/kH4Fqbc\r\nYoutube - https://www.youtube.com/c/diydownunder\r\nWebsite - https://www.diydownunder.com/\r\nInstagram IGTV : @diydownunder\r\n\r\nSee the creation of it here:\r\nhttps://youtu.be/y7uDMGgNxF0?t=664","steep_days":"0 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-11T14:17:31.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"1752","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Frosting","flavor_id":"4412","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Musk Candy","flavor_id":"308","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Rainbow Sherbet","flavor_id":"2312","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Sugar Orchid","flavor_id":"8571","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":150},{"name":"Vanilla Ice Cream","flavor_id":"1511","vendor":"LB","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Wild Berry Cobbler ala Mode","flavor_id":"8499","vendor":"FW","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Super Sweet","flavor_id":"2384","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":500}],"reviews":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"163711","name":"Wild Woman"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
