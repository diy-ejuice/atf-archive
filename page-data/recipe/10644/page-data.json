Sugar cookie, unless bolstered by a supporting bakery and/or better cookie (like FA), is a horrible concentrate. At a percentage this high, it made the recipe incredibly bland and terrible to vape. ","score":1},{"user":"kallyver","text":"Amazing recipe, I've mixed it a couple times. I've mixed a 100ml bottle and it didn't last 2 weeks. So, to see how well it ages, I just mixed 500ml, I hope it's enough. Great job ID10-T, I'm always amazed by your recipes.","score":5},{"user":"HermitJack","text":"Can't believe how good and simple it is. Only gets better with age.","score":5},{"user":"SeLeV","text":"This tastes like dirt. I honestly cannot fathom the appeal. CAP Sugar Cookie resembles some old spicy cookie crust and CAP Vanilla Custard is burnt custard with a teeny dab of vanilla. What a waste of resources.","score":1},{"user":"finsamson","text":"*Updated Review --- It's not actually that bad on the coils* &#xD;\nI'm rather new to mixing, and this was the first recipe (after many) I could get on board with. Packed with flavour, simple to make, and you don't have to wait long for it. It's my go to ADV whenever I'm not tasting other recipes or just waiting for others to steep in order to taste them. Great with coffee. I'll probably never tire of this one. My taste buds are shot, and find most recipes lacking in mouth feel and genuine punchy flavour, but this is spot on. Thank you man.","score":5},{"user":"DadaFry","text":"10/10 ADV the best recipe I can whip up to fix any bad vape or mixing day. Great SNV that gets better over time","score":5},{"user":"Marlena","text":"Wow.....love this recipe! So simple and so good. Thanks so much for sharing this.","score":5},{"user":"vix","text":"Take me to Disney! Smells like you're walking down Main St. Great simple recipe that proves you don't need complicated mixes to come up with something great. ","score":5},{"user":"horrend","text":"Foolproof recipe which is delicious (for me) after a day or two. Room note not going to be beaten.","score":5},{"user":"yeahIvape","text":"Outstanding recipe! Thank you so much for this, its so simple only two concentrates and yet the flavor is incredible. Smoked an entire 120ML on my DotSquonk in 1 week. This easily has become an ADV for me.","score":5},{"user":"LimeDrive","text":"Had to leave a review for this old classic. Redonkulous flavor and the room note can't really be matched. I also like how it is doofus proof.","score":5},{"user":"noxx1993","text":"Very nice","score":5},{"user":"Elvieann","text":"Simple and delicious!  Also a fantastic base for fruits.","score":5},{"user":"zenith","text":"Simple and beautiful, has quickly become an ADV for me.  Thanks for sharing!","score":5},{"user":"ParDeus","text":"","score":5},{"user":"JustinLFranks","text":"CAP Sugar Cookie and CAP Vanilla Custard are both awesome flavors, so it is no surprise that they work so well together. This is a ridiculously simple recipe that is ridiculously good. While I prefer a bit lower percentage of CAP Sugar Cookie (5.5%) and adding 1.5% TFA Whipped Cream, 1.5% TFA Cheesecake (Graham Crust), and 2% CAP Vanilla Cupcake (for a \"softer / cake-ier\" cookie with a light frosting), when I need to whip up something real quick that will taste great as a shake and vape, this recipe is what I usually go for.","score":5},{"user":"lolwtf","text":"A good, simple recipe.  This idiot knows what he's doing.  Perfect for sharing with friends who don't give a shit about the intricate complexities of your favorite DIY juices and just want something good.

Love recipes like this and the flavour from the sugar cookie and the custard is just perfect.","score":5},{"user":"esco","text":"Great vape, thanks for this recipe, mixed up 150ml and also fuck you, because now I'm out of sugar cookie ","score":5},{"user":"Demonic_Mixer","text":"you gotta be kidding me.i was thinking about the exact same recipe a couple of days ago.i just wasn't sure about the percentages.but thanks to you i can skip \"batch-phase\" and just go straight to the final recipe.thanks man :)","score":0},{"user":"Lupeie","text":"Killed my 30ml bottle quickly, only lasted me 2 days. I made a 120 ml and let it sit, and man it was delicious! I love simple recipes, and this is going to be in my rotation often!","score":5},{"user":"ActionRalf","text":"just a good all round great vape, simple and nice.","score":5},{"user":"KepinskiUK","text":"Simple and effective. A nice vape on it's own and would be great with a little something extra adding into it.

The mustard milk of cookies and cream recipes. Made 10ml, tried it after 2 days and immediately another 100ml plus another batch with a little brown sugar at 0.5% and that's pretty good also","score":5},{"user":"LocoMojo","text":"Really like this simple recipe. Good SnV like you said but really becomes fully fleshed out around 3-5 days steep. The only reason I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars is because I think something else can be put in there. I'll try to put something in the next batch i mix (and I certainly will be mixing more) but I dont know which direction I want to go. Maybe some CAP Marshmallow for more richness and mouth feel or maybe some FA Cookie for more cookie flavor. Definitely a solid recipe ","score":4},{"user":"Apexified","text":"","score":5}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"10644","name":"Simple Sugar Cookie "}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
