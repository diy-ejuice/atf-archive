Also this is still a work in progress unless you believe its good as is. Anyway what I can say is, is that this is by far the best custard vape I've ever had. I've tried Kreeds and 3rdWorld custard but they dont do it for me. I hope you guys enjoy this one.","steep_days":"5 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"updated_at":"2020-12-12T17:11:16.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"2335","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Cream Fresh","flavor_id":"540","vendor":"FA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Creme Brulee (yc)","flavor_id":"894","vendor":"INW","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Custard","flavor_id":"4210","vendor":"INW","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Custard","flavor_id":"484","vendor":"FA","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Condensed Milk","flavor_id":"7751","vendor":"PUR","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Super Sweet","flavor_id":"2384","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":250},{"name":"Vanilla Ice Cream","flavor_id":"1511","vendor":"LB","millipercent":2000}],"reviews":[{"user":"Bjorncoetsee","text":"Only been steeping 4days and its already really good","score":0},{"user":"TheDrStore","text":"I liked this.
