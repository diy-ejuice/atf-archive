Only difference is that ice cream had alcohol in it! This is definitely creamy and tastes like cheesecake ice cream with a ribbon of thick blueberry sauce and fresh blueberries mixed in. Delicious!\r\n&nbsp;\r\n**Steep Time:**\r\nAt S&V you mostly get blueberries with some cream. It will require a steep to allow all the cream based flavors to homogenize and really come out and shine, while also converting the blueberries to a more subdued compote/thick sauce style. \r\n&nbsp;\r\n**Bilberry (FA) 0.45% / Blueberry extra (TFA/TPA) 1% / Forest Fruit Mix (FA) 1.75%:**\r\nThis combo makes a great blueberry sauce. The Forest Fruit is not quite a blueberry but it does have blueberries in it. Its fresh and ripe without being overly tart. The Bilberry adds that slightly tart element while also bending it more towards the blueberry realm instead of the \"berries\" category. The Blueberry Extra converts the blend into the more syrupy, thick and sweet sauce I am looking for.\r\n&nbsp;\r\n**Custard (FA) 0.75%  / Vanilla Ice Cream (LB) 3%:**\r\nFA Custard has a citrus note to it which pairs nicely with the sweetness of the blueberries. It also does a great job of backing up the LB Vanilla Ice Cream which can mute flavors in higher %'s. Plus custard is a very common base for actual ice cream. I chose LB Vanilla Ice Cream because its a great ice cream and it doesn't give anyone the pepper taste. \r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n**New York Cheesecake (CAP) 2% / Cream Milky Undertone (OOO) 2.5% / Vanilla Whipped Cream (CAP) 2.5%:**\r\nThis is the cheesecake base. CAP New York Cheesecake is a fairly authentic cheesecake after a good steep. I have the OOO Cream Milky Undertone in here to really help make the mouthfeel creamy like this ice cream should be. The CAP Vanilla Whipped Cream is great for mouth feel as well, however I am also using it to bump up the vanilla note a little. \r\n\r\nThis is surprisingly delicious after a day, however it really does need to steep for all the creams to come out. I am tucking this away for a few weeks and will update with the final flavor description when its ready :) ","steep_days":"21","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"updated_at":"2020-12-12T20:30:14.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"2506","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Bilberry","flavor_id":"533","vendor":"FA","millipercent":450},{"name":"Forrest Mix (forest Fruit Mix)","flavor_id":"453","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1750},{"name":"Blueberry (extra)","flavor_id":"218","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"New York Cheesecake","flavor_id":"90","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Custard","flavor_id":"484","vendor":"FA","millipercent":750},{"name":"Vanilla Whipped Cream","flavor_id":"1","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Vanilla Ice Cream","flavor_id":"1511","vendor":"LB","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Cream Milky Undertone PG","flavor_id":"6539","vendor":"OOO","millipercent":2500}],"reviews":[{"user":"DavidAnanda","text":"I have mixed 20ml of this one using following subs:&#xD;\n&#xD;\n- instead 2% TPA blueberry extra I used 1% blueberry extra + 1% FW blueberry&#xD;\n- Instead OOO milky undertone I used TPA dairy milk 2%&#xD;\n- Instead CAP vanilla whipped cream  I used TPA whipped cream 2%&#xD;\n&#xD;\nLets see what happens.
