I can’t believe I’m the first to review it. Calipipitter Chow is such a great flavour and already pretty complex so just adding the equally lovely JF Bavarian Cream was genius. I made a 10ml tester and tried it after letting it steep for 4 days. It tastes like a big bowl of thick cream with a really great caramel mixed in, caramelised roasted nuts and wafer biscuit sprinkled on top- that’s what I get anyway. It’s not too sweet but just sweet enough. "}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"120873","name":"Chow-Chow My Nuts (Low Budget Recipe)"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
