In the lychee, the balance of sweet and tart is perfected. Its light, floral taste — some say it's a grape/rose, others insist pear/watermelon — pairs perfectly with coconut, lime, and other tropical tastes\"\r\n\r\nFA Lychee provides the smooth, realistic, fresh lychee flavor supported by a touch of sweetness in the form of  Cap Sweet Lychee. \r\nFA Cream lends a bit of body and enhances the mouthfeel, which allow the lycheee to show its full potential.\r\nWS23 cools everything down without detracting from the star of show. Feel free to start the WS23 off at 0.25% and adjust up if required.\r\nSub WS23 with Koolada if needed.\r\n\r\nGood on the shake, 3 day steep for the floral notes to subside and meld with the cream.\r\n\r\nCheck out these references to see what you have been missing out on!\r\nhttps://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/06/10/what-are-lychees_n_7515240.html\r\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lychee","steep_days":"3 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":4,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:49:46.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"5522","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Lychee","flavor_id":"582","vendor":"FA","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Sweet Lychee","flavor_id":"119","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Cream Fresh","flavor_id":"540","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"WS-23","flavor_id":"8085","vendor":"OTHR","millipercent":500}],"reviews":[{"user":"kitu5","text":"This one is interesting. While I like the nebulous tropical/floral taste that is the lychee, and I flat love WS-23 for its ability to cool out and enhance any fruit it comes across, There is something...just off about this recipe for me. I honestly think it's the lack of anything to enhance the lychee outside of the cream. I realize it's here to enhance the mouthfeel, which it does ably, but it doesn't really enhance the experience beyond that, and it slightly mutes the taste a little for me. Granted, my experience with lychee is limited to juice, but this just tastes...flatter than the juice I had. Perhaps with some other floral flavor to enhance it slightly along with the cream, like a rose or a dash of honeysuckle to play up the rose vibe some people get, or a light grape? Possibly a hint of pear or watermelon? Really play up one or the other scents people get when they eat the fruit. That would make this just shine and work well with the cream.&#xD;\n&#xD;\nWhile I can't call this an ADV as it stands, I WILL note that I wreck a 2ml tank in a few hours, partially because I love the cooling sensation, and partially trying to wrap my brain around it. This in and of itself makes it a damned good juice in my book.&#xD;\n&#xD;\nThis juice is for fans of tropical flavors, lychees, iced out fruits, florals, and those who want a cool vape while having something to meditate on."}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"77351","name":"Icee Lychee"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
