If you donâ€™t like butterscotch then tbh I feel sorry for you!!! ðŸ˜‚ anyways starting off... one of the most versatile,deliciously flavourful butterscotchâ€™s I enjoy vaping is a combination of FW butterscotch ripple and FA butterscotch combined. I find these 2 really work well together so using these was a no brainer. If you want this recipe how I intend it then these 2 concentrates are a must in afraid! I was recently introduced to VTA Creme Brulee thanks to @folkart and Iâ€™ve gotta say Iâ€™m absolutely LOVING IT!! Far superior to INW Creme Brulee however if thatâ€™s all you have then you can sub it @ 2%.\r\nThe Creme Brulee is combined with FLV vanilla pudding to create the base to our delicious,rich butterscotch  pudding. The only sub for vanilla pudding is FLV vanilla custard @ 2.5% feel free to use whatever you have but just bare in mind l,it wonâ€™t be the same recipe. WF Bavarian Cream can be subbed for TPA Bavarian Cream @ 1.5% and is added to thicken the mix and smooth out the edges. I use CAP super sweet @ 0.5% as I enjoy the added sweetness and also like the way it makes the recipe pop more but if you donâ€™t want to add it,donâ€™t. Please mix and rate my recipe and as always happy mixing.","steep_days":"10","temperature":"0","recipe_score":4,"updated_at":"2020-12-12T18:30:43.000-05:00","best_vg":"80%","views":"1461","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Butterscotch Ripple","flavor_id":"1217","vendor":"FW","millipercent":6000},{"name":"Butterscotch","flavor_id":"495","vendor":"FA","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Vanilla Pudding","flavor_id":"4433","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Bavarian Cream SC","flavor_id":"10404","vendor":"WF","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Creme Brulee","flavor_id":"8864","vendor":"VT","millipercent":3000}],"reviews":[{"user":"bjorama","text":"This is a delicious smooth and creamy butterscotch treat.   I didn't think it was much to write home about.  And then I changed the cotton and put in a fresh build and then the mls began to disappear into my lungs rather quickly.   5 stars for sure.  But I gotta hold furious to a much stricter standard and not pass out a cheap 5 star ratings.    Yup furious your recipes will be rated in comparison to your body of work displayed on this site.
