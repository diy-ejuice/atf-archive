Finally VT Vanilla buttercream frosting adds the 3d edge with sweetening up the ice cream and adding a little more depth to the vanilla.","steep_days":"7","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"total_reviews":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-05T23:56:10.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"1084","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Forest Fruits","vendor":"FA","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Honeydew Melon","vendor":"JF","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Vanilla Ice Cream","vendor":"LB","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Vanilla Buttercream Frosting","vendor":"VT","millipercent":500},{"name":"Vanilla Cream","vendor":"VT","millipercent":1500}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"187570","name":"Forest Dreams"}}}
