Sometimes with fruit or nuts. A popular drink from the Indian Subcontinent.\r\nSeveral recipes of the real drink served as inspiration for this recipe.\r\n\r\nIt is perfect for my taste - fragrant, creamy and sweetish with the Pistachio always there, but not overwhelming. With ice of course. \r\n\r\nFLV Greek Yogurt with FA Yogurt combines perfectly for the yogurt base. Any possibly associated off notes are eradicated by OOO Cream Milky Undertone without taking away from the essential yogurt character. I wanted a full cream milk and OOO Cream Milky Undertone fits the bill to a tee. FA Honey imparts just enough sweet without becoming overly discernible as honey on the taste. FA Bergamot, Rose and Saffron are understated and manifest as \"pleasantly fragrant\". Adjust FA Polar Ice to your own taste preferences in respect of how much or how little cool you want.\r\n","steep_days":"10","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"total_reviews":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-05T13:08:51.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"1272","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Greek Yogurt","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Cream Milky Undertone PG","vendor":"OOO","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Yogurt","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Pistacchio (Pistachio)","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Polar Blast","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Honey","vendor":"FA","millipercent":250},{"name":"Bergamot","vendor":"FA","millipercent":250},{"name":"Rose","vendor":"FA","millipercent":250},{"name":"Saffron","vendor":"FA","millipercent":250}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"64206","name":"Pistachio Lassi"}}}
