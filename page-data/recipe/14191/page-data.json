Excellent work!","score":5},{"user":"alexmori","text":"Really nice! Faintly tastes of banana and is a nice refreshing change from the fruit heavy juice I normally vape. I bought the recipe pack from Bull City and it was so worth it! Definitely in my all day rotation!","score":5},{"user":"bjorama","text":"Very nice unfamiliar fruit milk shake.   Nice and thick and this stuff is legit!@","score":5},{"user":"HerrHut","text":"This is very hard to rate for me.  I don't know how guanabana tastes, so I can't comment on the authenticity.  I don't particularly hate it, but I'm not looking forward to vape it either.  It's a smooth vape, but something about it doesn't really agree with me.  Update after 8 months:  still have it, still don't like it.","score":2},{"user":"kitu5","text":"Having never had a soursop before in my life, and being utterly baffled by what tasted to me like a tropically vanilla milkshake with the barest hint of banana (thank god), that someone went and made with sightly sour coconut milk, I did what i always encourage people to do, and googled it. According to wikipedia: The flavour of the fruit has been described as a combination of lettuce and tomatoes, with sour citrus flavour notes contrasting with an underlying creamy texture reminiscent of coconut or banana.&#xD;\n&#xD;\nOkay, seriously, if lettuce and tomato taste like that to you, QUIT SHOPPING AT THAT MARKET.&#xD;\n&#xD;\nAnywho, this is a damned tasty vape. That creamy goodness of milkshake, the hint of sour/tart that brings to mind either slightly off but still good coconut milk or mebbe pineapple and the barest hint of banana in there just really jells together. This is totally ADV worthy, and a milkshake I'd fight Daniel Day Lewis if he tried to drink it.&#xD;\n&#xD;\nThis one's for fans of tropical drinks, milkshakes, banana haters (YO!), banana lovers (just the right amount in there to set it off), or those who want to try something that looks outside your wheelhouse but is tasty as hell.

This one is an excellent recipe! For sure this goes to my rotation now.","score":5},{"user":"MattDGTL","text":"Am shocked on how much I like this, never tried guanabana. shit is amazing! I am a  TFA VBIC pepper taster and I do not taste pepper whatsoever on this mix.","score":5},{"user":"Thadentman","text":"Excellent vape, never had guanabana irl but this is certainly an adv, great job!","score":5},{"user":"crisk","text":"","score":5},{"user":"hyperlite310","text":"Usually I'm not into banana, due to all of the Nana Cream clones, but this stuff is amazing! FLV Can be hit or miss, but they really knocked it out park with guanabana and this is by far the best use of it yet to date. ","score":5},{"user":"SteamOn","text":"Good off the rip, Having never had a real guanabana I can only say this is great. Going to wait a few days to let the ice cream pop out a bit but it is good right away, Judging by the other reviews I will have this sitting close by for the next few days. Good job MiLLs.","score":5},{"user":"ConcreteRiver","text":"A balanced and absolutely delicious recipe.  That milkshake base is on point, but the guanabana is the start of the show.  It's got a just barely unfamiliar fruit taste that keeps you coming back for more.  Awesome stuff and really smart mixing.","score":5},{"user":"ID10-T","text":"I can't really comment on authenticity since I've only ever had guanabana nectar and not the actual fruit, but with a juice that tastes this good, who cares about authenticity? It just hits all the right spots, with a tartness that works like a tart fresh strawberry or a bit of pineapple and makes an excellent counterweight to the sweet, creamy milkshake base. That tartness kept me coming back and never getting bored. I try to give some constructive criticism on every critique but I'm mostly drawing blanks here, as this is a 5-star, ADV quality vape and I can't think of anything that might make it better than it already is... balance, mouthfeel, originality (in the sense that I've never had anything quite like this before, I know the milkshake base was borrowed but that was a great decision to make), everything about this is just gets it done. 10ml left me wanting more without any thoughts on how I might try tweaking it, and that is rare. Great recipe!!!","score":5},{"user":"RuntDastardly","text":"Mixed this on 10/2 and didn't get around to it until 11/22, so, I don't know if anyone's tried it this well-steeped (or even needs to) but, man, this is excellent! That guanabana is a really exciting break from the usual strawberry-cream profile, but hits all those tart/sweet/creamy notes in much the same way. I love it! Thanks for sharing this recipe!","score":5},{"user":"tw2k","text":"The guanabana is such a unique flavor, and the choice of creamy complements are well balanced. Thanks for the great recipe.","score":5},{"user":"jbird","text":"I never have had the real thing. But, if this recipe is anything like that, I must find it! After a week steep, this is delicious. Great job!","score":5}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"14191","name":"Batido de Guanabana"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
