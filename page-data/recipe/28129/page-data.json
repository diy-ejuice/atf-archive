I was looking for a good Bavarian Creme Doughnut and I looked for a bit and couldn't find much. There were a couple of things that were simple that I mixed up and didn't care for. I decided to make this my first mix. I am aiming for biting into the center of the doughnut here. The ooey, gooey center bite that results in a super creamy feel.\r\n\r\nZeppola/YC/Joy: This is the doughnut base. Zeppola is one of my favorites here. I tried TPA - Frosted before this and it just didnt fit right. There was something off, or artificial with it. I've tested this as a doughnut base, and it gives me a \"Fresh fried doughnut\" feel; slightly yeasty as well. This is my base I use for many doughnuts now.\r\n\r\nBavarian Cream/French Vanilla Creme/SC/Meringue/VC: This is my Bavarian Cream. The custard/meringue combo gives me a slightly thicker cream. I tried without those, and it felt too \"watered\" down. \r\n\r\nThe chocolate glaze: DCC. This is use lightly, as I just wanted it as a thin glaze. \r\n\r\nI was asked how the vape experience was, and this was my reply: Its got a strong fried doughnut taste on the inhale and beginning of the exhale. Then its followed by the Bavarian cream/semi creamy flavor, with a very slight chocolate at the end of the exhale. It's a pretty thick and dense vape. Very flavorful. A couple of people have commented on the fact that the French Vanilla is so high, but it is not as strong after the steep; gets toned down by the other flavors in the mix. The doughnut taste lingers on the tongue, with a little bit of the cream as well.\r\n\r\nIf you want a little more balance, more even texture/doughnut to cream feel, you can drop the Bav Cream down to about 1% or so and drop the french vanilla cream down to about 1.5%. This adds more of a texture and balance to the mix.","steep_days":"14","temperature":"0","recipe_score":4,"updated_at":"2020-12-12T18:29:03.000-05:00","best_vg":"65%","views":"25693","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Zeppola","flavor_id":"6312","vendor":"FA","millipercent":4000},{"name":"French Vanilla Creme","flavor_id":"168","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Bavarian Cream","flavor_id":"145","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Cake (yellow)","flavor_id":"1222","vendor":"FW","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Sweet Cream","flavor_id":"183","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Meringue","flavor_id":"530","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Vanilla Custard","flavor_id":"131","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":500},{"name":"Double Chocolate (clear)","flavor_id":"158","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Sweetener","flavor_id":"1432","vendor":"FW","millipercent":250},{"name":"Joy","flavor_id":"401","vendor":"FA","millipercent":250}],"reviews":[{"user":"WalleBiela","text":"Tried it after just a week. Amazing. That perfect amount of chocolate at the end of the exhale keeps me want to take another and another and..... puff.&#xD;\nVery well put together cream doughnut. Can't wait to see how it evolves. Made a 60 but will make a bigger batch so i can reach there. Thank you.","score":5},{"user":"phried","text":"Great overall balance of the cream, chocolate, and donut glaze (zeppola) - an easily ADV-able mix. Forgot I had one steeping, found and tried it after two months. Amazing vape, now I'm afraid of running out and always keep at least a 60mL on hand.","score":5},{"user":"Ebc88","text":"Steeped for the recommended 14 days. At first all i could taste was the zeppola but been vaping it on and off for 3 days and i guess i have gotten used to the zeppola and can taste the creamy goodness as well. Really reminds me of a bav cream donut. Solid recipe ","score":5},{"user":"Jerikorayne","text":"well off the shake this is not bad i made some % changes just brought some stuff down a bit well done tho i get the bavarian cream comes to me first then that nice dounut with a light chocolate i think this will realy come together after a steep i will report back on it in a week good job on your first post ","score":4},{"user":"heatbbx","text":"This is really good. Steeped for 2 weeks it turns into gold. Cream isn't too overpowering and a nice donut is present with just a hint of chocolate. Well done!","score":5}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"28129","name":"Bavarian Cream Doughnut"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
