I really like this recipe!! \r\nI don't have time to right out my flavor notes as of now but this needed to be shared!!! I have an atomizer I usually always vape nutty recipes out of and its always in my rotation. I have a feeling this recipe will be in my nutty atomizer for a while because this checks all the boxes that I wanted to check!!!!âœ”âœ”âœ”âœ”ðŸ’¯\r\n\r\nSide note: \r\nI know baklava is most commonly made with pistachio but hazelnut isn't unheard of and it just vapes better!!\r\n\r\nCORRECTION: \r\nI had a 5 day steep listed when this juice is so much better  after a 10+ day steep. It is great after 5 days Burr it gets even better. I have experienced this with other nut flavors I have made and with those I prefer a 30+day steep. So I imagine that this flavor will work the sa!e way so if you have some around still after 30 days it will be magical.
