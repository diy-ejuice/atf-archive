This recipe is available as a flavor pack on Bull City Flavors!](http://www.bullcityflavors.com/grab-apple-by-the-melons-by-exclusive-girl-pick-choose/)\r\n\r\n**Grab apple by the Melons** aka **Melon Hi-Chew**  \r\n\r\nThis blend starts off as a refreshing realistic melon with a hint of mixed apples. As it steeps, both the Apples and the LA Watermelon come out more adding a mouth watering candy affect similar to eating a melon and apple hi-chew. This is a refreshing ADV that I can't stop coming back to. \r\n \r\n**Flavor/Development Notes:**\r\nMy initial goal was to create a realistic perfectly ripe melon salad with some chopped up apples mixed in. A flavor that felt juicy and refreshing with a touch of crispness from the apple blend. Well I over did it a little on the LA Watermelon and it candied it. I ended up liking it so much it turned into my ADV. It takes about 4 days steep for the LA Watermelon to really blend in and add that mouthwatering candy feel.\r\n\r\n**Sweet Watermelon (CAP) 2% / Wild Melon (FLV) 1%:**\r\nThe sweet watermelon felt lacking in fullness/roundness. Its almost like a watermelon that's just starting to pass its prime and needs to be eaten before the flies make a meal of it. Its still good, just on the sweeter side. Adding the wild melon rounded out the flavors nicely. Wild melon is a mixture of watermelon, cantaloupe, and honeydew melon. The combo of the melons in wild melon are very tasty and I recommend this flavor on its own or mixed with other melons.  \r\n\r\n**Watermelon (LA) 2%:**\r\nInitially was to just add a mouth watering affect. It did that successfully then candied it to the point that its more of a hi-chew (the more realistic version of a mamba for those who haven't had it before). I would drop it down to maybe 0.75% if I want to go back to achieving a realistic watermelon but I really like where the 2% took this.  \r\n\r\n**Anton Apple (INW) 0.75% / Fuji Apple (FA) 3%:**\r\nAnton Apple is more of a granny smith style apple; acidic, crisp, and my favorite type of apple. The Fuji Apple helps balance out the acidity by adding a refreshing sweet bite. It also helped bring the watermelon sweetness out of that too sweet zone and back to the sweetness I was looking for.  \r\n\r\n**Cactus (INW) 0.25%:**\r\nAdds the juicy, wet mouthfeel that that every watermelon flavor needs. Not much more to say about this since it doesn't affect the taste at such a low %.

As a shake and vape, it's a vibrant watermelon and apple. After about a month, It's become a sweet, juicy mix of watermelon and apple. I can't really taste the cantaloupe, but that's just as well, really. Not truly a fan of that flavor by itself, so that it melds into the rest just speaks well as to how good this recipe is. &#xD;\n&#xD;\nAs it also tastes pretty bang on to the Hi-Chew candy, so points for accuracy. As this is a profile I hit up pretty much because it was on the Bull City Community packs, and I plan on vaping all of those, I wasn't surprised as to how good it is. I am surprised as to how much I like it. Very much ADV worthy.&#xD;\n&#xD;\nThis bad boy is for those who like watermelon and apple, simple profiles that are just cracking (and crack-like), fruit fans, and candy fans."},{"user":"Thadentman","score":"5","text":"As I am finishing my 7th 30 ml bottle in the past couple months I just realized I haven't reviewed this yet. Watermelon and cantaloupe is mostly what I am getting from this but it's a very full and balanced vape with the apples lightening up and adding some flesh. Not a very complex vape but extreme flavor bending is what makes this so unique, It's difficult to put this recipe down and for a guy that vapes 1 or less fruit vape per month going through 7 in 2 months says a lot. Great job!"},{"user":"Friction2600","score":"5","text":"Fantastic, really good mix, i actually bought INW Anton Apples just to mix this up b/c the recipe intrigued me so much and I'm glad i did. I havent tried this as a shake and vape so I cannot speak to that, but using the 7day steep it was fabulous. Thanks for sharing, keep up the great work!"},{"user":"jbird","score":"5","text":"This is truly awesome! You get the melon throughout the entire experience. Then, on the exhale, you pick up the apple and cactus that leave your mouth watering with delight. If you have the flavors, mix it up. If you don't, buy them. You will not be disappointed. Great job!"},{"user":"Mikeysmixes","score":"5","text":" You nailed it!!! This is my 2nd batch, and as I said before..............this is so realistic it makes my mouth water!! Like Philo said, \"mix up another bottle for later!\" It ages so well!"},{"user":"Philosaphucker","score":"5","text":"Tart, sweet, bright, and juicy. This is truly a delight. I like this right away, but mix up another bottle for later because you will definitely want to try the deeper sweetness that comes out as it ages."},{"user":"ID10-T","score":"5","text":"Truly mouthwatering. It has a feel to it that makes me think of a fruit slushy drink, not a Slurpee, but like someone took actual frozen mixed melon balls, put them in a blender, added some apple juice and simple syrup, and whizzed it up.
