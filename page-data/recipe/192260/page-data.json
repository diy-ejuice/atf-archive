It does not taste like coconut. The idea of harnessing a small amount of Lorann's take on Pina Colada to give this blue raspberry the unique richness of a ring pop was the last thing AlfredPudding gave me before he gave up vaping and mixing to go dress up in tactical gear to set farm animals free or whatever he's doing now. I just finally got around to putting the finishing touches on it and tweaking the concentrations for maximum nostalgia-trip authenticity. I don't think you could sub either of the berries or the pina colada and get similar results. But for the little bit of hard candy sheen the FW Hard Candy puts on it, if you don't have that but do happen to have TFA Apple Candy, 0.75% of that should do.  \r\n\r\nDoes not need sweetener. Plenty of that with the WF Sour Blue Raspberry Candy. \r\n\r\n____________________________________________________\r\n\r\nWant some tunes to listen to while enjoying this? I might put together an \"AlfredPudding left us\" playlist. \r\n\r\n1.
