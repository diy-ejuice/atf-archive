Both these flavors, OOO Butter Pecan Ice Cream and WF Butterscotch Cream Pie are great standalone flavors for a recipe. They're incredible and authentic tasting flavors!! I thought by pairing them together it would make a great recipe and boy was I right! Everything is there... The creaminess and body of the butterscotch, the smoothness of the butter pecan ice cream, and a slight hint of caramel. I'm using TPA Caramel Candy as the bridge between the 2 flavors and it did the job. This is a wonderful and simple but complex tasting recipe. \r\n\r\nTry it out and give me your feedback!","steep_days":"5","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:51:42.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"688","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Butter Pecan Ice Cream","vendor":"OOO","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Butterscotch Cream Pie","vendor":"WF","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Caramel Candy","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Super Sweet","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":500}],"reviews":[{"user":"notsonattynate","text":"I mixed up a 60ml of this and vaped it at work.
