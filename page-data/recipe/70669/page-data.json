Like honeysuckle and tobacco, but coconut and tobacco never crossed my mind. You took 2 recipes I have tried and enjoyed and blended them together &amp; it works well. Them tobacco combo you used from Abuela works really well in here and doesn’t overpower the coconut. "},{"user":"horrend","text":"I'll start by saying I lowered the cheesecake graham crust to 0.5% in this (I do the same with leche de coco otherwise I get nothing but graham, my palate is weird). Other than that I mixed this as is, this is a great mash up of two great recipes. I was thinking of what I could sub the mango in Abuela for to make a different vape and the first thing that came to mind was coconut so finding this helped me. It's a great vape, I get the same cigar goodness from Abuela with a light creamy coconut at the back end. I'll definitely be mixing up more of this.
