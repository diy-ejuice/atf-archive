Adjusted the recipe slightly since it's steeped. The gin seemed to fall back just a bit more than I wanted it too after it steeped so I added just a tad more, and the citrus soda also fell back a bit more than I wanted so I added a touch more of that. Lowered the sweetener a tad too as that popped out more than I wanted after it steeped. \r\n\r\nEverything else in the recipe has stayed the same. I just ignored the cucumber element in this picture as to me it is just decoration and probably didn't add anything to the actual drink. lol  Overall without the sweetener (a version I made for myself) I enjoy this quite a bit as a gin drinker myself. The alcohol notes are pretty subtle which in a soda drenched drink it wouldn't be slap you in the face alcoholic anyway.  I'm sure VTA Botanical Gin or FA Gin could also be added into this if you want a little more of an alcohol note, but personally I didn't want that. While you could sub the FLV gin for FA gin, it will be a little less aromatic in terms of gin, and a little more alcoholic, and I'd probably turn up the percentage a tad with FA gin.  VTA Botanical could also be subbed but I'd probably turn the percentage down a bit from the FLV amount as it's a tad more aromatic.  FLV is just somewhere in between. \r\n\r\nYou can mix without sweetener and get a good result, but for more of an authentic soda type feel to it sweetener works better.  I picked PUR over the other sweeteners because it is strong and not drying, so it doesn't take away from the wetness of the drink.
