I just gave it a little boost with VT Bilberry Ripe. The shell is the glorious HC Eggroll for that crispy fried texture and powdered sugar note. For the cream cheese filling I used a combo of OOO Vanilla Custard Cheesecake, which is a little sweeter and icing like, and Inw Yes We Cheesecake which is dense and rich. This could be vaped right away but I really feel a week is needed to let the flavors in this mix bloom to their full potential.","steep_days":"5 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-05T16:44:18.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"930","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Bilberry Ripe","flavor_id":"9886","vendor":"VT","millipercent":500},{"name":"Blueberry","flavor_id":"1201","vendor":"FW","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Egg Roll","flavor_id":"9273","vendor":"HC","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Vanilla Custard Cheesecake","flavor_id":"6532","vendor":"OOO","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Yes, We Cheesecake","flavor_id":"9272","vendor":"INW","millipercent":3000}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"163582","name":"mlNikons BB Cannoli "}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
