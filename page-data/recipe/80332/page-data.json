Here's a really simple and quick take on that profile. A strawberry, pear, honeysuckle vape. Please keep in mind that INW Lime is very potent, I typically only use 1-2 drops per 30ml depending on how lime-y I want that particular bottle to be.\r\n\r\nI might add flavour notes later on, but for now, this is really good as is, and everything really blends together after about 3 days. Hope you enjoy, and if you've had Placid before, let me know if I'm even remotely close to whatever that juice is supposed to taste like.","steep_days":"3 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"total_reviews":2,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:49:48.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"2660","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Honeysuckle (pg)","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":3750},{"name":"Pear","vendor":"FA","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Pear","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Strawberry (ripe)","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":6000},{"name":"Lime","vendor":"INW","millipercent":100}],"reviews":[{"user":"Thadentman","score":"5","text":"Very well done!
