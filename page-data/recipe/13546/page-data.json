"},{"user":"Asire","text":"One of the only recipes i've mixed where the description and ingredient list exactly describe what you will taste. No pounding flavors in here just a really nice mix of the graham cracker with a bit of cream and honey. The mashmallow brings it all together and adds a delicious slighly toasted undertone. Very nice "},{"user":"kindground","text":"I like this profile a lot. The graham and the honey are really good together. I have issues with FLV cream and for some reason Toasted Marshmallow amplifies that tangy off note I get. At first I thought I'd bring the TM down. Next I tried subbing FA Cream Fresh in. Bingo. FLV Tangy Cheese was the culprit! Love it with this 1:1 sub. "},{"user":"Ebc88","text":"Pleasant well balanced recipe I didn’t add the Meringue and steeped for a week. Honey and creams are coming through nicely, but not getting all of the Graham"},{"user":"MrBurgundy","text":"I threw in the 1% Meringue like a couple of other reviewers. This recipe is deliciously delightful. It’s smooth and creamy with a light but deep sweetness that really satisfies. Cheeba did a great job balancing this one. Easily an ADV. Thanks for sharing, man!"},{"user":"AndreM","text":"Reminds me very much of Dulce de leche made the Argentinian (proper) way. Light and not too sweet. ADV material. Thank you for the recipe."},{"user":"Lupeie","text":""},{"user":"RuntDastardly","text":"Mixed on 10/2 and only just now getting to it on 11/18. I don't know how you do it, but, this is another must-have juice in my rotation. How is something so unfussy this satisfying?! I think you're under-selling this one. There's a lot going on here for a tired palate to see and do. Seriously yummy stuff. Thanks for another banger, CheebaSteeba!"},{"user":"LocoMojo","text":"Mixed with the 1% Meringue addition. At first shake I was skeptical but after a week of sitting around it turned into a sweet smooth and dense delight. Definitely a good mix and a good flavoring. The way it tastes I'm sure it will improve even more after additional days in the steep box."},{"user":"Thadentman","text":"I also added the fa meringue at 1%, This is a really great mix "}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"13546","name":"Milk & Honey"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
