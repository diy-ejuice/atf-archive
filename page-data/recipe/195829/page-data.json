The rainbow berry candy from one on one flavors smelled almost identical to it, and mixing it at 10% yields something extremely close to Nerd Alert. I personally think it is a little better because it doesn't have that slight \"waxy\" mouth feel texture to it.\r\n\r\nIf you are unfamiliar with this eliquid, it is supposed to taste like nerds candy, I personally don't get that from it. I get more of a tropical starburst candy from it. So if you are into this type of flavor profile you will enjoy this super simple mix.","steep_days":"0 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"total_reviews":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T20:33:28.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"656","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Wild Berry Rainbow Candy","vendor":"OOO","millipercent":10000},{"name":"Super Sweet","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":150}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"195829","name":"Nerd Alert ?Remix?"}}}
