Is it fucking delicious? Absolutely. Mixed this one up twice just to try it with my own personal preference (fe lemon) and man is it delicious. The in-your-face fistfull of flower petals that fe green tea tends to be is quite tame here just adding a nice soft floral roundness about the whole recipe. The dragonfruit also helps tame and mix everything together on top of a nice soft lemon base that pervades the whole vape. The top note of subtle sweet cherry blossom kicks in around 3 days steep and the jasmine hangs back nicely. The whole vape is well balanced, light, and an easy adv."}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"47242","name":"Green Blossom Tea"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
