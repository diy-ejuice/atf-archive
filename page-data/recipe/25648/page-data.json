Almost like eating powdered tang or cool aid.  It has a nice tang, but too much orange up front for a sweet tart.  In a sweet tart I get the tart candy up front combined with the artificial fruit flavor.  In this I cant get away from the strong orange powder note.  Not a bad orange candy type, but would need to overcome that orange flavor to get that authentic sweet tart.  This may be my palate because orange flavorings are strong and overpowering to me.
