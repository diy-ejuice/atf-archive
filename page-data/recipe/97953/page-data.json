Redone and revamped with some major improvements. It is a peach/honeydew main profile, with some kiwi, and watermelon in the supporting role. All of the fruit is mingled with some sweet cream and Koolada is just a hint of coolness. This vape is very refreshing summer vape that gives you a light sorbet feeling on your palette. Was a favorite back in the day, and I have a feeling this is going to come back into the rotation once more.  \r\n\r\nhttp://e-liquid-recipes.com/recipe/782134/Peach%20Better%20Have%20My%20Honey\r\n\r\nHere is the old recipe if anyone is interested.
