The CAP VC does a good job keeping it from being dry, and it's a nice balance between the lemon and blueberry.  There's something about it that keeps me from vaping it for days in a row, but it's certainly nice as a change of pace from different profiles.  ","score":4},{"user":"CrowHop","text":"One of my ADV, taste like a fresh lemon cookie with a little blueberry on top. Very nice.","score":5},{"user":"BathtubBooze","text":"Excellent recipe. If you like FE Lemon and FW Blueberry as much as I do then you'll love this one. ","score":0},{"user":"Kittybit","text":"This is some serious good stuff. I was a little sceptical at first with the 1.5% INW biscuit, as we are so used to this around 0.5%, but I must say that the CAP Vanilla Custard really combats the dryness INW Biscuit usually has. So a very easy and tasty recipe the Developed boys has made here.","score":5}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"167162","name":"Lemon & Blueberry Cookies | BMW | DEVELOPED"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
