I've been meaning to put more use to it.\r\n\r\nFE Lemon - The king of lemons, and just enough to fuse with Lavender so that neither dominates the other.\r\n\r\nINW Pear - IMO the King of Pears. Provides an accurate and gentle pear note that rests alongside the lemon and lavender.\r\n\r\nFW Pink Bubbly - This one provides effervescence without additional flavor changes, like TFA Champagne or VT Fizzy Sherbet.\r\n\r\nFW Sweetener because I like it better than CAP Super Sweet,\r\n\r\nWS-23 - I put this into just about anything; kicks up the flavor just a tad, and brings in the chill wind.","steep_days":"2","temperature":"0","recipe_score":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-11T16:21:17.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"1276","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Cactus","flavor_id":"647","vendor":"INW","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Honeysuckle (pg)","flavor_id":"306","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Lavender","flavor_id":"510","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Lemon","flavor_id":"1655","vendor":"FE","millipercent":1500},{"name":"WS-23","flavor_id":"8085","vendor":"OTHR","millipercent":250},{"name":"Dragonfruit","flavor_id":"226","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Pink Champagne","flavor_id":"1380","vendor":"FW","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Pear","flavor_id":"665","vendor":"INW","millipercent":750},{"name":"Sweetener","flavor_id":"1432","vendor":"FW","millipercent":500}],"reviews":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"150413","name":"Golden Pear"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
