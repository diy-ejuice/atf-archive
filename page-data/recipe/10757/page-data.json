This one is very simple, but very good! It's one of those that gets better over a few days, although it does the job perfectly fine as SnV. I usually have it with t work with some other flavors, but I mainly grab for this one. Bonus: This was the recipe that made me like CAP Sugar Cookie as I hated it before. Good shit!","score":5},{"user":"kallyver","text":"I have to agree with kitu5. Without a sweetener it tastes a bit off. I added CAP Super Sweet to it, and it's a good ADV. The lemon flavor fades quite quickly, so 2-3 days of steeping is the sweet spot for this juice. Great job!","score":4},{"user":"kitu5","text":"Huh. How the hell am I the first to review this? Anywho.&#xD;\n&#xD;\nWhile this is most assuredly what it says on the tin, I find the flavor to be a little off. You can totally taste the lemon, and it is most assuredly a sugar cookie. However, it's just a little...off. Like the cookie is stale, and the lemon somewhat artificial. Gonna try it with a dash of sweetener, like one drop per 10ml...&#xD;\n&#xD;\nOkay, holy hell. That brightened things up considerably. The lemon is now vibrantly tart, and there's that little extra kick in the sugar cookie that says freshly made rather than store bought. Definitely a good, easy recipe, and thankfully, an easy fix to get it where i wanted it to be. As it's the same thing I noticed the first time I tried it, and realizing I can't give it what I want to give it, which is 4 and a half stars, I apologize for merely giving it 4 on what may well just be my taste buds talking. Sorry bout that.&#xD;\n&#xD;\nStill, nice one!","score":4}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"10757","name":"Lemon Cookie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
