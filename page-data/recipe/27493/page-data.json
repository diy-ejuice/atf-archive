It would be 5/5 if it wasn't so harsh. "},{"user":"ID10-T","text":"This is a tasty recipe. Does Juicy Peach really do some magic on Sweet Raspberry? Yes it does. I don't even think 6% Sweet Raz would be palatable without it, so that's a pretty damn neat trick. Sharing this trick is a special kind of community service for people who don't have access to better Blue Raz flavors such as OSDIY's Blue Raz Slushy. It doesn't really taste as \"blue\" as I want it too, but it's quite bit better than TFA and FW Blue Raz flavors.

That Juicy Peach really lifts the Raspberry, and as OP said, really creates the blue raspberry flavor. This tastes comparable to a blue raspberry jolly rancher, or a blue raspberry icee. Amazing recipe!"},{"user":"FizzChaser","text":"I agree. A tasty 5 star vape. First time I mixed this up I used CAP Sweet Peach. Just made a second batch with Peach (Juicy). And I have to say I like the Sweet Peach a bit better. But either one is pretty great!"},{"user":"OldAgeVaper","text":"Nice mix, just as the title says and its nice and tasty 5 stars from me and a second 30ml mixed up.&#xD;\nthanks for putting it up. !!"}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"27493","name":"Blue Raspberry Candy"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
