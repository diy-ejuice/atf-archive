The Double Chocolate is what I had on hand to start with and it seems to work well at this ratio. The Creme De Menthe is the creamy mint portion, and the Koolada is the the cooling sensation on the exhale. The sweetener is there as more of a binder than anything else, not sure why but without it the mint is very strong and the chocolate doesn't come through as much. I played with this for quite some time before coming up with the final blend that works well as a shake and vape but is great after about 48 hours.","steep_days":"2 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"total_reviews":1,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:48:54.000-05:00","best_vg":"80%","views":"1899","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Double Chocolate (clear)","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":12000},{"name":"Creme De Menthe","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":6000},{"name":"Koolada 10 Pg","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Ethyl Maltol","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":500}],"reviews":[{"user":"DataNotAnecdotes","score":"5","text":"I have a story about trying this recipe. My wife and I were driving, and she asked what I was vaping. \"Eh, it's supposed to be a York Peppermint Patty recipe, but the chocolate's kinda thin and shitty, the cream is non-existent, and all you can taste is menthol\", to which she followed up with \"So...tastes just like a York Peppermint Patty?\". Which is when it hit me. This recipe is absolutely, 100% spot on to a York Peppermint Patty. I just really, really don't like them. I've even verified this with one friend who enjoys them, who really enjoys this recipe. So, subjectively, the taste of this recipe is two stars, but on the technical side of things, this recipe seems to capture the essence of a York Peppermint Patty. It just comes down to whether you enjoy that or not."}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"19838","name":"Peppermint Patty"}}}
