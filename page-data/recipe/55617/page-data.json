First impressions was it tasted like the peanut butter in a nutty bar. From my mixing experience I knew INW Biscuit would work well for the wafer. I also like the way INW Milk Chocolate and FW Hazelnut work together. It might need minor tweaking, but after 3 days steep I think it really close. Any feed back is more than welcome.\r\n\r\nFULL DISCLOSURE. This is an old bottle of INW Milk Chocolate. It may or may not be the old formula. I ordered it in late Nov early Dec 2016. So substituting INW Milk Chocolate for something else might be in order. I know wayne subbed it out for JF Milk Chocolate in his recipes.","steep_days":"3 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"updated_at":"2020-12-12T18:29:21.000-05:00","best_vg":"60%","views":"3820","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Peanut Butter","flavor_id":"291","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":5000},{"name":"Milk Chocolate","flavor_id":"796","vendor":"INW","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Biscuit","flavor_id":"642","vendor":"INW","millipercent":1250},{"name":"Hazelnut","flavor_id":"1312","vendor":"FW","millipercent":500}],"reviews":[{"user":"Wafflepriest1","text":"Nails the flavor profile as close as possible in vaping - a smooth, prominent peanut butter with a hint of sweet biscuit/cookie that's finished with a light milk chocolate note.
