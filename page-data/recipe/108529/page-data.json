It tastes just like a smooth and refreshing sweet mead straight out of a horn.  As the last reviewer said, It's a rich, yet gentle flavor that's good for any time.  Only downside I've noticed so far is that it seems to be easily tainted, so take care when switching to this from a different flavor, and make sure your coils and cotton are clean."},{"user":"cdaniell30","text":"I love this.  It's rich enough for a full vape, soft enough for vaping when you're sick, and flavorful enough to throw in an MTL for a softer caramel vape."}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"108529","name":"Makers Mead"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
