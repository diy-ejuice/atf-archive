This will take you back to the candy shop, you've bought a large scoop of clear wrapped lemon sherbets and your mouth is watering as the shop assistant pours the scoop into a brown paper bag and with out taking your eyes off  the paper bag that is handed to you by the shop assistant, you pay with out looking else where and blindly head out of the shop door and place your hand into the bag to retrieve just one lemon sherbet that will be savored on your trip home.\r\nOn the inhale you have your sweet lemon, the exhale is a party of sherbet that is similar to breaking the center of the lemon sherbet candy. The sherbet is most certainly further enhanced by the pleasures of lemon. I see the honey bringing sweetness to the lemon, so it is never sour, but just to make sure, a little sweet mate never goes astray.\r\nTested on an RDA.","steep_days":"1 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-06T05:11:38.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"1238","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Honey Lemon","flavor_id":"8899","vendor":"VT","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Fizzy Sherbet","flavor_id":"8878","vendor":"VT","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Sweet Mate","flavor_id":"8981","vendor":"VT","millipercent":500}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"103478","name":"VT Le'Mone Sherbet"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
