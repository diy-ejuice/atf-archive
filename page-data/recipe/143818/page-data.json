While originally created as a concept mix, I did actually enjoy it. This is an updated version largely improved and yet different from original in many profound ways. It is a reimagining of life after being focused on problems, this here is the solution.\r\n\r\nMain Note:\r\nINW Plum/FA BC - Not very many recipes use Plum, but I loved its dryness, yet it was just a hair short of full. Plum to me is a bit thin at 1 and at 2 it's at it's limit. I wanted to give it a deeper fruity vibe and sweeten it up so I went with FA Black Cherry, and a touch of FW Sweetener.\r\n\r\nBase:\r\nFA Black Tea/VT Lemonade Clear/VT Sour lemon - This combo was used to create a lighter tea feel and a less sweet lemonade base to fit the dryness of the fruit. FA BT can probably be bumped up a bit if you want more tea out of it or maybe add a support with something less intense/more forgiving.\r\n\r\nAccents:\r\n\r\nFLV Yakima Hops/Pink Guava/INW Cactus - This adds some very slight funk to the whole mix that at these low levels adds just a hint of tropical funk and wetness. It folds under the rest quite nicely to me.\r\n\r\n(Optional) Coolant:\r\nFA Polar blast - I also mix this with Polar Blast at 0.4%,","steep_days":"1 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T21:32:57.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"1092","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Plum","vendor":"INW","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Cherryl (cherry, Black)","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1250},{"name":"Lemonade Clear","vendor":"VT","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Tea Black Water Soluble","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1750},{"name":"Sour Lemon","vendor":"VT","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Yakima Hops","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Pink Guava","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1250},{"name":"Sweetener","vendor":"FW","millipercent":500},{"name":"Cactus","vendor":"INW","millipercent":400}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"143818","name":"Arnold Plumber revisted "}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
