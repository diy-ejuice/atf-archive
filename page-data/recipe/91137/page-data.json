I used yogurt and vanilla creme for a base then added some fruits.  I really like cherry crush - it's not a strong cherry - more like a cherry punch- sweet and a bit candy-ish - although I haven't single-flavor tested it.  But I've used it a couple times and it adds a nice flavor imo.  Then lucky leprachaun and biscuit for some crunch - off the shake that doesn't come out yet.","steep_days":"3 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"total_reviews":1,"updated_at":"2020-12-02T07:39:00.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"1053","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Strawberry (ripe)","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1600},{"name":"Fresh Strawberries","vendor":"WF","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Cherry Crush","vendor":"FW","millipercent":1600},{"name":"Blueberry (extra)","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1600},{"name":"Greek Yogurt","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":3000},{"name":"French Vanilla Creme","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Biscuit","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Lucky Leprechaun Cereal","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Super Sweet","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":500}],"reviews":[{"user":"Mr-G","score":"none","text":"well"}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"91137","name":"berries and yogurt"}}}
