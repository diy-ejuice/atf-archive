Like I stated before, I've been really enjoying the combination of **TFA Kentucky Bourbon + FLV Bourbon**. Together these guys create a deliciously rich and smokey, sweet blended bourbon flavor. It really works excellently as our glaze in combination with with our “sticky” ingredients.\r\n\r\nGlaze Block. **VT Golden Syrup + TFA Toasted Marshmallow**. We all know and love the wonders of Kentucky Bourbon and Toasted Marshmallow thanks to /u/coop34 . Toasted Marshmallow helps “char” that bourbon and brings smoky sweetness to our glaze along with mouth feel. Golden Syrup makes things stickier and thicker, and also helps elevate our sweetness. It acts as a binder for our cinnamon to create those crunchy cinnamon sweet clusters we find covering our pecans.\r\n\r\nCinnamon Block. **FLV Rich Cinnamon**. If a recipe calls for cinnamon, 99% of the time I'm using this. It's an unparalleled bakery cinnamon that is sweet and potent.\r\n\r\nPecan Block. **FW Butter Pecan**. Another concentrate I consider best in class is this one. It's smooth and buttery, it almost has a warm taste. It's decadent and dense and nutty. This is what we attach all of our blocks too. Bourbon and Cinnamon to glaze, and the glaze to the pecans.\r\n\r\nThat's about it. It can be SnV'd but solidifies over about a week. In my opinion this is pretty straightforward, and reminds me of those bags of pecans you get from the little carts at your local County Fair. Enjoy!\r\n\r\n\r\n","steep_days":"7 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"total_reviews":1,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:50:29.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"1530","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Toasted Marshmallow","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Kentucky Bourbon","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Butter Pecan","vendor":"FW","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Rich Cinnamon","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":150},{"name":"Bourbon","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":750},{"name":"Golden Syrup","vendor":"VT","millipercent":1500}],"reviews":[{"user":"MrZigglesworth","score":"5","text":"Every time I got to a festival or a carnival I'm always on the look out for exactly this.
