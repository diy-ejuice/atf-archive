The dish had marshmallows, cream cheese, and pineapple. I thought it would make a great profile to replicate. Not a complex recipe but very delicious. Not much to mention on flavor notes, pretty self explanatory....just a nice creamy, marshmallow, pineapple vape. Can be a Shake n Vape but only gets better with time. Suggested steep time, 3 days. This is a first version. I normally post my first versions of recipes and keep 2nd or 3rd versions private for commercial purposes. MaxVG ....Enjoy :)","steep_days":"3 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":4,"updated_at":"2020-12-12T11:50:47.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"3575","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Pineapple","flavor_id":"259","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Marshmallow","flavor_id":"473","vendor":"FA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Cream Cheese Icing","flavor_id":"2380","vendor":"LA","millipercent":2000}],"reviews":[{"user":"dwinans","text":"Mixed this up last weekend.
