And for good reason. Creamy, buttery coconut with a clean melon flavor. It breaks up the monotony of your ADV of Strawberries and Dragonfruit on top of being refreshing and unique.\r\n\r\nGood as a Shake & Vape but gets better after a short steep.\r\n\r\n\r\nUpdates and Revisions:\r\n\r\n10/29/19:\r\nCoconut (TPA) 1.5% to Coconut (FA) 1%\r\nI can't believe I didn't think of this before. Duh.\r\nCoconut Candy (TPA) lowered to 1%\r\nTo better compliment FA Coconut.\r\nIntroducing Honeydew II (TPA) at 2%\r\n\r\n5/23/19:\r\nLowered Butter Cream (CAP) from 1.5% to 1%. \r\nThis should be a supporting flavor and I feel this change reflects that.\r\n\r\n4/30/19:\r\nOmitted Almond (FA). \r\nAs much as I wanted to continue to keep FA Almond in this mix, there was not much of a difference. Feel free to continue adding it to your own mixes, but at .5%, it seemed unnecessary.\r\n\r\n3/21/18 BIG UPDATE:\r\nRevised:\r\nAlmond (FA) 1.5% to .5%\r\nCoconut (FA) to Coconut Candy (TPA) \r\nVBIC 3% to 4%\r\nAdded:\r\nToasted Marshmallow (TPA)\r\nCoconut (TPA)\r\n\r\n2/19/18:\r\nWent back to A/AP VBIC. After testing, I have concluded that Diketones are delicious and in small quantities, I have had no problems. Ordering Sweet Coconut (FLV) and will continue to test.\r\n\r\n9/17/17:\r\nChanged Golden Butter (CAP) to Butter Cream (CAP). The Butter Cream lends a bit of sweetness and still brings that buttery note I wanted.\r\nLowered the Honeydew (TPA) by 1%. I feel that 3% still brings that overall melon tone, but perhaps without nose raping you.\r\n\r\n3/9/17:\r\nChanged Toasted Almond (TFA) to Almond (FA). I feel like the sweetness of Flavour Art's Almond will really shine in this recipe. \r\nChanged Butter to Golden Butter to reflect Capella's decision to change the name.\r\n\r\n5/19/2016: \r\nI have reworked the recipe to replace VBIC with A/AP free VBIC. I don't expect a noticeable taste difference.\r\n\r\n10/15/15: \r\nI've taken out the Cantaloupe and reworked the other percentages.\r\n\r\nSide note: I've seen my recipe re-posted on other sites and re-posted here. I'm glad you guys like it!\r\n\r\n9/18/15: \r\nI steeped for 3 weeks and it was quite close. I reduced the Cantaloupe and upped the Honeydew. I really feel like I'd miss the Cantaloupe if it wasn't there, so I'm trying a reduced batch before I consider omitting it all together.\r\n-vix","steep_days":"7","temperature":"0","recipe_score":4.5,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:50:03.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"2474","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Butter Cream","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Coco' (coconut)","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Coconut Candy","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Honeydew II","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Toasted Marshmallow","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Vanilla Bean Ice Cream","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":4000}],"reviews":[{"user":"SlashaLO","text":"To start off this tastes amazing. I enjoy Honeydew quite a bit and this mix hit the spot. The balance is great. The cream subdued the sharp points of the honeydew very well. I assume the toasted marshmallow is there for mouth feel and some sweetness, so it plays well here though I don’t know if it’s necessary, but plays a part. The almond I feel isn’t necessary, I am unable to get taste or texture due to the honeydew and vbic in here. It doesn’t hurt but I don’t think it helps. Butter cream blends with the vbic nicely to create a great cream. The coconut is a hard one for me. I have to search for it quite a bit but it’s there. I think it’s because of the honeydew at 3%. I don’t know if dropping it to 2% would lend the same flavor while allowing a little more coconut or not. It’s there but I really have to search. I think it had a more texture and sweetness with some cream, more than anything. All in all, this is very tasty. Ive never had the original so I can’t compare to it, but I will be mixing this again. "},{"user":"ParDeus","text":"TRY THIS RECIPE!!!  I hate coconut.  I hate melon (vape flavors anyhow).  This shit is amazing.  I will admit, I like it better with 3% JF Honeydew Melon instead of TPA, and I used 0.5 FLV Sweet Coconut instead of the TPA Coconut in the modified recipe, but both are amazing!!!"}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"93342","name":"Koi"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
