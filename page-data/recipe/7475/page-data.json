So far I don't like this at all. To me it doesn't taste of Cha Thai at all, whether from a restaurant or making it myself. I can't taste the sweetness of the condensed milk or the spiciness of the Thai tea spices. I have a vague dark sorta creamy flavor, almost chocolaty and I don't find I can vape it. I'll let it sit another couple of weeks or more and see if the taste changes but I don't have much hope. I'll amend my review if this gets better for me but until now, this is a complete miss for me."}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"7475","name":"Thai Tea"}}}
