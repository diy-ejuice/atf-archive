That way the juice won't be overly dry feeling in the mouth. This will show up in the mix day one. a few days steeping and the cucumber disappears from the mix.\r\n\r\nSalt Water Taffy  FW - Very potent but when used in the 0.50% to 1.00% range can really add a nice taffy texture to a juice.\r\n\r\nSuper Sweet CAP - Gives it that commercial brand kick you see in most premium eliquids.\r\n\r\n-A large credit goes to Dragonlady over at the /r/DIY_ejuice subreddit for a good base starting points on a mystery air head flavor.

I'm not 100% if my variation tastes like how it should in comparison to yours, but this is a mighty fine vape, and I like what you did with the Cucumber, making the vape rather vibrant and not so dry like other taffies I've had in the past. I'll definitely have to order FA cherry to get the full experience of what you created, and I think is deserving of a 5 star rating :) nice job!"}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"163869","name":"Mystery - An Air Factory #Remix"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
