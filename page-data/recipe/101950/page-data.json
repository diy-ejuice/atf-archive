I like it enough to be my first public recipe. After trying Charlie Noble's Raspberry Ripple, I knew I needed to try my hand at it. This a pretty close to what I remember about it. \r\nThe raspberry sweet is obviously a great choice for a sweet, almost jammy raspberry, but lacked a little body. That's why I threw in the FA Berryl.\r\nThe rest is easy, just get a rich, deep, creamy vanilla ice cream. Feel free to sub out your favorite VBIC if you can't do the TPA. \r\nI feel like the white chocolate and the vanilla shisha provide a really delicious touch to the ice cream, with the shisha providing a very nice spice vanilla note on the finish.  It really does remind me of a vanilla bean ice cream with a generous swirl of raspberry puree in it.\r\nGive this one a good 5 days to come together, but as always, the longer the better. \r\nI mixed this at 70/30 vg/pg and vape exclusively out of a Hurricane 1.3 RTA and it's very flavorful.\r\nI really hope you guys dig this one. Please let me know what you all think, good or bad!","steep_days":"5","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:50:11.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"2442","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Raspberry (sweet)","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":5500},{"name":"Berryl (raspberry)","vendor":"FA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Vanilla Bean Ice Cream","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":5500},{"name":"Marshmallow","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Super Sweet","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":500},{"name":"Shisha Vanilla","vendor":"INW","millipercent":500},{"name":"White Chocolate","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":3000}],"reviews":[{"user":"ObiWanCannoli","text":"Nice recipe. Unfortunately I'm one of those damned black pepper tasters when it comes to TPA VBIC and WC so I had to sub those with LB VIC and FW WC instead. Let this one steep for a week and everything blends nicely. Raspberry is fairly subtle but a nice flavor, like a raspberry jam or syrup, with a nice rich ice cream base. The white chocolate goes nicely with the raspberry as I've found out in a white chocolate and raspberry kit-kat recipe I've been tinkering with. A nice little recipe to break my steady stream of chilled fruit vapes for the summer heat. Keep up the good work, look forward to more recipes."}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"101950","name":"Raz Ripplez (Thanks Charlie!)"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
