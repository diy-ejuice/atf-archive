Taste good of the Shake. Give it 3-5 days for all the creams to meld together to make it perfection. \r\nSweet Strawberry: A Very candy like strawberry with a syrupy backbone to it and brings in a ton of flavor to the mix.\r\nFA Juicy Strawberry: This taste like Ripe strawberry but with a bit more juicy ness that you get from a real Strawberry.\r\nTFA Cheesecake Graham cracker crust: This has a nice subtle graham crust to it , while adding a rich, milky, thick creamy cheesecake flavor.\r\nTFA Sweet Cream: Brings in a heavier cream base that is sweet and has a nice cheesy taste to it to ehance the Cheesecake.\r\nTFA Vanilla Custard: at just a very low percentage does not take over the mix and does not add to steep time but adds just a nice buttery brightness to the mix.\r\nHS french Vanilla Bean ice cream.: a Thick creamy ice cream that almost leaves a Buttermilk taste to the recipe. Pairs very welll here.\r\nFLV Cream: Creamy, light vanilla and Milky a must have to really represent the dairy notes to the recipe. \r\nTFA Honeysuckle: This adds a nice sweet delectable bit of floral ness to they recipe while adding hints of honey. Itâ€™s a great addition to the Strawberries.\r\nCap Supersweet: This makes the recipe Shine more and create a bit more vibrancy. \r\nWhat you left with after a good 5 day Steep is a nice Strawberries and Cream cheesecake with hints of honey, thick milk, butter and a cream flavor that is so delicious you be coming back for more. Feedback is encouraged. Thanks and Happy Vaping. \r\n\r\n","steep_days":"5","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"updated_at":"2020-12-12T08:13:15.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"1391","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Sweet Strawberry","flavor_id":"121","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Juicy Strawberry","flavor_id":"8779","vendor":"FA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Cheesecake (graham Crust)","flavor_id":"152","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Sweet Cream","flavor_id":"183","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Vanilla Custard","flavor_id":"188","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":500},{"name":"French Vanilla Icecream","flavor_id":"2129","vendor":"HS","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Cream","flavor_id":"604","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Honeysuckle (pg)","flavor_id":"306","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Super Sweet","flavor_id":"2384","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":500},{"name":"Raspberry (sweet)","flavor_id":"267","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":500}],"reviews":[{"user":"cdaniell30","text":"Perfect mix for when you want something thick and rich, yet light enough on flavor to be a summertime ADV","score":5}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"86172","name":"Strawlicious Suckle Cheescake"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
