Basic but delectable. Pistachio pudding with caramel, vanilla, and cookie crumble notes. Enjoyable as a shake and vape but suggested 10 day steep, gets better with more time.","steep_days":"10","temperature":"0","recipe_score":4,"updated_at":"2020-12-12T11:51:18.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"5670","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Ry4 Double","flavor_id":"379","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Sugar Cookie","flavor_id":"115","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Vanilla Custard","flavor_id":"131","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Pistachio","flavor_id":"293","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Vanilla Swirl","flavor_id":"189","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Kentucky Bourbon","flavor_id":"361","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":250}],"reviews":[{"user":"elsignor","text":"awesome mix, perfect balance. love it","score":5},{"user":"ambzizbanannerz","text":"My hubby wanted me to tell you thank you this is one of his top fave I mix for him","score":5},{"user":"wh1skeyk1ng","text":"Probably the richest, thickest, most savory vape I've ever had.  3% pistachio makes it almost seem genuinely salty.  The bottom end of this vape is thick and sweet, yet it has a slightly salty top note.   Excellent recipe, the pistachio really shines, and the pudding base is impeccable. ","score":5},{"user":"Wafflepriest1","text":"Sweet, satisfying, and addicting. Mixed without Kentucky Bourbon, as I do not have it. Inhale is a pistachio custard, not very eggy but has a full mouth feel. Exhale is where the sweet pastry comes in with a hint of caramel from the RY4-Double that lingers almost as an aftertaste. Very close to Nobleman by Charlie Nobles or PRy4-U by Enyawreklaw, but this one is my personal favorite recipe for this profile.","score":5},{"user":"JayAbides","text":"","score":4}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"69229","name":"Nobleman | Pistachio Pudding"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
