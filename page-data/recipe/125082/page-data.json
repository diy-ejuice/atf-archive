Together they give me a buttery, flaky danish type pastry with just enough cooked gooey-ness. I used walnut for a slight nuttiness and to add a little texture to my pastry. The orange marmalade infuses my dough with a thick, sticky, cooked orange flavor. Topped off with a generous portion of rich, buttery caramel cream.","steep_days":"7","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-06T07:15:55.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"1269","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Butter Toffee Base","flavor_id":"8844","vendor":"VT","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Creme Caramel","flavor_id":"8865","vendor":"VT","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Croissant","flavor_id":"8867","vendor":"VT","millipercent":5000},{"name":"Orange Marmalade","flavor_id":"9895","vendor":"VT","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Walnut","flavor_id":"8996","vendor":"VT","millipercent":1000}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"125082","name":"OCD"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
