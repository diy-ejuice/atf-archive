I vape about 180 ml of this a week. Mostly in the fall thru the winter. Very good with coffee. I like it off the bat. But it seems to age very well. After 5 days very good. Mix at 60/40. Been making this recipe for about 5 years. Absolutely my all time favorite vape. Give it a try. It's nice and sweet. Taste  like a wonderful light vanilla caramel coffee. The biscuit is optional. I just like it cause it adds a bit of grain to the texture that I enjoy.","steep_days":"5","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:49:40.000-05:00","best_vg":"60%","views":"2495","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Cafe Napoleon Flavoring","flavor_id":"5122","vendor":"DFS","millipercent":6000},{"name":"French Vanilla","flavor_id":"4977","vendor":"DFS","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Ry4 Double","flavor_id":"379","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Biscuit","flavor_id":"642","vendor":"INW","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Super Sweet","flavor_id":"2384","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":500}],"reviews":[{"user":"Demented76","text":"I was a little nervous about mixing this one when I saw how much coffee flavoring that you used but I read the reviews and thought \"What the heck, I will try it.\"  This is SO good!  The DFS flavors are too pricey to ever share it with anyone though lol.  I will be hoarding it all to myself.  Thank you for this gem."},{"user":"TamVapes","text":"Excellent recipe. Delicious. Thanks for sharing. "},{"user":"finger_style","text":"I decided to order the diyflavorshack flavors for this because I have always wanted a good coffee vape but am always disappointed with the results. Damn this stuff is delicious off a shake and vape. Creamy and rich with some complex Carmel and coffee notes and one of the best vanilla finishes I've ever had in a vape. After a few days it gets even creamier but the Carmel notes seem to blend with the biscuit to taste almost graham cracker like. I'll be enjoying this with coffee all winter. Give this one a try if you love dessert vapes! "}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"69480","name":"French Cafe"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
