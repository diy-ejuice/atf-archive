Many have tried, most have failed but a savior is here in the form of Shape up Pear! It is an all-encompassing true, authentic, natural pear: skin, flesh, grittiness and all! \r\n\r\nThis semi-sweet, fresh pear accurately represents the best bits of a ripe pear with ease and, I suspect, will become the natural go-to pear for many a mixer. I bolstered the (delicate) pear note with a touch of FA Pear to make sure it kicks through our frulata base, which can easily dominate less robust flavors. \r\n\r\nThe milkshake base is given a smoothie twist with a dollop of yoghurt to cut through the sweetness by adding a smidgen of tartness, which balances the sweetness of both the pear and milkshake base alike.  The milkshake base, penned by @Freshepies, is simply the very best milkshake base around - thick and creamy vanilla ice cream blended to absolute perfection.\r\n\r\nGive this baby at least 5 days for the creams to meld and enjoy!\r\n\r\nDevelopment notes: https://youtu.be/_7hEvaB7LqE\r\n\r\n","steep_days":"5","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"total_reviews":2,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:50:57.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"1822","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Cream Milky Undertone PG","vendor":"OOO","millipercent":1500},{"name":"French Vanilla Icecream","vendor":"HS","millipercent":750},{"name":"Vanilla Ice Cream","vendor":"LB","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Shape Up Pear","vendor":"MB","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Yogurt","vendor":"FW","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Pear","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000}],"reviews":[{"user":"Pam","score":"5","text":"This is excellent and very well-balanced. I mixed it because you used MB Shape Up Pear, my favorite pear. I am really enjoying this and I think you for posting it. I think I will add a small amount of WS-23 for an icy vape but maybe not because it is wonderful as it. I did sub FLV Greek Yogurt for the FW Yogurt because that is what I have on hand. It seemed to work just fine!"},{"user":"PhyllisRae","score":"none","text":"Gonna definitely try this! i need a good pear recipe.
