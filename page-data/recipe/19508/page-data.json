It is actually a invention from the sisters Tatin from France. History tells us that this tarte was invented by a little accident that happened to the appletarte, which felt down and they were thinking what else they could do with the already baked apples, so they decided to caramelize the apples and cover them with a sheet of puff pastry and they put it in the oven upside down. Afterwoods they did turn the tarte around and this was the result....The Tarte Tatin was borne.\r\nIt is a appletarte with loads of butter and sugar inside for the caramel, nice warm and great for the cold winterdays.\r\nThis vape actually tastes like the real Tarte tatin, which i already made hundreds of times in the kitchen. Enjoy the recipe and like always please let me know about it if you mix it up.  \r\nGreetings and regards from Belgium  Chefproject","steep_days":"7","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"total_reviews":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-06T20:38:55.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"1459","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Apple Pie","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":4500},{"name":"Double Apple","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Carmel (caramel)","vendor":"FA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Butter Cream","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Super Sweet","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":500},{"name":"Graham Cracker Clear","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Meringue","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Brown Sugar","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Hazelnut","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Butterscotch Ripple","vendor":"FW","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Pie Crust","vendor":"FW","millipercent":1000}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"19508","name":"Tarte Tatin"}}}
