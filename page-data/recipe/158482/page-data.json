Sweet, yet tangy, the combo of 2-1 FA White Peach to Cap Yellow Peach really works fantastically.\r\n\r\nCap Marshmallow forms the backbone of the cream/sweetness and the LB Van IC + Cap Van Whipped really make it thick and luscious. It really lingers on the pallet and has a great mouthfeel.\r\n\r\nFA Pear is just to knock down any peach astringency and also to add wetness. Up the pear if you find it to be too dry for your likings.\r\n\r\nSweetener to taste, I only added Rick's van to this because of the vanilla notes I was already using. Super sweet to taste, but I think 0.1% is more than enough on top of the Rick's .5%","steep_days":"7 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"total_reviews":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T19:16:10.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"1167","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Peach White","vendor":"FA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Yellow Peach","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Marshmallow","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Rick's Vanilla Sugar Daddy","vendor":"TBV","millipercent":500},{"name":"Vanilla Whipped Cream","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Vanilla Ice Cream","vendor":"LB","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Pear","vendor":"FA","millipercent":250},{"name":"Super Sweet","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":100}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"158482","name":"Peaches and Cream aka \"Panty Hamster\""}}}
