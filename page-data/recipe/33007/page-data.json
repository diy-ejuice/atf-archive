But in the 1990s, Lemon Coolers disappeared from grocery store shelves after the cookie’s maker, Sunshine Biscuits, merged with Keebler in 1996.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThis recipe is 100% DIY or Die community created. I started with a simple Biscuit and Lemon sicily and asked the group (via Facebook) how they suggested I tweak it to give it that powdered sugar feel and taste and a good lemon bite that was blended into the cookie, not overpowering it.\r\n\r\nI will take 100% of the criticism as I published the final recipe under my name, but the guys in the DIYOD facebook group deserve the credit for getting this all-day-vape off the ground.","steep_days":"7 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-05T08:04:46.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"1417","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Biscuit","flavor_id":"642","vendor":"INW","millipercent":500},{"name":"Cookie","flavor_id":"490","vendor":"FA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Hazelnut","flavor_id":"70","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":500},{"name":"Lemon Sicily","flavor_id":"524","vendor":"FA","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Meringue","flavor_id":"530","vendor":"FA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Sugar Cookie","flavor_id":"115","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Torrone","flavor_id":"550","vendor":"FA","millipercent":750}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"33007","name":"Lemon Cooler v2 "}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
