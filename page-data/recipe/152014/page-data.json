But man, that cherry is totally fixed. While I was mixing it I tasted the apricot and could noticed some shared notes and I think it smooth the sharp edges of the cherry. I don't notice the \"candy\" flavor at all, and the cherry is sweet and natural. I thought that the sweet guava would be off but I imagine it is to lift the general flavor because I do notice that the grape compound in the candy mutes the flavor a little bit. Congratulations Alfred, not only the final product, but the process behind it is incredible!"},{"user":"ID10-T","text":"Did Alfred really create a magic formula to fix cherry medicine off notes? No, unfortunately. I first tried this with 2% FLV Rainier Cherry in place of the INW Cherries, because I'd heard it worked with CAP Tart Cherry and might be some sort of miracle. It was still quite GNARLY. But all that really proves is that FLV Rainier Cherry is beyond help. Mixed it again as it is written here.... with a terrifying, unusably high amount of INW Cherries. And all I'm getting is a shake and vapeable sugary sweet super tasty bright red cherry candy juice. With no medicine!!! So, while I can't personally recommend experimenting with this using other cherries, I can definitely sign off on mixing it up just way it is. It's yummy.
