I changed around some percentages, and came out with this. It's pretty delicious, but I'm thinking the gingerbread could be brought down just a tad along with the HS Pumpkin Pie, but I like where both of them are at personally. \r\n\r\nIt's rich in pumpkin flavor as well as spices! It takes around 3-5 days for it to come together, but it just keeps getting better and better with time. HS Pumpkin Pie tastes really odd at first, but definitely becomes rich and full of pumpkin goodness.\r\n\r\n\r\nI'm conflicted in putting this as an original recipe, because I used two others to get to this point, so I'm just going to leave that off, even though I feel like it is, there's definitely no debate it was inspired.","steep_days":"7","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-06T20:42:35.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"1222","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Pumpkin Pie","flavor_id":"5896","vendor":"HS","millipercent":5000},{"name":"Pumpkin Spice","flavor_id":"1387","vendor":"FW","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Chai Tea","flavor_id":"346","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Rich Cinnamon","flavor_id":"638","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":150},{"name":"Gingerbread","flavor_id":"324","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Holiday Spice","flavor_id":"305","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":250},{"name":"Sweet Cream","flavor_id":"117","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Cream Fresh","flavor_id":"540","vendor":"FA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Madagascar (Vanilla Classic)","flavor_id":"526","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"20071","name":"True Pumpkin Spice"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
