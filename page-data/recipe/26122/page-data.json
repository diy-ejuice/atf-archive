I know most people do not have Purilum Ocean Myst but I do believe it is worth picking up. It is still called NR Ocean Myst on ATF. This is the only place to get it https://www.nicotineriver.com/collections/purilum-flavor-concentrates/products/purilum-ocean-myst As a standalone at 8-10% it is a great grape juice flavor, here at 4% it is just noticeable enough to be our grape skittle, and it provides extra tartness to the mix.**\r\n\r\nInstead of adding CAP lemon sicily and FA lime Tahity I used CAP Lemon Lime because it does both jobs and adds more candy flavor to the mix.\r\n\r\nFA Black Cherry boosts the JF sweet strawberry while sweetening the whole mix.\r\n\r\nFW Blood Orange (natural) is what I used, I think the regular one can be subbed at the same percent. This guy is obviously the orange skittle. \r\n\r\nI wanted to keep this recipe as simple as possible so JF strawberry sweet is the only strawberry that I included, it is the best candy strawberry flavor IMO and if I could only pick one strawberry here it would be this one.\r\n\r\nThe combo of marshmallow and vanilla swirl provide the right amount of creamy aftertaste you get from a skittle. FA marshmallow is my favorite but you can sub TPA, imo the new CAP marshmallow is a bit more 'authentic' than TPA or FA so if you use that one I'd go lighter with it because to me it stands out as more marshmallowy. \r\n\r\nThis is tasty as fuck as a shake and vape. Give it 2-3 days or not!\r\n\r\n\r\nHeres my flavor review for Ocean Myst \r\n\r\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/5nlqau/prl_ocean_myst/\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is version 1, all input appreciated!","steep_days":"2 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T02:13:49.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"1830","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Blood Orange","vendor":"FW","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Ocean Myst","vendor":"NR","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Vanilla Swirl","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Marshmallow","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Strawberry Sweet","vendor":"JF","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Lemon Lime","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Cherryl (cherry, Black)","vendor":"FA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Blackcurrant","vendor":"FA","millipercent":500}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"26122","name":"Skittles "}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
