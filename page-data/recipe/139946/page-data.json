VTA watermelon to me,,, is one of the best watermelon out there, and I have tried most of them.\r\nVTA watermelon is super strong, I found out the hard way !!! I also bought most all of my VTA straight from Australia,,,, shortly after they became public, a whopping 45$ shipping cost !!,......  To me I have not found to many that I don't like, and a lot of the flavors are damn good, The watermelon mixed at .50 ,,,,  and 3.00 INW strawberry, the watermelon is very present and damn good. I am getting a delightful juicy, mouthwatering watermelon on the inhale, and a perfect strawberry on the exhale. This is a keeper for me. I'm using a Hussar Legacy on top of Drone 250C , @.15ohm , @ 56watts.","steep_days":"7","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-06T20:44:37.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"963","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Quince Jelly SC","vendor":"WF","millipercent":750},{"name":"Strawberry","vendor":"INW","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Sweet Coconut","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":200},{"name":"Watermelon","vendor":"VT","millipercent":500}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"139946","name":"Strawberry Melon Jelly"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
