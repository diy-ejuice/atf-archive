This isn't bad, the strawberry is definitely there.  It does need more butter though.  The toast is spot on.  Not really a clone of the original, but pretty tasty.  Good job on this one.","score":4},{"user":"Frin","text":"","score":1},{"user":"souporman","text":"","score":1},{"user":"matthewkocanda","text":"lmao so you basically just ripped Wayne's recipe to make your own?
