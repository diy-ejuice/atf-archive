It is a meringue dessert with a crisp crust and soft, light inside, usually topped with fruit and whipped cream.  The dessert is believed to have been created in honour of the dancer either during or after one of her tours to Australia and New Zealand in the 1920s    The nationality of its creator has been a source of argument between the two nations for many years.  The dessert is a popular dish and an important part of the national cuisine of both Australia and New Zealand, and with its simple recipe, is frequently served during celebratory and holiday meals.\r\n\r\nFA Meringue  -  FA is just my  favorite meringue as I think it has more texture of the crispy outershell and is easy to work with.    It  provides the foundation  of the mix along with Banana cream  and the Toasted marshmallow \r\n\r\nTPA Banana cream - provided a little more of the whipped cream volume along with a slight banana back note I wanted , with out adding an additional banana flavor\r\n  \r\nTPA Toasted Marshmallow  - adds   more texture for the   for the meringue  \r\n\r\nDouble Kiwi , juicy strawberry and   Forrest  fruit provide the fruit topping -    FA juicy strawberry is a sweetened fresh strawberry for me and will stand up to the cream in  the front of the mix.    The Forrest fruit provides for some of the darker berry  base notes I wanted.      Double  Kiwi  adds  that sugar sweeted fruit note that will be present through  front and back of the vape.     \r\n\r\nLemon Sicily -  is an additive  to help  add more juiciness  to the fruit and helps the fruit  notes pop  out from the cream. \r\n\r\nvanilla whipped cream - provides the cream that is part of the actual recipe and adds some vanilla that is present but not over the top  and helps to blend the  mix together \r\n#DIYDOWNUNDERAPRILCHALLENGE\r\n","steep_days":"5 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-11T14:16:41.000-05:00","best_vg":"7%","views":"1565","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Banana Cream","flavor_id":"210","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Forrest Mix (forest Fruit Mix)","flavor_id":"453","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1300},{"name":"Juicy Strawberry","flavor_id":"8779","vendor":"FA","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Kiwi (double)","flavor_id":"242","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1750},{"name":"Lemon Sicily","flavor_id":"524","vendor":"FA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Meringue","flavor_id":"530","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Super Sweet","flavor_id":"7787","vendor":"PUR","millipercent":300},{"name":"Toasted Marshmallow","flavor_id":"340","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":750},{"name":"Vanilla Whipped Cream","flavor_id":"1","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1500}],"reviews":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"97482","name":"The Aussie Pavlova #DIYDOWNUNDERAPRILCHALLENGE"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
