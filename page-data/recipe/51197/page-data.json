Amazing Cigarello flavour. Well done!"},{"user":"Rawtune","text":"This is day 15 for me and wow this is awesome. Cured and Kentucky Blend give a really nice tobacco note. The holy vanilla and shisha come together to give a nice vanilla tail, and the Ry4 gives a slight sweetness to bring together the tobaccos and vanilla. This might become an ADV for me. I think next time I'm going to sub HS RY1 for the RY4 and see how it goes."}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"51197","name":"Holy Nilla Rillo"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
