Full bodied with a nice thick mouthfeel, this is very much a dessert vape. The spiciness of the vanillas is tamed somewhat by the CAP Vanilla Custard and the Bavarian Cream. \r\n\r\nI like to vape this both when it is fresh, and after a few weeks steeping. After a day's steep it is quite intense and bursting with flavour. After a 2-3 week steep it begins to mellow and develop a much fuller, thick mouthfeel thanks to the CAP Vanilla Custard. I have never been able to make a batch last more than a few weeks, but I imagine it just keeps getting better. :)","steep_days":"21 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T23:36:27.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"1488","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Holy Vanilla","vendor":"DFS","millipercent":500},{"name":"Vanilla Bean Ice Cream","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Shisha Vanilla","vendor":"INW","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Vanilla Custard","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":7000},{"name":"Bavarian Cream","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Vanilla Swirl","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1500}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"96849","name":"Milli Vanilli "}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
