Its pretty god damn good. Lots of stuff in it. Some cinnamons. Some crunches. Other things too. \r\n\r\nI've been forcing people to try different versions of this recipe for the last month and this is by far the best and most authentic. A sharp cereal with a touch of milk, works as a Shake and Vape but really forms after two or three days. I recommend it to everyone.","steep_days":"3 (SNV)","temperature":"450","recipe_score":4.9,"total_reviews":52,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:48:57.000-05:00","best_vg":"60%","views":"66139","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Cereal 27","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Rice Crunchies","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Toasted Marshmallow","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Pie Crust","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":750},{"name":"Cream Fresh","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Sweet Cream","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":3500},{"name":"Cinnamon Danish Swirl","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":3000}],"reviews":[{"user":"MikeRaf23","score":"5","text":"taste just like cinnamon toast crunch ! end of story. nice job !"},{"user":"Don_Bil","score":"5","text":"I love Cinnamon Toast Crunch and cereal vapes in general. This has to be the best I have ever made and tasted. I did have to make a couple of subs as I only have regular TPA Marshmallow and FW Sweet Cream. I feel like it could be even better with toasted marshmallow. Will deffo get that on my next order as I WILL be making this again and again. Top recipe.

It's exactly what it says on the tin. So much nostalgia. You are single handedly responsible for making me spend a whole night vaping this and watching Boomerang just to get my old school Saturday morning cartoon fix to go with the taste of the cereal that accompanied it.&#xD;\n&#xD;\nBANGER!"},{"user":"Anton_Prymak","score":"5","text":"Amazing recipe, mixed it so many times already"},{"user":"AlfredPudding","score":"5","text":"This is my favorite recipe so far, because it demonstrates what is possible with DIY flavor creation. It is a very accurate profile of Cinnamon Toast Crunch with nice touch of sweet, rich milk. The somewhat grainy mouthfeel that is produced by a sizable amount of cinnamon, wheat, and rice, along with the notes of cream and marshmallow really instill this recipe with a sense of nostalgia. The pairing of Cereal 27 and Rice Crunchies gives this recipe a wonderful body that really completes the cereal effect. After steeping for a few days the cinnamon from the Cinnamon Danish Swirl mellows out some which allows for the other flavors to come through more. The most interesting part of this recipe to me is how Pie Crust is used to add a hint of dark, caramelized sugar. I do recommend trying this recipe with a small amount of sweetener added for the cinnamon sugar aspect to come through. Other than that I don't have anything that I would alter about this recipe, it's seriously awesome and I highly suggest that you mix some up if you haven't already."},{"user":"diesel223","score":"5","text":"Just finished making my second batch of this stuff, wow!! I'm fairly new to mixing but this is by far the most accurate rendition of a profile. This vape taste exactly like it says, it is undeniably cinnamon toast crunch with milk.

You can feel the milk along with the texture of the cinnamon cereals.&#xD;\nI noticed that 3 days was not enough steep because of the cinnamon which was a bit aggressive for me, and I love cinnamon."},{"user":"Jbirdy34","score":"5","text":"Love this stuff. Great recipe!"},{"user":"Mr-G","score":"4","text":"not too bad "},{"user":"Kudo","score":"5","text":"I was originally turned off by this recipe after mixing it, reading another review about it being a spot on shake and vape. Seriously do not shake and vape this... It needs a steep. I actually gave it to a buddy and it sat in his cabinet for a week before I tried it again and oh my god, dead-nuts accurate CTC. &#xD;\nI do get a bit sick of it after having it in my tank all day but it doesn't get much better than this. Hands down my favorite cereal vape, kudos man. This recipe definitely deserves all the praise it's been getting"},{"user":"Bradmaden","score":"5","text":"The profile is so accurate, definitely my favourite cinnamon and/or cereal vape.

The memory of the taste was a little foggy but the moment I dripped this on my coils I had a moment of \"Oh yeah, that's what Cinnamon Toast Crunch tasted like\". Spookily accurate and delicious, have been through 200ml of this easily. Inspirational work dude!

Most don't have a great balance and are usually all cinnamon. &#xD;\n&#xD;\nThis is fantastic after a few days steep, but after a few weeks it is PERFECTION!!! This really should have been named Radlad instead. The taste is cinnamon toast crunch cereal with the milk left at the bottom of the bowl. It is the best cinnamon toast crunch recipe I have tasted....hands down."},{"user":"hyperlite310","score":"5","text":"If you like cereal vapes, look no further. This (like others have said) is 100% spot on. Usually I am not a fan of Cap Sweet Cream, but it works so well here with the fresh cream, creating the perfect bottom of the bowl cereal milk. 10/10! "},{"user":"ChefJohn","score":"4","text":"A fantastic cinnamon vape. &#xD;\nWell balanced. &#xD;\nI'm not getting \"Toast crunch\" but more along the lines of a bearclaw pastry. &#xD;\n&#xD;\nI'm not getting a lot of cream either, but will adjust review if it just needs more cure time for my tastes.

Everything blends perfectly recommend to all who have been searching for  this cereal"},{"user":"dazcole","score":"5","text":"What can I say? When I seen that this recipe contained cap CDS I honestly continued to carry on walking it's definitely a flavour I'd totally fell out of love for but after some positive feedback I pulled the trigger and thought I'd try. The actual recipe looked great it has everything I enjoy apart from CDS but hey I could be missing out not trying. Wow as a cereal fan this doesn't disappoint everything works together beautifully it's crunchy, it's sticky and thick bodied and the cream blends perfectly to prevent the flavour from drying out. What I love is the CDS isn't forward it's enough to add plesent notes of mystery alongside the toasted aspect of the marshmallow and pie crust . Great use of flavours that I would never imagine would work. Highly recommended I'm glad I mixed a large batch it's definitely going into my rotation."},{"user":"Vurve","score":"5","text":"I am honestly in awe at how amazing this is. This is truly Cinnamon Toast Crunch. Never again did I think I would be able to vape CAP CDS, but it's balanced so well to lend it's pastry cinnamon flavor to the snap of the cereal and pie flavors. On top of that, the brown sugar flavor has been absolutely nailed, without any sort of brown sugar flavoring. Even down to the milk with the FA Cream Fresh and CAP Sweet Cream. It's perfect. Everything is perfect. There is no point in trying to replicate Cinnamon Toast Crunch as long as this recipe exists."},{"user":"NotCharlesManson","score":"5","text":"Absolutely incredible! It's a little harsh the first day, but really comes together after the second or third day, so be sure to give it at least a couple days. The CDS isn't too overpowering and lends its pastry qualities to combine with the Cereal 27 to work in a really unique way. I never would have thought to add TFA Pie Crust to something like this, but it works so well here. I feel like it's that one flavor that changes the profile from a cinnamon cream pastry to the Cinnamon Toast Crunch flavor we all know and love. The Toasted Marshmallow brings just enough malt to the profile to keep it from having too much of a straightforward milk/cream feeling, while providing that sticky, lingering mouthfeel I love.&#xD;\n&#xD;\nRage definitely has a talent with balancing flavors to create a profile I keep coming back to, and this is going to be something I'll be making a big batch of to make sure I won't run out anytime soon. Really impressed with this recipe (if you couldn't tell)."},{"user":"Fear","score":"5","text":"This is a really good cinnamon toast crunch cereal. I personally get more of a bottom of the bowl taste from it that whole bowl. Maybe I need to let it steep longer than 24 hours. Fantastic as a shake and vape, mix bigger than 30 approved, and you might even be able to get the full steep test on it :)"}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"23772","name":"Sadlad Toast Crunch"}}}
