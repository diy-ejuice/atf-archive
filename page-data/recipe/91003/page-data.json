I'm going for a melon mint gum. I didn't want an actual bubblegum flavor, more of an orbit or trident style gum. So I went with RF Taffy base and TPA Marshmallow to get the actual gum portion. Everything else fell into place right where it needed to be. Summer is right around the corner and I see this in my regular rotation so give this one a try if this sounds like something you might enjoy. Shake and vape approved.","steep_days":"1 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"total_reviews":3,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:50:00.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"1898","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Taffy Base â€“ SC","vendor":"RF","millipercent":750},{"name":"Wild Melon","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Red Summer (watermelon)","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Marshmallow","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":750},{"name":"White Winter (spearmint)","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Super Sweet","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":250}],"reviews":[{"user":"Mr-G","score":"none","text":"let u know"},{"user":"Bdisuzu01","score":"none","text":""},{"user":"Synergy","score":"5","text":"Exactly as described - and perfectly parallel to Orbit light mint gum.
