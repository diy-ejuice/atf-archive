The Candy Wizard is used to sweeten and add a jammy richness, while balanced with the sour notes of Sour Wizard, and everything is softly smoothed with a bit of TFA Smooth.  \r\n\r\nThis works well as a shake and vape recipe, but if you find it a touch harsh shake and vape, add up to 1% TFA Smooth to calm down the harsh notes as long as you don't plan to steep it. If you are going to steep for the 2 weeks it needs to be fully steeped leave the smooth levels as is in the recipe. I do also suggest adding (if you enjoy it) 0.75% FA Arctic Winter (Menthol) and 0.2% WS-23 to this mix. It adds a lovely element to it that I quite enjoy. If you do not like menthol or Cooling you can leave one or both out if you dislike them.
