It's a right tasty little number. The apple shines, bright and crisp, the honeysuckle is fragrant and sweet, but not overwhelming. The hint of lemon is a lovely spark of bright citrus sitting in the middle of the inhale, making things a little more vibrant. Ant then, there's the dragonfruit; the kinda sorta like a pear or is it a kiwi with the flavor therein missing that translates into a juicy mushiness on my tongue. It adds a goodly amount of juicy mouthfeel, and with this mixture of flavors, adds an odd chinging taste of pear then tropical with every other inhale. It's utterly fascinating, tasty as all hell, and has kept me wrecking tank after tank contemplating it. The only thing i cannot figure out for the life of me is the drop (essentially) of koolada. Does it do something to the mixture I simply can't detect? Is it an olive branch to the crowd that insists cold things must be cold? The garnishing sprig of mint leaves that you don't actually drink, but you know it's been in there? Color me utterly curious, but I can't figure it. Neat touch, though.&#xD;\n&#xD;\nThis one's for juice lovers, apple fiends, people who can't get enough of dragonfruit, but want something different, smoothie fanatics, and those looking for something that just plain tastes good, but keeps your brain working at it.&#xD;\n&#xD;\nAbsolute cracking juice. Love it!"}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"45414","name":"Dragon's Delight"}}}
