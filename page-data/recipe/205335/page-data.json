It sounds odd, but it is quite good. Creamy light honeydew up front, with the graham cracker lingering on after the vape. I think the Graham Cracker still needs a little tuning as the FW Graham Cracker can come across a bit harsh at times. Vaped on a Hadaly clone with an 0.5 ohm fused Clapton coil at 34 watts.\r\n\r\nUpdate: decrease FW Graham Cracker by 0.5 and increase TPA Cheesecake (Graham Crust) by 0.5. While I like FW Graham Cracker it just is a bit too dark for this recipe.\r\n\r\nPhoto by Federico Gutierrez on Unsplashed","steep_days":"3 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"total_reviews":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T02:17:58.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"368","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Honeydew II","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Bavarian Cream SC","vendor":"WF","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Graham Cracker","vendor":"FW","millipercent":500},{"name":"Cheesecake (graham Crust)","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":3500},{"name":"Sweetness","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":500}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"205335","name":"Princess Jasmine"}}}
