I usually find some of these cookie recipes to be a little too dry but the cookie to cream ratio is spot on. Very good job on this.

Definitely better than the more popular recipe of this profile. Perfectly balanced, simple and doesn't leave me wanting to tweak this or that.

Very smooth but satisfying, not too sweet but sweet enough to keep you coming back for more.  Mix it up if your into this profile at all, its just has a uniqueness about it, im wondering if its the flavorah cream, this is the only recipe i have tried it in, certainly something intriguing going on for such a simple recipe.  Pure genius, i love it, thank you Vurve!","score":5},{"user":"SixStrings952","text":"This is really good!","score":5},{"user":"MrBurgundy","text":"Wow. Delicious, warm, gooey, creamy sugar cookies.
