I usually find some of these cookie recipes to be a little too dry but the cookie to cream ratio is spot on. Very good job on this. "},{"user":"TOCMichelleHughes","text":"Holy blooming daffodils this is an INCREDIBLE recipe.  It's just like eating fresh baked sugar cookies straight from the oven!  HUGE winner."},{"user":"NastyNate","text":"Kick ass recipe! Thank you."},{"user":"ObiWanCannoli","text":"Great recipe with lots of flavor from just 6.5%. Definitely better than the more popular recipe of this profile. Perfectly balanced, simple and doesn't leave me wanting to tweak this or that. "},{"user":"kitu5","text":"This stuff is friggin ambrosia. Absolutely spot on creamy milk and warm sugar cookie. So many childhood feels in this, and so friggin cracklike. When I need good juice i can hit right the hell now, I know where i'm going. ADV.&#xD;\n&#xD;\nIt's Milk And Cookies. Do I really need to say who this one is for? Just put some sunshine in your soul and vape this."},{"user":"Whooptidooh","text":"Made this yesterday, and it’s already fantastic. Can’t wait to see how it develops further. ..And will have to make a bigger bottle as well. "},{"user":"CygnusY1","text":"Spot on. Simple yet complex tasting recipe. Could teach mixers a thing or two about simplicity in mixing."},{"user":"KillaCoDe","text":"So well balanced and tasty af!"},{"user":"CloudChef","text":"This shit is like crack, it puts the runner up ROTY Sugar cookies and cream to shame IMO (actually wondering if he mixed up the two recipes and really meant this one), it turns to pure magic after a month of steeping.  Very smooth but satisfying, not too sweet but sweet enough to keep you coming back for more.  Mix it up if your into this profile at all, its just has a uniqueness about it, im wondering if its the flavorah cream, this is the only recipe i have tried it in, certainly something intriguing going on for such a simple recipe.  Pure genius, i love it, thank you Vurve!"},{"user":"SixStrings952","text":"This is really good!"},{"user":"MrBurgundy","text":"Wow. Delicious, warm, gooey, creamy sugar cookies. I can't seem to make a big enough bottle. Thanks so much for sharing!"},{"user":"TravisM","text":"This is an amazing Sugar Cookie Base, I can imagine adding just about anything to this at low %s and it being amazing, but seriously awesome as is, another great recipe Vurve "}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"10633","name":"Milk and Sugar Cookies"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
