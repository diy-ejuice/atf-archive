Delicious warming ginger baked biscuits coated in sticky honey. Everyone deserves a break relax and enjoy.\r\n\r\nNotes\r\n\r\nCap sugar cookie \r\n\r\nDoesn't need much of a write up for this one everyone knows this is the staple for a great cookie/biscuit base it ouses flavour,has versatility and presence.\r\n\r\nInw biscuit \r\n\r\nAgain another great bakery flavour but with different properties. Pair it with cap sugar cookie and it transforms it giving it more bite,a deeper bakery flavour and some added texture and butter.\r\n\r\nCap gingerbread \r\n\r\nBy far the best gingerbread out there it does what it says and is all that's required for the ginger. It pairs so well with cap sugar cookie without bullying it.\r\n\r\nCap vanilla custard \r\n\r\nA biscuit needs a little vanilla it steps it up a level turning a bland biscuit into one you want to go back to. The custard also binds the mix together we need some egg and this fits the part.\r\n\r\nFw butterscotch ripple\r\n\r\nThis combines in two ways it gives the biscuit some creamy elements without using a cream. It also adds some much needed brown sugar without using such ingredient. We need some sugar to glaze the honey.\r\n\r\nFa honey \r\n\r\nI've tried many a honey and none really work but then I came to love fa honey it's perfect and if used correctly will transform a bakery. This at 0.25% is perfect it's well balanced has great presence without overkill. It's not fighting anything but you notice it's there. It totally glazes the biscuit and combines well with the butterscotch.\r\n\r\nFa cinnamon Ceylon \r\n\r\nIt had to be added just to give the biscuit more spice and warmth . A little goes a long way here but again it works in harmony with the gingerbread. A truly delightful pairing.\r\n\r\nFa meringue \r\n\r\nNothing completes a biscuit more than meringue it adds a little sweet powdered sugar without using any other sweeteners.\r\n\r\nEnjoy xx","steep_days":"5","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"total_reviews":4,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:49:12.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"6270","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Sugar Cookie","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Biscuit","vendor":"INW","millipercent":500},{"name":"Gingerbread","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Vanilla Custard","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Butterscotch Ripple","vendor":"FW","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Honey","vendor":"FA","millipercent":250},{"name":"Cinnamon Ceylon","vendor":"FA","millipercent":250},{"name":"Meringue","vendor":"FA","millipercent":500}],"reviews":[{"user":"kindground","score":"5","text":"Really tasty mix that hits all the marks for a ginger snap which I love. The spice is very deftly balanced and the cookie is crisp and sharp. The touch of honey makes this really nice and compliments the ginger and cinnamon really well. My only criticism is completely subjective. I get a musty stale beer note from Cap Gingerbread that I've never really liked. The honey seems to latch onto it and accentuate it. Still a very enjoyable mix. I may try substituting FLV Ginger Snap or HS Gingerbread next time. "},{"user":"asmirm","score":"5","text":""},{"user":"Mongoman","score":"5","text":"Love this ! Usually vape a butterscotch cookie so this great to add in rotation .I did replace cap VC with TfA butter just because  I seem to be the only guy who didn't like it and butter is my personal favourite ingredient ."},{"user":"mlNikon","score":"5","text":"This is a very tasty and unique mix.
