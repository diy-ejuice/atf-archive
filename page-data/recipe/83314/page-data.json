However, it should be noted that that's quite likely mostly my own damage and is not the mixers' fault. I've found that most of the time when I try someone else's recipe as written with TFA Honeydew, I get a hint of some soap, but then when I go back and mix it again with half as much Honeydew, the soap is gone. So maybe forget about the soap part, that's just me. But it's also an overpowering amount of honeydew. I'm not really getting any cantaloupe flavor. Just a very forward ripe honeydew with a crisper honeydew behind it, with some milky cream underneath. I must say, that cream is nice. I might like to come back and try this again with both of the honeydews cut in half to see if cantaloupe shines though and tastes good. Even if it doesn't, it should be worth a mix just to enjoy that cream base again and give some more thought to stealing/adapting it to other fruit and cream recipes.
