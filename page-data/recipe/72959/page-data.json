With that being said This recipe isn't for everyone and unless you want a molasses ginger snap cookie vape I wouldn't rush out and buy all of these unless you want exactly that a molasses ginger snap cookie. With that being said this also needs a long steep and this mix is dark as night so again this isn't for everyone but it is a delicious molasses ginger snap cookie and I mean exactly that!!! I have had Flavorah ginger snap for a long time and never used it because it's just that a dark ginger snap and unless that's exactly what your looking for than this concentrate isn't for you and the same goes for wonder flavours  molasses unless you want exactly that molasses than this concentrate isn't for you but if you do want these two profiles than these two are perfect and when mixed together it makes a delicious molasses ginger snap treat.\r\n\r\nI am going to break the notes in to two parts the cookie and the additives.\r\n\r\nThe cookie:\r\nI used flavorah ginger snap I found I got a fuller cookie at 3% which may seem high but trust and believe if you give this recipe a try and wait t steep time you will have a magical molasses ginger snap cookie. Now with just ginger snap it seems a little damp so I wanted to firm and crisp up the cookie a little not a lot just a little so I added .75% of flavorah cookie this concentrate is well worth the price tag personally I use this flavor all the time and I got my bottle last march and I still have over a quarter of it and its only 15ml you do the math its worth every dollar. I mean cap sugar cookie you have to use at least 3Ã— more  in a mix for example so the cost isn't as much more as you might think in the long run.  Anyway this simple mix of flavorah cookie and ginger snap  makes up the cookie but then I added a little flavorah eggnog I used eggnog to emulate that eggy moistness you get when you bite into a fresh molasses ginger snap. Eggnog also has a spice note to it and that definetly helps with spicing up the cookie a little. The eggnog is at a fairly low percentage and you cant even notice its presence but of is vital in the texture and flavor of this delicate dark cookie.\r\n\r\nThe additives:\r\nBasically I used exactly what you would use if you were making molasses ginger snap cookies. Of coarse I needed molasses so I used wonder flavours offering and it didn't dissapoint at 1% a get  dark sweet molasses not overpowering in any way. Then I wanted just a touch of cinnamon so I added .10% of flavorah rich cinnamon this is very light almost like a slight cinnamon sugar sprinkled over the top. So with that being said I needed some brown sugar and I used TFA brown sugar for this at .75%.. I then wanted a touch of vanilla to pull everything together now I don't expect the vanilla to come out in thallape much but it will help with the end flavor of the cookie and it will bind the other flavors together and blend into them all. I used flavorah vanilla bean for this I am sure you could sub this with another vanilla just don't go to high because flavorah vanilla bean is more of a light accent than it is a strong vanilla so pick the sub carefully if you need to Sub. It will be best if you don't gamble with a sub and stick to the flavorah vanilla bean at 1%. Now with this mix I used flavorah sweetness at .25% which is lightly sweetened I absolutely love flavorah sweetness but you may like a different sweetener or no sweetener at all totally a personal preference..\r\n","steep_days":"20","temperature":"420","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-06T20:40:31.000-05:00","best_vg":"75%","views":"1258","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Molasses SC","vendor":"WF","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Ginger Snap","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Cookie","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":750},{"name":"Eggnog","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1250},{"name":"Vanilla Bean","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Rich Cinnamon","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":100},{"name":"Brown Sugar","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":750},{"name":"Sweetness","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":250}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"72959","name":"Molasses ginger snaps"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
