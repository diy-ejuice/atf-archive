The flavors go wonderfully together!  The cherry is the top note with a lovely almond and creamy Honey rose flavor.  I vaped it right after mixing and it's delicious!!  \r\nI normally don't add sweetener to my mix and I feel this one is fairly sweet enough without any.  I do think this one is great as is but, would taste great with a touch of tartness added\r\n\r\nI can't wait to see what this one does as it steeps!  ill be back for an update.  \r\nupdates:\r\nsitting overnight:  The cherry is tasting more like a slightly toasted milky cherry, rose with cream and vanilla.  wow it's very lovely and totally worth it!\r\ngive it a try and let me know your thoughts.","steep_days":"7 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:50:34.000-05:00","best_vg":"100%","views":"1517","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Blackcherry Jelly Bean SC","flavor_id":"8359","vendor":"WF","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Cream","flavor_id":"604","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Milk & Honey","flavor_id":"609","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Rose","flavor_id":"511","vendor":"FA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Toasted Almond","flavor_id":"128","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Shisha Vanilla","flavor_id":"841","vendor":"INW","millipercent":1250}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"128768","name":"Vanilla Rose Moon Milk"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
