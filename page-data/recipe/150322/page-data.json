This Juice is called VM Juniper and was crafted by Benji from Vapour Mountain.\r\n\r\nWith my last bottle of the above Juniper running very low, I decided to create my own Juniper and it was based off a Craft Gin that I mixed and tasted at a Gin farm in Cape Town.\r\n\r\nDa Juun:\r\nUsing FLV Juniper Gin to bring the very authentic Juniper Flavour I kept it on the lower end as I enjoy a subtle boozy note and wanted all aspects to shine and compliment this Gin. with the Black tea added to compliment the herbal back notes of the Juniper and this all then infused with some sweet blood orange! \r\n\r\nThe Mixxer:\r\nI used my new favorite 'liquidizer', Cucumber! in combination with a little Citrus soda and WS23 to give a cool soda/tonic mixer. Cucumber also has a very complimentary flavor at higher % that works Very well with a Gin.\r\n\r\nSweetner:\r\nAs Always I'd say yes, But here I would say Hell Yass! It just compliments everything as if the only sweetner is from the Blood Orange!\r\n\r\nI personally feel this needs the few days steep for the Stronger Herbal notes of the Juniper to settle and mellow down to where I like it.\r\n\r\nEnjoy!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","steep_days":"5 (SNV)","temperature":"111","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-05T04:17:13.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"1050","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Juniper Gin","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1250},{"name":"Blood Orange","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1250},{"name":"Tea Black Water Soluble","vendor":"FA","millipercent":800},{"name":"Lemon Sicily","vendor":"FA","millipercent":350},{"name":"Cucumber","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1550},{"name":"WS-23","vendor":"OTHR","millipercent":450},{"name":"Super Sweet","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":350},{"name":"Citrus Soda","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":750}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"150322","name":"Bloody Juniper"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
