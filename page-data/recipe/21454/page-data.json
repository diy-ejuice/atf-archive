I had to sub for FA almond, I gotta pick up some toasted almond my next order! Thanks for the awesome recipes!!"},{"user":"orangetree","text":"Having Darren in the friend list on facebook gives you a big benefit: Being able to mix his awesome recipes some days before he releases it! This one is absolutely delicious. Marzipan complements so well with blueberry and the cookie base works so well with it. Being able to create profiles like this distinguishes him from a lot of other mixers out there. Thank you!"}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"21454","name":"B.A.M CAKES"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
