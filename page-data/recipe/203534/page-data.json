A simple, but bold and delicious blend of red and black current with a raspberry to fill it all in. \r\n\r\nI hope you all do enjoy this three flavor recipe. I do believe this recipe is finished to my liking, but I’m always open to suggestions and obstructive criticism. This helps me improve not only my recipe, but my skills as a mixer in general.\r\n\r\nPlease leave a review no matter how you feel about if you do plan to mix this!\r\n\r\n***also, if you’re wondering about which sweetener I use, it’s from ecigexpress. I’m not sure of the dilution ratio as I couldn’t find any information on it. That is why you see “other” as the brand.","steep_days":"3 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-12T18:31:00.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"629","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Sweet Currant","flavor_id":"10171","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Blackcurrant","flavor_id":"645","vendor":"INW","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Raspberry","flavor_id":"667","vendor":"INW","millipercent":500},{"name":"sweetener (sucralose)","flavor_id":"2313","vendor":"OTHR","millipercent":500}],"reviews":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"203534","name":"Fruit From The Stars: Sirius"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
