A friend of mine wants me to clone \"Naked, Sweet Sour\". After looking at the bottle & listening to her description, I came up with this recipe. She tasted it & said it has a little more Lime flavor in it from the original but is very good. Tastes like a lemon drop candy to me. Although not a identical clone, Very delicious! Pairs well with any citric drink. Enjoy <3","steep_days":"1 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-10T14:52:12.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"2000","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Juicy Lemon","flavor_id":"79","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1700},{"name":"Key Lime","flavor_id":"241","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2600},{"name":"Lemon Lime","flavor_id":"83","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":2350},{"name":"Lemon Sicily","flavor_id":"524","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1600},{"name":"Super Sweet","flavor_id":"2384","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":500},{"name":"Citric Acid 10%","flavor_id":"2521","vendor":"OTHR","millipercent":300}],"reviews":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"59893","name":"OhMSlice"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
