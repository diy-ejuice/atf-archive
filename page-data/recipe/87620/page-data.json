It looked really good so I mixed it up, and it made me really appreciate INW S’Camel (which is also sold as Dromedary and Pyramid.) \r\n\r\nI started reading a bunch of reviews for Camel Unfiltereds, and decided to up the nuttiness and earthiness of the S’Camel with some HS No 5 and FLV Red Burley. The No 5 gives it a toasted nutty flavor like a good Burley Blend aught to have. The Red Burley brings a bit of that dark, earthy tobacco. No 5 and Red Burley make a real nice couple in my opinion. \r\n\r\nThen I had to get that sweet, spicy Turkish tobacco to make it a Camel. Tobacco Absolute Oriental (also from the El Camello recipe) was an obvious first choice. Brings some authentic tobacco taste with it. HS Desert Ship was in some earlier versions, but I tried to take it somewhere else for a little bit, but eventually came back around to it. It’s kind of a hard flavor to describe, but it’s good. It’s sort of dry and has some spice to it, but someone with a more refined palette and larger vocabulary would have to expand further than that. Definitely way better than FA Desert Ship. So if the FA version has scared you away from trying it, fear not. They are different. \r\n\r\nDNB just doin’ DNB things. \r\n\r\nIt’s quite good after just a few days, but is ideal after 2 weeks. I’ll meet that half way and say 10 days.
