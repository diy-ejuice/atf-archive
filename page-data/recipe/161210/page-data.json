I see it mostly for sodas, but in my head it would fit perfect for a tea as well. To make the tea more fluent and combat the dryness FA Black Tea brings, I figured FLV Lemonade would play a good supporting role in the mix, both for flavor and texture.\r\nI hadn't actually planned on adding honey into this, but I felt I needed something sweet to dance both with the dark flavor tea has and the citrus. I looked over what I had in my stash. Considered this and and that, but fell on VT Golden Syrup.\r\nI discovered that when you combine VT Golden Syrup and FLV Eisai, it gives off a very nice lightly floral and almost fresh off of the beehive honey taste, in addition to the accent of green tea. Very delicious!\r\nFLV Eisai brings some nice earthy and floral flavors to this mix, that to me makes this very authentic.\r\nINW Cactus is there to make everything just a little more juicy and nice.\r\n\r\nThis flavor tastes exactly like the brand \"Oishi Black Lemon tea\" which is an asian tea - just without all the sugar.\r\n\r\nLet it steep for a few days - 2-3 I'd say. Works alright as SnV, but the tea is a tad too strong at that point.\r\n\r\nI hope you'll enjoy this mix!
