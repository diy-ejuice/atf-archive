FLV Wild Melon is great, but I've not used FLV Cantaloupe before...no time like the present.\r\nBavarian Cream, Cream and Vanilla Swirl complete the recipe with a thick and rich milk base to tone down any sharpness found in the liquors and tie the whole recipe together.\r\n\r\nThis recipe was originally called Red Hot Melon Horchata and I used FLV Red Cinnamon which is a fireball/red hot candy type flavor.  I thought it would be a good twist but even at 3 drops per 30ml it took over the entire recipe.  I was forced to go with a safer FA Cinnamon Ceylon.\r\n\r\nThis was created for the #theyearofmixing weekly challenge.  https://www.facebook.com/groups/flavorpro/ http://flavor-pro.com/the-year-of-mixing/","steep_days":"7","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-02T07:43:21.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"871","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Jamaica Special (jamaica Rhum)","vendor":"FA","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Bourbon","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":750},{"name":"Vanilla (bourbon)","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Cinnamon Ceylon","vendor":"FA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Wild Melon","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1250},{"name":"Cantaloupe","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Bavarian Cream","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Cream","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":500},{"name":"Vanilla Swirl","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1500}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"98310","name":"Melon Horchata"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
