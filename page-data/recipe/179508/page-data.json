Light on the sugary meringue.\r\n**FE Lemon** is chosen because it will outlast the steep needed for the custard. It can be substituted with your favourite lemon, just push it a bit higher to last through the steep.\r\n**FA Custard Premium** is much maligned, and may be hard to get in your territory - it can be substituted with CAP Vanilla Custard if you choose.\r\n**HS French Vanilla IceCream** can be swapped out with *LB Vanilla Ice Cream* should you choose.\r\n\r\nLet it steep for a while in order to get the custards and creams to bloom.\r\n21 Days is a good while for this.\r\n\r\n*Image from https://sallysbakingaddiction.com/lemon-meringue-pie*","steep_days":"21","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"total_reviews":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T14:14:19.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"1102","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Lemon Meringue Pie","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Pie Crust","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Lemon","vendor":"FE","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Acetyl Pyrazine 5%","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":350},{"name":"Custard Premium","vendor":"FA","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Custard","vendor":"INW","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Meringue","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1250},{"name":"French Vanilla Icecream","vendor":"HS","millipercent":1250}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"179508","name":"Another Lemon Meringue Tart"}}}
