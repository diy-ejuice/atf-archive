He decides to show up right at the last minute screaming Y U No... Y U No... running and  staring  at me violently with those beady eyes. Once he catchs up to me he stops, pauses and holds those crooked fingers to my face. As I look down on him in fear,  I ask what's up my little dude? He is in a frozen state as I jump out of bed from this nightmare screaming Y U No.... Y U no.....  Night after night he comes back terrifying me to no end. Then last night it finally came to pass I finally got to hear\r\nthe question that has been haunting me for months. Again as I look down on him in fear of what comes next with those beady eyes and crooked fingers he tilts his head up with a deformed smile, begins to say softly Y U No put  lime in the Cheese cake as he vanishes back into the darkness. \r\n\r\nThis tribute recipe was developed from my Sicily Cheesecake  that I had released a few months ago. Adapted from Wayne Walkers Cheesecake stones when its right its right dude.... Taking out the lemon and adding the FA Florida key lime puts a twist on this dilcious Cheesecake vape. For that matter you can experiment and add you own fruit or fruit stone to your liking. Enjoy!!!!\r\n\r\nVisit DIY MIXERS CREW on Discord https://discord.gg/kUJGkHt\r\nVisit DIY MIXERS CREW on FaceBook https://www.facebook.com/groups/456512471380574/\r\nWatch DIY MIXERS CREW LIVE on YouTube every Sunday at 4:30 pm EST https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC1ENB0bSNrG_1KETYwZ154g\r\nPlease comment, mix, and or rate,....it makes us all better mixers.","steep_days":"3 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"updated_at":"2020-12-12T10:33:42.000-05:00","best_vg":"75%","views":"2216","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Almond","flavor_id":"528","vendor":"FA","millipercent":250},{"name":"French Vanilla","flavor_id":"56","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":500},{"name":"Graham Cracker","flavor_id":"62","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":750},{"name":"Florida Key Lime","flavor_id":"7699","vendor":"FA","millipercent":2500},{"name":"New York Cheesecake","flavor_id":"90","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Vanilla Bean Ice Cream","flavor_id":"186","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Vanilla Whipped Cream","flavor_id":"1","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1500}],"reviews":[{"user":"DigitalDrops","text":"Luckily for me I have a 55 gallon drum of Wayne's cheesecake layer on hand at all times just waiting for a situation like this .
