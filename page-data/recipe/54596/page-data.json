It's more of a cornflakes cereal with chopped apples and a little sugar sprinkled on top. Very refreshing and bright. \r\nThe recipe is based around cereal 27 and Fuji. Cereal 27 is similar to frosted flakes, but not nearly as sweet. INW Pear is there to make the apple more authentic, bring some juiciness to create the apple chunks rather than an apple flavored cereal. The creams all play together to create the milk base. Cream Fresh is really what does it, but meringue gives it more of a milk flavor and vienna cream brings it more to the cereal milk side. The sweetner isn't completely necessary or could be taken down, it doesn't make the vape sickly sweet, but helps to brighten up the whole recipe in my opinion.","steep_days":"14","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"updated_at":"2020-12-12T18:29:20.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"1346","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Acetyl Pyrazine 5%","flavor_id":"1709","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Cereal 27","flavor_id":"4163","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Cream Fresh","flavor_id":"540","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Apple Fuji","flavor_id":"4886","vendor":"FA","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Meringue","flavor_id":"530","vendor":"FA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Pear","flavor_id":"665","vendor":"INW","millipercent":250},{"name":"Sweetener","flavor_id":"339","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Vienna Cream","flavor_id":"516","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1500}],"reviews":[{"user":"billygoulay","text":"","score":5}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"54596","name":"Apple Cereal"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
