A real sweet fruity flavor, This could definitely be a all day vape. Making you salivate and waiting more. The worst part about this flavor is waiting for your addy to cool down so you can take another vape. (FA) kiwi as the main flavor. You can shake and vape but I recommend putting it in hot water for 20 minutes.   Its still a work in progress. I'm never happy. I blame my wife.
