Simply described its watermelon menthol but beyond that it has depth, created by the FA Pomegranate and RF Kiwi combo. TFA Dragonfruit brightens the entire mix and really makes the NR (Purilum) Watermelon (I highly recommend you pick it up) pop.  FA Meringue smooths it all out. I know you all will enjoy this recipe. Whats even better its a shake and vape, so mix it up and leave you thoughts with a review. Thanks KRUCIAL.","steep_days":"1 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-06T07:15:00.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"3276","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Koolada 10 Pg","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":750},{"name":"Cactus","vendor":"INW","millipercent":2250},{"name":"Dragonfruit","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Kiwi","vendor":"RF","millipercent":500},{"name":"Pomegranate","vendor":"FA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Meringue","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Watermelon","vendor":"NR","millipercent":4250}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"45816","name":"$$$ WACK JUICE $$$ A Philosaphucker GRACK JUICE remix"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
