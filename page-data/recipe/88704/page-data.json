This recipe is much juicier than the original. Another aspect I wanted to change was to make the kiwi more tart. I accomplished this by adding more FA kiwi and less FW. Adding TFA dragonfruit and removing TFA whipped cream, made the fruits pop. I had to share this recipe, I can't put it down. If you like candy like profiles, give this one a mix.\r\n\r\nThis recipe is a sweet strawberry and tart kiwi, blended with dragonfruit.\r\n\r\nThe strawberry is candyish, juicy, chewy, ripe, and slightly syrupy. I used Strawberry Harvest  JF for the main strawberry note. It's a clean candyish strawberry that is chewy and somewhat similar to Juicy Strawberry FA, but I personally like strawberry harvest more. I boosted the strawberry with Strawberry TFA and made it pop with Dragonfruit TFA.\r\n\r\nThe kiwi note is tart and candyish. I used Kiwi FW for the candy note, and layered Kiwi FA on top of it, for its tartness.\r\n\r\nI wanted to add some Vanilla since it goes so well with fruits. I decided to use Vanilla Bean Ice Cream by FW, because it's a plain vanilla that does not add alot of weight, nor cream, at this percentage.\r\n\r\nTo sweeten it up, I added 0.50% of Super Sweet. This is optional. It's pretty sweet without any added sweetener.\r\n\r\n####Feedback is welcomed. If you mix up my recipe and review it, in return, I will mix up a recipe of yours and give you an honest review. \r\n\r\nI tested many different variations of flavors and percentages, and I'm happy to release this other version.\r\n\r\nThis is a shake and vape, but the flavors pop after 2 days. I vape this in various rda's and rta's (primarily the wasp and serpent mini), and usually mix it at 60-70VG. I don't like a hot vape and usually use a resistance around .5   Enjoy!\r\n\r\n*I initially posted this recipe with Red Touch Strawberry FA @ 2% instead of Strawberry TFA.
