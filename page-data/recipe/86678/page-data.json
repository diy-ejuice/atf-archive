Great for a cold, reminds me of a cough drop that is buttered and orange. Please note *VT Orange* was used in this recipe.  All instructions were courtesy of Vape Train. I mix this at 70 vg 30 pg. You could add some menthol to this too around 0.5%.\r\nPlease note nicotine was used in the recipe I made and was still great to vape!","steep_days":"3 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-10T16:00:34.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"971","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Butter Base","flavor_id":"8843","vendor":"VT","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Butter Toffee Base","flavor_id":"8844","vendor":"VT","millipercent":5000},{"name":"Butterscotch","flavor_id":"8845","vendor":"VT","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Creme De menthe","flavor_id":"8866","vendor":"VT","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Honeycomb","flavor_id":"8901","vendor":"VT","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Orange Tang","flavor_id":"8930","vendor":"VT","millipercent":1500}],"reviews":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"86678","name":"Orange Butter Drops"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
