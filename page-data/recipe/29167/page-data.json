I mean the last one had fewer ingredients and was vaguely about fruit \r\nbut this one encompasses so many possibilities it was hard just to decide where to start.\r\n\r\nUltimately I settled on nostalgia: Like most kids candy was my drug of choice. I remember negotiations with my dealer (the asian lady at the corner market) where I'd pour out handfuls of change and handfuls of candy and hope that I'd have enough to cover it all. She was meticulous and miserly but would usually let a few pieces go unpaid for, as long as I wasn't trying to pay for them with bottles and cans. But the corner store was all standard fare, the real treats were on the road. Every month or so we'd go visit my grandparents out in the middle of nowhere (and hour drive felt like a lifetime) and on the way home we'd stop off at a little country store. \r\nThey had a rainbow of colorful sodas in glass bottles and literally barrels of candy. Not only was the candy in barrels, the candy I loved was shaped like a barrel.\r\n\r\n\"Barrels of Yum\" \r\nIt was years later that I figured out what they were called. Years after the taste and excitement was a distant memory. But thanks to the internet I was able to experience it all again and I was even able to rediscover my favorite flavor among them--Blue Raspberry. \r\n\r\nTPA Blue Raspberry: It's the base but it's basic. It's artificial, tangy, sweet and watered down blue raspberry. It's good but not good enough to be alone... \r\n\r\nCap Blue Raspberry Cotton Candy: This rounds out TPA's offering and brings it to life. Just these two alone are an almost perfect representation of the flavor left on your tongue from the little blue barrels. \r\n\r\nCap Jelly Candy: This was not just the only choice but the perfect choice to encapsulate the flavor of the barrels into their hard candy form. It imparts the mouthfeel and makes everything solid. \r\n\r\nCap Blueberry: Time isn't an option so to tone down the inherent dryness of the other ingredients a dash of this brings a touch of juiciness while keeping it blue.\r\n\r\nSweetener: For sugarlips and accuracy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","steep_days":"1 (SNV)","temperature":"400","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-04T21:23:20.000-05:00","best_vg":"60%","views":"2934","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Blue Raspberry","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Blue Raspberry Cotton Candy","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Jelly Candy","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Blueberry","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":500},{"name":"Sweetener","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1000}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"29167","name":"Barrels of Yum"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
