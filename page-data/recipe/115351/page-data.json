I considered INW Yes We Cheesecake but didn't want it's crust interfering with the Joker. VT creme brulee tastes like cannoli filling but is missing the extra hint of cheese. I considered using WF mascarpone however  VT cheesecake also has the hint of cheese I was looking for with minimal crust.  I topped it with some FLV frosting so it could match the photo! See how this goes for you.\r\n\r\nThe steep time although long is important for the frosting and creams to do their thing. It does change around the 3 week mark to where it needs to be.\r\n\r\nOther options include adding a drop of FLV biscotti per 15ml , FLV cinnamon crunch could work in here or spice up your creams with HS Italian or as suggested by the very helpful MB you could add some FA Catalan Cream.\r\n\r\nWatch this while having a vape: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CL7t22rypew\r\n\r\nHave fun.\r\n\r\n","steep_days":"21","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"updated_at":"2020-12-12T10:34:22.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"3274","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Pazzo Burlone (Joker)","flavor_id":"9911","vendor":"FA","millipercent":5000},{"name":"Frosting","flavor_id":"4412","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Sweet Cream","flavor_id":"8979","vendor":"VT","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Creme Brulee","flavor_id":"8864","vendor":"VT","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Cheesecake","flavor_id":"9361","vendor":"VT","millipercent":500}],"reviews":[{"user":"R2ME2","text":"I mixed this and put it aside for a month and tried it again and itâ€™s delicious!  I think you found a winning combo using VT Sweet Cream and Creme Brulee. Definitely going to give that one a try ","score":5},{"user":"MECH_MOD_RN","text":"I have been meaning to leave a comment for this forever  as it is    really so darn tasty  -    the use of cream brulee here is so very smart as it help add some depth to the filling   and to the  shell  I think as well.  It  just a lovely filling and I was intrigued  that  VT cheesecake was used , as that is not a cheese cake that is usually used in cannoli mixes  but  really works.     The VT sweet cream I think also adds some darker caramel like notes to this that really works.    While this may not be a traditional type of  Italian cannoli  it is just plan  tasty and I enjoyed it  very much  and  would recommend it  to any one that  would   enjoy this profile.
