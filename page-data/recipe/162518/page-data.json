WF Flapper Pie makes a great base for a custard pie, at 3% it adds to the crust, custard filling and whipped topping. FW graham cracker at 3% keeps it present but not overtly so, and is an amazingly perfect graham cracker note. TPA cheesecake (graham crust) at 1.5% to fill blend the crust and custard. Tpa brown sugar at .5% was used as well to darken and sweeten the crust!\r\nFor the Banana Custard layer i went with what i had. CAP Banana has a really good artificial banana flavor and used low at 1% along with TFA Banana Cream at 3%, it makes what i think of when i think \"banana pudding\" as far as the banana taste goes. Artificial. FLV Vanilla Pudding at 1.5% and FA Custard Premium at 1.5% round out the filling very nicely.\r\n\r\nFA Marshmallow Vanilla at .75% along with TPA Whipped Cream at 2% both help add to the whipped topping as well as the custard inside.\r\n\r\nI vaped this off the shake with (1.5 cap banana 2.5 tpa banana cream) and the banana was a little sharp. Readjusted and this is vapeable after a day but gove it time and it will only bloom.\r\n\r\nI added .75% FLV sweetener (sucralose) to this, you can add sweetener to your own descretion!\r\n\r\nIf you like what i make please leave feedback!\r\n\r\nWe are all always learning :)","steep_days":"5","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"total_reviews":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T17:35:52.000-05:00","best_vg":"60%","views":"1251","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Banana","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Banana Cream","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Flapper Pie SC","vendor":"WF","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Cheesecake (graham Crust)","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Graham Cracker","vendor":"FW","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Vanilla Pudding","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Marshmallow Vanilla","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":750},{"name":"Whipped Cream","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Brown Sugar","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Custard Premium","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1500}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"162518","name":"Phenom Banan Creme Pie"}}}
