Even off the shake.\r\n\r\nVery citrusy, hoppy in the back with some earthy tones to round things off??\r\n\r\nIt's... like drinking an IPA after smoking a cigarette....or something like that\r\n\r\nPlease anyone let me know how this is haha\r\n\r\nNo sweetener. Tbh it's actually pretty sweet.\r\n\r\nVape this low. Im using a hadaly with a .35 at 50w. All nuance plays....in my Unity RTA at 75w i get citrus and lose a lot of the nuances. \r\n\r\nInspired by a live comment on a diyordie video by max savage.\r\nHope you see this man!\r\n\r\nHOLY SHIT USE FLV CITRUS SODA NOT FW sorry guys thats my bad","steep_days":"3 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"total_reviews":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T21:33:21.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"1245","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Citrus Soda","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":750},{"name":"Guanabana","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Lemon Grass","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":450},{"name":"Red Burley","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":650},{"name":"Virginia Tobacco","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":800},{"name":"Yakima Hops","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1200}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"190536","name":"West Coast Islands' Savage IPA"}}}
