I like them alright, but I'm not a fanatic. I do like peppermint, though, and I enjoy a recipe that integrates peppermint well. Technically speaking, I feel like this recipe makes a couple of missteps. For one, I think the Koolada is much, much too high. I'd cut it in half, at least, especially with the Menthol there which already provides a cooling sensation. Two, I think it could benefit from a flavor which acts like a bridge between the cooling sensation and the creaminess peppermint can exhibit and the marshmallow, such as Creme de Menthe. Having one there would help the flavors meld a little bit more. Third, I think the peppermint is at this awkward place where there's enough to clearly taste it, but not enough for it to be a clear top note; it's almost a side taste, and my mind kept wandering to how medicinal this tasted. I think boosting the peppermint to bring it to the forefront would help alleviate that issue by making it the core flavor, instead of something which permeates without ever taking center stage. Overall, I try to rate on the technical side of things, and not taking my personal preferences into account, and I think someone who likes Menthol will enjoy this recipe for the mouthfeel and extreme cooling sensation, but not for the slightly nauseating lightness of the is-it-isn't-it peppermint.","score":3}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"39936","name":"MINTHOL"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
