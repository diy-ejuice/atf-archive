Made this at the back end of July 2018 inspired by Nick's Honeycomb custard https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/110483#honeycomb_custard_by_nickevz  Despite it being DAAP free, it's incredibly tasty.

Hope you enjoy it..","steep_days":"60","temperature":"0","recipe_score":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-10T14:52:55.000-05:00","best_vg":"75%","views":"1715","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Creme Brulee","flavor_id":"8864","vendor":"VT","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Honeycomb","flavor_id":"8901","vendor":"VT","millipercent":6000},{"name":"Sugar Cookie V2","flavor_id":"116","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Super Sweet","flavor_id":"2384","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":400},{"name":"Vanilla Custard V2","flavor_id":"132","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":9000}],"reviews":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"124004","name":"Honeycomb Custard"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
