Made this at the back end of July 2018 inspired by Nick's Honeycomb custard https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/110483#honeycomb_custard_by_nickevz  Despite it being DAAP free, it's incredibly tasty. Needs a long steep to reach it's potential though. Hope you enjoy it..","steep_days":"60","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"total_reviews":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T17:35:17.000-05:00","best_vg":"75%","views":"1708","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Creme Brulee","vendor":"VT","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Honeycomb","vendor":"VT","millipercent":6000},{"name":"Sugar Cookie V2","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Super Sweet","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":400},{"name":"Vanilla Custard V2","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":9000}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"124004","name":"Honeycomb Custard"}}}
