Beneath the marzipan frosting are alternating layers of sponge cake, pastry cream, and whipped cream and often contains raspberry.\r\n\r\nFlavor notes for those who are flavor-nerd-ioligists. As taste is subjective this recipe is a ballpark of what I perceive to be acceptable. At the end of the day I hope that at least this combination of flavors will get you pretty close to this profile. \r\n\r\n**WF Princess Cake** is a concentrate that this profile is based on which from the manufacturers description is alternating layers of sponge cake, pastry cream, and whipped cream, topped with marzipan. \r\n**WF Angel Cake** is a  sponge cake with a buttercream flavor and it also carries a light berry note. The Angel Cake also work well with the  WF Buttercream Frosting. \r\n**WF Buttercream Frosting** is a delicate sugary buttercream frosting that needs some boosting from another cream.\r\nThe **WF Pistacio Cream** provides a boost to the buttercream and the creamy almond is bent towards a marzipan with the aid of FA Marzipan.\r\n**FA Marzipan** is used as a sweetener and adds nuttiness of sugar-glazed bitter almonds.\r\nThe **MB Pink Raspberry** provides a soft, lightly floral and tart contrast to the cake layers.\r\n\r\n #DIYDOWNUNDERDecemberCHALLENGE\r\n\r\nTested using a single coil RDA 60 Watts, 0.18 Ohms\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n","steep_days":"14","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T19:15:52.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"1604","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Princess Cake SC","vendor":"WF","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Buttercream Frosting SC","vendor":"WF","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Pistachio Cream SC","vendor":"WF","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Angel Cake SC","vendor":"WF","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Pink Raspberry","vendor":"MB","millipercent":1250},{"name":"Marzipan","vendor":"FA","millipercent":350},{"name":"Cream Cheese Icing","vendor":"LA","millipercent":1000}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"133632","name":"Sweden: Prinsesstårta"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
