Shake and vape certified.  Fresh strawberry jam flavor that was a little strong but calms down with time. \r\n\r\nJam - Shisha Strawberry, Strawberry (ripe), Sweet Strawberry - These 3 strawberries make up a sweet delicious strawberry jam. \r\nSyrup - Golden Syrup - Fills out the middle of the vape for me. With a 4 week steep, the Golden Syrup really pops.\r\nWaffle - Belgian Waffle and Waffle - The combo of these two is great, you get some of the fluffy Belgian waffle while still having some of the burned waffle from straight off the waffle iron. \r\nCream Topping - Sweet Cream and Whipped Cream - This finished the recipe with a bit of cream for good measure. \r\n","steep_days":"2 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-06T20:44:31.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"2199","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Belgian Waffle","vendor":"LB","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Golden Syrup","vendor":"VT","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Shisha Strawberry","vendor":"INW","millipercent":500},{"name":"Strawberry (ripe)","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Sweet Cream","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Sweet Strawberry","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Waffle","vendor":"FW","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Whipped Cream","vendor":"FW","millipercent":1000}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"133876","name":"Strawberry Jam on Waffles"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
