This is a remix of a juice I used to vape alot before my mixing days. It's just a very satisfying blend of mango passionfruit and guava. Perfect for summer, and something I personally can't put down.\r\n\r\nFE/FLV Mango: This to me is a very natural tasting blend of mangos. I love FLV mango but it needed a little more to shine in this recipe, so I included some FE mango to fill it out a bit. FE mango does fade a little, so if i were to let this mix sit for more than 2 weeks I'll throw in 1.5-1.75 depending on how freaky I'm feeling.\r\n\r\nFLV Pink Guava/VT Blood Orange Champagne: The original has white guava in it, so I used FLV pink guava because I said so, and then VT Blood orange because the original also has orange in it, and the champagne is more of a dry texture than a champagne flavor, so that dryness helps the guava be a little less \"pink\".\r\n\r\nWF Passionfruit: Easily my favorite passionfruit. It's really good, so it's in the recipe\r\n\r\nNo need for sweetener, this is very sweet as is.","steep_days":"3 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"total_reviews":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T17:36:30.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"551","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Mango","vendor":"FE","millipercent":1200},{"name":"Mango","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Pink Guava","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Passionfruit SC","vendor":"WF","millipercent":1750},{"name":"Blood Orange Champagne","vendor":"VT","millipercent":1500}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"202667","name":"Bombies - Jungle (Remix) #Developed Summer"}}}
