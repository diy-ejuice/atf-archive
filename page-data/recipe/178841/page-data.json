The Blueberry works perfectly and is very subtle and not overpowering . I agree with another comment that it needs a longer steep than Platinum Blush . I find it best when close to 2 weeks steeping . I really like this recipe . Keep up the great work guys .","score":5},{"user":"NonStopMix","text":"This needs more time than platinum blush to come together and that recipe is so good. At 10 days, this recipe is very good. The blueberry is not as prominent as the strawberry in the other recipe. Overall, I prefer platinum blush but this is nice to have in rotation.","score":4}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"178841","name":"Platinum Blue | DEVELOPED"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
