So so delicious and very accurate profile. Taste just like vaping the picture. My only complaint is that I like it better fresh a lot more than steeped for some odd reason. That being said, no biggie I just make what I'll vape in a day or two. I've mixed 30 ml of this at least 4 times in the last few weeks. Love it."}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"157193","name":"Strawberry Pastry #Mixenvixens"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
