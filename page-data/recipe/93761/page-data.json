This one is smooth and heavy on the tongue.\r\nFA Caramel is one of the best caramel flavors in the business. It is not a complete caramel flavor, but with help it was the right one. FW Butterscotch Ripple added rounds out the the caramel and gives it some creaminess. INW Custard adds to the creaminess, further rounds out the caramel a bit more, and gives the mix more weight. It also does not necessarily require a long steep, but it does get better over time. INW Biscuit puts in that gritty cookie background. FW Butter Pecan adds a slight nutty note. Sweetener as with most mixes is optional, but PUR Super Sweet at 0.25% gives a perfect overall sweetness. CAP‚Äôs version can be used at the same percentage. Just follow the recipe and use CAP instead. To me PUR‚Äôs Super Sweet is a cleaner tasting sweetener.\r\nThis can definitely go off the shake but starts to take shape after a week. The Biscuit gets better and the caramel creams start to melt together. The longer is goes the better it gets. Around three weeks it starts to peak.\r\nEDITED to 1% Biscuit per SlashaLO‚Äôs recommendation which was spot on.üëçüèªüëçüèª","steep_days":"21 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":4.5,"total_reviews":2,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:50:03.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"3705","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Carmel (caramel)","vendor":"FA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Custard","vendor":"INW","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Biscuit","vendor":"INW","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Butter Pecan","vendor":"FW","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Butterscotch Ripple","vendor":"FW","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Super Sweet","vendor":"PUR","millipercent":250}],"reviews":[{"user":"SlashaLO","score":"4","text":"I would have to say I really enjoyed this mix. I personally LOVE butter pecan, so thats a huge bonus. I feel that the cookie finish is TOO light here for my taste. I had to search for it. I think the carmel/ripple/pecan combo overpowered it too much. I think next time I mix this one up, I'm going to go for 1% biscuit, and for my taste I feel it will be perfect. Very thick, dense, and smooth vape. Great job.
