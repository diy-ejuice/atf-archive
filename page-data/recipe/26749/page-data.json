USE FLAVOR WEST RASPBERRY. FW raspberry wasn't in ATF flavor library.\r\n\r\nSo, this is my recipie for the first round. I was going for an sweet apricot vape. This came out a bit different, but I really enjoy it. After trying over and over as soon as I made this variation I knew it was the one to enter..\r\n\r\nAnyway, like I said I was going for a sweet apricot. Instead raspberry became the star of the show. Up front that's what you taste. On the exhale it gets backed by the apricot. And that strawberry ripe is in it to blend it and give it that almost real fresh fruit taste. Which is a first for me using strawberry ripe as just a blender and not a real up front flavor. Anyway, I hope you guys enjoy!\r\n\r\nMixed at 70 vg 30 pg 2% nic","steep_days":"1 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-11T04:36:50.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"1519","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Apricot","flavor_id":"209","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":5000},{"name":"Raspberry (sweet)","flavor_id":"267","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Strawberry (ripe)","flavor_id":"271","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2000}],"reviews":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"26749","name":"Tres Hombres"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
