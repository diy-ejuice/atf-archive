The flavor profile is a nice grapefruit followed by the vanilla which gives a nice glaze over the pomegranate and a general tropical end.\r\n\r\nINW White Grapefruit: This is the main note of the recipe. I use this at 1% as it is a strong flavoring and is quite smooth. I really like this flavoring a lot but took awhile to figure out what to pair it with. This gives the inhale a really good grapefruit taste.\r\n\r\nINW Shisha Vanilla: My favorite vanilla flavoring by far, this gives a nice sweet glaze of vanilla over the fruit notes. At first I used 1% but felt it wasn't enough but 1.5% seems to work for what I want it to do in this recipe.\r\n\r\nFA Pomegranate/TFA Pomegranate: This is something I've been doing with pomegranate in general is using both of these flavorings together to accentuate each other. What I find is FA at 1% and TFA at 3% gives me a very nice pomegranate that sits behind the grapefruit, in front of the tropical notes and right under the vanilla.\r\n\r\nTFA Dragonfruit: At first this recipe was just the Grapefruit, Pomegranate and Vanilla and it got harsh on me quick. For this reason I decided to change some pace up and try adding in a bit of a tropical flavor to it and Dragonfruit does a great job with that. Since it has a similar profile as pineapple does and has a bit of a creamy note to it, this helps smooth out the recipe and adds in a nice tropical note.\r\n\r\nFA Passionfruit: This was a wild guess. Upon flavor testing this I noticed it had a nice sweet tropical fruit note that made sense to pair it with the dragonfruit and it works really well to make a tropical fruit profile that comes through at the end of the exhale.\r\n\r\nFA Fuji: I use Fuji to tie up all the fruit flavors together and smooth it all into one nice flavor. Originally I used it at 1% but bumped it just a bit to 1.5% for a little extra help.\r\n\r\nOverall a nice clean Grapefruit, Pomegranate and Tropical Fruit vape with a nice vanilla shine. Shake and Vape, I mix at 80vg/20pg personally but you do you baby.","steep_days":"1 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":null,"total_reviews":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-05T23:54:14.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"1315","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"White Grapefruit","vendor":"INW","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Fuji","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Pomegranate","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Pomegranate","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Shisha Vanilla","vendor":"INW","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Dragonfruit","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Passionfruit","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000}],"reviews":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"22456","name":"Tropical Delight"}}}
