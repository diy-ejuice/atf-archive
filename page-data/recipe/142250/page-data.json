Not just any butterscotch cream pie, one with hints of chocolate, caramel, and honeycomb. \r\nThe piecrust is made up of Molin Berry Cookie Bite, at this % you get a delicious chocolate note as if the crust was lined with fudge. The Butterscotch Pudding is FA Butterscotch, FA Caramel, and FLV Vanilla Pudding. Absolutely delicious butterscotch pudding for this. The topping is WF SC Buttercream Frosting combined with WF SC Flapper Pie. If you have not used Flapper Pie, it does some pretty miraculous things in a recipe. So to add to this, is VT Honeycomb, which works as toffee drops on top of icing. \r\nWe decided to name this recipe Jupiter, because it is out of this world. Then we find this song, and it brought us to tears, because we realize the importance of vaping as a life saving alternative to smoking. \r\nhis song was written by the lead singer of Train. His mother died of lung cancer, due to being a avid smoker her entire life. \r\nHe wrote the song. Drops of Jupiter about her. He envisioned her floating in the universe after her death. Do yourself a favor and watch the video, listen to the words, and think about how many deaths can be prevented by switching people to vaping, a safer alternative. \r\nWrite your local government elected officials, and remember: I vape, I vote. \r\nLove and Peace. ðŸ’œðŸ’œðŸ’œ\r\n","steep_days":"5","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:50:47.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"2242","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Cookie Bite","flavor_id":"10149","vendor":"MB","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Buttercream Frosting SC","flavor_id":"8361","vendor":"WF","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Flapper Pie SC","flavor_id":"10106","vendor":"WF","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Butterscotch","flavor_id":"495","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Carmel (caramel)","flavor_id":"503","vendor":"FA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Honeycomb","flavor_id":"8901","vendor":"VT","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Vanilla Pudding","flavor_id":"4433","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1500}],"reviews":[{"user":"Grfxman","text":"This has just the most amazing crust / bakery note ... super smooth and silky buttery pie.

Give it a day and all the caramel, butterscotch, meringue cut through. Full of mouthfeel and sweetness. Rich and creamy. Tam and Pippa killed it with this collaboration!
