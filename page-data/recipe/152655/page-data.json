The new flavors from nicotine river are kinda fantastic, but you really need to start around 7-8% and work your way up. \r\n\r\nThe blackberry from NR is really really good, but it needs some definition. It’s all body with very little top note. It’s also not sweet. \r\n\r\nA touch of hangsen blueberry, tpa grape juice and inw blackcurrant do the work in filling out the high notes while super sweet serves to brighten the whole mix up. It may look like a lot going on here, but it’s very cohesive and purposeful. \r\n\r\nI add some 30% ws-23 from bull city to give it a nice cool exhale, but that’s on you.
