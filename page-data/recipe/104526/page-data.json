That's where FA Cookie and JF Biscuit comes in... Combined with FA Marshmallow, they coax the life out of the Lava Cake and make it shine, and then some!\r\nA bit of added texture and this baby transforms into a something its creators, I imagine, intended. I tested Lava Cake at 3% and 4% but found that, at highher levels, it overpowered the delicate pear notes.  2.5% works a treat but if you want the increase the chocolate, feel free to up it by a % or 2.\r\n\r\nThe pear layer is compliments of my trusty pear duo, which, when combined, delivers and unbelievably realistic, fresh pear flavor.\r\nI upped the ratios of the pear to punch through the chocolate base and show themselves in all their glory...  The pear sits beautifully atop the rich chocolate tart and balances the sweet and cocoa notes with its inherent, slightly astringent, notes. \r\n\r\nGive this baby a good week to settle and enjoy!\r\n\r\n","steep_days":"7","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"total_reviews":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T17:34:59.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"1207","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Lava Cake","vendor":"LB","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Pear","vendor":"INW","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Pear","vendor":"FA","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Cookie","vendor":"FA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Biscuit","vendor":"JF","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Marshmallow","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"104526","name":"Chocolate Pear Tart"}}}
