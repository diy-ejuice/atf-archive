Combining Grape Juice with Forest Fruits? Awesome. Combining Grape with Lemon and Forest Fruits with Lemon? Hell, yes. But that Blueberry Lemonade Slushie. It has a weird chemical off-note for me as a shake and vape. I tried this with just a short steep as suggested to see if something in the recipe managed to mask that, no luck. I tried letting it steep for over a week to see if it steeped out and it does, but what it leaves behind is a blueberry that's a little too earthy for this application and a lemonade that's a little too Country Time for my personal taste. Yanking that Blueberry Lemonade Slushie out of here and replacing it with a more realistic lemon flavor could turn this into an outstanding recipe, in my opinion.
