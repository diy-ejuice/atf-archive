I have always utterly failed in that aspect, and I was about to give up until I got my hands on some FLV Alpine Strawberry. I had to do a handful of test mixes, but finally, I am proud to present a strawberry recipe that I am not ashamed to put out in public, and is GF approved!\r\n\r\nThis mix has a sweet & cold country-time lemonade inhale, with a nice ripe and fresh strawberry following through on the exhale.\r\n\r\nTested on a Cthulu 1928 MTL RDA / Pasito Pod RBA 15w 6 wraps 2mm 25mg/mL Nicotine\r\n\r\n#####**Notes**\r\n\r\n**LA Lemonade & FLV Lemonade** - These two have essentially been my go-to for mixing lemonade for low powered devices. It doesn't stray too far from being a powdered lemonade, but it also doesn't straight up taste like it just came from a tub. I find it to be a really nice middle ground that I am super satisfied with.\r\n\r\n**CAP Sweet Strawberry** - FLV Alpine Strawberry is great, but I think it is a pretty authentic strawberry. I debated on a few different strawberries to help with this, and finally came to CAP Sweet Strawberry. It introduces a sugary aspect that layers over FLV Alpine very nicely, and also still keeps FLV Alpine Strawberries authentic aspects in tow.\r\n\r\n**FLV Alpine Strawberry** - The star strawberry of the show. I haven't made too many mixes with it yet, but people are definitely not wrong when they say a little will go a long way. FLV Alpine brings in a really nice and potent authentic strawberry flavour that mixes very well with CAP Sweet Strawberry & the Lemonades. I highly recommend getting this if you can, it is a bit pricey but it is well worth it. \r\n\r\n**WS-23** - Lemonade needs to be cool. Adjust the % to your liking\r\n\r\n**CAP Super Sweet** - A touch of sweetness is obviously needed. Adjust % to your liking as well.\r\n\r\nHope you enjoy this mix! Let me know your thoughts if you mix it up :)","steep_days":"0 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"total_reviews":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-06T23:08:40.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"1413","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Lemonade","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Lemonade","vendor":"LA","millipercent":7000},{"name":"Sweet Strawberry","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Alpine Strawberry","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1000},{"name":"WS-23","vendor":"OTHR","millipercent":750},{"name":"Super Sweet","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":250}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"191529","name":"Strawberry Lemonade (Pod / MTL)"}}}
