At least 1 week steep time needed. The Strawberry can also be subbed for other fruits of your liking like Blueberry to make other delicious Cheesecakes. I had an amazing Blubry version using 9% TFA Blueberry Candy and 3% FW Blueberry but TFA completely changed their Blueberry Candy concentrate and it now splits and has a chalky taste in any recipes it's used in making it useless which sucks, not sure why they ruined it. I have Sugar Daddy listed as the sweetener which is fine used alone but I actually use my own sweetener mixture which is made up of 12oz's Regular Sugar Daddy, 2oz's CAP Super Sweet, & 2oz's TFA Sweetener shaken together in a 16oz bottle... I use that as the sweetener in all of my mixtures...
