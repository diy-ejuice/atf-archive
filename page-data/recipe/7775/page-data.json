I feel like you're eating the cookie covered in buttercream.\r\n\r\nVienna cream also helps accent the slightly nutty Bakery notes in both biscuit and sugar cookie.\r\n\r\nSupporting Cast\r\n\r\nHazelnut\r\nHazelnut does so many things here along with adding to the Nutty notes, it also has an extremely creamy quality boosting the creams along with accenting everything else.\r\n\r\nSubs\r\n\r\nIf you don't have TFA butter you can substitute out for CAP vanilla custard, still adds weight and gives you more of a vanilla wafer cookie.\r\n\r\nAging\r\n\r\nI'm really enjoying this as a shake and Vape. Couple days down the road the creams start to pop, and the hazelnut really comes through.","steep_days":"14 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":4.8,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:48:44.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"134797","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Sugar Cookie","flavor_id":"115","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Biscuit","flavor_id":"642","vendor":"INW","millipercent":750},{"name":"Vienna Cream","flavor_id":"516","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1250},{"name":"Cream Fresh","flavor_id":"540","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1250},{"name":"Hazelnut","flavor_id":"1312","vendor":"FW","millipercent":600},{"name":"Butter","flavor_id":"147","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Bavarian Cream","flavor_id":"1187","vendor":"FW","millipercent":1500}],"reviews":[{"user":"BadaG","text":"Love this recipe, very authentic. I mixed this up as a MTL 18mg vape and it's been a great ADV for work. I haven't changed the flavor in my RTA for two months now"},{"user":"Germ","text":"I like this recipe a lot as a starter for a cookies and cream e-liquid. Light on flavors, adding sweetener doesn't really make it pop at all. Normally a bakery would be better at higher wattages but this recipe falls flat on it's face.  I'm not the greatest mixer on the planet but for being the most mixed/most popular recipe on alltheflavors I just expected more I suppose."},{"user":"FatKidz","text":"excellent!"},{"user":"Ebc88","text":"This is a really good cookies and cream, and it shown me that i should use FW Bav Cream in some my mixes. You cookie base is excellent and blends right in with cream.  "},{"user":"Boomdog07","text":""},{"user":"RemoveHasperat","text":"As someone else said, good but not great. As a standalone recipe it does the job well enough and tastes pretty nice. Where this recipe really shines IMO is its ability to be adapted into 100s of cookie and cookie type base recipes with just a couple additions. "},{"user":"Katumbas","text":"Simple recipe but killer on flavour and execution. Great balance in the selection of flavours used for this profile."},{"user":"super8line","text":"Definitely good but not great.   I don't get much creaminess from it which is strange because there's lots of cream in it.  Still a decent recipe and very cookie like. q&#xD;\nEDIT:  Felt I should come back and update my review.  I gave 30ml's of this to a friend and he said \"it's the best juice you've made yet\".  So there you have it, just because I didn't think it was the greatest thing I've ever vaped doesn't mean a thing. "},{"user":"Sepanik1986","text":"Love this stuff. I just had to use tfa Bavarian cream. Delicious"},{"user":"Mr-G","text":"Loving it"},{"user":"ObiWanCannoli","text":"A solid recipe other than the Fresh Cream which I hate at higher %s. I think I'd like to try this again but with 1% of Flavorah Cream instead. Just my personal taste I guess but dont let that deter you from trying this because it really is quite good."},{"user":"mysterioso","text":"Really good juice.  I gave it 4 stars because it is a little light on flavor, but the flavor it does have is really good."},{"user":"andreaelle","text":""},{"user":"Elvieann","text":"This is what I vape between heavier bakery flavors to cleanse the palate and neutralize my cotton/ coils.  It is delicious and I am never without it.  Definitely one of my 3 favorite cookie flavors and my #1 vanilla."},{"user":"shyndo","text":"Finally got around to trying this a bit ago. I can safely say that this and thadentmans ice cream sugar cookie are the two best cookie custards in existence. Job well done chris. "},{"user":"zarblez","text":"This has been my ADV since I first made it back in March. Great, simple, and tasty! Everything tastes full and \"together\" while at the same time each flavor has a unique contribution. "},{"user":"KenWhitfield","text":"I must be the last one to break down and mix the recipe. My fault and my loss for not mixing this earlier. This is fantastic, I'm very sad I only made a 30ml test bottle."},{"user":"TotallyLilt","text":""},{"user":"Stuminello","text":"I just mixed up a batch, unfortunately I don't have Vienna Cream and had to sub.

But I let it steep and wow after 3 days all the cream came out and this is so delicious!!!!"},{"user":"Exercyst","text":"This is an ADV for me thanks!"},{"user":"corvape","text":"Delicious!&#xD;\nPerfect sugary creamy cookie!&#xD;\nAuthentic  texture and flavor&#xD;\nDefinitely changes quite dramatically after a good steep!&#xD;\nAfter 3 weeks it's very hard to put down!&#xD;\nGreat job with this. Can't wait to mix the lemon adaptation!!&#xD;\n and maybe adapt with some strawberry"},{"user":"KylezKloudz","text":"This is a BANGER brother! I've had this in my app since you released it, being the slacker I am I never got around to it... I heard Wayne talking about it during his recipe of the year video and remembered it and just whipped it up...üëçüëç Damn good job! Now I wished I wasn't such a slack ass... Very on point recipe and sooooo tasty! Showcases the CAP Sugar Cookie great! Best sugar cookie recipe I've ever had!   "},{"user":"G8RH8R23","text":"Good as a shake and vape but man give this a few days and man this is great. Can't put this shit down!"},{"user":"Kriswk","text":"This shit is on point. Super tasty especially after like 2 weeks. The cream is my favorite aspect but the whole recipe is bangin' Good work sir."},{"user":"LLcoolwhip","text":"Amazing perfect balance of ingredients gets better every day even great right after the mix"},{"user":"matp75","text":"I mixed this exactly as posted after two I got zero flavor? like nothing taste like straight VG mixed at 80/20 any ideas ?"},{"user":"gopackgo","text":"Very good. I added .5 FA meringue and 1.5 LA cream cheese icing. It worked well together."},{"user":"Acc1079","text":"Delicious recipe"},{"user":"Bogey_Again","text":""},{"user":"SkiddlzNinja","text":"I feel Sugar Cookies and Cream is a bit of a misnomer. I get more of a Starbucks Birthday Cake Pop. Gooey, creamy, sweet, and thick. Not quite the profile I was expecting, but 5 stars for what it delivered."},{"user":"travino85","text":"Noxious Buttery Clouds"},{"user":"KRUCIAL","text":"This shit is defuckinglicious, its perfectly balanced from the creams to the cookie.

Just....this!!!"},{"user":"RoscoeJenkins","text":"Hey can I use creamy hazelnut by fw I didn't know if that was the same thing"},{"user":"BigMoose","text":"One of my favorites on ATF.

As a S&amp;V this is seriously an amazing juice, is perfect I can't put it down. And I know it's going to be even better in a few days. Thanks for posting this because I know I'm going to make this a lot and for my friends. "},{"user":"Aquaneo","text":"This is a really good vape. Everything lines up really well and the flavours come through unmuddled and distinct. Good job Chris&#xD;\n"},{"user":"Queuetue","text":"Tastes like a second 60ml.  Great sugar cookie."},{"user":"Vurve","text":"Really good recipe. Nice balance between sugar cookie and cream. Definitely requires 1-2 week steep. I made 100ml and I highly recommend this recipe. Also, it was decent ;)"},{"user":"Lunareklipse","text":"Made this with CAP bavarian cream until my new order shows up, but god damn this is good! "},{"user":"TravisM","text":"Dude, this very well may be the best recipe I have mixed this year, really amazing work, now off to make a shit ton more!"},{"user":"RuntDastardly","text":"Had to substitute FW Bavarian Cream with TFA Bavarian Cream, and TFA Butter with CAP Golden Butter, but I don't think either change this fantastic recipe in any significant way. This one is definitely going into the permanent rotation for me. Full, rich and very satisfying, but not overly sweet or cloying, just a lovely balance of creamy, delicious flavors. Great recipe!"},{"user":"Thadentman","text":"Mixed the first batch about 2 weeks ago waited 3 days and I felt it still needed time. Waited a week and it was very good but thought to myself it could use a little more flavor. Then you made v2 and then me too, just waiting for it to age. Great recipe Man."},{"user":"McCharlton","text":"Great full creamy shake and vape.
