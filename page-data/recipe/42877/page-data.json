This was nearly three years going back to it over and over till I got it down to vanilla custard graham cracker and sweet strawberry, but it was missing so much actual marzipan flavor.. The profile is more of a realistic strawberry marzipan than a custard to me, like the one from Ikea..\r\n\r\n*Please MIX IT AS DIRECTED make it 80/20 VG/PG\r\n\r\n\r\nMASTER LEVEL!!","steep_days":"14 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:49:16.000-05:00","best_vg":"80%","views":"10802","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Vanilla Custard","flavor_id":"131","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Bavarian Cream","flavor_id":"145","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Sweet Cream","flavor_id":"183","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Graham Cracker","flavor_id":"62","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Sweet Strawberry","flavor_id":"121","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":3000}],"reviews":[{"user":"HerrHut","text":"Smooth strawberry custard with Graham cracker."},{"user":"Flyver","text":"This really does taste like the original to me, i am loving it !"},{"user":"G8RH8R23","text":"Man it's been a minute since I've had mothers milk but this tastes exactly like I remember it. Make sure you let it steep the full 2 weeks.  Awesome strawberry custard with the graham cracker on the end man."},{"user":"MrBurgundy","text":"Oh yeah. This is the good stuff.. Snakes and sparklers. Been too long to judge the accuracy, but this is a phenomenal strawberry custard.  It isn't overwhelming or in your face. It's layered, proportionate, and subtly complex. The strawberry blends right into the custard creating this decadent and sweet treat with a little textured graham note on the bottom. It's all working in sync, and even the numbers make me happy. An absolute joy to vape. ADV recipe here. I faved it. Have you?"},{"user":"MrColdOne","text":"I'm crowning you man!!! This is a sad/happy day! A sad day because many people, myself included have chased this recipe for so many years! And I'm almost sad to see it come to an end. But such a happy day because I can now make as much mother's milk in my own home. After looking at this recipe it all makes sense too. I went up and got a bottle of mother's milk and after a two day steep this recipe is so damn close I'll even say pretty much exact. Awesome freakin job man!!!
