We started with \"Blueberry Soda\" and we wanted to use VT Bilberry ripe as its a nice syrupy jammy blueberry.  We also wanted to use Fizzy Sherb so we started with those 2 and added the citrus soda to bump up the citrus a bit and add some more effervescence.  We both LOVE FLV Boysenberry and it really seemed like the perfect berry to pair with VT Bilberry ripe.  This mix alone with the WS-23 was pretty spot on, but we felt the need to candy it up and that's where the sweetener came into play to make this mix perfect.\r\n\r\nCome join us on Discord! https://discord.gg/ufVTyAQ","steep_days":"0 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"total_reviews":1,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:50:57.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"2553","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Fizzy Sherbet","vendor":"VT","millipercent":3500},{"name":"Bilberry Ripe","vendor":"VT","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Boysenberry","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Citrus Soda","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":250},{"name":"Super Sweet","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":500},{"name":"WS-23","vendor":"OTHR","millipercent":250}],"reviews":[{"user":"xoxmx","score":"5","text":"Very nice mix.
