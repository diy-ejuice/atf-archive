At 1-2 weeks it takes on the Oreo taste with a nice creamy vanilla filling.\r\n\r\nFlavour Breakdown:\r\nTBV Cookie and Creameos - This flavour I find to taste like crushed Oreo cookie (without filling)\r\n\r\nCAP Vanilla Custard (v1) - This is my go to bakery custard, gives to the creamy vanilla body\r\n\r\nTFA Vanilla Swirl - I wanted a vanilla right in the front of the mix and fits really well with the other 2 vanillas\r\n\r\nTFA French Vanilla Deluxe - I love this flavour, I find it adds a rich and creamy vanilla butter taste.\r\n\r\nCAP Sugar Cookie - a nice addition to add to the cookieness of the blend\r\n\r\nFA Meringue - This transforms vanilla cream / custard base into a more sugary version making it more Oreo filling like.\r\n\r\nThis has been an awesome ADV cookie vape for me I can't put down, I hope others enjoy it as much as I do.","steep_days":"14","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-11-28T12:02:49.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"1019","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Vanilla Custard","flavor_id":"131","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":3500},{"name":"Vanilla Swirl","flavor_id":"189","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1250},{"name":"French Vanilla Deluxe","flavor_id":"169","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Sugar Cookie","flavor_id":"115","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":750},{"name":"Cookie And Creameos","flavor_id":"10317","vendor":"TBV","millipercent":3250},{"name":"Meringue","flavor_id":"530","vendor":"FA","millipercent":250}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"154213","name":"Triple Decker O-re-o"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
