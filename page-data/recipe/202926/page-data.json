A dark and smooth black coffee with a hint of cream. It definitely has that Tiramisu type flavor but much creamier with more body. The VT Coffee Milk Froth compliments the FA UP very well. It's the base of the coffee creamer and it delivers wonderfully. I normally use FA Vienna Cream in any coffee recipe I create. I'm using it as the whipped cream topping plus it gives the recipe the cohesiveness I was looking for.  The VT Milk Base is my go to flavor for all my Dairy recipes. In this recipe it didn't disappoint.\r\n\r\nPlease enjoy and give me your feedback!!","steep_days":"5","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-06T20:46:05.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"873","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"UP (coffee)","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1250},{"name":"Coffee Milk Froth","vendor":"VT","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Vienna Cream","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Super Sweet","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":400},{"name":"Milk Fresh","vendor":"VT","millipercent":1500}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"202926","name":"Dream Cream Coffee"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
