Love bananas, tobacco and butterscotch? Look no further.\r\nTry this mild banana vape with a rich vanilla tobacco flavor and sweet butterscotch.\r\n\r\nBuilding blocks:\r\n\r\nRF SC Butterscotch is a lovely addition to this recipe, it bridges the banana and vanilla perfectly. \r\n'Solo tested at 2.5%, the recommended.maximum, steep 3 days.\r\nIt's got a rich, dark butterscotch taste. and is quite creamy and with a mild throat hit.\r\nPerfect mixer for coffee, tobacco, chocolate and some fruits that needs a rich butterscotch layer.' \r\nIf you do not have the RF SC, it can be subbed with FLV Butterscotch.\r\n\r\nRy4 Double used for its caramel, vanilla notes and mellow tobacco flavor. I added TFA Red Oak to give a sweet smoked touch to this recipe. i would have use FA oak but i felt this it would be a little dry on the mix.\r\n\r\nJF Vanille got that deep dark vanilla taste and soly added to support the RY4 vanilla flavors\r\n\r\nTFA Toasted Marshmallow to round and bind this mix.\r\n\r\ns/v 48 hours to settle but give it 7 days or more for the RY4 to fully grow and makes this mix a rich balanced banana cream with smoked flavors.\r\n\r\nEnjoy.\r\nshare and rate if you like it.","steep_days":"7","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"total_reviews":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-05T11:04:44.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"2014","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Banana Cream","vendor":"LA","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Red Oak","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":250},{"name":"Butterscotch â€“ SC","vendor":"RF","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Ry4 Double","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":3750},{"name":"Toasted Marshmallow","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Vanilla","vendor":"JF","millipercent":1000}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"48271","name":"Vague Tobacco ((Smoking Hot Banana))"}}}
