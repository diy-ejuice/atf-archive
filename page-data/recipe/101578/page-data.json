The main ingredient i wanted to work with was the cinnamon danish swirl that is a great flavour but i find a bit tricky to work with sometimes. Adding the cheese cake graham cracker really helps it out in a big way and the custard and ice cream help smooth out the bakery profile and some off notes i get from the danish swirl.\r\n\r\nI added the cantaloupe because i love it lol and helped it out with some peach if you want more of a peach profile go .75% peach and .25% cantaloupe.\r\nThis was a great learning curve for me and i learnt alot about these flavours through trial and error. there are so many things i wanted to add but Sydney vapour don't have unfortunately. but all these flavours are staple flavours for your mixing.\r\n#DIYDOWNUNDERMAYCHALLENGE","steep_days":"20","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T22:32:54.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"1153","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Cantaloupe","flavor_id":"220","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1250},{"name":"Cereal 27","flavor_id":"4163","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Cheesecake (graham Crust)","flavor_id":"152","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Cinnamon Danish Swirl","flavor_id":"35","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":3500},{"name":"Dragonfruit","flavor_id":"226","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":750},{"name":"Peach (juicy)","flavor_id":"254","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":250},{"name":"Vanilla Bean Ice Cream","flavor_id":"4","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Vanilla Custard","flavor_id":"131","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":2000}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"101578","name":"The cantaloupe twist"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
