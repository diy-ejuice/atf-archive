So this isn't a very strawberry forward mix. I wanted a strong emphasise on the thick custard with a bit of strawberry to keep it interesting.\r\n\r\nFA Custard = FA Custard Premium\r\n\r\nThe Custard:\r\nI wanted more if a dairy custard and TFA Vanilla Swirl was perfect to bring in a milk like quality into the mix with the vanilla notes that I needed. FA Custard Premium is perfect for the buttery quality of custard and INW Custard adds the richness and egginess that I needed. \r\n\r\nThe Strawberry Jello: \r\nFA Juicy Strawberry adds this sugary element to the mix and TFA Strawberry helps bring the strawberry a bit more forward. Swedish fish is used low to help create a jello sensation and doesn't add too much to the taste of Swedish fish. \r\n\r\nSuper sweet is optional. What can I say, it tastes commercial now.
