I have to get FLV Milk Choc. and FW Caramel Candy but i will definitely be mixing this one up. I never picked up the FLV Milk Chocolate so I just added an extra .5% of Glamour Chocolate. That being said this shit is awesome very thick, rich, and smooth but I feel it needs at least 2 weeks to steep. Great recipe and keep it up."}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"81895","name":"dec路a路dent"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
