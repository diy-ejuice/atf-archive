He used cherimoya with dragon fruit and juicy orange. It was really good but I thought the cherimoya was just a little funky for my liking so I used guanabana to keep the tropical vibe going and switched out the juicy orange for cap sweet tangerine for a more syrupy sweet smoothie.","steep_days":"3 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"total_reviews":2,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:51:06.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"5781","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Dragon Fruit - Pitaya","vendor":"INW","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Guanabana","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Smoothie Base","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Sweet Tangerine","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1000}],"reviews":[{"user":"Ebc88","score":"5","text":"Excellent usage of Guanabana and dragonfruit.
