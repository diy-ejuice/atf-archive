I know what you SHOULD be vaping on, try putting a better banana in your mouth tonight with my new recipe! This creamy strawberry/banana ice cream cookie sandwich will leave a creamy taste in your mouth, and it might even leave a different type of cream in your pants. \r\n\r\nA little backstory on this recipe, I started with sugar cookie as the main cookie portion, but it was just too creamy and strong and seemed to explode in your mouth, instead of gently sliding into your throat, one piece at a time to taste each section giving you a rich and sensual experience. Cookie and Biscuit seemed to give it a good cookie base that gently holds the banana ice cream between it's supple cheeks, letting you taste that creamy ice cream sauce while being held together. Instead of the two parts celebrating their strengths, they work together to create the ultimate vaping experience, giving you the satisfaction you have always been searching for.","steep_days":"7 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":4.8,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:49:11.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"4429","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Biscuit","flavor_id":"642","vendor":"INW","millipercent":500},{"name":"Vanilla Swirl","flavor_id":"189","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Strawberry (ripe)","flavor_id":"271","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Vienna Cream","flavor_id":"516","vendor":"FA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Sweetener","flavor_id":"339","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Banana Cream","flavor_id":"210","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Vanilla Bean Ice Cream","flavor_id":"186","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Cookie","flavor_id":"490","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000}],"reviews":[{"user":"MotherPunker","text":"great mix!  just mixd it up last night with a 6 ml sample (which i always do cuz I'm stupid picky lol) and finished it before I could let it steep.  Mixing up a bigger batch now and hopefully can get this one to sit a bit.  Nice work :)   and btw, the recipe \"inspired by\" this one is the exact same....not sure why this guy copied and posted your recipe."},{"user":"cdaniell30","text":"The cookie base of this is legit.  The recipe is damn good as-is, but I'm eventually going to do this without the strawb and banana and add in some different chocolates to see what happens.&#xD;\n"},{"user":"HerrHut","text":"Cookie vape with a hint of banana. Not bad."},{"user":"lococarnage","text":"Love this recipe. One of my all day vapes.  Banana cream in the front, vanilla cookie in the back. The second time I made it I used 5% Banana Cream and increased Cookie and Biscuit slightly.

Just a shake and vape but I'm sure it'll just keep getting better!"}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"35888","name":"The Vengeful Banana"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
