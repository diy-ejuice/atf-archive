To me and everyone that tries them side by side it's 90%+ to being a spot on clone.

If you don’t know the name fennel candy you’ll still almost certainly recognize the taste. I always put 4 drops of FA Bitter Wizard per 30ml into all my mixes; it neutralizes the sweet taste of the VG and lets you taste your flavors a lot better. I also added 0.25% FLV Sweetness and 0.25% FW Sweetener. This mix is another great use of TFA Absinthe, which is turning into one of my favorite flavors. Also try it in “Cool and Sassy,” a root beer mix here on All the Flavors."},{"user":"RuntDastardly","text":"Mixed on 11/20 and FINALLY got to it on 12/15, and, BOY, did this one scare me for the first 2 hits! Powerful blast of anise to the face! After that, though, it settled right in and that awesome torrone/meringue/caramel combo lifted it into this incredible symphony of smooth, sweet, spicy goodness. This is a truly glorious recipe, and so exquisitely unique in terms of flavor and texture. I can see this being in my rotation forever, but it's definitely one of those recipes that everybody in search of something different should try for an exciting change of pace. I've never tried Attara Artisan's Bombay, but, this is an excellent recipe right here. Kudos!"}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"16327","name":"Sweet Fennel Candy"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
