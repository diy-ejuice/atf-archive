While I like the original recipe I wanted to twist it by adding Cap Double Watermelon (Bull City Flavors) which is a nice mild middle of the road background Watermelon flavor. It helps accentuate the Strawberry while adding a light floral and candy like Watermelon flavor to the vape. I also added Cap Super Sweet because I like my lemonade on the sweet side. Plus the addition of WS-23 (30% concentrate from ecigExpress) gives it that nice icy coolness. Just to be clear the Lemonade flavor is actually called Flavor West Natural Lemonade. This one of my favorite Summer ADVs.","steep_days":"3","temperature":"0","recipe_score":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-12T11:51:53.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"1592","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Lemonade","flavor_id":"1336","vendor":"FW","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Strawberry (ripe)","flavor_id":"271","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Sweet Strawberry","flavor_id":"121","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Double Watermelon","flavor_id":"48","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1000},{"name":"WS-23","flavor_id":"8085","vendor":"OTHR","millipercent":330},{"name":"Super Sweet","flavor_id":"2384","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":500}],"reviews":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"102522","name":"Strawmelonade"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
