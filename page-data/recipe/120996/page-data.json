Even Wayne's Milk Plus Remix ( https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/78933#milk_plus_by_bonzai_vapors_remixmonth_by_enyawreklaw ), which was better than the original, but I felt was dissappointing.  Neither are bad, I just wanted more caramel.  This delivers for me.  Some people that have tried it only get butterscotch, not me.  I get a rich creamy caramel with a dense mouth feel (thank you whipped cream).","steep_days":"7","temperature":"0","recipe_score":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-10T16:00:58.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"1282","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Pudding Base","flavor_id":"8948","vendor":"VT","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Vanilla Pudding","flavor_id":"4433","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Butterscotch","flavor_id":"8845","vendor":"VT","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Caramel (salted)","flavor_id":"1232","vendor":"FW","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Caramel Candy","flavor_id":"150","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Super Sweet","flavor_id":"2384","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":500},{"name":"Butter Toffee","flavor_id":"3504","vendor":"RF","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Whipped Cream","flavor_id":"193","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2500}],"reviews":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"120996","name":"Wizards Beard"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
