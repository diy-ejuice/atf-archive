It is my take on a Bourbon banana foster. This recipe is good after an overnight steep! Give it a try and let me know what you think in the reviews!!!!!ðŸ˜ƒðŸ˜œ I just realized I had to put butter pecan pie wonder flavors when I used butter pecan pie real flavors super concentrate because it wasn't available for a selection teach me to put up recipes late at night because I forget to right down what I did. Sorry if anyone mixed it the way its written but I bet its good either way lol.","steep_days":"1","temperature":"420","recipe_score":5,"total_reviews":2,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:49:32.000-05:00","best_vg":"75%","views":"2962","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Banana","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":750},{"name":"Banana PurÃ©e","vendor":"WF","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Brown Sugar","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":750},{"name":"Bourbon","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":500},{"name":"Vanilla Cream Extra SC","vendor":"WF","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Rich Cinnamon","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":100},{"name":"Butter","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":750},{"name":"Butter Pecan Pie","vendor":"WF","millipercent":2000}],"reviews":[{"user":"Aritria","score":"5","text":"I too mixed this up using WF Butter Pecan Pie.  I did a version as written (aside from the note) and a version using HS Banana instead of the FLV Banana.  I think it might be a little placebo that I prefer HS Banana to any other however you made a great recipe here and props to MlNikon for suggesting it a DIY OR DIE show or chat recently because I wouldn't have ever found it otherwise.  I'm hoping the vanilla comes through more on a 5 day steep as both of my batches are 3 days currently but great recipe!!  Thanks for sharing it with us!"},{"user":"mlNikon","score":"5","text":"This is so damn tasty! Good job sir! I mixed it up using wf butter pecan pie though because I don't have the rfsc version and I didn't pay attention to the note...oops. Anyway I just wanted to let you know I am enjoying the shit out of this. One of my favorite banana vapes to date. I love the touch of rich cinnamon in this.
