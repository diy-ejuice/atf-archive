I was basically just using what I had lying around and it turned out very good!!!  Let steep 2 or 3 days to bring out the creams but also works as a SAV. I'm very new to mixing and like I said just wanted to come up with something with what I had. If anyone has any suggestions to make this better I'm all ears but damn it's tasty the way it is.
