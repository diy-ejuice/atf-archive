They were touring the borough of Queens, NEW YAWK and picked up these awesome Colombian snacks that looked amazing.\r\n\r\nIt's a crunchy waffle wafer layered with Dulce De Leche in between. There's probably better choice for the waffle cone out there but I'm limited to what I got. Still experimenting with this so subject to change in the future! If you mix it up, leave a comment and let's brainstorm!\r\n\r\nINW Biscuit and TFA Graham Cracker Clear are going to be the crunchy, primarily for the texture and dryer mouthfeel + FW Waffle for some waffle flavor. Keeping it low so it's just barely noticeable and doesn't give too much maple flavor some folks get at higher percentages.\r\n\r\nJF Dulce De Leche because it's fucking amazing, TFA Dairy Milk + FA Fresh Cream to soften it because I don't want a syrup, more of a creamy spread. Plus they help to smooth out the recipe in general so you're not vaping on straight dry biscuit with dulce de leche on the side.","steep_days":"7","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-11-29T18:19:58.000-05:00","best_vg":"60%","views":"1048","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Biscuit","flavor_id":"642","vendor":"INW","millipercent":750},{"name":"Graham Cracker Clear","flavor_id":"325","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Waffle","flavor_id":"1457","vendor":"FW","millipercent":750},{"name":"Dulce De Leche","flavor_id":"4575","vendor":"JF","millipercent":1200},{"name":"Dairy/Milk","flavor_id":"2164","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Cream Fresh","flavor_id":"540","vendor":"FA","millipercent":500}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"108034","name":"Arequipe"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
