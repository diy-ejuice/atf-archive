I worked on this for a while and I'm proud to share it.\r\n\r\n####The breakdown of the recipe:\r\n\r\n####Yogurt Base:\r\n-Creamy Yogurt (CAP)\r\n-Greek Yogurt (TFA)\r\n-Cream Fresh (FA)\r\n\r\n####Mango:\r\n-Philippine Mango (TFA)\r\n-Golden Eye (NR/PUR)*\r\n-Sweet Mango (CAP)\r\n-Mango (FLV)\r\n\r\n*Golden Eye (NR/PUR) - This is a sweet, an almost tangy mango all mixed into one. It's a great blender flavor and is very smooth. Works great to help with the top note for the mango. Love this flavor.\r\n-If you don't have Golden Eye, mix it without it. It's still delicious. Then when your at Nic River, pickup a bottle, mix this up with it and see the magic happen.\r\n\r\n####Mango Enhancer:\r\n-Lime Tahity Distilled (FA)\r\n-EM from Sweetener (TFA)\r\n\r\n####Low Pass Filter:\r\n-Vanilla Swirl (TFA)\r\n\r\n####Sweetener:\r\n-Honey (FA) 1 drop per 15ml (used original Flavour Art bottle)\r\n*If you don't like honey, then omit this flavor.\r\n-Sweetener (TFA)\r\n\r\n####Blender:\r\nMTS Vape Wizard (FA) - 1 Drop per 10ml (used an original Flavour Art bottle)\r\n*This is not a must have but it helps the recipe.\r\n\r\nThis is my first post on ATF and wanted to make it a good one. A big thank you to Wayne for introducing me to this great art, and everyone I have learned from. I began mixing when Wayne first started his channel and love it to this day.\r\n\r\nI mix this anywhere from 60-70 VG. All the ingredients are important in this recipe and make it work. \r\n\r\n*Update 2/11/18 : I have tried to remix this recipe using less ingredients, numerous times,  and I can't come up with one as good as this version.\r\n\r\n####Feedback is welcomed. If you mix this recipe and give me a review, in return, I will mix a recipe of yours and give you an honest review. Enjoy!","steep_days":"3 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-11T15:01:56.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"2682","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Cream Fresh","flavor_id":"540","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Creamy Yogurt","flavor_id":"5","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Greek Yogurt","flavor_id":"173","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Golden Eye","flavor_id":"5912","vendor":"NR","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Mango","flavor_id":"3516","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Philippine Mango","flavor_id":"258","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Sweet Mango","flavor_id":"120","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Lime Tahity Distilled","flavor_id":"415","vendor":"FA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Vanilla Swirl","flavor_id":"189","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Honey","flavor_id":"531","vendor":"FA","millipercent":90},{"name":"Sweetener","flavor_id":"339","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Mts Vape Wizard","flavor_id":"482","vendor":"FA","millipercent":150}],"reviews":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"33542","name":"Lassi - A Mango Love Story"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
