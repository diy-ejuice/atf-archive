Tons of flavour as expected with flavorah stuff but as good as i find some of there stuff they do have some shockers !! Its the main note through the whole recipe an it was begging to be paired with a good grapefruit imo \r\nINW  Grapefruit - A very sweet tart grapefruit that marrys well with the pink guava for the recipe ! Super fresh an perfect for this weather ! To high % an i felt some throat hit so 1.5 % was my sweet spot \r\nTPA Dragonfruit/INW Raspberry  - The supporting star in alot of fruit recipes pumps up the other fruits an with a bit of raspberry give the recipe some body an a nice secondary layer with some weight \r\nWS-23 - Never been a Koolada fan but Ws-23 is  good addition to keep that cool tropical flavour on a hot day \r\nTPA Ethyl maltol just tames down the tartness of the grapefruit an smooths the sharper notes together \r\nCAP super sweet - FOR THE WIN :-) \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","steep_days":"1","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-06T07:15:01.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"1161","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Pink Guava","flavor_id":"637","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":3500},{"name":"Grapefruit","flavor_id":"785","vendor":"INW","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Raspberry","flavor_id":"667","vendor":"INW","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Dragonfruit","flavor_id":"226","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Cactus","flavor_id":"647","vendor":"INW","millipercent":400},{"name":"Ethyl Maltol","flavor_id":"1710","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Super Sweet","flavor_id":"2384","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":500},{"name":"WS-3 (Koolada)","flavor_id":"5851","vendor":"SA","millipercent":1250}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"47663","name":"#WESTANDTOGETHERMANCHESTER "}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
