This is my version of a commercial profile that I find absolutely disgusting. I knew that I could make the profile delicious.\r\n\r\nCandied yams with a smidgen of cinnamon, drizzled in strawberry syrup with a bit of marshmallows and cookie.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI tried a few Yams and they were all mostly nasty with horrible off notes to me. FLV was pretty good but it tasted really raw and starchy but wasn't disgusting and no off notes. I knew that I needed something to warm it up and sort of cook it so using Rich cinnamon used super low achieved that first try. The Capella Sugar Cookie helps it out a bit here as the generic bakery kind of slides under as a base and fill it out. Sugar Cookie may not be the best but it's a phenomenal tool when used to build a bakery base. \r\n\r\nI shamelessly stole ID10-T's marshmallow idea from a lucky charms cereal and it fit very well here. FLV Marshmallow and FLV Whipped Cream. \r\n\r\nThen I tested strawberries in pairs. About 6 different iterations. RF, TFA Ripe, JF Sweet, INW Shisha, and then Capella released Ripe Strawberries. I was looking for something Ripe and syrupy kind of generic sweet red berry sauce that blended in. Shisha because... yeah... it's straight strawberry syrup. Capella because it brings that fairly authentic sweetened macerated strawberry thing. I love this new flavor. \r\n\r\nBalance was the trickiest part once I nailed down the ingredients.. I wanted something slightly separated that started with sweet cooked yams and finished with the berries and nuances to keep you wanting to come back to it. If you mix it up please leave a review if you're a member and able to. If you want to play with subs, the cookie and strawberries leave some wiggle room for tweaking to your favorites. The yam, marshmallow, whipped cream, and rich cinnamon are not able to be substituted. That candied yam base is a thing of beauty.

So many recipes promise to have all these layers of flavor but vape like a bunch of stuff all muddled together, especially the ones that are more complex. This one actually delivers. That's pretty freakin awesome! Also the marshmallow and strawberry syrup layers are delicious. It just turns out that vaping an authentic candied yam is more enjoyable to me in my imagination than in actuality.
