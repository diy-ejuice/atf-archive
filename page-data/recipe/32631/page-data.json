Im posting now before someone else makes this profile. I know these flavors pretty well and a longer steep is not going to hurt it. When looking at the list of ingredients I enjoyed alpine strawberry standalone @1.25% and its probably something I could vape alone and be happy with. My wife even hurt my feelings when I told her to try this flavor her words were \"this is the best recipe youve ever made\". OUCH. I dont value her opinion on flavors anyway her palate is shot to hell..proof here https://www.reddit.com/r/mixersclub/comments/5e9b0t/couples_that_vape_together_stay_together/ I get a jammy fresh strawberry preserve off this flavor. So that mixed with JF sweet strawberry as I like jf sweet straw to just stay low and compliment the jam. Apricot low as well to just barely lend some of its peach like qualities to the strawberry. CAP sugar cookie is G.O.A.T so you would imagine naturally how the cookie, butter, biscuit can leave you with a delicious shortbread. AS PROVEN BEFORE MYSELF. THAT  base is looking familar. With good reason because thats a very accurate shortbread base. Bav cream and hazelnut are just there to add not cream but bridge everything together and make it a lighter more blended feeling.
