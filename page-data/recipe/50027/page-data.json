To my palate, Albeit on the weak side, this ingredient is close to that note for me. There's no doubt in my mind this is in Lemon Tart.\r\n\r\n**FA Vienna Cream**\r\nSweetness, Cream and a sugar \"texture\".\r\n\r\n**TFA Toasted Marshmallow**\r\nAdded mouthfeel, But a light toasted note as well.\r\n\r\n**TFA Vanilla Bean Ice Cream**\r\nVanilla, Cream and sweetness.\r\n\r\n**CAP Cereal 27**\r\nHave I mentioned how much I love this ingredient? Contributes the cereal note.\r\n\r\n**FA Custard**\r\nPlays beautifully with the Lemon ingredients to bring a smoother lemon experience, Further enhances the Ice Cream notes as well.\r\n\r\n**FA Lemon Sicily**\r\nBecause FW is quite weak, I've added Lemon Sicily as backbone support to prevent the lemon note from fading over time.","steep_days":"5","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"total_reviews":1,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T22:32:11.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"4013","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Lemon Meringue Pie","vendor":"FW","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Vienna Cream","vendor":"FA","millipercent":750},{"name":"Toasted Marshmallow","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Vanilla Bean Ice Cream","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Cereal 27","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Custard","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Lemon Sicily","vendor":"FA","millipercent":250}],"reviews":[{"user":"jlhenry","score":"none","text":"I have been making this since you released it.
