This isn't a 1 for 1 of Tribeca but it is very reminiscent of it without being overly sweet like the original was.\r\nCan it really be a Tobacco S&V YES!! Yesss it can!!! I know this is just two ingredients I know Meringue looks high as hell and Soho looks like too much. I know it's hard to believe, but try it! It works and was my ADV for about 3 months. Not only was it my ADV but it's still what I vape when I cant taste anything else. This is a recipe is not mine originally a good friend shared the correct % with me after I tried his juice but he doesn't post on forums and does not want his name on the recipe.  My friend is in groups and knows I share this forward and I wanted to share it here too!

It is currently my ADV and it's so easy to make and being a SNV is an added bonus!  Thank you so much Juicefairy, you rock! :)","score":5},{"user":"Jbirdy34","text":"Not bad at all but I had to add some vanilla to it. Was just a tad to plain for my liking but I have also been using in a pod so that can be the reason. Tastes awesome with some vanilla ice cream LB and vbic cap. 1% and 2% in that order.","score":4},{"user":"Ihavenoidea","text":"This is currently my favorite way to vape Soho. Sometimes simple is the best. Well done!","score":5},{"user":"Xist","text":"Well played sir.  I haven't SFTested soho yet, and this is awfully close to that delicious Tribecca sultriness.  I found a Tribecca clone that is very close, and I think this will complete it...though with how simple this mix is, I may just run with this one!  Thank you, and again, well done!","score":5}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"96967","name":"Soho Time (SNV New Skool Tribeca type)"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
