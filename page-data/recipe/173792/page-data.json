As usual, I got on the hype train late lol. After devouring 2 blocks of this stuff I can confirm the hype is warranted. The delicious balance of white chocolate & caramel sweetness is highly addictive. I knew I had to try and simulate this in the best way I know how in an eLiquid.\r\nAfter many versions I have concluded that to make an eLiquid that truly replicates the real thing would become very sickly sweet and somewhat throaty as the flavour dominates our olfactory rather than only the palette. Sure I got very very close but to achieve a pleasant all day vape is more important to me.\r\nThis is why I have called this recipe \"CARAMILKed\".\r\nI have milked the base flavours from this overall profile with a lower saturation of sweetness that while it replicates the profile well, it is more like an essence of the original flavor profile that is as delicious but very smooth to vape. Make no mistake, this is delicious & balanced!\r\n\r\nThe Caramel:\r\nThe caramel part of this recipe is a cross between a commercial sweet caramel and a caramel based on condensed milk.\r\nThis is why I used the combination of FA Caramel, FA Butterscotch & Purilum Condensed Milk here. It took some balancing though.\r\n\r\nThe White Chocolate:\r\nThe chocolate part of this recipe took some work to balance as well. Flavorah White Chocolate has notes that can't be mistaken here and works really well when smoothed with VTA Vanilla Buttercream Frosting.\r\n\r\nThe Sweetness:\r\nThe Flavorah Frosting is a real hero here. It brings an edge of sweetness, body of texture, as well as a vanilla that compliments the caramel beautifully.\r\nThe cap super sweet is used a little high here at 1% but it's worth it to truly get that balance of sweetness right.\r\n\r\nOff the shake this is sweet, delicious and definitely reminiscent of the real thing. After 5 days steep its even smoother and better.\r\nAs the flavours linger after several puffs, I warn you, you will crave for more!\r\nIn summary this recipe has milked the essence of the original to provide the smoothest, delectable and delightful experience as an all day vape in an eLiquid.\r\n\r\nEnjoy!\r\n\r\nI enjoy this at 55W on a Single 0.25 ohm SST coil on a Recurve RDA.\r\n\r\nI hope you enjoy this just as much as I enjoyed creating this recipe, but let me know what you thought in the comments below.\r\n\r\nHow I come up this recipe on video now on You Tube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aX7tWvnvGDY\r\n\r\nSeriously if you like a solid recipe that works give it a go!\r\n\r\nCheers for reading this far, now go and get mixing!\r\n\r\n\"Together, Let's Discover!!!\"\r\n\r\nFacebook - https://www.facebook.com/groups/diydownunder/\r\nDiscord - https://discord.gg/kH4Fqbc\r\nYoutube - https://www.youtube.com/c/diydownunder\r\nWebsite - https://www.diydownunder.com/\r\nInstagram IGTV : @diydownunder","steep_days":"5","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:51:13.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"2447","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Butterscotch","vendor":"FA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Carmel (caramel)","vendor":"FA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Condensed Milk","vendor":"PUR","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Frosting","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Super Sweet","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Vanilla Buttercream Frosting","vendor":"VT","millipercent":1500},{"name":"White Chocolate","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1250}],"reviews":[{"user":"wadeyloops","text":"A solid take on this profile. The buttercream frosting takes on a slightly powdery note as it steeps through making it taste like white dry icing. I think it may be a touch high here by about 0.25% or so which isn't a lot for my taste expectation. The caramel notes are subtle but to be fair I have not tasted this chocolate yet but have had similar. The caramel notes are also a bit \"smokey\" although they are smooth as is the whole vape experience as a whole. I only added 0.6% super sweet and this was a touch on the high side for me personally and am glad I did not go higher for my own taste as at that level it was high enough. This is really worth mixing and playing around with e.g sub condensed milk for PUR caramel coffee with sweet milk or increase the caramel by a smidgen and add in some banana as I am about to. 4.69/5 "}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"173792","name":"CARAMILKED"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
