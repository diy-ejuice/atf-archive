(thanks to @tootall for his recommendation of sugar cone)\r\nDevon cream adds a thick cream  with a slight chocolate back note  that supports the hazelnut cream  and  hazelnut coffee.  \r\nHazelnut cream and Hazelnut coffee   work together to create  the hazelnut cream center  along with  frosting for a  sweet butter cream texture.   The combination   of coffee and hazelnut  give the impression of a cocca note that really works well here. \r\nThe powder sugar is subtle and adds touch of powder sugar on the wafer cookie.   \r\nAdd sweetner to taste.\r\nSUBS:  if you want a sweeter cookie with more butter notes you can use CAP sugar cookie  instead of the crispy  wafer).  Powdered sugar is not needed but adds that  impression of a powder sugar on top of the wafer cookie  \r\n\r\nLooking to learn more about making your own mixes - Check out what DIY Downunder has to offer:\r\nFacebook group : https://www.facebook.com/groups/diydownunder/\r\nDoscord: https://discord.gg/kH4Fqbc\r\nYourtube channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCTCwb7ULyfJALQlehomZZQA \r\nWebsite : https://www.diydownunder.com","steep_days":"5","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T02:16:25.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"2256","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Crispy Wafer SC","vendor":"WF","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Devon Cream","vendor":"VT","millipercent":750},{"name":"Frosting","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1300},{"name":"Hazelnuts & Cream","vendor":"WF","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Hazelnut Coffee","vendor":"HS","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Powdered Sugar","vendor":"OOO","millipercent":750},{"name":"Sugar Cone SC","vendor":"WF","millipercent":2500}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"111252","name":"Hazelnut Cream Waffle  Cookie "}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
