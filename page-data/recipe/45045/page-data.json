I replaced Rich Cinnamon with a couple strawberries. I also bumped Cereal 27 from 3% to 5% so it will stand up to the strawberries enough. Really simple adaptation, yet it radically changes the profile. See Toasted for the cereal notes if you're interested.\r\n\r\nFlavor Notes:\r\n\r\nCAP Sweet Strawberry is a bright, sugary, candied flavor. It's exactly the kind of Strawberry you want in your cornflakes. At 4%, it‚Äôs present without totally overtaking everything.\r\n\r\nTPA Strawberry Ripe brings a touch of that authentic, fresh strawberry flavor to the mix. 2% isn't very apparent, but it fleshes out the CAP Sweet Strawberry. There's not much else to say about it.\r\n\r\nThis is a good shake and vape. Let it sit for 1-3 days first and you will be rewarded.\r\n\r\nHappy mixing. üëΩ","steep_days":"10 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"updated_at":"2020-12-12T14:05:20.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"5718","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Cereal 27","flavor_id":"4163","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":5000},{"name":"Graham Cracker Clear","flavor_id":"325","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Cream Fresh","flavor_id":"540","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Meringue","flavor_id":"530","vendor":"FA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Toasted Marshmallow","flavor_id":"340","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Sweet Strawberry","flavor_id":"121","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Strawberry (ripe)","flavor_id":"271","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Super Sweet","flavor_id":"2384","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":250}],"reviews":[{"user":"Ebc88","text":"Awesome recipe full of flavor.

But i think i might enjoy it with the AP instead of the gcc more and a little dairy/milk maybe.&#xD;\nIn the end still a good mix and im puffing through a tank right now well done.","score":5},{"user":"Screwdriver","text":"This is a banger recipe, I can't get enough of this... so flavorful. &#xD;\nCan't believe there's no appreciation for this one. &#xD;\nThis is in my top 10 and I've mixed over 350 recipes to date. &#xD;\nMany thx for this one MrBurgundy.","score":5}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"45045","name":"Pink Eye"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
