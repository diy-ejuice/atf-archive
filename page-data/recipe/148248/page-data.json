It is exactly what it says it is, sweet ruby red grapefruit grapefruit juice, sparkling grapefruit soda, little booze with some authentic tequila taste, and a delicate but delightful hint of rose. Seems like this is the perfect way to go with that FLV Tequila. I get kind of an annoying Mountain Dew taste from it usually but the grapefruit and citrus soda seem to just use that instead of fighting with it.
