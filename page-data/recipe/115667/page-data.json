The story of how armaretto came to be is pretty interesting. I would like to believe it is true   In 1525, a Saronno church commissioned artist Bernardino Luini, one of Leonardo da Vinci's pupils, to paint its sanctuary with frescoes. As the church was dedicated to the Virgin Mary, Luini needed to depict the Madonna, but was in need of a model. He found his inspiration in a young widowed innkeeper, who became his model and (in most versions) lover. Out of gratitude and affection, the woman wished to give him a gift. Her simple means did not permit much, so she steeped apricot kernels in brandy and presented the resulting concoction to a touched Luini\r\n**VT Brandy, FA marzipan, FA almond and Caramel**  create the amaretto base for this cocktail..   the combination of fa almond  and marzipan is just  perfect for this  and the brandy adds some depth and  bozzie notes.  The caramel just adds more dark sweetness and mouth feel that is needed. \r\n\r\n**INW lemon and VT Lemon sour and VT golden syrup**  create the sweet and sour mix for   an amaretto sour type of  beverage.  INW lemon is that tart  sweet candied lemon along with the  bright sourness of the lemon sour  .   ( **NOTE**you can sub with FLV milk and honey 1.75% ,  LA lemonade 3%  and FA lemond Sicily  .75%  but it  does not have that sweet almost candied lemon syrup quality  I wanted)  \r\n\r\n**VT blood orange champagne**  adds that top  orange note that is sometimes added to a amaretto sour and some more booze notes \r\n\r\n**Add sweetener of choice**  if you like it sweet.. and yeah I do  - I use FLV sweetness here around  .50   \r\nSpecial thanks to liam davey and @starsandclouds \r\n\r\nLOOKING for a group to learn about mixing your own eliquid check out these groups and your tube channels\r\n\r\nhttps://www.facebook.com/groups/diydownunder/\r\nhttps://www.facebook.com/groups/eatsleepmixrepeat/\r\nhttps://www.diydownunder.com/ \r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/user/frank1360\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0xkeZFSG04","steep_days":"5","temperature":"0","recipe_score":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-10T13:45:41.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"1300","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Almond","flavor_id":"528","vendor":"FA","millipercent":750},{"name":"Blood Orange Champagne","flavor_id":"8833","vendor":"VT","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Marzipan","flavor_id":"467","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Golden Syrup","flavor_id":"8887","vendor":"VT","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Lemon","flavor_id":"660","vendor":"INW","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Sour Lemon","flavor_id":"8971","vendor":"VT","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Caramel","flavor_id":"151","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Brandy","flavor_id":"8841","vendor":"VT","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Armenia (apricot)","flavor_id":"507","vendor":"FA","millipercent":500}],"reviews":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"115667","name":"The  Inkeepers Nectar "}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
