It's a bit heavier on the custard and pie crust than some other variants might be, but that's what I was going for.\r\n\r\nTFA Key Lime - This is the main note. A tart and not too sweet key lime that hits you right up front.\r\n\r\nTFA Cheesecake Graham Crust/Pie Crust - The CGC helps to cut through the tartness of the key lime and paired with pie crust creates a nice pie base.\r\n\r\nFA Meringue - This is there to give us that whipped meringue that you often find on the real thing. 1% is all you need to achieve this.\r\n\r\nTFA Custard - This gives you the body of the recipe. Pretty straight forward.","steep_days":"3 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:49:00.000-05:00","best_vg":"80%","views":"1366","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Key Lime","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":10000},{"name":"Cheesecake (graham Crust)","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Meringue","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Pie Crust","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Vanilla Custard","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":5000}],"reviews":[{"user":"evild","text":"Excellent!"},{"user":"OldAgeVaper","text":"I really enjoyed This one in my tanks, Although the key lime concentrate may become a little expencive to keep up production lol.&#xD;\nWell done great recipe !!&#xD;\nA little update this is one of best mixes ive done from this site, Im around 500ml mixed now and always have a 100ml at hand top recipe !&#xD;\nIf you like lime pie youll love this."}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"27165","name":"Southern Most Pie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
