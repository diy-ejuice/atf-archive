So this is the final recipe after making a few different batches. Setup: Recoil RDA, dual coil build flat clapton wire @ 0,13 ohm's, 70 watt. Very nice creamy caramel taste, but you really need to let it steep for about 3 weeks to let the Dulce de leche settle down en blend in with the other flavours. If it is to sweet for you reduce the sweetener to half a percent, i personally got a sweet tooth lol","steep_days":"21","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:48:54.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"2906","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Catalan Cream","vendor":"FA","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Marshmallow","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Sweet Cream","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Dulce De Leche","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Caramel (original)","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Super Sweet","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Butterscotch Ripple","vendor":"FW","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Vanilla Custard","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Caramel Candy","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1500}],"reviews":[{"user":"reuben","text":"Love this mix make 120ml at a time"}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"19971","name":"Caramel&cream"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
