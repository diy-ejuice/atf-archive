This is my take on a Apricot danish with a cinnamon glaze drizzle. I've used a darker white chocolate to help blend the cream cheese icing and built the pastry aspect with the graham cracker clear and the sugar cookie which are both pretty delicious for my taste.

But there’s something weird in the top notes, something about the way the flavors are combining makes that frosting just a little plasticky or overly waxy. I wish I knew how to fix it, but I don’t know what’s actually doing that, because these flavors have seemed fine to me in other settings. It’s just something off about the way they’re meshing here.
