First, I lowered the CAP Juicy Lemon and raised the INW Lemon.  INW Lemon is really my favorite straight lemon flavor, but the INW Juicy Lemon adds some juiciness.  Next, I dropped TPA Berry Mix in favor of INW Raspberry.  I was just recently smelled INW Raspberry and I really wanting to use it in a recipe.  I think it works really well alongside the Forest Fruit.  The last change I made was to add some TPA Sweet Cream on the suggestion of a redditor.  which added some sweetness to the cheesecake base.\r\n\r\nOverall I think the lemon pairs up with the sweet berries very well, adding a nice tartness, while the cheesecake is more distinct than the last iteration.  I'm really enjoying it after a 7 day steep.","steep_days":"7","temperature":"450","recipe_score":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-11T19:41:57.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"1207","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Cream Cheese Icing","flavor_id":"2380","vendor":"LA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"New York Cheesecake","flavor_id":"90","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":5000},{"name":"Shisha Vanilla","flavor_id":"841","vendor":"INW","millipercent":500},{"name":"Vanilla Custard","flavor_id":"131","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":500},{"name":"Custard","flavor_id":"484","vendor":"FA","millipercent":300},{"name":"Juicy Lemon","flavor_id":"79","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":500},{"name":"Lemon","flavor_id":"660","vendor":"INW","millipercent":750},{"name":"Forrest Mix (forest Fruit Mix)","flavor_id":"453","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Raspberry","flavor_id":"667","vendor":"INW","millipercent":750},{"name":"Sweet Cream","flavor_id":"183","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":500}],"reviews":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"113311","name":"Simply Lemonberry Cheesecake - v2"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
