Probably the closest I've gotten so far. It's funky, smoky, and dirty. \r\n\r\nFLV Arabian- If you've struggled with this flavor like I have, make a 10% dilution and start playing with that at .5%. It's strong and funky, but once you find your comfort zone with it, it is a pretty interesting flavor to play with. It adds a musty, grassy, earthy taste. Not something you want in your face, but it's nice when hidden in the base. \r\n\r\nFLV Classic Cigarette- FA Burley, but usable is how I like to describe it. Grassy notes, a bit of ash, and a pretty satisfying throat hit. It's strong as hell, and even at 1% it is going to be the star of your mix. \r\n\r\nINW TA Cuban Cigar- one of my favorite additives to use in a cigarette mix. Taste wise it doesn't add a whole lot. There's a pleasant Tobacco Leaf taste, but I use it mostly to dry things up a bit. Never had a cigarette with really wet smoke, so I throw this in to give it a dry smoke feel. \r\n\r\nINW DNB- no burning cigarette recipe is complete without it! At least in my opinion. Gimme all the dirty ash taste. \r\n\r\nAdding 1% FA Polar Blast (or cooling agent of your choice) can turn this in to a nice Menthol cigarette. I've given some to someone that was struggling to give up Newports and he said it was crazy how accurate it was to a Newport. Hated menthols, so I can't say much about that. But if you liked menthols or you're trying to help someone quit menthols, give it a go!","steep_days":"7","temperature":"0","recipe_score":3,"updated_at":"2020-12-05T15:43:09.000-05:00","best_vg":"%","views":"2529","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Arabian Tobacco","flavor_id":"4383","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":80},{"name":"Classic Cigarette","flavor_id":"4358","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Tobacco Absolute Cuban Cigar","flavor_id":"8505","vendor":"INW","millipercent":1750},{"name":"Tobacco Dirty Neutral (dnb)","flavor_id":"2186","vendor":"INW","millipercent":1250}],"reviews":[{"user":"saklas","text":""},{"user":"skineedog","text":""}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"65018","name":"Lucy"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
