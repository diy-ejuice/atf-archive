I don't get much sting from brandy in general, so FA does the trick. If you want more punch, add some TFA Kentucky Bourbon for an alcoholic kick. Also heard VT makes a decent brandy with more of a boozy kick.\r\n\r\nFLV Back Bar Bitters - This is it. This is angostura bitters. No doubt 100%. The low percentage gives a nice spice note while not being overpowering to the mix.\r\n\r\nVT Fizzy Sherbert/CAP Lemon Lime - Thanks to AlfredPudding for the Fizzy Sherbert suggestion. This combo brings a nice bright, semi carbonated Sprite feel. Keep it a 1:1 ratio to raise or lower the amount of soda you'd prefer.\r\n\r\nFW Orange / FW Maraschino Cherry/CAP Super Sweet - While they are muddled at the bottom of a glass and cherries are topped, there is a sweet citrusy yet sticky aroma when drinking a Old Fashioned. Of course, this is a sweet.\r\n\r\nThe best part about this recipe is that it's completely tweakable. Think of it as visiting multiple bars around town, they all seem to have their own way of creating this drink. Forgot the sugar cubes? It's 1:59am and the bartender filled your glass 80% with brandy? There was only a splash of soda? You can do that. There doesn't seem to be a combination that doesn't work.\r\n\r\nI feel this is a recipe that will never die for me, but for now, LAST CALL!\r\n\r\nEDIT \r\nIf you are having issues finding FW Orange, it maybe labeled as FW Orange Natural. Seems there is a difference in name between BullCity and FlavorWest's site.","steep_days":"3 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T10:44:24.000-05:00","best_vg":"60%","views":"2714","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Brandy","flavor_id":"493","vendor":"FA","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Back Bar Bitters","flavor_id":"10082","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":250},{"name":"Fizzy Sherbet","flavor_id":"8878","vendor":"VT","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Lemon Lime","flavor_id":"83","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Orange","flavor_id":"1362","vendor":"FW","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Maraschino Cherry","flavor_id":"1349","vendor":"FW","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Super Sweet","flavor_id":"2384","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":750}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"144627","name":"Last Call - A Revisit on an Old Fashioned"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
