Or is it a Blueberry Cream? Wait, it kind of tastes like a Cheesecake, too! This mix plays tricks with your mind. I've even heard some getting waffle from it.

Where's the gritty crust coming from? I can't tell you how many cheesecake recipes I've mixed and I've never tasted the \"cheesecake\" part of it. It's usually some fruit with muddled cream mess.
