As a shake and vape I am mostly getting the vanilla custard and banana puree. I am thinking in 5-7 days the bisquit and deep fried pastry dough will pop out and the banana will soften. I made this recipe by searching online for a recipe to bake some cream puffs and came up with this I have never had a cream puff in real life so in true #mixinvixens fashion I took a shot at it.","steep_days":"7","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-05T15:43:46.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"1028","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Deep Fried Pastry Dough SC","vendor":"WF","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Biscuit","vendor":"INW","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Butter","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Cream","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Banana Pur√©e","vendor":"WF","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Vanilla Custard","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":2000}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"113900","name":"Banana Cream Puff #mixinvixens "}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
