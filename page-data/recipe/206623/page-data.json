At 1.3% it's just the right amount to shine and popcorn is here to add a little bit of butter and a tiny bit of texture. I use jammy berry as a dark fruit base(at 0.3% it's not too syrupy) and add a combination of three brighter fruit( peach, persimmon and cranberry) to lighten jammy berry and add a fresh and sweet fruitiness. Sweetness is a little bit high at .8% but I wanted to make a \" fun to eat muffin\" not a diet one....allow 5 to 7 days for lembas bread to show up nicely and to jammy berry to calm down. Enjoy!","steep_days":"5","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T21:33:30.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"380","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Cranberry","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":750},{"name":"Jammy Berry","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":300},{"name":"Lembas Bread","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1300},{"name":"Peach","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":400},{"name":"Persimmon","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":200},{"name":"Popcorn","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":500},{"name":"Sweetness","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":800}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"206623","name":"Hobbit's snack # developed flv"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
