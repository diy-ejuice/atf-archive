At 1.3% it's just the right amount to shine and popcorn is here to add a little bit of butter and a tiny bit of texture. I use jammy berry as a dark fruit base(at 0.3% it's not too syrupy) and add a combination of three brighter fruit( peach, persimmon and cranberry) to lighten jammy berry and add a fresh and sweet fruitiness. Sweetness is a little bit high at .8% but I wanted to make a \" fun to eat muffin\" not a diet one....allow 5 to 7 days for lembas bread to show up nicely and to jammy berry to calm down. Enjoy!","steep_days":"5","temperature":"0","recipe_score":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-12T03:47:44.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"389","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Cranberry","flavor_id":"2493","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":750},{"name":"Jammy Berry","flavor_id":"10150","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":300},{"name":"Lembas Bread","flavor_id":"8557","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1300},{"name":"Peach","flavor_id":"629","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":400},{"name":"Persimmon","flavor_id":"4420","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":200},{"name":"Popcorn","flavor_id":"8564","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":500},{"name":"Sweetness","flavor_id":"4413","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":800}],"reviews":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"206623","name":"Hobbit's snack # developed flv"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
