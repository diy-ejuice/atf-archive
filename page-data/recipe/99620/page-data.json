I hate steeping too but you know.\r\n\r\nAustralian chocolate and the VBG make the milk chocolate ish chocolate. The salted caramel and butter pecan and AP make the caramel pecan base.\r\n\r\nThis takes about a week to settle down and in. I lost my sample bottle for 2 moths. It was good after a week but after two months it held up very good and was slightly better.\r\n\r\nThe chocolate is well just what chocolate is when its vaped. Just ok at best.
