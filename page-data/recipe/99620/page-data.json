I hate steeping too but you know.\r\n\r\nAustralian chocolate and the VBG make the milk chocolate ish chocolate. The salted caramel and butter pecan and AP make the caramel pecan base.\r\n\r\nThis takes about a week to settle down and in. I lost my sample bottle for 2 moths. It was good after a week but after two months it held up very good and was slightly better.\r\n\r\nThe chocolate is well just what chocolate is when its vaped. Just ok at best. I do think TPA VBG does add some milkiness to chocolates. The salted caramel and butter pecan really have a nice butter caramel aftertaste. The AP really brings the nuttiness of the butter pecan out,","steep_days":"7","temperature":"0","recipe_score":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-10T17:57:30.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"1239","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Butter Pecan","flavor_id":"1212","vendor":"FW","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Australian Chocolate","flavor_id":"2657","vendor":"HS","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Caramel (salted)","flavor_id":"1232","vendor":"FW","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Vanilla Bean Gelato","flavor_id":"185","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Acetyl Pyrazine 5%","flavor_id":"1709","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":125}],"reviews":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"99620","name":"Chocolate Caramel Pecan Turtle"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
