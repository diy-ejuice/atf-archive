The icing is very sweet with a slight lemon undertone. When mixing this recipe it brought back all kinds of nostalgia, speifically licking off the animal icing figures.\r\n\r\nJF Biscuit and Cap Sugar Cookie work wonders together in creating the correct biscuit profile, with INW Biscuit used to add depth and give the baked effect on the outside. TFA cheesecake graham crust is used to add a litte more depth to the biscuit base and gives a slight wafer hint.\r\n\r\nFLV Frosting and LA Cream cheese icing work to create the hard icing on top of the biscuit, carrying the bulk of the sweetness.\r\n\r\nFW Fruit Flakes is extremely strong, Less is more in this scenario, Too much and you will end up a fruitloops biscuit. You could proably get away with subbing it out for FW Fruit rings or TFA Fruit circles at around 0.5%, but I found FW Fruit Flakes just does the job right.\r\n\r\nSome slight edits:\r\nTFA Lucky Leprechaun adds a slightly malty flavour while carrying very light fruit loop non lemony notes.\r\n\r\nEthyl Maltol, my think here is the recipe needs some rounding off, especially to keep the lemony notes in check and bring a little balance to the biscuit.\r\n\r\nTastes great as a SnV but 2 weeks will only do the mix justice.\r\n\r\nENJOY!","steep_days":"10","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"total_reviews":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T15:20:39.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"7374","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Biscuit","vendor":"INW","millipercent":250},{"name":"Biscuit","vendor":"JF","millipercent":750},{"name":"Cheesecake (graham Crust)","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Cream Cheese Icing","vendor":"LA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Frosting","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":500},{"name":"Fruity Flakes","vendor":"FW","millipercent":100},{"name":"Sugar Cookie","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Vanilla Cream","vendor":"INW","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Ethyl Maltol","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Lucky Leprechaun Cereal","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":400}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"47995","name":"Jungle Cookies (AKA the Zoo Biscuit)"}}}
