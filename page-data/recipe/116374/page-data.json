It‚Äôs almost like a cookie custard to me, and with that and the cream from the banana cream, it was the perfect match to make a \"raw\" cookie dough with mashed banana in it. \r\n\r\nThe cinnamon Sugar is doing 2 things. It is the sprinkle on top, but it also makes the raw cookie dough into a nice crispy baked cookie...\r\n\r\nLet it sit for a good 2-3 days and enjoy yourself a easy cheap Vape. It doesn‚Äôt have to be so damn complex everytime, and I really love that with this challenge üëç\r\n\r\nThanks to Cathy wood for making me do these notes. I know I means a lot to me when I‚Äôm looking at others recipes, so of course I should do em my self. Not sometimes, but always!
