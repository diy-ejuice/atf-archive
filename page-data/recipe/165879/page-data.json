Sweetener option. I use 0.25% super sweet and it was really nice. Be sure to give this recipe a MINIMUM 7 day steep due to FLV sweet dough needing time to fully do its job. The longer you leave it the more doughnut forward the recipe will be. Please leave a rating and review on the recipe for others to see.
