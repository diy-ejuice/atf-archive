It is likely because of how vague FA likes to be with some of their flavor names and profiles. At low percentages it is a lighter version of Joy IMO and from what I have been able to find it is supposed to be a jelly donut flavor with there being some debate as to whether its a strawberry or raspberry jelly note. At higher percentages the jelly note starts to emerge and I can’t quite put my finger on the exact fruit note other than a med-dark berry.\r\n\r\n3% FA Zeppola - by now we have all heard of this one. If you can’t get a hold of SA Doughnut this has got to be IMO the next best doughnut concentrate. I’d say \r\n\r\n3% would be the minimum concentration to use this flavor at. Nice fried dough taste with a hint of cinnamon and powdered sugar.\r\n\r\n2% CAP Vanilla Custard - a low percentage of CAP vanilla custard helps to add to the mouthfeel of this recipe and thicken it up. Also used as such a low percentage and also because I’m not using it to have it’s flavor prominent really helps make this recipe more suitable as a shake and vape but really 3-5 days should be this recipe’s sweet spot.\r\n\r\n1% FA Forrest Fruit - the 1 part of this recipe I really struggled with. did I want something to sweeten it? Something unexpected to make it less linear? Something to add a frosted or maybe a cream topping? Perhaps a coconut or powdered sugar dusting? I was really torn on that so knowing that the doughnut aspect of this recipe was where I wanted it to be what aspect of the existing ingredients did I want to have more presence. What would make it more enjoyable for my tastes? I finally arrived at FA Forrest Fruit. As all I knew about the fruit note in FA WoW was that it was some sort of dark berry I wanted to bring that note forward. INW black currant was considered as well but the amalgamation of various dark berries in FA Forrest Fruit made it my logical choice. \r\n\r\nIf you want powdered sugar note go with 1% OoO powdered sugar. \r\n\r\nIf you want a more jellied type fruit note go with 1% INW Shisha Strawberry. \r\n\r\nIf you want a coconut dusting go with 1% TPA Coconut Candy. \r\n\r\nIf you want a maple glazed note 1% FA Maple syrup does nicely. Lastly if you want a nice glaze note and even more depth added to the doughnut 1% FLV Milk and Honey makes a nice substitution.","steep_days":"5 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-05T08:04:59.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"2269","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Beignet","vendor":"SA","millipercent":5000},{"name":"wOw","vendor":"FA","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Zeppola","vendor":"FA","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Vanilla Custard","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Forrest Mix (forest Fruit Mix)","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"46781","name":"Springfield USA"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
