It would be better if it was steeped for a month but at 2 weeks it was really tasty.  This would be great to mix up and have ready just in time for Valentine's Day.  I wanted it to be fairly sweet since cupcakes usually are but you can adjust this to your taste.  You can also use your preferred sweetener.","steep_days":"14","temperature":"0","recipe_score":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-12T01:41:54.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"1790","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Strawberry Milkshake","flavor_id":"8492","vendor":"FW","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Strawberry Shortcake","flavor_id":"1753","vendor":"OOO","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Vanilla Cupcake","flavor_id":"129","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":7000},{"name":"Sweetener","flavor_id":"1432","vendor":"FW","millipercent":1000}],"reviews":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"134997","name":"Tickle me Pink"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
