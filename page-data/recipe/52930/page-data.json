The taste really stands out to me, though it's fairly sutble in the vape itself, I would recoginize it anywhere. I knew it would have to be low to just barely peak through with that slight tropical/floral note it carries. .5% brings the perfect hint of flavor without the throat it that it brings used higher.\r\n\r\nStrawberry\r\nI'm a strawberry non-taster so I always struggle with strawberry juices, but I could taste a small amount of a ripe, slightly sweet strawberry in Nola. I can't taste TFA Straw ripe at all so I doubted it was in there, but I can taste FA Red touch (Strawberry) so it was my first though, it carries a real strawberry flavor with a slight dryness to it. I've heard it described as freeze dried strawberry and I think that's pretty accurate. Looking for something to bring a little life back into FA Strawberry I went with FLV strawberry over the others. I'm not a huge fan of TFA Strawberry, and originally I tried INW Shisha strawberry, but it made it a little to candy feeling for me. going with a 2:1 ratio of FA and FLV strawberry with 4%/2% helped bring to life the strawberry and sweeten it just a touch.\r\n\r\nKiwi\r\nUp front I don't have a ton of experience with Kiwi so I wasn't sure on this one. I only have FW and TFA DBL.\r\nComparing the two, I found TFA Kiwi double to be a little more candied kiwi, whereas FW seemed a little juicy, almost like would you'd get in a yoplay Strawberry Kiwi yogurt. It's a bit of a weak flavor it self but I knew it needed to stand up to provide some juicyness to the overall vape so I took the % up slowly to stand contrast to the strawberry.\r\n\r\nThe Meringue\r\nFA Meringue was an easy choice here, it's a very sweet, real meringue flavor when used higher to be more of a main note vs. and accent so 2% worked really well. When vaping Nola though I swore up and down I tasted a slight sweet bakery note, like you'd get from a baked meringue. Wanting to really keep that sweet bakery flavor sutble I went right to CAP sugar cookie, 1.5% doesn't taste like cookie, but it provides some baked sugar sweetness to the merignue to fill out that base perfectly.\r\n\r\nWhipped cream\r\nSo this one is doubtfully what they use in Nola, but I only have FA whipped cream and CAP van whipped cream. More than likely I would guess they use TFA whipped cream as FA is disconnected in the states, but I didn't want the weight it brings to the table so I went with CAP van whipped cream. It's fluffy and light and I only get a slight vanilla taste to it. 1.5% was enough to provide a light fluffy mouth feel at the end of the vape with a hint of vanilla accenting the fruits.\r\n\r\nLet it steep for a few days so that passion fruit settles in to the recipe and have at it!\r\n\r\nAll in all from memory this isn't a 1:1 clone, but it's incredibly similar and really hits the spot for the craving of NOLA as well as being a great sweet and bring summer vape.","steep_days":"3","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:49:25.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"2350","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Vanilla Whipped Cream","flavor_id":"1","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Meringue","flavor_id":"530","vendor":"FA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Sugar Cookie","flavor_id":"115","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Red Touch (strawberry)","flavor_id":"421","vendor":"FA","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Strawberry","flavor_id":"626","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Kiwi","flavor_id":"1330","vendor":"FW","millipercent":3250},{"name":"Passionfruit","flavor_id":"4893","vendor":"FA","millipercent":500}],"reviews":[{"user":"cdaniell30","text":"I don't even know how to describe this, but I know I will keep some on-hand for quite some time.
