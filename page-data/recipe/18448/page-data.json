Lightly sweet and flavorful with a beautiful, tropical/citric twang. This is just the thing I needed to take the chill off this cold, 33 degree day! Will definitely mix again, not only to keep the winter blues away, but to celebrate summer if it ever comes back to New England. ;-)"}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"18448","name":"Stunner"}}}
