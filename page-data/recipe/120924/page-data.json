The idea behind the profile was to put Coconut and Native Tobacco up against each other since I find Native to be delicious, but strong. The result was unexpectedly pleasing.\r\n\r\nA very sweet cinnamon thump with a dark tobacco back note.\r\n\r\nUpdate: I have found this to work best as an MTL recipe. I have switched to Molinberry RY4 (Please note that this is marked as MPV flavour house) and included Vanilla Classic (FA) and Butter Cream (CAP).","steep_days":"14","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-11-30T20:59:35.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"984","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"RY4","flavor_id":"6768","vendor":"MPV","millipercent":5000},{"name":"Kentucky Blend","flavor_id":"4362","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":800},{"name":"Dx Coconut Candy","flavor_id":"229","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":600},{"name":"Native Tobacco","flavor_id":"4393","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":600},{"name":"Rich Cinnamon","flavor_id":"638","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":250},{"name":"Butter Cream","flavor_id":"3","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":500},{"name":"Madagascar (Vanilla Classic)","flavor_id":"526","vendor":"FA","millipercent":500}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"120924","name":"TABS"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
