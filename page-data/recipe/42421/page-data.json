I developed this a while ago when INW cactus was all the rage and wanted to integrate it, too. I want to tinker with the levels a little but it is a very refreshing all day fruit blend. It even brings to mind the *juiciness* and *fruitiness* of a certain popular gum. I've also bumped the koolada and made it a high nic-salt mix for a pod before and it worked well.","steep_days":"0 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T02:15:05.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"1235","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Sweet Lychee","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Cactus","vendor":"INW","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Raspberry","vendor":"INW","millipercent":500},{"name":"Dragonfruit","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Peach (juicy)","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Koolada 10 Pg","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":500}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"42421","name":"Me Lychee"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
