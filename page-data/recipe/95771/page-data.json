I find Sugar Cookie intolerable over 4% (too spicy) but it blends in nicely with FLV Cookie Dough here. \r\n\r\nNow for the crack part. FW Butter Pecan has that cinema popcorn butter flavour I love. It also has hints of nutty pecan which is highly addictive;  you keep wanting more. At 3% it tames the Sugar Cookie and backgrounds the whole mix, bathes it in nutty buterry goodness. FW Hazelnut enhances the mix ( it should always be mixed with Cookie Dough IMO as it brings out its slight chocolate notes). Finally 1.5% Vanilla Custard is the blending cream but also keeps the mix buttery and moist to give you that satisfying mouthfeel as you exhale.\r\n\r\n0.35% FLV Sweetness \r\nSweetener is essential for this recipe as I find Cookie Dough and Sugar Cookie need a sweetness boost to excel in any recipe. \r\n\r\nThis is nice as a S& V but it really takes 5 days for the cookie dough to blend in and peep through.\r\n","steep_days":"5 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":4.7,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:50:05.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"4188","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Cookie Dough","flavor_id":"4373","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Sugar Cookie","flavor_id":"115","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Butter Pecan","flavor_id":"1212","vendor":"FW","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Vanilla Custard","flavor_id":"131","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Sweetness","flavor_id":"4413","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":350},{"name":"Hazelnut","flavor_id":"1312","vendor":"FW","millipercent":750}],"reviews":[{"user":"SlashaLO","text":"This was a great mix. On crack is right. Pretty freaking accurate mix as well. I enjoyed vaping this, and my only issue is that it felt too rich at times. I had to switch to something else.

This recipe is truly cookie incarnate, absolutely delicious.
