Don't really care for TPA key lime and love FA Florida key lime so went with that. I find that FA Florida key lime already has a sort of creaminess to it with a great lime flavor. Added a little Lime Tahity Cold Press for some more lime zest and bam. This work is something ill probably keep tweaking over time but as of right now its damn tasty. Can be a shake and vape but recommend over night steeping.
