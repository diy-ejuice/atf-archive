A blended and pretty balanced mix. However....I did find that in two weeks the banana cream had faded into the Cheesecake graham crust and VBIC a little more than I'd have liked, so I decided to see if I could fix it for my palette. \r\n\r\nFirst I flip flopped the rolls of the bananas going with much more Banana bread 6% vs 1% in the OG and just a touch of the Banana cream 1% vs 3% in the OG and overhauled everything else \"to taste\" to make up for the swap.\r\n-Vanilla Ice cream(LB) because I dumped all my other ice cream flavors out and filled them with Liquid Barn Vanilla Ice Cream\r\n-Yes, We Cheesecake(INW) at 1.5% added a little richness to the mix in place of the higher %s of Banana Cream and helped get the graham note started.\r\n-Graham Cracker Clear{TPA) 1% The graham note with the banana, from the OG had to stay, this did just that.\r\n-Caramel(FA) just a caramel I felt like I could drop much lower in the mix and still find it in this mix.. The OG called for 2% TFA Caramel. This still gives it plenty of caramel at .75%\r\n\r\n*If you want a touch more banana out of this, drop the Vanilla Ice Cream(LB) to 2% and add 1 more % of Banana Cream(TPA) *total of 2%\r\nIt's very good as well but for me, this mix is the perfect balance and is an extremely full and flavorful vape that is phenomenal dripped and should work in most tanks as well.\r\n\r\nThanks Jeff for the great recipe to play with! \r\n\r\nI'd go mix his if you haven't and then come back and give this one a try.\r\n\r\nThis recipe was tested and designed on the Haku single Clapton at .54ohms at 50W\r\n\r\n@s2k on ELR, YouTube and #DIYorDIE Discord\r\n","steep_days":"10","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"updated_at":"2020-12-12T14:08:03.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"900","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Banana Cream","flavor_id":"210","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Carmel (caramel)","flavor_id":"503","vendor":"FA","millipercent":750},{"name":"Yes, We Cheesecake","flavor_id":"9272","vendor":"INW","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Banana Nut Bread","flavor_id":"144","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":6000},{"name":"Vanilla Ice Cream","flavor_id":"1511","vendor":"LB","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Graham Cracker Clear","flavor_id":"325","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1000}],"reviews":[{"user":"RUG_ly","text":"Have you tried WF Banana Puree?
