I have been trying to amp up my Blue Moon Ice Cream concentrate since I got it.   I was not quite ready to release this yet but I am still happy enough with it that I will share it for the show.  I have the original VG version and it requires a bit more steeping and a lot more flavoring.  If you have the SC version you can get by with a few days of steeping instead of 14.  You will also need to lower the percentage to about 2% instead of 6%.  The cotton candy may be muting this a bit so I am going to cut it in half.  It was still a work in progress so don't be surprised if the percents change a tad over the coming weeks lol.\r\n\r\n***You can use another sweetener if you would like.  You can also add WS-23 at around 0.3-0.4% if you want a cooler vape.***  ","steep_days":"14","temperature":"0","recipe_score":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-10T14:52:50.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"2224","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"American Bubble Gum","flavor_id":"1558","vendor":"MB","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Blue Moon Ice Cream","flavor_id":"4089","vendor":"RF","millipercent":6000},{"name":"Blueberry","flavor_id":"1201","vendor":"FW","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Blueberry Cotton Candy","flavor_id":"1202","vendor":"FW","millipercent":500},{"name":"Marshmallow","flavor_id":"473","vendor":"FA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Vanilla Ice Cream","flavor_id":"1511","vendor":"LB","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Rick's Vanilla Sugar Daddy","flavor_id":"9414","vendor":"TBV","millipercent":400}],"reviews":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"116596","name":"Blue Moon Ice Cream #Mixin Vixens"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
