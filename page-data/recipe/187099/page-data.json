Strawberry RF is one of my favs I used some CAP strawberry sweet to boost its potency, im not sure why this combo is so special to me but I love these two at these percentages they just work.  \r\n\r\nYellow cake JF I dig a lot but can never get it to pop the way I want it to, felt like 7% is about the Max I could go with it and sugar cookie was just an addition to it to give it that cake mouth feel I wanted.  I felt I had to go high with the percentages (sacrilegious I know) so they are not too drowned out by the strawberry, and the way they are it culminated to great mixture of the notes I was after.   \r\n\r\nVBIC, really I just like this flavor and thought its profile would accent rather well in this recipe, it just kind of fits the flavors and gives it a nice creaminess. \r\n\r\nSuper sweet could probably be omitted but fuck I like things on the sweeter side and .5 was about right.\r\n\r\nFor some odd reason this recipe is fantastic immediately no steep time required.  I prefer this one when it is freshly mixed which seems counter intuitive.  Been mixing for quite a long time now and just wanted to share my adv with the community that has been helping me for a long time now.  If you like desserty shit and strawberries this one is for you.  \r\n\r\nI made a lot of different variations of this recipe, I had friends testing it taking notes on what they liked or didn’t like. In the end it was version one that I liked the best, and everyone that tested the shit ton of variations also landed on it (weird how that works).  That’s as close as I get to recipe notes or flavor description.\r\n\r\n","steep_days":"1 (SNV)","temperature":"666","recipe_score":0,"total_reviews":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T22:34:02.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"968","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Strawberry","vendor":"RF","millipercent":5000},{"name":"Sugar Cookie","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Super Sweet","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":500},{"name":"Sweet Strawberry","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Vanilla Ice Cream","vendor":"LB","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Yellow Cake","vendor":"JF","millipercent":7000}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"187099","name":"Greed (Strawberry Short Cake ADV)"}}}
