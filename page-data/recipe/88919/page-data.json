I kept this as simple as I could without complicating the mix with unnessary ‘clutter’. Deceptively simple, mouthwateringly rewarding!\r\n\r\nI went for my  tried and tested INW custard base which acts as the foundation upon which I balance the star of the show...\r\n\r\nHoly Holy Grail RY4 is the undisputed supreme master and beautifully imparts it’s inherent creamy caramel and vanilla with the embracing custard base. The tobacco slowly develops and fully rears its head after about 2 weeks, resulting in oral bliss.\r\n\r\nThe vanilla notes, present in the custard and Holy Holy Grail, is given a subtle boost by the Holy Vanilla and heightens the sweetness just a tad. Holy Vanilla has slight smoky and earthy notes, which plays beautifully with the Holy Grail and compliments it, seemingly naturally. \r\n\r\nGive this baby the 2 weeks it deserves but have a taste after a week if you wish.\r\n\r\n** I adjusted the INW Creme Brulee to 1% following further testing and feedback. The Creme Brulee was originally at 3% which overpowered the delicate RY4 notes and made the Holy Holy Grail play second fiddle... \r\n","steep_days":"14","temperature":"0","recipe_score":4.7,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:49:57.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"8522","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Custard","flavor_id":"4210","vendor":"INW","millipercent":3000},{"name":"HOLY HOLY GRAIL RY4","flavor_id":"5037","vendor":"DFS","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Holy Vanilla","flavor_id":"2385","vendor":"DFS","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Creme Brulee (yc)","flavor_id":"894","vendor":"INW","millipercent":1000}],"reviews":[{"user":"lnterlinked","text":"A delicious caramel custard. Great balance of caramel, vanilla and thick mouth feel. This is a go to recipe for me when I want something comforting and sweet."},{"user":"Fleming","text":"Great recipe here.  Simple but very thick mouthfeel and strong on the vanilla and cream very authentic custard will be making more than my 60 mls for sure.  Keep up the good work. "},{"user":"SlashaLO","text":"I have to start off saying how much I love this recipe! It’s a very creamy custard with a slight toasted sugar feel with a great caramel and vanilla. I’m a huge fan of the INW custard/brûlée combo which is why I mixed this up to begin with. I let it sit for 3 weeks before busting into this. It’s well worth the wait. &#xD;\n&#xD;\nNow to explain why only 4 stars for me. In the description you mention the tobacco notes and how they come through. To me, holy grail has little to not tobacco until at about 8%; even then, not very prominent. It’s a weak flavor in my experience. It’s an AMAZING caramel for sure. I was hoping for that RY4 tobacco note to come through possibly, but it didn’t happen. For my taste, I would probably add 2% of TFA RY4 double, or a minute amount of FLV red burley/cured to add the missing tobacco note. &#xD;\n&#xD;\nNo off notes anywhere to be found, just a straight forward, caramel and vanilla custard that tastes amazing.

After a 2-week steep this simple recipe is absolutely delicious. The RY4 backed with INW Creme Brulee seems to make a delicious RY4 combo, and when combined with Holy Vanilla and INW's Custard it makes for a delicious and creamy RY4 experience. Great recipe OP!"},{"user":"TheGrouch","text":"Not even a week and this stuff is absolutely amazing! Thanks for the recipe, I love it!! "},{"user":"LonesomeRhodesTN","text":"I really wanted to try this . . . so I cracked into it after 5 days, and I'm digging it.  An extremely satisfying vanilla custard!  I think you've found the Holy Quadrality (if that's real word) of custards.  Looking forward to seeing how this changes over time.  Great job!"}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"88919","name":"Holy Holy Custard"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
