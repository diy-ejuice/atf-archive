For a more authentic ice cream you may want to add some form of a cooling agent because as is its more of a melted ice cream which is good for me because I like to melt my ice cream a bit and stir it up. \r\n\r\nBourbon Burnt Sugar:\r\nFlavorah Bourbon is a perfect bourbon flavor. I haven't ever tried any other bourbon flavors so I don't know about substitute's. I started at 1% Bourbon which was good but it was just a little better at .75% Bourbon. The burnt sugar I made using brown sugar by tfa at .25% and higher amounts of toasted marshmallow by tfa and crème brulee by inawera. I pushed both to 2.5% to really bring out the toasted notes in both and it worked. The crème brulee also helps bring that eggy note that artisan ice cream and its also quite creamy at this percentage also. I was worried about the ethyl maltol in the toasted marshmallow but it seems to blend the flavors together. Meringue by flavor art at 1% also adds a sugary type of note to the mix.\r\n\r\nThe ice cream  a.k.a. \"melted cream\":\r\nI used Vanilla bean ice cream by tfa at 4% and then I used 2% French ice cream by hangsen I find these two ice cream flavor's work really well together. I also used 1% of sweet cream by Flavorah this helps bind and smooth out the two ice cream flavors.\r\n\r\nSweetener:\r\nUse it if you want and don't use it if you want your choice!!!\r\nMe I only use one sweetener lately and that is Flavorah sweetness I normally only have to use .25 % for the perfect a amount of sweetness for me. I don't know what it is about Flavorah's sweetness that I like so much but its good and a 15ml bottle will last you quite a long time.\r\n\r\nSTEEP TIME= 10-14 days ","steep_days":"14","temperature":"420","recipe_score":0,"total_reviews":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T20:32:06.000-05:00","best_vg":"75%","views":"1882","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Bourbon","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":750},{"name":"Meringue","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Creme Brulee (yc)","vendor":"INW","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Brown Sugar","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":250},{"name":"Vanilla Bean Ice Cream","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":4000},{"name":"French Vanilla Icecream","vendor":"HS","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Toasted Marshmallow","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Sweet Cream","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Sweetness","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":250}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"52601","name":"Bourbon burnt sugar ice cream"}}}
