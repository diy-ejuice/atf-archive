Can't comment on the clone-iness of it as it's been so long since I've had the real deal.  I think I prefer the V1 clone recipe by a hair though."},{"user":"Chewymidget","text":""},{"user":"TamVapes","text":"This is amazing!  I had to try after hearing the talk on videos I have watched.  Definitely, worth the hype!  Love it.  "},{"user":"MrZigglesworth","text":"To be honest I wanted to mix this because this recipe has to be the most flavoring I have ever seen. That with what I read on Reddit it seemed promising. This is definitely a fantastic fruity/cotton candy recipe and I definitely recommend it. Personally I liked it best after a 5-day steep."},{"user":"RuntDastardly","text":"I started DIY about three months after I started vaping, so I never had the opportunity to try OG Shurb. I *have*, however, gleefully mixed and vaped along with you since version one, and while V2 was my favorite up until now, I cannot imagine anything more dazzling than this. This is perfection in every way, and unimaginably delicious. I mixed up on 12/28 and cracked it today on 12/30 because I couldn't wait a second longer, and now I cannot put it down. You should be proud as hell of this, and I am incredibly grateful you shared it, because this is one of the best recipes I've ever tasted. Kudos to you, captain!"}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"22318","name":"Shurb"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
