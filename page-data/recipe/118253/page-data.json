It plays nice with the chocolate taste in the FLV Smores to create that unique 'first' bite in a Melow Cake. Very addicting vape.\r\nThe actual creamy and fluffy filling consists of FLV Smore, FLV Marshmallow, WF SC Vanilla Cream Extra, and VTA Fresh MIlk.\r\nAs for the cookie bottom layer, I used Cap Sugar Cookie and INW Biscuit for a little crunchiness.\r\n\r\nThis is not a Melow Cake, or is it? \r\nIt's for sure a tasty chocolate dessert vape, a very tasty vape, that needs a 2 week steep to bloom.\r\nEnjoy ;-)","steep_days":"14","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T02:16:33.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"1506","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Biscuit","vendor":"INW","millipercent":300},{"name":"Chocolate Mousse","vendor":"VT","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Milk Fresh","vendor":"VT","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Marshmallow","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1250},{"name":"Smore","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":500},{"name":"Sugar Cookie","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":2750},{"name":"Sweetness","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":500},{"name":"Vanilla Cream Extra SC","vendor":"WF","millipercent":1500}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"118253","name":" Melow Cakes"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
