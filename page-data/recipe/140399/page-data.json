On the inhale you get a sweet vanilla soft cookie that transitions to a nutty, caramel popcorn, graham cracker finish. it is good at 3 days but the popcorn builds over time and comes out at 7 days . best at around 60 - 65 watts .    \r\n\r\nFeel free to add additional sweetner if you want that commercial feel  - as this is a in your face commercial style mix and  not meant to have alot of subtly -  but the cake batter dip provides alot of sweetness that comes out over 3 - 5 days.   \r\n\r\nThis was made for daytime frank Mixin in the kitchen episode n popcorn \r\n\r\n**caramel popcorn, AP** and **kettle Corn** create the popcorn base. it tends to grow a bit. The Caramel popcorn and peanut is very light on the popcorn but has a really nice peanut finish . Kettle corn has a nice buttery sweet note that I am using here along with AP to provide more of a popcorn note. \"**NOTE** AP is not necessary but does support the popcorn and cookie in this mix. \r\n\r\n**cake batter** adds some top note sweetness and body to the mix to contrast some of the darker notes\r\n\r\n**Graham cracker and Sugar cookie** creates a really nicely balanced cookie with a soft center and slightly darker baked crisp notes from the Graham cracker. \r\n\r\n**caramel toffee** is a nice dark caramel note that holds up in this mix and comes though at the finish \r\n\r\n**vanilla cheesecake custard** sits a bit on top and adds some vanilla top notes and needed creaminess to this mix","steep_days":"7","temperature":"0","recipe_score":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-12T11:52:36.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"1607","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Acetyl Pyrazine 5%","flavor_id":"1709","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":300},{"name":"Cake Batter Dip","flavor_id":"1223","vendor":"FW","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Caramel Popcorn and Peanuts","flavor_id":"10113","vendor":"WF","millipercent":3500},{"name":"Caramel Toffee","flavor_id":"2121","vendor":"HS","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Graham Cracker","flavor_id":"62","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Kettle Corn","flavor_id":"329","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":5000},{"name":"Sugar Cookie","flavor_id":"115","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Vanilla Custard Cheesecake","flavor_id":"6532","vendor":"OOO","millipercent":1500}],"reviews":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"140399","name":"Poppin Cookie ( caramel popcorn, sugar cookie, toffee) "}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
