Great as SNV. This really starts to bloom after two to three days. I have no comparison to the original since I don't want to buy FW Yellow Cake, but it makes a great tasty vape on it's own and doesn't cover your coils in burned fructose in an hour.\r\n\r\n\r\nAll credit to Wayne Walker for original recipe.
