I increased the CAP BRCC to 2% and itâ€™s been great! After a week steep it really tastes like a blue freezie pop to me! Thank you"},{"user":"xx2000xx","text":"Good to see Slush not 8% for a change. I'm going to mix it up right now because this is up my alley. Have you tried a touch of Bilberry in it or any other Raspberry like INW? Just curious because you didn't leave any notes and I'd make a few batches to see how it compares and let you know how it went.
