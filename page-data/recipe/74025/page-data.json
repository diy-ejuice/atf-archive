So I chose FLV custard and fresh cream(FA)\r\nAs my custard base in future mixes I may add some CAP custard for its egginess and to make the custard fuller... But for now it's still good wanna see where the FLV ends up in a week or so\r\nAdded a small amt of super sweet to smooth out the edges ","steep_days":"7 (SNV)","temperature":"60","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-02T15:40:27.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"1646","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Blueberry","vendor":"HS","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Blueberry","vendor":"MB","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Eden Apple","vendor":"MB","millipercent":750},{"name":"Cream Fresh","vendor":"FA","millipercent":250},{"name":"Super Sweet","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":500},{"name":"Custard","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":5000}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"74025","name":"Simply Blueberry Custard "}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
