Thank you, Alfred!\r\n\r\nFA Zeppola/WF Angel Cake/LB Belgian Waffle = This is a delicious doughnut stone and you can be certain I'm keeping it in my notes. I feel it would work just as well for a waffle, a french toast, or anything else fried, sauteed, etc., give or take some tweaking.\r\n\r\nOOO Vanilla Custard Cheesecake/OOO Powdered Sugar = this is for the glaze and it's yummy.\r\n\r\nFLV Rich cinnamon = I love adding it to my fried goods, it gives that little extra touch of sweet and baked and lovely fresh out of the oven smell and taste.\r\n\r\nFA Butterscotch = Remember when they told you it was a sweet honey glazed doughnut bun? They lied. It's not honey, it's syrup and with our glaze, a touch of FA Butterscotch will do the trick. You can add a 0.5% of TPA brown sugar, maybe 0.5% of VT golden syrup or a little FA Maple if you want to change the profile a tiny bit. I like it as is.\r\n\r\nThis thing is lovely on the shake, even better 7 days later if you can stay out of it.\r\n\r\nEnjoy, be queer & vape on!\r\n\r\n[Photo Credit = www.biscuitville.com ]","steep_days":"7 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"updated_at":"2020-12-12T17:12:36.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"1719","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Zeppola","flavor_id":"6312","vendor":"FA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Angel Cake SC","flavor_id":"9014","vendor":"WF","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Belgian Waffle","flavor_id":"1478","vendor":"LB","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Rich Cinnamon","flavor_id":"638","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":100},{"name":"Vanilla Custard Cheesecake","flavor_id":"6532","vendor":"OOO","millipercent":500},{"name":"Powdered Sugar","flavor_id":"6522","vendor":"OOO","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Butterscotch","flavor_id":"495","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000}],"reviews":[{"user":"diesel223","text":"Really been enjoying this vape the last couple weeks.
