I bet youâ€™re wondering what the heck it tastes like, right?\r\n\r\nMint? Cloves? With strawberries?\r\n\r\nYep.\r\n\r\nForget the sugar. Forget the cream. Forget everything you think you knew about strawberries because this super simple recipe is about to blow it all out of the water.\r\n\r\nThis odd sounding mix is set to become your new best friend. They go together like a match made in heaven. Like salt on meat. Like red bean and mochi. It's an old profile used in deserts and it's never made it to the diy vape scene until now - if your one of those who can't taste strawberry- this will make it pop like nothing else you've tried! Give it a shot, 10ml SNV and you'll never look back!

I used 1% of Delosi Clove, and I'm telling you, the flavor bending here is phenomenal!  My ol lady though it was chocolate, then 5min later thought it was margarita.  It's simple, delicous and never gets boring.  Thank you for putting this together!
