WF Island Mango is very very sweet, and it needs a little body so TPA Mango helps there. I wouldn't use TPA Mango alone for mango, but if you want to get something out of it, 3% is a minimum.\r\n\r\nWF African Horned Cucumber is here to give you juiciness. Where you would use TPA Dragonfruit or INW Cactus, you can use WF African Horned Cucumber, especially for yellow flavor profiles.\r\n\r\nCap Lemon Lime is the tartness. Lime loves mango in general, but here, the mango would be too ripe without it.\r\n\r\nEnjoy, be queer & vape on !\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Photo Credit : Stylecraze]","steep_days":"3 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"total_reviews":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-04T22:28:30.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"1796","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Island Mango","vendor":"WF","millipercent":4000},{"name":"African Horned Cucumber SC","vendor":"WF","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Mango","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Lemon Lime","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":2000}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"138319","name":"Mango Tango (Mango Juice)"}}}
