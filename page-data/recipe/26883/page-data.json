I am so glad I discovered tpa organic strawberry. it is so authentic and paired with tpa strawberry ripe you end up with what has become my favorite strawberry combo. strawberry ripe is my favorite standalone strawberry but unfortunately it has a tendency of getting weaker/muted over time if the percentage used isn’t boosted, especially in custards and creams (hence the combo of it with tpa organic strawberry). tpa dragonfruit used to boost strawberry which was the first flavor enhancement tip I got when I started DIY and I continue to swear by its addition with raspberry and strawberry recipes. tpa vanilla custard I use in nearly everything at 1% as its a fantastic sweetener that goes with everything for my tastes. if you do not yet have cap vanilla whipped cream just get it. it has replaced fa whipped cream not only because I think it tastes better but also because it is very readily available. i like whipped cream on any and all desserts and cap whipped cream gives me that dollop of sweet fluffy dairy goodness.\r\n","steep_days":"7","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T22:31:52.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"2382","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Cheesecake","vendor":"FW","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Graham Cracker","vendor":"FW","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Strawberry (ripe)","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":6000},{"name":"Organic Strawberry","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Vanilla Cupcake","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Custard","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Dragonfruit","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Vanilla Whipped Cream","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Lemon Meringue Pie","vendor":"FW","millipercent":1000}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"26883","name":"Strawberry Cheesecake"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
