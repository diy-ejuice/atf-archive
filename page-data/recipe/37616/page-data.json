It provides a nice dense mouth feel and a sweet milky base for the cereal to sit in.  After a couple weeks, the fruit and cereal flavors still hold strong, making for a nice sweet cereal vape.\r\n\r\nGive it a few days for the fruitiness to calm down, after that it just gets thicker.  The fruit is fairly intense here, feel free to back it down if preferred, but at these percentages, it really makes for a nice ADV with full flavor every time, even through a steep.","steep_days":"3","temperature":"475","recipe_score":5,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:49:12.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"2498","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Dragonfruit","flavor_id":"226","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":5000},{"name":"Fruit Circles","flavor_id":"139","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":6000},{"name":"Berry Crunch","flavor_id":"136","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Cream Fresh","flavor_id":"540","vendor":"FA","millipercent":2000}],"reviews":[{"user":"photohap","text":""}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"37616","name":"Dragon Loops"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
