Thanks to ID10-T for the lemonade base. I'm an Inawera lemon junkie. The MF Wild Raspberry is hard to get, and yes it's expensive but it's worth it. While you're at it pick up their caramel. Here the MF Wild Raspberry is the realistic part of the raspberry and also brings some dark sweetness to do terribly good things to the EM laiden Raspberry Sweet.
