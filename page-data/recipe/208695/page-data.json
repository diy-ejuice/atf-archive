Smells like patchouli in there.  They sell all the vegan/gluten-free/non-GMO/organic/fair trade/$1 from the purchase of this $6 candy bar goes to saving the rainforest type of stuff. Mine has organic vegan versions of creamsicle bars in the freezer section. Blueberry, Raspberry, and of course Orange, the most common flavor of creamsicle by far. The inside is, of course, dairy-free and instead filled with a vanilla-flavored coconut-based cream. I just thought it was weird that they had such basic flavors, in a place where almost everything is some sort of acai, goji, whatever weird fruit they found growing high in the Andes mountains of Peru this week. It seemed like kumquat would be a great flavor for a hippy creamsicle, so here that is. \r\n\r\nI borrowed heavily from Jenn W's [Loco Unicorn](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/193460#loco_unicorn_jenn_w_by_mixinvixens) recipe, which you can see reflected in the combination of coconuts and choice of vanilla. I figured that would work well with WF Kumquat as it worked with her CAP Sweet Tangerine, and it does. The VT Sweet Cream really drives home the rich whipped creamy filling as it blends well with the coconuts and vanilla. \r\n\r\nThe trouble with WF Kumquat is it needs more of that tart peel note, I used INW Lemon Mix for that. I also tried a version with VT Orange Marmalade for the peel, but it annihilated the separation I was looking for between the fruit and cream. INW Lemon Mix stays on top. \r\n\r\nI know it's supposed to be a popsicle, but I fell out of the cold things should be cold camp on this one. I didn't want either the citrusy top note or the creamy coconutty filling to get stomped on by it. You could try adding coolant if you want to, just don't hold me responsible for the result.
