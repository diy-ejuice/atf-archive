It's rich and sweet and as authentic as it gets. Give it a week to grow and a couple more to be even more amazing. Maple flavorings need time to settle.\r\n\r\nIf you want something a little more pancake syrupy, you can sub TPA Brown Sugar for FA Butterscotch.\r\n\r\nThis is a stone, so it's not exactly made to vape on its own. Use this with baked goods, fried treats, cereals, and whenever you want that authentic sweetness without sweetener.\r\n\r\nEnjoy, be queer & vape on!\r\n\r\n[Photo Credits: William Allaway @ www.acadianmaple.com ]","steep_days":"5 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"updated_at":"2020-12-12T20:30:40.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"730","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Maple Syrup","flavor_id":"509","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Golden Syrup","flavor_id":"8887","vendor":"VT","millipercent":750},{"name":"Brown Sugar","flavor_id":"313","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":500}],"reviews":[{"user":"Gordo","text":"I going with five stars...,. the first recipe I used this in ,  ... ( a graham - maple- custard )  has an incredible Maple note.  Question, is this scalable if I want to make maple primary and use other backround / top notes? Of course my next try will be another shot at French Dude.  Have to nail these remixes before they are pulled off the shelves.  Thank you for this.
