Meringue and sweetener substituted for CAP Vanilla Cupcake. I used this based on a beginner's blending podcast a while back about substituting meringue and marshmallow when used as sweeteners for vanilla cupcake. I kept the marshmallow in this go around but I may try to bump the vanilla cupcake a touch again and remove marshmallow to see if it still works. I prefer tpa marshmallow and fw vbic so those were subbed as well. Normally I sub vbic with tpa vanilla bean gelato but was out of that ingredient at time of mixing. When I get some more flavors refilled I'll have to whip this up again with the aforementioned changes for marshmallow and vbic.
