Nice work.  I did add a touch of FLV Sweet Coconut for the sweetness and a little interest."},{"user":"Trista_C","text":"One week out and im enjoying it!  I know it will be better with more time.  I'll mix this one again!"},{"user":"Aquaneo","text":"This was a perfectly sweet thick vanilla custard. It reminds me of Velvet Couds vanilla custard. The second batch was a 100ml batch as I enjoyed the first so much. Takes at least a week till those custard notes come through properly. Enjoyed it allot.
