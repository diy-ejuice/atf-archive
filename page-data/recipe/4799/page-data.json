Nice work.  I did add a touch of FLV Sweet Coconut for the sweetness and a little interest.","score":4},{"user":"Trista_C","text":"One week out and im enjoying it!

It reminds me of Velvet Couds vanilla custard. The second batch was a 100ml batch as I enjoyed the first so much. Takes at least a week till those custard notes come through properly. Enjoyed it allot. ","score":5}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"4799","name":"Custody"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
