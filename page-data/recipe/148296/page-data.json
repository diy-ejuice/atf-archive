This is not the same fig profile found in Fig Newton, which a sweet fig 'paste' with little flavor reference to the fresh version.  Some describe the flavor as a mix between peach, pear and passion fruit which does describe some of the elements but does not tell the full story. The problem in describing a fruit is that each has its unique flavor properties and it is almost impossible to describe any taste to someone who have never tasted it. It is like trying to describe an apple to someone who have never tasted one - it is just about beyond the bounds of possibility without referencing something which it is similar to. \r\nTo me, FA Fig is the quintessential fig.\r\n\r\nFW Blood Orange is, despite it's new rival from FLV, still the undisputed king of oranges and just work better here.  Somewhat bitter, slightly sweet blood orange with a hint of grapefruit sums up this beauty. It blends seamlessly with the Fig, to create a deep, somewhat unusual & familiar, deep fruit taste sensation. \r\n\r\nHS Australian chocolate adds a touch of cocoa to compliment the inherent bitter notes form the blood orange. It keeps keeps the mix interesting by just sitting in the background with its mate, INW Shisha Vanilla, who needs no introduction...  \r\n\r\nGive this baby 3-5 days to mingle and let rip!!!\r\n\r\n","steep_days":"5","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:50:53.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"1301","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Fig Fresh","flavor_id":"518","vendor":"FA","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Blood Orange","flavor_id":"1197","vendor":"FW","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Shisha Vanilla","flavor_id":"841","vendor":"INW","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Australian Chocolate","flavor_id":"2657","vendor":"HS","millipercent":500},{"name":"Liquid Amber","flavor_id":"476","vendor":"FA","millipercent":500}],"reviews":[{"user":"Seakow","text":"So I hadn't gotten around to vaping this until after a month of steeping.
