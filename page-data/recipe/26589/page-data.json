With (FW) Blood Orange the clouds parted and the Mango and Orange simply fell in love with each other.\r\n\r\n(INW) Raspberry - Well what can I say, this flavour in any fruit mix at a low percentage will just add another dimension and not distract you from the main profile. I find that in this recipe the raspberry really helps the mango shine and gives it an almost brighter, tart note...you'll just have to see for yourself.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","steep_days":"0 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":4,"updated_at":"2020-12-12T18:29:01.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"3611","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Mango","flavor_id":"3516","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Blood Orange","flavor_id":"1197","vendor":"FW","millipercent":5000},{"name":"Raspberry","flavor_id":"667","vendor":"INW","millipercent":2000}],"reviews":[{"user":"cdaniell30","text":"We chatted a few weeks ago about this recipe after I had reviewed one of your others.  You told me it was made for a comp, I got the feeling that I shouldn't expect much...but I really liked this.  Using the mango this high gives it an earthiness that isn't common in most fruity/berry vapes, and I found that quality a pretty refreshing change.  It could probably be tweaked a bit and made into a real banger of a recipe, but I'll leave that to you if you still want to play with it.  As is, I really enjoyed the time I spent with this one and it's a fine example of how you don't need 9 or 10 concentrates to make a nicely balanced recipe.  The flavors are different enough that the recipe comes across as a more complex mix than it is, yet they all come together to make a pleasant vape.","score":4}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"26589","name":"Blood Mango ( Mango Vs Orange Cage Fight)"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
