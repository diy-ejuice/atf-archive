Here my choice fell on CAP Sweet Guava.\r\nWhile Sweet Guava on its own can be very weak, it does have some awesome abilities to both sweeten up other fruits and add some nice exotic top notes.\r\n\r\nTo make the candy a candy, but not sugary disgustingly sweet candy my choices fell on OOO Powdered Sugar and WF Sour Ball Candy.\r\nThose two always works out great in a combo. The powdered sugar adds a great sugary accent, that you just cannot get out of a sweetener, where the Sour Ball Candy adds the texture of a sort of chewy candy and brings a little sourness.\r\n\r\nAll in all, I'm pretty satisfied.\r\n\r\nIt's good right off the rip, but I suggest you leave it for half a day.\r\nThe WF Sour Ball Candy and  Powdered sugar needs a few hours to really blend in well with the fruits to make it shine.\r\n\r\nEnjoy!","steep_days":"1 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"updated_at":"2020-12-12T20:31:08.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"1648","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Powdered Sugar","flavor_id":"6522","vendor":"OOO","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Watermelon","flavor_id":"616","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":500},{"name":"Wild Melon","flavor_id":"619","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":2250},{"name":"Sour Ball Candy SC","flavor_id":"9046","vendor":"WF","millipercent":2250},{"name":"Sweet Guava","flavor_id":"118","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":3000}],"reviews":[{"user":"gunsforhands","text":"So I kept begging this mixer to make a melon vape for me to try and when I tasted this I knew he'd knocked it out of the park.  It's great right off the shake, but after a day or two steep the magic really starts to happen.  This is a lovely melon-y candy type vape that I can puff on all day.  Sometimes I even get a slight green banana note from it, which really adds to the experience I think. If you're in the mood for a simple watermelon candy vape, give this one a shot!
