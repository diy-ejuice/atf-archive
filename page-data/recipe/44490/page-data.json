You could sense the coconut, sugarcane and spices used, almost imagine the wooden barrels this rum (would) have ripped in. If i wouldn't known better i would have drinked this little bottle of aroma instantly.\r\nI used at 1.25% for a perfect balance with the pineapple and icecreams used in this recipe.\r\n\r\nLB Vanilla Ice Cream (my prefered) needed some support from TFA VBIC for the spicy beany notes to round of this ice cream mixture.\r\nFor the vanilla spices i was looking for i used WF Tahitian Vanilla Cream, it completes the creamy structure to the mix. \r\nThe perfect ice cream!\r\n\r\nFlavorah Sweet Coconut added to sweeten and support the Coconut Spiced rum.\r\n\r\nJF Pineapple, a bit sharper pineapple than Golden Pineapple and therefore used in this recipe as a counterbalance for the creams.\r\n\r\nS/V let it sit 24 hours, better or perfect 4 days.\r\n\r\nShare and rate this if you like it.","steep_days":"4 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-01T11:48:19.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"1203","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Coconut Spiced Rum – SC","flavor_id":"7480","vendor":"RF","millipercent":1250},{"name":"Pineapple","flavor_id":"6793","vendor":"JF","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Sweet Coconut","flavor_id":"605","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":750},{"name":"Tahitian Vanilla Cream","flavor_id":"6065","vendor":"WF","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Vanilla Bean Ice Cream","flavor_id":"186","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Vanilla Ice Cream","flavor_id":"1511","vendor":"LB","millipercent":3000}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"44490","name":"Coconut Spiced Rum Ice Cream"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
