Soft, rich, uber creamy with just the right amount of vanilla is the perfect bed to receive the sweet & abundant mango blessing.  TPA Sweet cream lifts the Bavarian cream by boosting the creaminess with finesse. CAP Sweet Cream can simply not compete in this race and unceremoniously dethroned  \r\nHoly Vanilla, used relatively high, adds the ultimate vanilla flavor here and provides a delicate sweetness & creaminess to the Panna Cotta.\r\n\r\nFE Mango has been my favorite mango this year and shows its full colors here. Full, juicy & ripe mango goodness... I have encountered NO evidence of the 'myth' of the fading FE Mango and not sure who started this nonsense. I have a reference SF test batch dating back to January and it has shown negligible fading. The flavor is (still) on point and, even after 5 months, still (far) better than any of its rivals.\r\n\r\n A touch of Papaya adds a bit of intrigue and keeps the mango profile from being linear and, vitally, assists with balancing the sweetness. \r\n\r\nAs creams go, this baby needs a good 7 days to fully develop.
