Full of crunchy and creamy goodness! I am loving this VT Warm Custard. You actually get a warm sensation to it. It's so creamy and thick. Mixed with TPA Vanilla Custard II, IMO it's the best custard combination. CAP Sugar Cookie and JF Cookie also pair well together. The JF Cookie gives it that grit and substance that I was looking for. \r\n\r\nGive it a try. Enjoy!!","steep_days":"3","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T20:33:33.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"629","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Cookie","vendor":"JF","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Sugar Cookie","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":3500},{"name":"Vanilla Custard 2","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Warm Custard","vendor":"VT","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Super Sweet","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":500}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"204035","name":"Warm Custard Crema Cookie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
