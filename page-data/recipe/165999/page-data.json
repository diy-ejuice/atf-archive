I made the blueprint, tried it out and BOOM, chocolate D0nut. Some of the flavor choices are obvious, like lava cake (excellent chocolate flavor), glazed donut (THE best d0nut), and zeppola (for the \"fried\" feel). Sugar cookie was added to cake out the donut and add more body, and FW sweetener was used instead of cap SS so that it wouldnt add citric acid to the mix. Flv sweetness can be used this way also.","steep_days":"3 (SNV)","temperature":"69","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T00:08:28.000-05:00","best_vg":"60%","views":"1146","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Glazed Donut SC","flavor_id":"9025","vendor":"WF","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Lava Cake","flavor_id":"1493","vendor":"LB","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Sugar Cookie","flavor_id":"115","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Sweetener","flavor_id":"1432","vendor":"FW","millipercent":500},{"name":"Zeppola","flavor_id":"6312","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1500}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"165999","name":"D0nut (chocolate)"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
