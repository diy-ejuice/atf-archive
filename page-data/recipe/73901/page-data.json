Well this is my favorite holiday creamer in my morning coffee. I prefer my coffee to be pretty heavy on the cream and sugar. This is just that. A perfect cup of joe loaded with that wonderful holiday creamer.\r\n\r\nLB White chocolate peppermint has proven to be an amazing flavor perfectly balanced between the white chocolate and the peppermint. The mint isnâ€™t over powering and fits just right. I have mixed this recipe with variances anywhere from 3-8 percent. 8 percent left me the perfect taste and really allowed it to stand out in this mix as it is the main note. \r\n\r\nFA cappuccino was my coffee of choice because to me it can bend very well with the help of the condensed milk and sweet cream. At 2% the coffee flavor wasnâ€™t too forward but just sat there as a nice accent for the white chocolate peppermint. \r\n\r\nThe vanilla bean ice cream is there to help blend the ingredients together and of course the Super Sweet is completely optional. I love my sweet coffee. \r\n\r\nI have been vaping on this since I have mixed it 7 days ago and it just keeps getting better. \r\n\r\nENJOY!!!!! ðŸ’–","steep_days":"7 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-06T20:40:33.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"1885","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Condensed Milk â€“ SC","flavor_id":"7483","vendor":"RF","millipercent":500},{"name":"Italian Relax (cappuccino)","flavor_id":"505","vendor":"FA","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Sweet Cream","flavor_id":"183","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Vanilla Bean Ice Cream","flavor_id":"4","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":3000},{"name":"White Chocolate Peppermint","flavor_id":"6795","vendor":"LB","millipercent":8000},{"name":"Super Sweet","flavor_id":"2384","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":500}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"73901","name":"Jolly Java"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
