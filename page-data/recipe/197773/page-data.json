I absolutely love Guanabana especially in something like green bastard and was intrigued to see it used in a strap on recipe. Unfortunately I am not the biggest fan of cherimoya, so as I sit vaping on trop cock the idea hit me, \"what if I tried switching the cherimoya for kiwi like in green bastard\". Low and behold, green bastard strap on was born!\r\n\r\nCap Super Sweet: Take it or leave it! Completely optional I just like using about 1 drop per 15mls when I make green bastard to help give it a little boost, and I feel the same happens here.\r\n\r\nDecent off the shake but definitely shines and is excellent after a 2-3 day steep.\r\n\r\nRecipe inspired by: \r\n\r\nGreen Bastard: https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/153649#green_bastard_by_yippyo\r\nTrop Cock: https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/35505#trop_cock_strap_on_by_deejay_mills\r\nStrap-On: https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/6487\r\n\r\nProps to ID10T for his blessings/assistance in this creation!","steep_days":"3 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:51:37.000-05:00","best_vg":"75%","views":"3234","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Fuji","flavor_id":"506","vendor":"FA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Red Touch (strawberry)","flavor_id":"421","vendor":"FA","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Red Summer (watermelon)","flavor_id":"471","vendor":"FA","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Guanabana","flavor_id":"4427","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Kiwi","flavor_id":"522","vendor":"FA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Super Sweet","flavor_id":"2384","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":250}],"reviews":[{"user":"Jonny5","text":"This is banging, I added 1 drop flv ice and 3 drops flv cool Menthol to 30ml and its on another level, its addictive, my new ADV thank you for sharing "},{"user":"Spycke","text":"Very tasty recipe and not boring at all. Next time I'd mix this I am going to try lowering fa watermelon to 2% and add 1% of Molinberry Big Watermelon. But that's just personal taste ;) Good job!"},{"user":"ID10-T","text":"Is this more like substituting the Sweet Guava in Green Bastard with Strap-On or more like substituting the Cherimoya in Trop Cock with Kiwi? I can't decide. But I have two theories this awesome stuff helps to prove: 1) It's hard to mess up FLV Guanabana, and 2) Strap-Ons are fun to play with. This is a lovely fruit party perfect for summer and hard to put down. That touch of sweetener seems to really add to the experience. You could drop it to 0.13% if you don't like things too sweet, but I don't recommend leaving it out.
