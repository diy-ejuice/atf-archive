Icy Trio presents a refreshing \"trio\" of strawberry, kiwi, and lychee with a sweet and cool menthol.\r\n\r\nThis is my fifth revision of icy trio and it’s getting closer. Please feel free to feedback me, I’d love your input! This is a work in progress.

This recipe is very well balanced and the kiwi-lychee combo with the underlying (FW) Strawberry are in perfect harmony. Thank you for sharing, it's amazingly good and full of flavour at only 7.05%. Improving will be very very hard to do, maybe the fift revision is the one, no?
