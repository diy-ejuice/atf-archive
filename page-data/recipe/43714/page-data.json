Shout out to Nick Luton! \r\n\r\nThe profile is Blueberries with drizzle sitting on a dash of thick cream and crispy Meringue base. \r\n\r\nFA Bilberry/FW Blueberry make up a decent representation of an actual blueberry. The FW Blueberry doesn't have quite enough presence on its own, it needs some help. The FA Bilberry is strong, but really gives the blueberry more depth and authenticity. \r\n\r\nCAP Blueberry Jam is very sweet, very artificial; perfect for sweetening the main blueberry flavour, giving a nice 'drenched' Blueberry vibe.\r\n\r\nFA Meringue/CAP Sugar Cookie were a no brainer. The Meringue is perfect at 2%. I tested it higher in previous batches and it's just a waste to go higher. \r\nThe Sugar Cookie helps to give the meringue more substance and bite as well as sweetening. I wanted more of a Pavlova style Meringue; which is crisp on the outside and chewy inside.\r\n\r\nFW Marshmallow/ CC Devon Cream are the cream/ thickening agents. They contribute more sweetness, more mouthfeel, a hint of vanilla whilst binding the recipe together. \r\nCC Devon Cream I used was straight from Cupcake World but I believe they are the same thing. It's extremely eggy, more so than CAPs VCV1, so it's excellent for a meringue mix. \r\nIt can absolutely be subbed for 1% TFA Bavarian Cream and 0.5% CAP VCV1. The reason I used DC is because it does the job of both. \r\nThe FW Marshmallow can also be subbed for your favourite marshmallow at the same %. \r\n\r\nThis is pretty sweet as is but also good with 0.25% Super Sweet. \r\nShake and Vape good to go but fills out great after a week!\r\nEnjoy!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","steep_days":"5 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"total_reviews":1,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:49:17.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"2811","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Bilberry","vendor":"FA","millipercent":250},{"name":"Blueberry","vendor":"FW","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Blueberry Jam","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":2750},{"name":"Meringue","vendor":"FA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Marshmallow","vendor":"FW","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Sugar Cookie","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Devon Cream","vendor":"CC","millipercent":1500}],"reviews":[{"user":"Pilgrim","score":"5","text":"I really like this combination of blueberries on top of the great meringue, this is definitely going in to my rotation.
