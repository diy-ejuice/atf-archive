The hops has a slight citrus note that is further enhanced by the tangerine, and the honeysuckle brings the sweetness and funkyness. It's wierd, but good wierd. Love stuff like this."},{"user":"kitu5","score":"5","text":"This is a lovely little mix. The tangerine is a nice, bright burst of citrus in a bed of lush, juicy and sweet (thanks honeysuckle) hops. This is what a craft beer should taste like. I'd drain a sixer of this like I drained the bottle I made. 10ml gone in under 48 hours, and in a MTL tank. Sooo damned good!"},{"user":"Xist","score":"5","text":"Just mixed this a minute ago, and my first impressions are quite promising...Strong flavor for a low percentage mix, and I'm digging the simple citrus flavor.  I'm finding that I really love Yakima Hops, which is the main reason I chose to mix.  Nice blend!"}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"142567","name":"Hop Along Sally"}}}
