I never had something like this recipe in my life, but I knew that these ingredients should work well together.  So I mixed them and... BOOM. It's delicious!\r\n\r\nTHE RICE BASE\r\nFE Sweet rice 3% and just 0.25% of FA cinnamon ceylon it's what I always mix when I want rice desserts.\r\n\r\nCOCONUT\r\nFLV Sweet coconut 3% is the true fruit, the white pulp of coconut. But it is weak, so I need a bit of commercial coconut flavor. Fa coc√≤ 1% it's the perfect pairing.\r\n\r\nPISTACHIO\r\nI need a sweet candy pistachio here so I use RF pistachio at 2%\r\n\r\nBLOOD ORANGE\r\nFW blood orange is a complex flavor: it has a fruit part that talk with coconut and a bitter part to make a compensation to the sweeteness of RF pistachio.\r\n\r\nFINAL THOUGHTS\r\nYou need a 0.5% of sweetener to help the coconut to rise up and to mute down the rice off-note.\r\nI'm very proud of this recipe and I have to thank a lot of mixers for inspiration:  @ENYAWREKLAW for his note about FE sweet rice, all  the NOTED crew ( @mlnikon - @ID10T - @CheebaSteeba ) for their explanation of RF pistachio and FLV sweet coconut.\r\n\r\nEnjoy and don't forget to review.","steep_days":"2 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-10T16:01:13.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"1057","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Sweet Rice","flavor_id":"7727","vendor":"FE","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Sweet Coconut","flavor_id":"605","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Pistachio","flavor_id":"2281","vendor":"RF","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Cinnamon Ceylon","flavor_id":"497","vendor":"FA","millipercent":250},{"name":"Super Sweet","flavor_id":"2384","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":500},{"name":"Coco' (coconut)","flavor_id":"416","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Blood Orange","flavor_id":"1197","vendor":"FW","millipercent":1000}],"reviews":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"139561","name":"PISTARICO"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
