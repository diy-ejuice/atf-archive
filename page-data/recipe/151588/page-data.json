Then I got to thinking about a Shirley temple so I wanted to get a cherry flavor in there without the medicine.  Really not a ton going on here.  The FLV Ginger is a pretty strong ginger and paired with citrus soda/fizzy sherb lemon/lime soda base gets me a pretty solid gingerale taste.","steep_days":"14","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:50:56.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"1599","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Red Cherry","flavor_id":"1516","vendor":"MB","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Cherries","flavor_id":"757","vendor":"INW","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Ginger","flavor_id":"4415","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":750},{"name":"Citrus Soda","flavor_id":"10083","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Fizzy Sherbet","flavor_id":"8878","vendor":"VT","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Kentucky Bourbon","flavor_id":"361","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Bourbon","flavor_id":"8839","vendor":"VT","millipercent":1000}],"reviews":[{"user":"ID10-T","text":"This is an impressive recipe! The idea is a ginger ale with whiskey and cherries and the result is a really nice beverage vape. I think without any of the deep Bourbon smokiness coming through this goes a little more toward Crown, which is a good thing, that actually sounds better to me with Ginger Ale than Maker's Mark. So you get that booze right on top with VT, but there’s depth to it as well, it’s a mixed drink, not just a float of liquor on top. He’s got that sweet syrupy ginger and he’s built a ginger ale out of it with these fizzy things and it really has that effervescent feel to it, like the ginger spice and that fizz thing from the citrus soda and fizzy sherb are amplifying each other. It makes me wonder whether the FLV Citrus Soda/VT Fizzy Sherbert/FLV Ginger combo used here could be portable for other Ginger Ale setting or whether the liquor here is covering up some of the top-side citrus and keeping it from being to citrusy for ginger ale. Someone needs to experiment with that, for science.  The whole thing also has a wet beverage feel. It’s refreshing. I was pretty nervous about combining cherry with alcohol because that sounds like a recipe for cough medicine, but he’s managed to get enough bright red cherry in there to taste it without it going that direction. It really tastes like a lot of work went into this. I think I might like just a little cooling with this. I wouldn’t put WS-23 because in my experience that would totally mess up that boozy liquor top note, but a light touch of FA Polar Blast might add a cool finish to a cocktail vape.

I was lacking flavors and was sent a sample by the kindness of Puck and I'm glad he did. I have since purchased the missing flavors to be able to mix this again for myself. The bourbon/ginger combo is fantastic. Ginger's warmth plays well with that bourbon warm sweetness giving it a little spicy bite. When I first sampled this mtl, I really didnt get a lot of 'ginger ale' vibe. In the time since, I've made sure to try it in my c4 and that gingerale comes through very well indeed. There's wiggle room for you to adjust your percentages if you want to bring out the bourbon more or less or just work with the ones you have. (Also was sent to me minus the booze flavors with instructions to add my booze of choice. I can see that as the drink portion here is solid gingerale with cherry and i love the versatility of this.) This profile is right up my alley, and yours if you enjoy sweet bourbon mixed drinks. It is sweet, warm, flavored nicely bourbon with a cherry on top. Excellent work from us booze hounds! (Also, still strong after a month or two steep.)"}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"151588","name":"Don't Call Me Shirley"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
