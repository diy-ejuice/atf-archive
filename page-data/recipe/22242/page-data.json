Imagine a mixed long gin drink with fresh and tangy apple juice and a rhubarb syrup - that's my perception of this recipe.\r\n\r\nProfile:\r\n\r\nGin itself - During my research of FA Gin I found it to mostly carry a juniper berry flavour than an actual gin flavour, so taking it from 2 to 3% at 2,8% max in a mix and adding a bit of INW Cactus, I made FA Gin feel more \"drinkable\" and juicy. To sweeten the whole thing up I've decided to use a bit of Strawberry ripe - just to get the sweetness without getting an actual strawberry flavour.\r\n\r\nApple & Rhubarb - To provide an authentic \"boozy\" feel of this mixed drink I've used FA Fuji as a fresh, tangy apple with a bite that will compliment the gin part. As for rhubarb - here goes a nice one - INW Rhubarb, IMO pretty much universal flavouring that carry an authentic rhubarb flavour with a rhubarb sour peel, it can make a drink more juicy and sour and add that specific rhubarb note, it can be also used in cakes and stuff - but that's the whole other story. Be mindful, though, don't use it over 0,5%, this flavouring can overpower every other with ease. In the end we've got a fresh and a bit sour apple and rhubarb mix that will be good in a drink and will be very light, but not creamy smooth, to provide our mixed drink a kick it needs.\r\n\r\nSyrup - While I added TFA Strawberry ripe to the mix already to make it sweet, let's add a syrupy texture by adding INW Raspberry Shisha, it will add a smooth texture and will make our fruity mix more syrupy, so it can be mixed into our drink and blend with it well.
