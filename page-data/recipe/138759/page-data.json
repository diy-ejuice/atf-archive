Nothing groundbreaking going on, just a straight-forward raspberry lemonade. A killer recipe, nonetheless. They sold a ton of this stuff, and Ruby Roo gushed about it endlessly. Just using two great flavors as the cornerstone in a perfect marriage and keeping it simple. \r\n\r\nThe original was a bright, cherry-red as it used the old Lorann's Raspberry with the deep red coloring. I prefer the Colorless version, which is standard issue at Bull City. Either is fine, the aroma is the same. I do miss that red color, it was appetizing.\r\n\r\n*LA Lemonade* is just a great flavor. Does what it advertises, bold and true. Hard to beat, imo. Flavorah is close, but Lorann's takes the crown.\r\n\r\n*LA Raspberry* is still one of my favorite candy-raspberry flavors. Very underappreciated today, and very unique. So many mixers swore by this stuff back in the olden days of vaping-past. *(It's also a big part of \"Angel Sauce\" by The Plume Room, an awesome sherbet recipe.)* It is used well here, paired with it's sister Lemonade flavor.\r\n\r\nI've added *TFA Sweet Raspberry* just to darken the berry note, it's at a low percentage so it doesn't detract, but rather adds to the original. One might even consider adding ~0.25% of FA Blackcurrant to darken it further, but then we're not true to the original which is what this is shooting for. \r\n\r\nSweetener to taste. 0.5% is more than enough, but the original may be closer to 1%\r\n\r\nHopefully this post helps someone who has a nostalgic craving, or was trying to nail down the recipe, yet missing out because of Lorann's low profile these days.\r\n","steep_days":"1 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:50:43.000-05:00","best_vg":"60%","views":"1745","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Lemonade","vendor":"LA","millipercent":10000},{"name":"Raspberry","vendor":"LA","millipercent":6000},{"name":"Raspberry (sweet)","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Super Sweet","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":500}],"reviews":[{"user":"Mindbugs","text":"Damn good juice.
