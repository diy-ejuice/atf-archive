Floral, spicy, fruity, and boozy. There’s that terrific non-perfumy floral of elderflower right on top, mingled up a bit with cinnamon and hops, and an apple cider base loaded with things to ferment that basic apple juice flavor into an authentic hard cider. I don’t know why this recipe says “work in progress.”  It tastes finished and even one-shot worthy to me, and I hope I remember to make some more in the fall, when this kind of warm, comforting vape will be perfect for chilly evenings. There also seems to be something worth learning from here; a cider like this could get a bit ho-hum without that floral point of interest from the Elderflower, but there doesn’t seem to be a reason why the point of interest HAS to be Elderflower. It tastes like one could replace that with just about any distinctive flavor with a bold top note and use this terrific cider base to create some other kind of hard cider.
