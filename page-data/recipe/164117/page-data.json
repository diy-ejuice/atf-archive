Clove can be overpowering, but at 0.3% it's present without taking things over. FA Soho was a great addition to my collection, well worth it for this recipe or any other lighter tobaccos you might want to mix. The mix of FLV Cured and Turkish provides a slightly sweet, slightly tangy tobacco finish to this recipe that makes it pop. This is _the_ clove recipe as far as I am concerned."},{"user":"nowar","score":"5","text":"This is the clove recipe I have been waiting for. It's a perfect application of FLV Clove which can dominate a juice. I've used it to cover up so many mixes and I've just overused it. Here, at 0.3% it's just adding all the right notes, blending marvelously with the spice notes in Turkish for a lip smacking taste, that isn't reliant on the clove for bite. Soho adds that depth and richness to make this all come together into something really easy to vape. Cured keeps it an honest tobacco feel and this is perfection. Not a thing 'off' about this. If you are interested at all in this profile, this is it without any extras. Thank you for this."}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"164117","name":"Clovert operative"}}}
