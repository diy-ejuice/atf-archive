Its rich, buttery and thick and has a wonderful ice cream taste so i had to use it.\r\n\r\nTHE CEREAL \r\n\r\nCAP Cereal 27/ FLV Milk & Honey this two make a great Golden Graham like taste, and with the two other flavourings the milky, creamy cereal milk part is covered.\r\n\r\nIt's pretty tasty as a SnV but after 10 days its wonderful.\r\n\r\nAdd: 0.5% Fa Meringue and 1% Inawera Custard to Boost the milky-creaminess.\r\n( it makes it quite more towards a true custard but its makes it smoother,tasty and rich)","steep_days":"10 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"total_reviews":6,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:51:08.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"4196","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Cereal 27","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Custard Premium","vendor":"FA","millipercent":3500},{"name":"Vanilla Bean Ice Cream","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Milk & Honey","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":500},{"name":"Super Sweet","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":500}],"reviews":[{"user":"MikeRaf23","score":"5","text":"absolutely excellent ! my new favorite mix. Nice work !"},{"user":"Grfxman","score":"5","text":"I am a custard fiend... but this takes the top spot in my rotation - the use of Cereal 27 in here is genius as a bakery/crust note with the CA Premium and VBIC working to give that rich creamy base. I swear I am even getting hints of marshmallow in here too = its just a lovely recipe and one I will be making a whole lot more of... 5 stars all the way!

My 15ml disappeared like there was a hole in the bottom of the bottle. Gotta mix some big batches now! Thanks for sharing!"},{"user":"BadaG","score":"5","text":"Damm, my favourite custard so far!!&#xD;\n&#xD;\nSo creamy and thick, I went for the extra INW custard and FA Meringue additions and I’m absolutely loving it.&#xD;\n&#xD;\nI especially love the Ice cream element which gives it extra decadence and the cereal makes it more interesting than a standard custard adding another dimension.&#xD;\n&#xD;\nSimple but rich, thick, luxurious and  bloody delicious, exactly what I was looking for for an ADV&#xD;\n&#xD;\nIt was delicious straight off the shake with the ice cream being fairly prominent and after a one week steep the cereal aspect showed its face and everything balanced out superbly. All these flavours work so well together and I haven’t stopped vaping it all week which is uncommon for me as I get bored easily &#xD;\n&#xD;\nGreat recipe "},{"user":"Alanfinal","score":"5","text":"No shopping list full of flavours,simple straight forward and effective,my ADV right now"},{"user":"bjorama","score":"5","text":"This here is a nice little recipe.  One of the few recent recipes I've mixed up that caught my attention.  Very nice take on a cereal vape.  In the past I fell in and outta love with Cereal 27 and it's used perfectly here.  I'm only about 4 days into the steep and this is already a 5."}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"164985","name":"Cereal Milk Frozen Custard"}}}
