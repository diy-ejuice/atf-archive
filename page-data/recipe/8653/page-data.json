So I tried it again with FA pear subbed in, which doesn't change the flavor profile much but does remove that nauseous feeling I get from the TPA.  Works really well and really emphasizes the melon.  Good summertime vape."},{"user":"jiff_smooth","text":"Some of my favorite flavors that I never thought to use together in a mix. I'm surprised it's balanced so well considering my main concern was whether the watermelon would play well with the honeydew. I'm getting the cantaloupe/honeydew on the inhale and watermelon on the exhale, with a light but satisfying taste of pear throughout. Very nice recipe, man. I didn't even finish 5 mLs of it before I mixed it up in a much larger bottle. "}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"8653","name":"Melonius Thunk"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
