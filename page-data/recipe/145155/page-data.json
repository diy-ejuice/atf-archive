I felt the need to go back to it just to see how I would approach it now and I have to say with the help of newer flavors.\r\n\r\nAs much as I am not a fan of **FLV Sweet Coconut**, I do really love **FA Coconut** and how well they both blend into creams. When I think of recipes with creamy coconut in them I think of [Leche de Coco by hashslingingslashur](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/42350#leche_de_coco_coconut_milk_by_hashslingingslashur), so I went with them at the same ratio but turned down a bit. Although weak, **TFA Sweet Tea** is still my favorite for straight up black tea. I have been messing around with this combination with **VT Sugar Cane** for a few mixes and haven't been disappointed yet. VT Sugar Cane makes it a little darker, sweeter and even a little more earthy. After testing a lot of cream layers I decided to go with **CAP NY Cheesecake** and **FA Bavarian Cream**. Working with Folkart and Alfred on multiple recipes, there is no denying those fuckers are straight up, unapologetically crema bavarese crazy, and for good reason. I used NY Cheesecake to fill out some of the missing texture and weigh it down a little more, but I didn't expect it to add as much to the coconut layer like it does. I wish I had more to say about why that flavor works in here but somehow it does.\r\n\r\n\r\n.25% CAP SS if needed... probably needed.","steep_days":"3 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-12T02:45:41.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"1479","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Bavarian Cream ","flavor_id":"9951","vendor":"FA","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Coco' (coconut)","flavor_id":"416","vendor":"FA","millipercent":250},{"name":"Sweet Coconut","flavor_id":"605","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":500},{"name":"New York Cheesecake","flavor_id":"90","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":750},{"name":"Sweet Tea","flavor_id":"369","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":11000},{"name":"Sugar Cane","flavor_id":"9369","vendor":"VT","millipercent":250}],"reviews":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"145155","name":"Coconut Milk Tea"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
