Refreshing vape on a hot day for me.\r\n\r\nV2 (2020): This was one of my first mixes I made and enjoyed but coming back to it almost a year later I made a couple minor tweeks making it even better. Doubled up on the CAP Golden Pineapple from the original, it helps in pushing out the citrus fruits to more the front and reducing the dominance of the guava. Doubling the WS-23 was more for me because ~1-1,.25% is my preferred cooling level but you can reduce to the original 0.5% if preferred.
