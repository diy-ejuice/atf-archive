Most of the time they suck dick. This isn't one of those times. \r\n\r\nI present to you the Malibu Driver. A Malibu Driver is an alcoholic beverage insisting of two parts orange juice and one part Malibu rum. I have never had a MD before, but I do like me some good ol' vitamin C and Malibu gets along well with me on occasion, so it sounded like a pretty good cocktail. Why not put it in vape form?\r\n\r\nOrange Juice - CAP Sweet Tangerine, TPA Orange Cream and FA Mandarin: these three combine to make our orange juice base. The Orange Cream more or less tastes like rind ( as noted by @Vurve ) and is by far the most realistic so that flavor creates our base. Sweet Tangerine is a very vibrant and delicious orange flavor, just a tad too \"Orange Tic Tac\" at higher percentages. FA Mandarin helps blend the two together and almost adds some orange zest to further the realism. \r\n\r\nMalibu Rum - FA Coco', TPA Coconut Candy and FA Jamaican Rum: Jamaican Rum is the head honcho being that this is a rum recipe. At 3% it was a little too overpowering for me so I dropped it to 2% and have been digging it right there. FA Coco' to me tastes like coconut milk and is a very authentic coconut flavor. At 2%, it's strong enough to be present but still plays nicely with the rum. TPA Coconut Candy is VERY easy to fuck up with. At too high of a percentage it makes your juice taste like sun tan lotion, but at .5% it just helps to boost the coconut aspect a tad. \r\n\r\nKoolada is optional, no one likes a warm cocktail so it is suggested. I'm waiting on some WS-23 to arrive and maybe that would work well with this recipe also. \r\n\r\nSweetener is always subjective, but orange juice is slightly sweet as is Malibu, so .25% works well for me. Feel free to leave this out. \r\n\r\nAnd there you folks have it, a fruity (?) recipe that Parkus actually can vape on for more than a few minutes. Mix this up and let me know what you guys think. \r\n\r\nDeuces‚úåüèª","steep_days":"1 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"total_reviews":2,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:49:35.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"2009","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Sweet Tangerine","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Orange Cream","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Tanger (mandarin)","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Jamaica Special (jamaica Rhum)","vendor":"FA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Coco' (coconut)","vendor":"FA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Coconut Candy","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Super Sweet","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":250},{"name":"Koolada 10 Pg","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":100}],"reviews":[{"user":"HerrHut","score":"5","text":"I don't really like cocktail vapes but mixed it up anyway.
