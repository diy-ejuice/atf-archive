It may just be me being sensitive to that particular concentrate. The overall flavour on this recipe is very good though,I think if I mix this again I’ll use 4% DFS and 2.5% TPA. Thanks for the recipe matey. Happy new year 👍🏻","score":4}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"179448","name":"Bread Dead RY4demption"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
