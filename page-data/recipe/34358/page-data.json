(TPA) Banana cream is pretty much already banana pudding, so this recipe is just about balancing the other ingredients perfectly so that it tastes like a perfect Banana Puddin' and not just Banana Mush. (CAP) Sugar Cookie give it that sweetness and lightness to keep it a pudding and then (FA) Meringue is a perfect eggy, sweet, component to make this juice a little more complex. Simple-juice is making e-juice better and more simple. \r\n\r\nKeep mixing!","steep_days":"1 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:49:09.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"6009","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Sugar Cookie","flavor_id":"115","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Banana Cream","flavor_id":"210","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Meringue","flavor_id":"530","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000}],"reviews":[{"user":"Kittybit","text":"Pure and prime example of how awesome CAP Sugar Cookie really is. Nice and buttery, little bit eggy from the meringue and the TFA Bana Cream and CAP Sugar Cookie is a match made in heaven. This is some delicious good stuff."},{"user":"HerrHut","text":"I like this a lot. Decent banana with a nice pudding \"mouth feel\" (does that even make sense?).  It needs an hour or so for me for the sugar cookie to settle, but then it's ready to go.
