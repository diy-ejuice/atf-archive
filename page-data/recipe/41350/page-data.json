This seems to be the favorite for most vapers out of the Space Jam line and I can see why. Its a great sweet and sour candy fruit experience, great for spring. It has a medium throat hit on a shake n vape but its gone after a couple draws and will steep out after a couple days. Im not a huge fan of menthol but I would say that this recipe would make a good candidate for adding just a little bit. Menthol is not in the original profile and neither is raspberry but in testing I found that 2 drops per 30ml of INW Raspberry adds another layer and works very well in this mix. So there you have mix it up, enjoy, and never have to buy Pulsar by Space Jam ever again.","steep_days":"1 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":4.7,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:49:15.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"11501","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Lime Tahity Cold Pressed","flavor_id":"581","vendor":"FA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Lemon Sicily","flavor_id":"524","vendor":"FA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Sour","flavor_id":"336","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Super Sweet","flavor_id":"2384","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Lemon Lime","flavor_id":"83","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":3500},{"name":"Meringue","flavor_id":"530","vendor":"FA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Peach (juicy)","flavor_id":"254","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1250},{"name":"Raspberry","flavor_id":"667","vendor":"INW","millipercent":250}],"reviews":[{"user":"konvul","text":"My ADV!

But I mixed this anyway and boy am I glad I did! I get zero throat hit from this juice, I don't get much peach for that matter, I get more of the candy peach ring notes, helping to give more of the candy profile to the lemon and lime. It's sweet but not too sweet. Reminds me of downing a handful of yellow and green sour patch kids. Very good work here, I imagine I will be vaping this a lot throughout spring and summer"},{"user":"TamVapes","text":"This is great.  Thank you for posting and sharing."},{"user":"Dalpho","text":"I've never had the original but this is a really nice summer time vape. Not to sour not to sweet and the peach really makes it pop. I used .75% TFA sweetener to sub for cap SS.&#xD;\n&#xD;\nUpdate: after a few days rest the S&amp;V harshness fades and I'm really starting to get addicted to this profile. Definitely adding this to my normal rotation. Thanks "},{"user":"jajohnson93","text":"Give up outfielders cuz this one's out of the park! A very nice sweet and tart profile my tastebuds thoroughly enjoy.  Excellent work Barrett! Really dig your butter almond custard as well! Doing good things you are.
