I can’t put it down! \r\n\r\nA juicy, refreshing, summery feeling mix. \r\n\r\nJuicy, tart apple with pink fruity and floral notes from the MB Pink Lady. VSO Apple is the foundation of the mix. It’s the best apple flavour I’ve tried by miles. I could happily vape it as a SF. \r\nI think those who usually don’t like florals wouldn’t be put off by this mix as they more just accent to the apple. It’s a pretty soft floral note. \r\nCucumber is mainly adding to the overall fresh feel of the mix. \r\n\r\nI let it sit overnight before vaping.
