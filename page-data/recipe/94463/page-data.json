Over the last few months it seems everyone has been releasing some sort of custard recipe. I thought it was time for me to release my take on Duchess. Kings Crest describes this profile as a decadent, creamy tres leches cake. I'm not sure how accurate it is to that description, but it is very tasty.  I taste a buttery, brown sugar with vanilla and a thick custard with hints of corn giving it an autumn feel.  Now I have no idea what they are using but here's how I approached this profile. \r\n\r\nLets start with the custard. CAP Vanilla is always my go to for custards. There's many custards to choose from but it's my favorite to work with because it's just so damn tasty. I used it at 3% and I think that's where it needs to be for this profile. Some may think it needs to be higher to achieve a \"decadent\" custard, but just let it steep for 1-2 weeks and it's delightful. I had considered adding a vanilla note to the custard but the vanilla note in CAP Vanilla Custard is enough to achieve this.\r\n\r\nThe buttery, brown sugar notes:\r\nIf you're wanting to add a brown sugar note to your recipes I suggest using DFS HOLY HOLY GRAIL RY4. It's perfect for a rich brown sugar note that doesn't require a long steep. I used it at only .5% and added CAP Butter Cream at 2% to create that buttery, brown sugar note I was going after.\r\n\r\nThe corn note:\r\nWhen I first single flavor tested FA Corn I wasn't sure I like it. It had such a distinct flavor and kinda weird. But after it steeped for a week I knew it had a place in this mix. It really settles down after a week steep to only a hint of corn-like flavor. And while the corn note I got in the original is faint, it is there. At .5% it's perfect in this mix. I added TPA Acetyl Pyrazine at .5% to bolster the corn and give it a bit of texture. I also add INW Biscuit to add some buttery texture to this layer as well.\r\n\r\nThe .25% of CAP Super Sweet is probably not necessary, but I prefer just a touch.\r\nSteep time is at least 1 week but only gets better the longer it steeps.\r\n\r\nI know some of you may say to yourself, \"not another damn remix\" but I do enjoy tackling these remixes and that's why we do what we do, just having fun with it. I think this remix is pretty damn close and I hope you will mix, comment, and or rate, it make us all better mixers :).\r\n\r\nVisit Freedom To Mix on Discord https://discord.gg/SmSc8Ef\r\nJoin our Freedom To Mix FaceBook group https://www.facebook.com/groups/415341418920740/ \r\n\r\n\r\n","steep_days":"7","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"total_reviews":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T20:32:30.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"5233","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Acetyl Pyrazine 5%","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Butter Cream","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Biscuit","vendor":"INW","millipercent":650},{"name":"Corn","vendor":"FA","millipercent":500},{"name":"HOLY HOLY GRAIL RY4","vendor":"DFS","millipercent":500},{"name":"Vanilla Custard","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Super Sweet","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":250}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"94463","name":"Harvest Custard (A Duchess remix)"}}}
