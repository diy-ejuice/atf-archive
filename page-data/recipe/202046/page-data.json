You get a darker cherry with some light floral notes, dunked right into a delicious southern sweet tea. Floral's are not overbearing and this is not medicinal as you would think. It is slightly floral so some may confuse the two, but this is a delicious vape!! I add 1 drop cap ss per 10ml, sweeten to your liking!!\r\n\r\nThis is good as a shake and vape but as always i recommend a short 3 day steep.","steep_days":"3 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"total_reviews":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T17:36:29.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"265","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Blackcherry Jelly Bean SC","vendor":"WF","millipercent":750},{"name":"Cherry Blossom Tea","vendor":"LB","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Southern Sweet Tea SC","vendor":"WF","millipercent":5000},{"name":"50/50 Cherry","vendor":"OOO","millipercent":2000}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"202046","name":"Cherry Blossom Sweet Tea"}}}
