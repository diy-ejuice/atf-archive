These three work well together to mimic the kind of creme brulée I dig.\r\nThe Ginger and Lemongrass combo works as well in sweet and savory concoctions, so pairing them here wasn't too much of a risk. Lemongrass is low because that ish is expensive, and it still comes through well enough at .25 to be noticeable without giving off any lemon pledge or woody notes. \r\nYou may want to add a few drops of INW cactus to it too, because it can feel a little dry - but don't overdo it. \r\nGive it a week to settle down, and enjoy!\r\nMassive thanks to @SlashaLO for the review and the suggestion to up the ginger a smidge. You were bang on the money and I've updated the recipe. \r\n ","steep_days":"7","temperature":"0","recipe_score":4,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:50:05.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"1156","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Creme Brulee (yc)","flavor_id":"894","vendor":"INW","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Ginger","flavor_id":"4415","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":750},{"name":"Lemon Grass","flavor_id":"2592","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":250},{"name":"Custard","flavor_id":"4388","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Sweet Coconut","flavor_id":"605","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":500}],"reviews":[{"user":"SlashaLO","text":"This was a very interesting mix on paper. It’s what sparked me to mix it, as well as the custard base here. The lemongrass is great and plays with the ginger very well. I didn’t think coconut would do well here but it did, very well. The main notes I got up front were the lemongrass and coconut. I feel the ginger got overpowered in this mix, even at that %. For my taste I think another .25% and it would be more pronounced and still stay balanced. Great mix for sure.
