For this journey was a difficult one. With my vaping style I need something to be a adv for me to release a recipe. With that said this was the closest I could get to a authentic plain pumpkin pie with out bombarding it with a vbic or some sort of vanilla ect..... I didn't want to mask nothing. I wanted a traditional buttery crust so the pairing of caps sugar cookie and inw biscuit play this role in making up the crust. Now the pumpkin I didn't want to go the same route as folk in using HS pumpkin. So my option were limited. Trying a bunch of different combos from holiday spice, flv egg nog ect....  they just wasn't hitting my palate the right way something was missing. The choice of RF pumpkin pie was a difficult decision. It's a tough one to work with imo. Using at 2% with  caps pumpkin spice at  .75% to help support the lacking spice  and to help mute some of the off notes. Lastly the the lacking body of the filling is where I need a milky or some sort of condensed milk. This is where the Vienna cream, cream fresh and sweetner play there role. The addition of custard is to thickin  up the mix. Hopefully you guys enjoy it was a tough one for me. \r\n\r\nVisit DIY MIXERS CREW on Discord https://discord.gg/kUJGkHt\r\nVisit DIY MIXERS CREW on FaceBook https://www.facebook.com/groups/456512471380574/\r\nWatch DIY MIXERS CREW LIVE on YouTube every Sunday at 4:30 pm EST https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC1ENB0bSNrG_1KETYwZ154g\r\nPlease comment, mix, and or rate,....it makes us all better mixers.","steep_days":"3 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-11T02:37:11.000-05:00","best_vg":"75%","views":"1994","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Acetyl Pyrazine 5%","flavor_id":"1709","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Sugar Cookie","flavor_id":"115","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":3500},{"name":"Biscuit","flavor_id":"642","vendor":"INW","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Sweetener","flavor_id":"339","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":250},{"name":"Vanilla Custard","flavor_id":"131","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Vienna Cream","flavor_id":"516","vendor":"FA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Cream Fresh","flavor_id":"540","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Pumpkin Pie (spice)","flavor_id":"107","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":750},{"name":"Pumpkin Pie â€“ SC","flavor_id":"7536","vendor":"RF","millipercent":2000}],"reviews":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"63776","name":"I hate pumpkin pie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
