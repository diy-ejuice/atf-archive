A sort of smoky Black Cavendish vibe, but instead of a honey sweetness like Gold Ducat, it’s got a hint of licorice. It’s not an offensive amount of licorice. I really don’t care for anise or black licorice, but I’m ok with the amount in this one. \r\n\r\n* Black for Pipe: If you don’t have it or already know about it, you’re messing up. Great smoky tobacco with some dark fruit subtleties and a tobacco flavor that goes down really smooth. Must have in my opinion. \r\n\r\n* Gold for Pipe: basically honey smoke. That’s the best way I can describe it. I love it with Gold Ducat, and it’s just as magical with Black Jack. \r\n\r\n* Tobacco Absolute Garuda: Pretty much it’s just plain ol’ Tobacco leaf. Some mild sweetness, and can give just a little hint of ash when pushed to the 1.5% range- which is what I did here :)","steep_days":"14","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"updated_at":"2020-12-12T15:39:35.000-05:00","best_vg":"60%","views":"2389","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Black Jack Tobacco","flavor_id":"714","vendor":"INW","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Classic For Pipe Black","flavor_id":"764","vendor":"INW","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Classic For Pipe Gold","flavor_id":"767","vendor":"INW","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Tobacco Absolute Garuda","flavor_id":"2717","vendor":"INW","millipercent":1500}],"reviews":[{"user":"JTHerman","text":"This is a great mix. The further past two weeks it gets, the more I taste the dark fruit and something like baked apple. I like anise, so I added 0.5% TFA Horehound to bring it out more and it really works. Next time I’ll switch to TFA Absinthe. This was my first try with gourmet tobacco flavors and it’s so much more like the real thing than the SOHO and RY4 mixes I’ve made, it’s night and day. My only criticism is that at least on the mod I use (Skystar with a Revvo tank), the flavor is weak. It’s too subtle. I find that if I boost the tobacco percentages by 50% (2.25% and 1.5%, respectively), the flavors come through perfectly.","score":5},{"user":"amouthforwar","text":"Thought I had left a review for this a while back. When I first mixed it I slaughtered a 30ml in 2-3 days (on a kayfun mind you, so pretty damn fast). Stuff's good. Like Ebc said, I don't get much licorice, maybe a touch of anise but the overall mix is pretty fruity in a really dark and smoky way, so instead of coming out like licorice I get a really nice anise mixed with almost black currant kinda raisin note. I'm terrible at describing what I experience, but it's a really good dark and rich vape with a touch of zing from the black jack and black for pipe, a nice semi-gooey sweetness from the gold for pipe, which also gives it a nice mouthfeel. the Garuda really ties it all together and brings it back to leafy tobacco territory. None of these flavorings are overly ashy in their own right, maybe black for pipe being the smokiest of the 4, but tied together they really bring that smoky casino vibe in full force. Fantastic work, dude. This and 3 cities will forever be in my MTL rotation.","score":5},{"user":"Ebc88","text":"I don’t notice any licorice notes from the Black Jack but they wasn’t that offensive when I solo tested it awhile back. We have different interpretations of Gold for Pipe it really gives off a chewing tobacco vibe to me, but it works just fine in here, and pairs well with the smoky berry tobacco the Black Pipe brings and the slightly earthy tobacco the Garuda brings. The Garuda is in my top 3 solo tobacco flavors which is probably one of the reason I’m digging this recipe so much. I could definitely see bringing a squonk full of this to a casino/bar just seems like it would go really well with alcohol.
