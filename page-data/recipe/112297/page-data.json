With an overabundance of this profile out there, all tasting so similar, it's refreshing to find one that is apart from the herd. I have had plenty of the original (it was one of my ADVs before I got into DIY) and I have to say this is better. I didn't have TPA Strawberry at first, so I subbed it with Strawberry Ripe which worked quite well up until I got Strawberry from BCF. I'm not sure which ingredient I like better so I just alternate to keep it fresh. I usually keep a 120ml at the ready, but it's good off the shake if I neglect my mixing responsibilities and have to SNV to get my fix. That being said, I prefer to wait for a 5 day steep.

I passed a few months ago because Iâ€™m not a huge fan of cap sweet strawberry but this works better than I imagined it would. Glad I finally mixed it up.","score":5},{"user":"Ebc88","text":"This reminds me alot of my favorite strawberry &amp; cream which is Cheebas. The NY Cheesecake work really well it add a unique taste.
