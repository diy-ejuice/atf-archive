I was inspired by the Mixin Vixens challenge, but I am not fond of sweets, so this is a more savory take on an ice cream sundae, so, you may want to add sweetener.  I was shooting for a nut ice cream, topped with caramel, unsweetened whipped cream, and candied pecans.  It is dense and creamy.\r\n\r\nI chose LB Vanilla Ice Cream as the base as it has received great reviews, and added TFA Pralines and Cream and Butter Pecan to add the nut flavor.   The FE Oak Milk adds a little depth to the flavor, and brings in that savory note.  I love cardamon with dairy, so I added FA Cardamom for spice.\r\n\r\nThe Dulce De Leche adds a little more cream and backs up the Caramel.\r\n\r\nThe Whipped Cream because, what would this sundae be without whipped cream?\r\n\r\nTested on ss316  0.5 ohm 40 watts.  It needs at least a two week steep, but is best with a one month steep.\r\n\r\n\r\n","steep_days":"30","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T11:44:27.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"1228","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Vanilla Ice Cream","vendor":"LB","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Pralines And Cream","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Dulce De Leche","vendor":"JF","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Whipped Cream","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Butter Pecan","vendor":"FW","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Cardamom","vendor":"FA","millipercent":250},{"name":"Oak Milk","vendor":"FE","millipercent":500},{"name":"Carmel (caramel)","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1500}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"141347","name":"Caramel Nut Ice Cream"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
