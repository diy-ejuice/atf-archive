Detox. Yes folks, I too am an addict. I needed to go get right and I achieved that goal. Now as I push forward one day at a time, I am slowly finding my mixing legs again. \r\nI'm pleased to say that I don't think I will be making changes on this one. Unless it doesn't steep that well, then I think I might go back and tweak a couple components. \r\n\r\nGive this a shot and see if you think it's up to snuff for a weekend in a locked unit. ;)","steep_days":"2 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":4,"updated_at":"2020-12-12T14:06:19.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"2011","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Holy Vanilla","flavor_id":"2385","vendor":"DFS","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Graham Cracker Clear","flavor_id":"325","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Peanut Butter","flavor_id":"291","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Ry4 Double","flavor_id":"379","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Vanilla Custard","flavor_id":"188","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Super Sweet","flavor_id":"2384","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":500},{"name":"French Vanilla Icecream","flavor_id":"2129","vendor":"HS","millipercent":2000}],"reviews":[{"user":"super8line","text":"Pretty good, vaping it as I write this.","score":4}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"95342","name":"Peanut Custard ADV"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
