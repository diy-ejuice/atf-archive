What I remember is it was a dry, soft sugar cookie with a very light lemon glaze note.\r\n\r\nI've tried with this with OOO Powdered Sugar in lieu of LA Cream Cheese Icing and a combo of the two and I just can't make Powdered Sugar work.\r\nCAP Sugar Cookie seems a bit high in percentage, but I think it shines at 5% in this recipe.  You get all the texture and softness of a sugar cookie.\r\nCAP Lemon Lime and TFA Lemonade Cookie give a nice light lemon note.  You don't want it to be overpowering, the original was just recognizable enough as not to be cloying.\r\n\r\nEnjoy!","steep_days":"7","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T17:35:54.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"732","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Sugar Cookie","flavor_id":"115","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":5000},{"name":"Lemonade Cookie","flavor_id":"2367","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":750},{"name":"Lemon Lime","flavor_id":"83","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":750},{"name":"Super Sweet","flavor_id":"2384","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":500},{"name":"Cream Cheese Icing","flavor_id":"2380","vendor":"LA","millipercent":750}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"165490","name":"Lemonem #REMIX Beantown Vapors"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
