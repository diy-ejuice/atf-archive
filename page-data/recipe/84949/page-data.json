I think it’s oretty good but as always things can and will be improved! \r\n\r\nAs before we want to start off strong on the custard side of things. So we will be using a French vanilla premium custard  and vanillin convo to achieve that. This time around I wanted to use something I’m currently messing around with. “Flavour arts custard premium” personally I don’t really like how eggy this stuff is as a stand-alone custard. Don’t get me wrong it’s good just not what I’m after. But in this recipe it works well and I feel it has more of s rich side that is needed to compliment the butterscotch. TFA french vanilla is used to add that top layer of vanilla and the vanillin is borderline overkill but I like it. Sooo....\r\n\r\nNow we get to the cake batter graham cracker combo. And why I use it in my custard’s.....using graham cracker clear and cake batter together adds another ultra rich layer to the original sweet vanilla that can be almost boring after a while in most mixes that I feel should deliver every single time. \r\n\r\nMy choices for butterscotch were simple for me personally but that is because these are two that I like. If you can think of another from another brand that is similar to butterscotch ripple then please let me know in the comments. \r\n\r\nPossible alterations. We could add a little dolce de leche for a more caramel edge at maybe 0.20% and I’d like me your not to fond of the choice of vanilla custard then switch it back to Capella version 1 instead. Now that I think of it I may try a little toasted marshmallow for that extra lip smacking sweetness but we will see. \r\n\r\nI hope you crazy geniouses like this as much as I do and well. If you don’t then Stick a dick in your ear and Fuck what you heard!
