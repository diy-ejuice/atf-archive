Pairing them with raspberry felt compelling, and once I tried it, it didn't dissapoint. I felt that I wanted to have the raspberry \"just there\", to bring that sweet yummyness without taking over. The rose is definitley the star here, even if the flavor in itself is pretty light, it makes the recipe very smooth. The lychee can easily get funky if you use it too high, but here I think it pairs great with the raspberry to make it more of a nondescript berry sweetness, while also adding a body to it, something that the rose is lacking.\r\n\r\nI can see how this recipe might frighten some people when they see all the floral flavors, but honestly, if you like berries and cream kind of vapes, you'll like this. Rose Essence is very light and when I vape this it feels like I'm puffing on pink clouds.\r\n\r\nFlavor notes:\r\n**LB Vanilla Ice Cream** is pretty much the gold standard lately when you're making an ice cream (imo). Great mouthfeel that you want an ice cream to have, and a perfect balance between the sweet and eggy notes. 3% felt perfect for this, considering the other ingredients that are a bit on the lighter side.\r\n**TFA Vanilla Swirl** is just a perfect match for LB VIC, since it's light on the body but has an *amazing* sweetness and vanilla note to it.  There's a good reason why these two flavors are used so much together, they're just a match made in heaven.\r\n**CAP Hibiscus** is a very versatile flavor, and is perfect to use as sweetener for berries & florals. It's not used for flavor here, but rather to add some extra sweetness, while acting as bridge between the creams and the florals. Thanks to @apexified for this suggestion!\r\n**INW Raspberry** is hands down my favourite raspberry flavor, and one of the best berry flavors out there. It can be a bully and it can become wierd if used too high. At 0.5% it is slightly muted by the vanilla swirl, and just adds a touch of that amazing raspberry flavor that pairs extremely well with both the lychee and rose.\r\n**FLV Lychee** is very sweet, has a great body to it, and also some funky floral notes that I just love. This can be hard to work with, if you use it higher it will become too funky, but here at 0.5% it adds a nice sweet body, while acting as a bridge between the sweet raspberry and light floral rose.\r\n**FLV Rose Essence** .. it feels wierd to say that the rose is the star here, but it is. It's such a \"light\" flavor with a nonexistant body, but with the ice cream base, and the sweet berry/lychee body it adds that final  touch to it, a very pleasant \"calm\" and fresh feel to the mix.

This is an extremely satisfying mix right here. I have zero clue what Rose is supposed to taste like and I've only dabbled in Lychee and Hibiscus so I can't exactly speak to the technical parts of this but its seriously good. I went into this thinking it would be overbearing with floral because of the multiple floral flavors used but I’ll be damned that’s just not the case. INW Raspberry backs up the floral combo so well and gives it a sweet, deep flavor that just works so well. I have no clue if it was even ever considered, but not using the Ice Cream Trinity here was 100% the right thing to do. The low percentage of LB VIC brings the perfect ice cream mouthfeel and is bolstered by the Vanilla Swirl which I think works fantastically with the \"lighter\" floral. I think if HS FVIC was in here it would just mess up the vibe of the whole thing. It's to heavy and malty for this. Long story short this is a fantastic example of florals done well. It's bright, sweet and creamy while still showcasing the floral flavors."},{"user":"nowar","text":"This is a really interesting and unusual variant on ice cream. Light and floral, it sells on the unusual take on an ice cream. I have to say, i enjoy the interplay between the lychee/raspberry combo and the rose/hibiscus combo as complementary yet distinct flavor sensations. My favorite part of this recipe is that it has the right amount of sweetness for me. The heaviness of the trinity can really wear me down after a bit, but the florals here let LB ice cream do its work and poke through just often enough to sweeten up the mix without beating me over the head with IC. That's the real joy in this mix for me as I can see myself taking a good amount of time before tiring. I even get some hints of grapefruit when I pull and Im not sure if I'm just mistaking lychee for GF here, but it's a nice pocket of citrus in the mix."},{"user":"ID10-T","text":"I love this so much! It is indeed very pink-tasting, and absolutely lovely, one of the most pleasant things I’ve encountered in some time. It’s a smooth and relaxing, almost Zen kind of flavor. I get the rose and lychee situated perfectly in a sweet vanilla cream base. I know the FLV Rose Essence is a bit of a shrinking violet and FLV Lychee and INW Raspberry can be bullies, so getting both of these to work so well in pleasing floral ice cream is an achievement. There’s such an intriguing balance here between delicateness and richness. The raspberry doesn’t really come through as a raspberry, but it’s just enough to give it a berry-like sweetness and body that enhances its pinkness. If I had to offer one bit of constructive criticism, it would be that there’s not enough raspberry here for raspberry to appear in the name. That’s it. There’s nothing I would change about this but the name. I’d either just take word raspberry out or come up with some creative name for it. It’s a shame Shyndo already used “The Pink” because it would be a great fit. Maybe “Deco Umbrella Ice Cream” or something like that. "},{"user":"Foment_life","text":"So, above all here, the Lychee is cutting through the mix. I can see where the rose is happening, and the cream is clear, but a bit subdued here. It's not off in any way really, but a little less of a fully formed ice cream, and more of a heavy, not-as-yet set cream. The light, delicate and floral flavors here are sitting rather comfortably in the cream here. I can absolutely see how the floral and the fruit flavors are intermingling to make a delightfully rich, yet delicate combination of flavors. I can't see this being something I want to vape every day, but something I enjoy on occasion, this is excellent."}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"161831","name":"Rose, Lychee & Raspberry Ice Cream"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
