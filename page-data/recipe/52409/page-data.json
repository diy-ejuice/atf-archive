This is what it tastes like to me. This is just your simple Blue Jelly Candy recipe, that is not so flavor excessive percentage wise, and is a quick and ready shake and vape for someone on the go. \r\n\r\nFLV Boysenberry - This is one of my personal favorites out of my repertoire to use in mixing. It can be used in simple recipes, it can be used in complex recipes. In this one, it's the main squeeze, and this is mainly what you'll be tasting.\r\n\r\nFW Blue Raspberry - Including myself, a lot of DIY mixers aren't too fond of this flavor, and I have struggled using this as main profiles, and in other mixes in general. But I used this one as more of an enhancer with the Boysenberry, and it works rather well in my opinion at the 1% that it's set at.\r\n\r\nCAP Jelly Candy - Another one of my personal favorites to use in my collection, CAP's Jelly Candy provides a gummy flavor, that brightens alot of fruits in recipes, and doesn't take away from your main fruit profiles. I wouldn't go any higher than 2.5%\r\n\r\nRF Sour Gummy - Well, I don't have RF Sour Gummy in particular, I have the repackaged RF, North West Sour Gummy, that is VG based. I've used this flavor mainly like how others use TFA's Marshmallow as more of a mouth feel, and to give the flavor more girth. If you have RF Sour Gummy, I would probably do half the percentage of my North West percentage since RF's PG liquid should be more potent.\r\n\r\nFA Kiwi - I used Kiwi in this, just to add more brightness, and to give it more of a summer feel to the profile. Probably wouldn't use this any higher than 1%, unless you have a different profile you want to achieve\r\n\r\nCAP Super Sweet - I used 3 drops per 15ml of Super Sweet because well, this is a candy recipe. So it only makes sense. But could get away without using Sweetener if that isn't up your alley","steep_days":"1 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:49:25.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"2417","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Boysenberry","flavor_id":"614","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":3500},{"name":"Blue Raspberry","flavor_id":"1200","vendor":"FW","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Jelly Candy","flavor_id":"2170","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Sour Gummy","flavor_id":"4136","vendor":"RF","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Kiwi","flavor_id":"522","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Super Sweet","flavor_id":"2384","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":750}],"reviews":[{"user":"onimodaekil","text":"Tasty, bright, and about as blue as the sky. 3-4 days really does it a favor but it's great out the gate too."}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"52409","name":"Does This Taste Blue to You?"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
