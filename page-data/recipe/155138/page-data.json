His 123 strawberry fluff is extremely tasty & I suggest trying it out for yourself. It really shows the quality of lb strawberry cheesecake.\r\n\r\nOnwards to the notes:  \r\n\r\n**General:**Wanted a little more cheesecake and a bit of ye olde crust. Oh & I'm stuck on RF Strawberry SC, nice & jammy to go with the cheesecake. A hint of cap ss really helps the strawberry pop imo, 1 drop per 10ml instead of my usual 15.\r\n\r\n**Cap NY Cheesecake** A delicious creamy cheesecake and staple of every mixers toolbox. It really works well with the lb strawberry cheesecake\r\n\r\nSpeaking of, **LB Strawberry Cheesecake** is a great flavor. Creamy, some get cakey, (very full flavored) while also blending in a delicious sweet thick candied strawberry.\r\n\r\n**RF Strawberry SC** I'm not a strawberry non-taster, but I've heard this one works for the afflicted as well. & Lucky for them because it's a wonderful jammy Strawberry that kind of turns into a thick gooey strawberry when mixed with the cheesecakes. The super sweet helps to make the strawberry pop out a bit more.\r\n\r\n**TPA Cheesecake (Graham Crust) & Graham Cracker Clear:**To finish off the cheesecake we need a nice graham cracker crust right? Right. This works. GCC is one of those things I bought way too much of as a rookie dumbass so I always try it 1st where applicable & find it actually does a pretty good job here.\r\n\r\nAdditional: could add a tiny amount of AP(.18 or so) if you want to crunch up the crust even further.\r\n\r\nPicking a steep time on this one is hard because I feel it keeps improving over time (at least what I've been able to save). Tasty overnight, but I really recommend giving it 5 days for everything to fully meld together & magic the further than that you can make it last.\r\n\r\nEnjoy & Happy Mixing üòéüí®üí®\r\nRemember, feedback good or bad helps us all become better mixers.  With comments currently fubar reviews or even a pm are even more important than ever. üëç\r\n\r\nSubs: only thing I can think of is fw\\ecx sucralose or flv sweetness. I find cap easier to work with & cleaning coils isn't that big of a deal, but get sweetness & use (so far from what I've experimented with) about 1 5-2x as much as you would cap ss.","steep_days":"5","temperature":"666","recipe_score":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-12T00:42:03.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"1660","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Cheesecake (graham Crust)","flavor_id":"152","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"New York Cheesecake","flavor_id":"90","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Strawberry Cheesecake","flavor_id":"1505","vendor":"LB","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Strawberry ‚Äì SC","flavor_id":"7550","vendor":"RF","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Graham Cracker Clear","flavor_id":"325","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Super Sweet","flavor_id":"2384","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":180}],"reviews":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"155138","name":"1-2-3-2-1 Strawberry Jam Cheesecake"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
