I've never been a fan of either really. I get a bad after taste and those two paired always taste the same to me and over run the mix with a \"generic\" taste again, just my palette. Defiantly worth a mix and a good one to play with and make your own!!"},{"user":"Mr-G","text":"I expexted better taste tbh"},{"user":"w4lly01","text":""},{"user":"cincinnatiking","text":"One of my favorite strawberry and cream recipes. Love the strawberry combo of 3% and 4%."},{"user":"MrBurgundy","text":"I've tried this with the chocolate and without. They're both good, but I prefer without. It's a thick, buttery ice cream with just the right amount of strawberry. The strawberry is bright and sweet, and it blends right into the ice cream. There's the slightest tang that doesn't come from the berries, and I think it's the Sweet Cream. That's the only thing that comes across off to me, but it isn't very noticeable. After all, I am a little sensitive to that flavor. I mixed 60ml and let it steep 4 weeks before trying. Really nice vape at that point. I'll likely mix this again and would recommend it to someone looking for this profile."},{"user":"ChefJohn","text":"This recipe. Doesn't do it for me. &#xD;\n&#xD;\nIt's flat and has a weird texture. &#xD;\n&#xD;\nYmmv! "},{"user":"Lupeie","text":""},{"user":"Peewee","text":"Very close to the original and actually more consistent since we mix it up ourselves (ohw QC is terrible) but you need to add double chocolate at 3%. Wayne put a note up somewhere just not here. Very sweet and Gunks up my coils fairly fast,but i enjpy it regularly for the sweet tooth fix. Neapolitan icecream at the bottom after it mixes all up."},{"user":"BigMoose","text":"One of my favorite ice cream recipes. Very creamy strawberry-vanilla. I prefer it with a little double chocolate added in."},{"user":"stark","text":"Very nice, do need to wait for awhile for it too steep but then the flavours come through wonderfully.&#xD;\n&#xD;\nNot a criticism of the recipe itself but I think I'm personally a little sensitive to some things..  I got a very slight head ache from this, I personally just need isolate which ingredient it was going forward, probably the sweetener.&#xD;\n&#xD;\nThanks for the enthusiastic youtube channel"},{"user":"ncmijs","text":"Love the creamy strawberry flavor. Love this recipe. Makes me crave Neapolitan ice cream."},{"user":"Mixepic","text":"A really good strawberry cream flavor. If you put your mind to it I suppose you could get some chocolate in there, but not really. The 2% sweetener is pretty high, but that's the point.
