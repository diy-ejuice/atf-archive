I've been through several different recipes and revised this one several times but I finally have it where I want it. The blueberry is light. Not overpowering. The cheesecake blends so well with the icecream with only a note of the graham crust and the icecream is delicious with the addition of sweet and bavarian creams. I've made it in the past with tpa sweetener but it doesn't compare to caps super sweet IMO. I love this mix and I hope you will too!","steep_days":"7","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:49:11.000-05:00","best_vg":"65%","views":"1943","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Blueberry (extra)","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":6000},{"name":"Blueberry (wild)","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Bilberry","vendor":"FA","millipercent":500},{"name":"New York Cheesecake","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Cheesecake (graham Crust)","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Vanilla Bean Ice Cream","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Vanilla Cupcake","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Sweet Cream","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Bavarian Cream","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Super Sweet","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":500}],"reviews":[{"user":"cdaniell30","text":"Solid cheesecake a la mode base, topped with a killer blueberry syrup."}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"36988","name":"B.B.
