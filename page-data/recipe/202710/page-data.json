I utilized FA Raspberry and TFA Raspberry Sweet to produce a vivid raspberry flavor that isn't too natural and \"watery\". While it's not particularly deep, it's a great base for a popsicle flavor. Next, I layed in the lime, which is the second dominating accent note. VT Persian Lime + MB Green Lime produce a very tart and bright lime flavor that sits right next to the raspberry, rather than on top of it. Lastly, I filled out the finish with FW Blood Orange, and used Menthol to add a light mint note to the mix.\r\n\r\nLive Mixing:\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hE9u1yLJBH4","steep_days":"1 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":4,"updated_at":"2020-12-12T18:30:59.000-05:00","best_vg":"60%","views":"1260","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Blood Orange","flavor_id":"1197","vendor":"FW","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Green Lime","flavor_id":"1527","vendor":"MB","millipercent":500},{"name":"Persian Lime","flavor_id":"8942","vendor":"VT","millipercent":500},{"name":"Berryl (raspberry)","flavor_id":"412","vendor":"FA","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Raspberry (sweet)","flavor_id":"267","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":3500},{"name":"Aroma Arctic Winter (menthol Artic)","flavor_id":"514","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Super Sweet","flavor_id":"2384","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":500}],"reviews":[{"user":"Toasty","text":"Great recipe!
