This is pretty damn close to being dead on. Cap GC is needed for the cinnamon cracker. Cookie is used to just add a bit of crisp to the cracker. FA custard is perfect for the curd base as the lemon note in it helps round it all out. The lemons should be pretty obvious and the RF custard is fantastic to not add too much egginess. I used TPA sweetener as the EM in it will help tame some of the sharp notes, but feel free to sub for you sweetener of choice. Give it 3 days and let the magic begin.
