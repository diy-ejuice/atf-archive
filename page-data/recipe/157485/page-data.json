But in the honor of celebrating diversity, i've given this a go - and I LOVE IT. \r\n\r\nWell done Molinberry, this concentrate is a banger. \r\n\r\nMB Cactus Cupcake - This is the hero in the mix, with it distinct but not overboard caky cactus notes\r\nPUR Yellow Cake - To boost the cake notes, what a lovely yellow cake. \r\nWF Buttercream Frosting SC - Add some buttercream frosting and butter notes that completes this mix. \r\n\r\nYes this is a bakery good off the shake.
