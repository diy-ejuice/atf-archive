Or I'm pretty sure it's called Green Candy at Chefs. Anyway, I tried it and thought it was like a better version of CAP Green Apple Hard Candy. To me the apple flavour is better and you don't have to use it at a crazily high %. It does the hard candy texture really well. I've heard the folks on Noted describe some hard candy flavours as 'glossy' and it is definitely that. \r\n\r\nI wanted to experiment with the flavour so I thought it made sense to try it in ConcreteRiver's Camp Tigerclaw. I just subbed the CAP Green Apple Hard Candy for WF Whatever It's Called and it turned out pretty great. There is already a fair amount of sucralose in the WF so I reduced the amount of CAP SS used. It's maybe not quite as sweet as Camp Tigerclaw, but it's still pretty sweet for me. I found that the sweetener was dampening the sourness so I tried to balance getting the sweetness without losing too much of the tartness.
