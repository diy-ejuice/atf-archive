A little dry, maybe, but there was no expectation of a moist cookie just from looking at the ingredients used.

I like the way Sugar Cookie and Marzipan give it a dense yet fluffy body and the custard sort of smooths things out and bridges the flavors and textures. I can see why the Acetyl Pyrazine was used (brought in there to give it some texture), but I'm not a big fan of the flavor on acetyl pyrazine and typically use it a little lower, so that's why I knocked it a star (maybe some FA Cookie in it's place?). Other than that, this is an excellent recipe and good vape!","score":4},{"user":"Bogey_Again","text":"Simple almond cookie? Yes but than's why it tastes so good! Good enough to go back and mix 60ml after the first test batch.","score":5}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"3908","name":"Simple Almond Cookie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
