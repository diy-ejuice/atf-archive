The FA Stark Apple sits right up front with its sweet red delicious/ honey crisp flavor.  The INW Two Apples rides right in the middle with the FW Green Apple and delivers a tart but refreshing finish. This recipe is so simple,well balanced, and would pair wonderfully with a cider beer or a blended whiskey on ice in the summer time. Great job Sam, you hit a homerun on this one.
