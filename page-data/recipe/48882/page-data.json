I add TPA Red Licorice to give more of that gum texture and adds more to the bubblegum flavor. Marshmallow helps round out the more tropical side of papaya. I'm not done with this recipe but I'm releasing this now in hope of getting some help with making the flavor a little louder. Could be as simple is going higher in the papaya and cactus but would like to see what others might have to contribute as well.","steep_days":"1 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-12T00:40:34.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"2088","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Papaya","flavor_id":"252","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Cactus","flavor_id":"647","vendor":"INW","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Marshmallow","flavor_id":"332","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Red Licorice","flavor_id":"335","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Super Sweet","flavor_id":"2384","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":300}],"reviews":[{"user":"MotherPunker","text":"ever tried adding TPA dragon fruit?
