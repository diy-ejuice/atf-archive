This here is a pretty simple profile ! But it's delicious !! FW Fruity Rings create the froot loops flavor and is the perfect choice for this mix ! TFA Vanilla bean Ice cream and TFA Vanilla swirl create the milkshake. TFA Toasted Marshmallow helps add a little Malted Flavor to the entire mix and TFA Whipped Cream adds a nice light creamy whipped cream on top of the shake !!  Mix it up, leave feedback !!!!! Thanks !!!!!
