I will tell you though that although it's only 1 profile it did take some negotiation to get this to where I liked it combining a few orange flavours and other little teasers that combined together to create a simple but tasty vape that's juicy, refreshing and icy cold.\r\n\r\nSo I guess it's time to bore the shit out of you with some info and notes, skip to the recipe if you ain't bothered.\r\n\r\nFW blood orange\r\n\r\nThis is the base of the profile it's an excellent orange that does somewhat need pushing more towards the higher percentages. This works for the top end of a orange drink it's bold authentic and plenty juicy to build upon.\r\n\r\nCap sweet tangerine \r\n\r\nThis added more sweetness and juice to the blood orange it melds together to combine more authenticity to the orange. Go to high and it starts getting towards a candy but at 2% it's enough.\r\n\r\nFA mandarin \r\n\r\nBy far the most authentic of the 3 so we need this in here it adds some freshness to the orange and more zest we want a refreshing drink here and by adding this it adds that zest and accents the bolder orange flavours. \r\n\r\nTfa Dragonfruit \r\n\r\nWe all know how good dragonfruit is for blending together fruits it's no exception here it really pops the orange flavours and acts as a emulsifier.\r\n\r\nTfa marshmallow \r\n\r\nA little here really calms them citrus notes and takes away any harshness you might detect while smoothing the vape out.\r\n\r\nINW cactus \r\n\r\nIt's a drink for gods sake we want that wet feeling when we drink so it has to be included I detected this in the original juice you get that infamous cactus note.\r\n\r\nCap super sweet \r\n\r\nThis flavour is in all premium juices so if we're trying to get close then let's not forget premium liquids go to staple ingredient.\r\n\r\nWS-23\r\n\r\nA new kid on the block when it comes to cooling effects and this stuff is the shit don't be scared by the 2% it works and is as close to the original liquid in terms of cooling.\r\n\r\nThat's it mix this up and enjoy love it like I love you xx\r\n\r\nSHAKE N VAPE\r\nBEST AFTER 3 DAYS \r\n\r\n\r\n","steep_days":"3 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":4.6,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:49:08.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"41409","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Dragonfruit","flavor_id":"226","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":750},{"name":"Blood Orange","flavor_id":"1197","vendor":"FW","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Sweet Tangerine","flavor_id":"123","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Tanger (mandarin)","flavor_id":"547","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Cactus","flavor_id":"647","vendor":"INW","millipercent":300},{"name":"Marshmallow","flavor_id":"332","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Super Sweet","flavor_id":"2384","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":500},{"name":"WS-23","flavor_id":"8085","vendor":"OTHR","millipercent":2000}],"reviews":[{"user":"thefogvlog","text":"This is amazing! "},{"user":"RuntDastardly","text":"Hot damn, this is sensational! Mixed on 4/26 and tried it on 4/29 and I am completely smitten. (Full disclosure; I dropped the Super Sweet down to .25% because I've found any higher ruins my enjoyment, and I opted for 1% of the WS-23, because, honestly, I was a little scared of that 2%.) Great, sweet, juicy orange taste. Also, this is my first experience with WS-23. I've tried every other coolant up until now, and truly disliked them all. It's great to finally find one that actually works for me! So orangey and refreshing! I love it!"},{"user":"beeker","text":"This is a delicious juice. However, I think Funta may be slightly better in my book. This shouldn't take anything away from this juice, but if you like this juice, I suggest you mix up Funta as well to see which you prefer. These two juices made me totally forget about the lemonades I loved, as they hit a similar sweet cooling citrus note and taste better to me. Thanks for the great juice, the orange soda profile is delicious!"},{"user":"ObiWanCannoli","text":"This has earned the spot of my favorite Orange/Citrus recipe. Excellent work sir. The orange is vibrant, juicy, and bold. seems just a tad weaker than expected but that may be due to using this recipe in a large RDA with some big alien coils, and experiencing some flavor muting due to the higher percentages of multiple orange concentrates. Im sure this recipe would be a great MTL vape and I suspect it would be awesome on a smaller RDA like a Hadaly. Will have to mix up a new bottle to test this theory as my first 30ml barely lasted a day. To boot, this recipe is smoooooth considering all of the citrus concentrates. A must mix recipe!"},{"user":"Censored23","text":"Been one of my ADV's since it was posted."},{"user":"Kudo","text":"This is amazing. A little too sweet for me but hey, its a remix of a commercial juice. I'll try leaving out the super sweet next time"},{"user":"BuryMeInSmoke","text":"Mixed with 1% TFA Koolada in place of WS-23.  Nice recipe, very similar to Fanta, a touch more realistic orange than straight chemical-orange.  Would recommend against using TFA Koolada though - gives it a bit of 'orange juice after brushing your teeth' vibe - I assume WS23 is a bit cleaner in that respect. "},{"user":"Chased2Deth","text":""},{"user":"KenWhitfield","text":"I was nicely surprised by this recipe. The cooling at 2% was a little high for me, but liked it more using only 1%.  Very inventive use of the flavors to get the end result that you created, bravo!"},{"user":"Asire","text":"Amazing orange soda blend. Really no throat hit though it contains a lot of citric aromas which can cause that sometimes. Everybody how is not so much into cold vapes should really consider cutting the WS 23 down thats how i like the recipe the most"},{"user":"TheDrStore","text":"This stuff is soooo good. You managed to get most vendors to import ws23. You nailed this profile and it's been a ADV for me. "},{"user":"Deweysuds","text":"Nice orange drink flavor.  A fairly authentic orange soda flavor, but kind of flat like you opened a can and left it out for a bit.  Granted getting that fizzy effervesce is a unicorn and no one has quite nailed it.  I believe there would be a couple directions to try, but would mess with the orange soda flavor.  I believe the oranges are blended great to give the fanta profile.  My only draw back is that is gets a bit powdery on me at times which effects it‚Äôs authenticity.  Take this with a grain of salt though because I‚Äôve yet to make my own orange mix or any other recipe that I would want to vape more than 15ml.  This is the best one I‚Äôve tried so far.  "},{"user":"SweetPoisonKim","text":"Bloody loving this straight off the bat! Tastes just like an ice cold Fanta; without the diabetes!  Great for this hot weather. Another excellent recipe; Simply Fantastic! "},{"user":"kindground","text":"Great recipe! Just what I was looking for in a summer vape. I'll be mixing a 120ml of this for sure. I dropped the CAP SS and Koolada percentages a bit for my personal tastes and it's just right. "},{"user":"ChefJohn","text":"A great recipe Daz. Wonderful notes as normal. &#xD;\nGreat flavor. I was scared of 4% blood orange, but it's wonderfully balanced. &#xD;\nSmooth with a touch of tingling. &#xD;\n"},{"user":"inrespekkt","text":"Dude dat WS-23... hit me like a truck. Almost felt like brain freeze at first and indeed it settled down nicely. The orange is orangy without being sour - 1% CAP Super Sweet makes it pleasantly sweet. I have a hard time getting any off-notes here, which doesn't happen that often with my palate."},{"user":"Darklyspectr","text":"I have never tried the original juice this was based on. But this is a delicious fantaish recipe. tastes like a fanta ice pop. WS2-3 has become my favorite cooling ingredient because of this. A+ recipe. must try. the damn brit does it again."}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"32883","name":"Fantastic.........üçä A FANTASIA REMIX üçä"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
