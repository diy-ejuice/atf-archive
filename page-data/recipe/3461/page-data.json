I can taste the raw kind of sweet poptart dough in there as well. Imo its really accurate to the profile this recipe is going for. Will probably mix this one up again if im ever craving a poptart flavor. Great replacement for the real deal. "},{"user":"yeahIvape","score":"5","text":"This is GREAT, spot on for raw poptart . Thank you!"},{"user":"heatbbx","score":"5","text":"Mixed this up a long time ago and forgot to review, but this is DAMN good. Tastes like a raw pop tart spot on. Good stuff."},{"user":"altneurose","score":"4","text":"A raw sort of pop-tart, and that Pie Crust is killing me, but definitely a sb pop-tart nonetheless, and a delicious one."},{"user":"mlNikon","score":"5","text":"This is great Vurve! I love how the dry flaky pastry is balanced with that delicious jammy strawberry. I haven't tried your simpler version but this one is one that made it to a large bottle."},{"user":"LB","score":"5","text":"This is a pretty decent attempt at a pop-tart.  I was more curious as to how this would accurately represent a pop-tart because I've never had a good one that mimics the real thing. I'd say this tastes more like a pop-tart before its been toasted.  Kind of has that raw pastry taste. It's a good way to have a strawberry vape but mix it up from the millions of strawberries and cream we've all had."}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"3461","name":"Strawberry Poptart"}}}
