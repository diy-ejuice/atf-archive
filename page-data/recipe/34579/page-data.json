Apple pie has nice bakery notes with a bit of apple shining through and the zeppola takes it to the next level with more powdered sugar, cakeyness and a bit of greasy feel.\r\n\r\nFuji is just boosting our apple note to the front. \r\n\r\nJF Yellow Cake and TPA Bavarian cream here to round everything out. Yellow cake gives just a bit more body without taking away from anything and bavarian cream complements the apple with its darker sweetness. These two kind of unify the zeppola and apple pie into a fritter. (sub CAP yellow cake 1%, FW at .5%). could see sugar cookie working for this purpose but I didn't want it to mute anything or take it too far into cookie land.\r\n\r\nA touch of caramel for good measure.\r\n\r\nHonestly works as S&V but let it chill out  for a couple days","steep_days":"4","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"updated_at":"2020-12-12T09:12:33.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"2788","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Zeppola","flavor_id":"6312","vendor":"FA","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Apple Pie","flavor_id":"551","vendor":"FA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Fuji","flavor_id":"506","vendor":"FA","millipercent":900},{"name":"Yellow Cake","flavor_id":"4560","vendor":"JF","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Bavarian Cream","flavor_id":"145","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Carmel (caramel)","flavor_id":"503","vendor":"FA","millipercent":500}],"reviews":[{"user":"cincinnatiking","text":"Excellent recipe!","score":5},{"user":"cdaniell30","text":"It's like a donut made of apple pies, or an apple pie with a zeppola crust.
