The recipe reaches its full potential after 5+ days.\r\n\r\nEnjoy!","steep_days":"5 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"total_reviews":1,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:51:03.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"1143","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Sweet Tea","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":6000},{"name":"Tea Green","vendor":"FA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Bergamot","vendor":"FA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Cactus","vendor":"INW","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Italian Lemon Sicily","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1100},{"name":"Sour","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":200},{"name":"Super Sweet","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":300},{"name":"WS-23","vendor":"OTHR","millipercent":600}],"reviews":[{"user":"Parad0x357","score":"5","text":"Very accurate to the profile and absolutely tasty. I increased the WS-23 and left the super sweet out. In my opinion it's sweet enough on it's own.&#xD;\nBy the way: While i was mixing a second batch of this I accidentally mixed it with 0.5% FA Aurora instead of 0.5% FA Bergamot (made aw juices at the same time and grabbed the wrong bottle). Also very good, gives the recipe even more of that citrus bite. But the bergamont is far more authentic to the profile, I have to admit."}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"159340","name":"Das Grüne - \"Der Grüne\" Clone (Green Iced Tea with Cactus and Lemon)"}}}
