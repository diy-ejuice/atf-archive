There are countless versions of this dynamic duo, but this one is mine. I'm very happy with how this turned out, and after many, MANY versions, this is the one I keep coming back to.  We've got rich vanilla custard with cinnamon and subtle notes of caramelized brown sugar and honey. Then come in the crunchy cookie graham crackers. Thick and dense, these two partners make one hell of a team. The profile is simple for the most part, but I had a blast working in different concentrates to really fill this vape out into something I'm quite proud of. Most of these flavors you will find carry a dark sweetness that I am very fond of, and I think it helps fit the theme nicely.\r\n\r\n\r\nI really like bending bakeries. I could never seem to get graham cracker right, though. I tried so many graham cracker combinations and they all fell short. I could never get that crunch that I wanted. I needed that texture. So I decided to invite FA Cookie to the party. This is a beast of a concentrate when you want that AP heavy crunch. It's kind of dry, but we are dropping those Graham Crackers into custard, right? \r\n\r\n\r\n**FA Cookie** is a crunchy bakery 'cookie’ base that works very well to build our graham cracker off of. It's definitely AP heavy, and works well as a jump-off point because of its graininess and neutrality. It's dark, and mildly sweet, kind of like my Irish mother.\r\n\r\n\r\nThat's our foundation, folks. Let's start building that bad Larry up. I used two graham crackers in conjunction to the FA Cookie, both serving very different purposes. CAP Graham Cracker brings the cinnamon, and FW Graham Cracker brings some more crunch, with a touch honey.\r\n\r\n\r\n**CAP Graham Cracker** has a decently strong bakery cinnamon sweetness, some people find it off-putting, but I personally love it once it settles down a bit. You are going to get some butter, and a slight graininess from this concentrate which is helpful to build on that cookie base. This thang tastes pretty authentic to me, almost like they were homemade and baked. These graham crackers came out of the oven, not out of a box. This concentrate needs help in the crunch department, and that's why we are also using FA Cookie and FW Graham Cracker.\r\n\r\n\r\n**FW Graham Cracker** is hands down my favorite GC. If I had to only pick one, this is it. You ever had Honey Maid Graham Crackers? You know, the ones that come in sheets and you have to break apart? These are them. Definitely sweet, definitely cookie-like, and it packs that punchy crunchy. It also brings some honey, which is awesome in combination with CAP's offering. These 3 bakeries working together create our graham cracker cookie. It's tasty, and in my opinion a very clear representation of a solid graham cracker to crumble up into our custard.\r\n\r\n\r\nCustard is so bomb. They are easily my favorite profile and I absolutely love tinkering with new ways to elevate them. This custard base seems pretty standard, but each ingredient was chosen very deliberately to help bolster our graham cracker. Let's start with the custard base, no surprise here, CAP Vanilla Custard.\r\n\r\n\r\n**CAP Vanilla Custard** is universally accepted as a solid canvas to paint upon when it comes to developing a custard recipe, and there is no exception here. It's eggy. It's rich and buttery. It's thick, creamy and sweet. I didn't want to bring it too high, because that depth and intrigue was going to come from our *cream* and *vanilla* addition. I like taking a custard and accentuating it with the proper cream, and the proper vanilla. It just works.\r\n\r\n\r\n**DIYFS Holy Vanilla** found it's home here because I decided I wanted to keep things *dark*. It's a superb vanilla. Malty and creamy with a tad of spice that leans towards extract. Crack them beans, baby. The rich vanilla sinks into the custard and thickens it up, all while bringing a maltiness that plays off not only the custard base, but the graham cracker. It helps bring dimension and clarity to the graham cracker which helps deliver a more accurate end product. Nothing too out of the box with this one, it just fits.\r\n\r\n\r\n**INW Creme Brulee** is what sets this custard apart for me. I mean honestly, this is just another custard, but it has this delectable brown sugar note accompanied by creamy vanilla. It's not quite *burnt* but more of a bubbly caramelization of sugar. It again, not only brings depth to our custard, but our graham cracker as well. Brown sugar and custard? Sign me up. Sticky brown sugar graham crackers in a delicious vanilla custard? Put me in coach. \r\n\r\n\r\nAnd there you have it. Crunchy, crumbly graham crackers and a robust vanilla custard sure to satisfy you bakery heads like me. Hope you enjoy.\r\n\r\n---Silky---","steep_days":"14","temperature":"0","recipe_score":4,"updated_at":"2020-12-12T10:34:38.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"4513","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Vanilla Custard","flavor_id":"131","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":5000},{"name":"Creme Brulee (yc)","flavor_id":"894","vendor":"INW","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Holy Vanilla","flavor_id":"2385","vendor":"DFS","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Cookie","flavor_id":"490","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Graham Cracker","flavor_id":"62","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Graham Cracker","flavor_id":"1297","vendor":"FW","millipercent":2000}],"reviews":[{"user":"bjorama","text":"It is what it says it is.

This is one of those types that you have to make, put it in a cupboard and just let it sit for a month. I tasted it 2 weeks after making it, and it was ahh ok, but man when you let this sit you will pound your head in the wall that you did not make a few 120 ml bottles.. It is REALLY good after a month, even better after 2, like an aged wine, but that was because I made (4) - 120ml bottles the second time.. I wish I could give it 10 stars.. Hats off to the creator... So creamy, buttery smooth custard with melted in graham biting your tongue and tingling the senses.. I LOVE this..!!! 10 stars from me!!!!

It is  thick, rich, full of vanilla, and that touch of cinnamon sets it off. I really love this recipe and will be making more. Thanks for sharing it! Also, thank you for turning me on to one of the most underrated flavors, which is FW Graham Cracker.","score":5}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"137878","name":"Graham Cracker Custard"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
