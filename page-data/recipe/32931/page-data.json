The first role is for the cookie. It plays along nicely with CAP  SUGAR COOKIE to give the juice that nice cookie texture with the smooth buttery homemade sugar cookie flavor. \r\n\r\nNow for the icing. This is where the CAP CAKE BATTER along with CAP VANILLA CUSTARD, CAP VANILLA CUPCAKE AND LA CREAM CHEESE ICING play together.  I was basing this recipie of sugar cookies my grandmother used to make for the holidays every year and growing up in would always help her. So I put my heart into this one. The flavors for the icing blend together so well it just comes off so smooth.\r\n\r\nSweetener isn't necessarily needed. I just really enjoy it in this recipie. Although you get a good flavor, right after mixing it's not how it's meant to taste. It hits the nail on the head about 7 days after. Hope you all enjoy.
