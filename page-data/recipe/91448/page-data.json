Initially I used this at a higher percentage and it completely took over the mix. So i dialed it back a bit\r\n\r\nINW Shisha Strawberry- is a syrupy strawberry that smells and taste alot like a strawberry jolly rancher to me. \r\n\r\nFLV Native & Kentucky taste very similar to me. Mildly sweet & lightly spiced tobacco with a hint of smoke. But in my experience with FLV tobaccos most tend to fade in a steep so i paired these together\r\n\r\nFLV Cured- the tobacco note in cured taste very similar to kentucky and native, but cured doesnâ€™t have spice that the others have. I also get kind of a syrupy note with Cured which i figured would go well with the shisha flavors. Cured also fades rather quickly if it is not paired with another tobacco \r\n\r\n\r\n","steep_days":"4 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-06T20:43:47.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"944","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Kentucky Blend","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":900},{"name":"Shisha Blackcurrant","vendor":"VT","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Cured Tobacco","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Shisha Strawberry","vendor":"INW","millipercent":1200},{"name":"Native Tobacco","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":900},{"name":"Connecticut Shade","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":200}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"91448","name":"Currant Baccer"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
