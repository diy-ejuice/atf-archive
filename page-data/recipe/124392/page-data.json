INW's dragonfruit is sort of hard to pin down, not the emulsification agent that TFA dragonfruit is, and more of a real fruit flavor. It's a potent one, and it sort of turns things in a unique direction here.\r\n\r\nThe ws-23 is pretty obvious, adding a refreshing chill and really makes this a more spring and summer mix than anything else.","steep_days":"1 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:50:30.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"7232","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Bilberry","flavor_id":"533","vendor":"FA","millipercent":2700},{"name":"Blueberry","flavor_id":"1201","vendor":"FW","millipercent":2700},{"name":"Peach White","flavor_id":"543","vendor":"FA","millipercent":2700},{"name":"Peach (juicy)","flavor_id":"254","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2700},{"name":"Dragon Fruit - Pitaya","flavor_id":"652","vendor":"INW","millipercent":1500},{"name":"WS-23","flavor_id":"8085","vendor":"OTHR","millipercent":1000}],"reviews":[{"user":"nowar","text":"The parallel here to grack juice is instantaneous, a fruit medley that defies description and is cold af. I was worried about the 1% ws23 as a person who likes ws but rarely ever uses it. I went with the original recipe and was certainly glad I did. Yes, it's cold. That's about all i can tell you without using an analogy of some sort. The fruits have mingled to where I can't pin a single one down. This is my first try with INW Pitaya so, im gonna chalk up the overall funkiness to that and being backed up by some sweet blue and stone fruit. What I get is akin to what I like about inw cactus without the overpowering strangeness. It's *delicate* strangeness, like the pomelo to the grapefruit.  A sweeter, milder version that is sort of what you want when you dont want to get beat up by flavor. Yet, there's no shortage of it here and the cold almost acts like a flavor itself, which is by far my favorite part. It seems so perfectly in place, even at 1%. Very interesting and unusual recipe, well deserved of 5 stars, because I would certainly mix this again."},{"user":"YippYo","text":"Mmmm yas yas yas very tasty! To me it represents a candy I've had forever ago and forgotten about. Definitely recommend mixing this up. I've already mixed 3 batches ðŸ˜‹"},{"user":"RushG93","text":"\"Tasty\" would be an understatement for this recipe. I'm really enjoying this recipe and there's no doubt I will be mixing this one again. Thanks!"},{"user":"Hexical","text":"An amazing recipe that I just can't seem to put down. It feels like every day I wake up and hit it I get a different taste from it, which is quite interesting. This even somehow hits my itch for blueberry flavours, which is really nice. Can't recommend this recipe enough!"},{"user":"TheJuiceJackBuilt","text":"Great recipe this. Muddled yet distinguishable blueberry on the inhale and peach on the exhale. I love how the dragonfruit  brings the whole recipe together, for a crazy yet delicous taste experience like no other. "},{"user":"RainbowDragon","text":"I'm surprised that there aren't more reviews for this one. Everyone seems to love it. It's weird and good. Sweet peach atop an indistinguishable 'blue' flavor. This one is definitely great for hot summer nights. I had a moment of perfection with this in my tank. Peach sunset over blue mountains. One that you have to try for yourself as describing it with words doesn't do it justice."},{"user":"ID10-T","text":"A delightfully confusing recipe. It's muddled in the best possible way, proving like Grack Juice, Fiestas and Fiascos, Coop's Kiwi Bourbon and a few other notable works of abstract recipe art that something doesn't have to represent a real thing to be tasty as hell. The closest thing I can compare it to... Have you ever bought frozen sliced peaches? You know you don't have to thaw them out, right? You can eat them right out of the freezer for a wonderful summer treat. Now imagine those peaches are blue. Not blueberry + peach, but an alternate universe where some peaches happen to be naturally blue and taste much different, and most agree better, than their yellow brethren. This juice is a trip into that fantasy world and it's a place I want to revisit.  "},{"user":"beeker","text":"This is absolutely delicious! It tastes like an unidentifiable hybrid fruit that you canâ€™t quite place... until you vape another tank. At least thatâ€™s what youâ€™ll use as an excuse for more of this mutant fruit ambrosia. Thanks for the recipe, Iâ€™ll be making lots of this. "}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"124392","name":"Blue Eyes White Dragon"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
