I do agree with Dave that the Sweet Guava would work better than the Honey Peach. I guess I have blown my cold receptors off vaping all this WS-23 for my ADES recipe. That the koolada isn’t that noticeable to me. I also usually hate Cap Super Sweet and sweeteners in general, but it works in here. I figured it would be overly sweet with all the fruits and bubble gums, but it isn’t. The bubble gum itself taste like Classic Old School Pink Gum. Which it kind of weird at first when combined with tropical fruits, but the more I vaped of it the more I liked it."},{"user":"ID10-T","score":"4","text":"This is nice! It’s the best thing I’ve had with koolada in it in a really long time. It’s making this very refreshing, and the sort of artificiality of it actually seems to fit well with the profile. I don’t really taste any of these fruits in particular, more just a juicy interesting tropical fruit addition to bubblegum. It tastes like the color pinkish orange made in to a vape. The flavor is a bit odd with the mix of tropical fruitiness and classic pink gum together, but it’s dig-ably odd, not ew yuck odd. Mouthfeel is working for me as it’s thick yet juicy, kind of like gum, with a smooth texture. The one thing I might try, not saying this would definitely be an improvement but it might be worth a try, is adding some CAP Sweet Guava or replacing the JF Honey Peach with CAP Sweet Guava. That one’s always given me a kind of bubblegummy vibe and it might be a good fit for a tropical fruit gum, while the bit of tartness it has could make the whole thing seem more mouthwatering and juicy and less sticky sweet.
