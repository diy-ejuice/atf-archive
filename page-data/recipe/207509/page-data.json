I think I found their secret recipe.. RY4 Double is the base, I was told that Turkish and Navajo make a good tobacco. The vanilla brings a sweetness and dark creaminess to the mix. The DNB has the ashiness that most tobacco users like.. Can be mixed without the DNB for a softer flavor.   \r\n\r\nTested on a Elder Dragon with a fused clapton 2.5 mm 1.9 ohms, 65 watts power.
