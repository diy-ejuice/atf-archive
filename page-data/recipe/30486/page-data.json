Wrong! Well at first you might...until you tasted this delicious happy accident. This combination is so delightful it will make you question every flavor you thought didn't go together. This milkshake will most definitely bring all the boys to the yard. Enjoy this unusual treat!\r\n\r\nTFA Banana Cream - This flavor makes the perfect banana ice cream to act as an accent or backnote to this mix.You can tell there is banana in your milkshake but it doesn't get in the way of that amazing mint..It is mellow and very creamy and adds to the authenticity of the milkshake. \r\n\r\nFA Cream Fresh - I used this flavor to help boost the creams and give the mix a more milky mouth-feel and flavor. \r\n\r\nFW Creme de Menthe - This is the perfect mint flavor for this mix. It has a soft nuanced creaminess to the mint that just works so well as a milkshake. The slight vanilla notes further add to the accuracy of this milkshake along with the cooling sensation it provides that pushes this mix over the edge into milkshake land. Creme de Menthe also provides most of the sweetness for this recipe and makes it so darn enjoyable to vape.\r\n\r\nCAP French Vanilla - Here we have more vanilla to add to the milkshake, but this flavor does more than just add some vanilla to the mix. It bridges the gap between the starkly different flavors of banana and the mint. So instead of having a scoop of banana ice cream in your mint shake, you have an evenly blended together concoction. \r\n\r\n","steep_days":"0","temperature":"0","recipe_score":4.6,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:49:05.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"7450","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Banana Cream","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":4500},{"name":"Cream Fresh","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1300},{"name":"Cr√àme De Menthe","vendor":"FW","millipercent":3500},{"name":"French Vanilla","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":2000}],"reviews":[{"user":"ianerb","text":"good from the get go but on the second batch added another scoop of banana and now it paces the mint better for me"},{"user":"HerrHut","text":"I'm not really a fan of mint vapes.  But surprisingly my 30ml tester was empty pretty fast.  So this must be good.  And it is.  Good job!"},{"user":"MECH_MOD_RN","text":"was buying some flavors on Bull city and  saw your mix on  and thought .. this is either going to be banging or not so much .. but had to give it a try ..  and BAM  it is so elegantly balanced.. each flavor  contributes  you get the mint on the front end that transitions with the french van.  to the  sweet banana finish all in a nice dense creamy vape.     really well done..  I love when a simple recipe can be as lovely as this .   really hit its stride at about 5 days.. and did not find any muddling of flavors at month   TY  cheers!  "},{"user":"sp0di","text":"So, was a little scared at mixing this one up, but all the parts came in the Awesome box, so I figured what the hell.  Gotta tell ya, it's not one that I would have thought of in a LONG time.  The cream blend is there, but I don't think I would put it in the Milkshake category, but that is very subjective.  It's a nice smooth vape with just a hint of mint, which I guess it to be expected.  Oh yeah, and the ever slight touch of Banana. &#xD;\n&#xD;\nNice combo - keep them coming..."},{"user":"shyndo","text":"Fantastic Vape. It's dense rich and creamy mint and banana and it hits the fucking spot. As I drip this I get more banana and as my wicks start to dry out I get more mint. It helps keep it interesting. The balance is perfect, the flavor isn't too strong to adv. Highly recommend this."},{"user":"Huckabees","text":"This is so delicious. It tastes exactly like a milkshake and the flavours go so well together that I'm gonna make a real shake like this. Only downside is that after a while the flavours kind of blend too much and become a bit muddled and it tastes a bit like bubble gum or something. 5 stars as a shake and vape, 4 stars otherwise."},{"user":"Dalpho","text":"I really like this juice, I'm a banana fan but I couldn't ever find a ejuice banana I really liked. With this banana cream plus mint it's a wonderful combo, the banana is not over powered at all the mint keeps it toned down to a slight back hin and the mint it's self is not overly strong nothing like a menthol juice. It's really like taking sips out of a milkshake. I'm a big fan of this. Thanks"},{"user":"laurie9300","text":"Thank you for this recipe mlNikon, I mixed it up EXACTLY to the recipe. These flavours definitely go well together, the creams do a great job of taming the mint. The mint also does a good job of taking away the \"runt candy\" notes from the banana. For me, the balance is still a little \"mint heavy\", but on occasion I got hints of the banana, which was a nice surprise, this may be related to my particular atty/build. I'm definitely mixing this again, but I'll try to swing the balance a little more towards the banana. Thanks again for posting."},{"user":"Bogey_Again","text":"This is delicious! Generally speaking I'm not a banana vape fan but I decided to give it a try because of how weird the combination sounded. This is the first TFA banana cream mix I have ever liked. Great job!"}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"30486","name":"Here Come The Boys"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
