We use it here at a half a percent and it clearly shines through the rest of the flavors. \r\n\r\nWe build upon the coconut with  0.25% FA Coconut. \r\n\r\nFlv lemon grass. \r\nThis flavor is the most powerful flavor I've ever used. Period. \r\nIt's literally 1 drop per 120ml bottle. \r\nThe lemon grass is a wonderful flavor, light citrus, rich earthyness with out overpowering everything. \r\nIf you don't have this, it can be removed. Just don't sub it with anything. It'll ruin the balance. \r\n\r\n\r\nHS ice cream. \r\nThis complements our cream base and gives us a wonderful full mouth feel. \r\nIced Thai tea is a very rich and thick drink. HS ice cream gives us that feeling and is delicious. \r\n\r\nFA Fresh cream. \r\nOur main milk base. It's rich enough to shine though the bully flavors and maintain the creaminess we need for a real Thai tea. \r\n\r\nINW vanilla shisha. \r\nA wonderful compliment to this recipe. \r\nIt's bold and thick. Light vanilla notes add to the complexity. \r\n\r\nCap super sweet. \r\nCitric acid helps this mix, you can sub any sweetener you want. But SS is the best here in my opinion. \r\nWe need it sweet for authenticity. \r\n\r\nLive mixing video! \r\nhttps://youtu.be/fWcDl3MTSzs\r\n\r\nSupport me on Patreon! \r\nEvery dime go to bring you more content and recipes! \r\nÂ https://www.patreon.com/ChefJohnWK\r\n\r\n\r\nJoin the Facebook group! \r\nhttps://www.facebook.com/groups/eatsleepmixrepeat/\r\n\r\nCheck out the website for more! \r\nWww.esmrdiyvapes.com ","steep_days":"1 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:49:14.000-05:00","best_vg":"100%","views":"3563","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Thai Chai","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":500},{"name":"Lemon Grass","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":50},{"name":"Ice Cream","vendor":"HS","millipercent":500},{"name":"Cream Fresh","vendor":"FA","millipercent":250},{"name":"Shisha Vanilla","vendor":"INW","millipercent":500},{"name":"Super Sweet","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":250},{"name":"Coco' (coconut)","vendor":"FA","millipercent":250}],"reviews":[{"user":"tw2k","text":"I hadn't much luck creating a well rounded recipe with FLV Thai Chai. Now I don't have too, because this is fantastic. To me it tastes just like the Thai Chai that's sold in 16oz white cans. Thank you."},{"user":"Hawger03","text":"Awesome recipe.  I mixed this up in the middle of April and just finishing a 120 of it here in July.  The flavors hold up and the vape is still great.  Could use a touch more lemon grass as I don't taste much of the lemon.  Great recipe John"},{"user":"MopHead","text":""}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"39397","name":"Dis Thai Tea Doe"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
