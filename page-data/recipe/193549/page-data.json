May the 4th be with you and within that them we all know Yoda was a dusty old fart.  Guy, thing, whatever thought he knew everything.  Well he completely ignored the revival of the Sith until it was too late.  He was farting out dust by the time he met baby face Luke Skywalker.\r\n\r\nThis is a simple Sour Green Apple Fundip.  \r\n\r\nFor the apple I used the ingenious combo of TFA(Tart Green Apple) with Cap Double Apple and FLV Apple to start.  Boxer and Tes really nailed this combination and I decided to kick up the apple with the FM Green Apple.  \r\n\r\nNext we need to dust this shit up and I used the WF Pixie Candy combined with OOO Powdered sugar to give us that grainy dusty old fart flavor.\r\n\r\nThe WF Sourball Candy helps with the sour, but also gives us some fundip stick vibe to it.  Enjoy!","steep_days":"0 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"total_reviews":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T22:34:10.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"825","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Apple (Tart Green Apple)","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1250},{"name":"Double Apple","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Sour Apple","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Sour Ball Candy SC","vendor":"WF","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Green Apple","vendor":"FM","millipercent":1750},{"name":"Powdered Sugar","vendor":"OOO","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Pixie Stick Candy SC","vendor":"WF","millipercent":1250}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"193549","name":"Dusty Yoda Farts"}}}
