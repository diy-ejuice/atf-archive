I never use more than 0.5 personally but, if you the sugar lips type ramp it up.\r\n\r\nEnjoy","steep_days":"7 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"total_reviews":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-02T15:38:27.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"1036","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Strawberry Sweet","vendor":"JF","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Red Touch (strawberry)","vendor":"FA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Peach","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Peach White","vendor":"FA","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Jelly Candy","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Super Sweet","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":500}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"172746","name":"BerryPeach Jelly"}}}
