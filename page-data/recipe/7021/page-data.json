Seriously, I love rediscovering how great this is every summer. Love you, dude! &#xD;\n&#xD;\nI'm a big fan of this mixer's Fresh Lemonade recipe, and I couldn't have imagined loving anything as much, but this version is so sweet, satisfying and incredibly balanced. A little less intense than it's fresh counterpart, this recipe has just enough creamy vanilla sweetness to give it some body, but it's not too heavy for a hot summer's day. Perfect in every way.","score":5},{"user":"Chewymidget","text":"Disclaimer, I've never tried the frosted lemonade shake from Chick-Fil-A. &#xD;\n&#xD;\nThis is really well done. It has my favorite lemonade base and favorite flavors for a shake. What's not to love?&#xD;\nThe cream's here aren't too thick and the lemons aren't sharp. The problem for most lemonade flavors are they contain citric acid, creating a sour taste and clash with creams. I have dabbled with LA Lemonade with creams and it usually ends with a clear distinction between the lemonade and the creams. The magic with a mix like this is the lemons. You can create a lemonade flavor that blends with creams or sharpen it to make a fruit lemonade profile.&#xD;\n","score":5},{"user":"PhyllisRae","text":"","score":0},{"user":"CygnusY1","text":"Loved this recipe. Definitely needs more than 2 days steep. I added 1% vanilla shisha to dial up the vanilla notes and to accent the lemons more. The weird things is that some people have said the lemon is too strong. Not for me. horses for courses as they say.","score":5},{"user":"CatWillMew","text":"Good stuff, but I think it needs a longer steep than recommended.  Going to try it with the Koolada next.","score":5},{"user":"Philosaphucker","text":"I added a few drops of Koolada. After 4 days, this becomes amazing. Nice simple, delicious, and satisfying recipe.","score":5}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"7021","name":"Frosted Lemonade"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
