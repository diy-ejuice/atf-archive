Just felt I had to note immediately that this is insanely good. Luckily I mixed 80ml, so I'm hoping I'll be able to keep it around long enough to see how it steeps over 14 days. Very grateful that you shared this, Em! Thank you.  Update: I made it to day 14 with just a few drops left. FLV Sweet Dough definitely builds with time, like you say. This is masterful mixing. "},{"user":"Ebc88","score":"5","text":"I steeped for 3 weeks wish i would made a 60ml instead of 30. So i could give it a longer steep. Excellent job and thanks for sharing "},{"user":"nowar","score":"4","text":"My palate may be too numb to pick up on the doughy parts. That said, this is a smooth creamy satisfying vape. Nothing obtrusive, well balanced, and easily vaped all day long. "},{"user":"cultureviolet","score":"5","text":"Taking the advice of Pudding,Alf I mixed up a 60mL... and let me say this is absolutely, superlatively divine! The evolution of the steep is a course-style delectable ride from buttery flaky croissant to its deeep sweet doughier daughta. &#xD;\nA rich, *true* bakery treat; the mouthfeel here coats the surface and just keeps getting better and better succeeding in the impression of buttery and fried... I'm finding myself audibly lipsmacking =P finna get more steeping immediately. Great use of obvious talent here, the execution is flawless, it's my great pleasure to expect more from you! &#xD;\nProtip: this goes swimmingly well with some chocolate pu erh+spicy red dragon chai or tea/coffee of your choice. Go crazy, experiment with pairings. I'm addicted to croissants IRL, just incredibly inspiring stuff here, maybe I can displace some of those calories lol."},{"user":"ID10-T","score":"5","text":"My goodness this is heavenly! After a long steep it tastes just like that picture, matches the description perfectly. Don't let the low amount of overall flavoring trick you into thinking this might be lightly flavored. It's so rich and buttery I can't ADV it; it would be like eating dessert all day long. But paired with that mid-morning pick-me-back-up coffee or after dinner? Abso-freakin-lutey! Easily one of the best recipes I've tried all year. "},{"user":"AlfredPudding","score":"5","text":"Please do yourself a favor and make a large bottle of this so you will have no choice but to let it steep. I've been testing it every three days and it seriously grows exponentially better each time. The combination of WF Croissant and FLV Sweet Dough is absolutely fantastic. If you try it early you'll get much more of the buttery croissant, which is by no means a bad thing. However, if you can manage to hold off, the sweet dough will come forward and create a truly magnificent cronut. The mixture of Vienna Cream and Vanilla Cream Extra makes the perfect filling for this dessert, and the cream is firmly planted in the center of the outstanding bakery profile. &#xD;\n"},{"user":"NaCHeF","score":"5","text":"We are not worthy Emily! I have to admit that when I first saw the 7.5% total flavoring I thought it would be more light but for my surprise this is a flavorful, perfectly balanced mix. I love how FLV Sweet Dough is used like a bridge between the croissant and the cream, adding that sweet dark syrup and also making the bakery more rich and full. Thank you for this clever and delicious recipe Em!"}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"115532","name":"Vanilla Cronut"}}}
