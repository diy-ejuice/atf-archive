This is not a fruity vape, it's more of a full cheesecake with just a little fruit to make it more interesting! \r\nI've seen people using FA Dragonfruit on a higher percentage than what I use on this recipe, but I find it to be overpowering over everything else when you use it higher, making it hard to balance it when you want to create a fruity vibrant mix, making it difficult to mix it with other fruits. But with all the problems it can create, it is a really realistic and tasty dragonfruit.

Mentally separating the two parts isn't easy, but when do it, that cheesecake base is absolutely delicious... But itâ€™s quite buttery, and the buttery flavor up against that hibiscus-like floral from the dragon fruits floral makes me nauseated. I've thought in the past that maybe any cream with a lot of dragon fruit needs to be a light cream, now I'm more convinced of that. But, I'd love to see this exact cheesecake base with a different topping. ","score":3}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"154195","name":"Dragonfruit Cheesecake"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
