This is very close in profile IMO and If you like S&C, try this and you won't be disappointed. Feel free to swap the TPA Strawberry with Straw Ripe for a brighter version that's just as good. I also must stress you try the original for yourself...

I did do it with Ripe instead and got to say it was very good not to strong on the strawberry more a lighter strawberry not flavor. I actually really enjoy this flavor a lot. I don't know if I will ever try the real version unless Wayne releases the recipe as I don't usally buy one shots. But overall this was a very great flavor. Well done.

I'm going to mix a bigger bottle now and let it sit for a few days. "}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"51239","name":"Rose Milk REMIX"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
