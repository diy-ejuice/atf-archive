Admittedly this is far more heavy on the caramel than the coffee but so is the one from the fast food joint that I modeled it after.  I used the FLV-Toffee and the VT-Toffee Ice Cream to add some darker layers to the Caramel.  The VT-Toffee Ice Cream also helps to thicken it up a bit.   The FW-Butterscotch accents the brighter caramel notes as  I wanted a full range of caramel lushness in this one.  The WF-Brazilian Coffee adds a bit of coffee to the mix along with the VT-Coffee Milk Froth which also adds a hint of butter to the caramel and helps cream it up a tad more.  This is much better after a good steep so that the flavors can meld together.    \r\n\r\n***The PUR-Caramel Coffee w/Sweet Milk is rather sweet on its own so you may not need any other sweeteners in this one.  Test it first and see.*** ","steep_days":"14","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T21:32:42.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"3115","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Brazilian Coffee SC","vendor":"WF","millipercent":400},{"name":"Butterscotch (natural)","vendor":"FW","millipercent":500},{"name":"Caramel Coffee with Sweet Milk","vendor":"PUR","millipercent":5000},{"name":"Coffee Milk Froth","vendor":"VT","millipercent":500},{"name":"Toffee","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Toffee Ice Cream","vendor":"VT","millipercent":1000}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"117215","name":"Caramel Frappe"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
