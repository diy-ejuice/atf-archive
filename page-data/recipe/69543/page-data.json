I personally have no problems vaping diacetyl and diketones every now and then, as there are sooo many more in the cigarettes i used to smoke. Plus they create great flavour. This mix is a very sweet, cakey,  and hammered with caramel and sugar. I suggest you only mix and vape it if you have no respect for your coils and cotton. Enjoy!
