I've been working on this profile for a while now and I finally feel like it's finally at a point where I can release it. Something nice to close out the warm season, but with enough freshness and crisp bite to fit in with the cooler mornings and evenings. This recipe works as a nice palate cleanser, but also comes through with a nice amount of flavour.\r\n\r\nFLV Cantaloupe / FLV Wild Melon - a match made in heaven. FLV Cantaloupe is a wonderful concentrate that is both accurate to the name, while avoiding any sort of off notes that come from cantaloupes in real life. With FLV Cantaloupe around 3%, we get a really bold, sweet cantaloupe note similar to biting right into the middle of a perfectly ripe slice. The addition of FLV Wild Melon adds some extra back end notes of general melon flavour. Nothing too distinct, but it just pushes the cantaloupe note into a more unique territory. Almost like if you got a cup of chopped cantaloupe, watermelon, and honeydew, but only ate the cantaloupe pieces. Delicious, and the higher percentages here allow it to stand up to the somewhat unusual power of the cucumbers.\r\n\r\nFLV Cucumber / CAP Cucumber - These two work together to give us a fairly accurate cucumber note, but one that is sweet enough to avoid any sort of off-putting vegetable notes. FLV Cucumber brings the authenticity, likened to some fresh garden cucumbers, sliced up and immediately eaten. There are some slight notes of the cucumber rind/skin which add to the accuracy. Keep this one under 2% in your mixes, for around there, we start to get some strange bitterness and \"dirty\" accents. Not entirely pleasant at all. CAP Cucumber feels more like the flavour you get in a cucumber water type beverage. More on the sweet side, like eating just that part of the cucumber with the seeds. That fleshy interior that has a strange inherent sweetness to it, but not in the realm of candy or sugar sweetness, just only noticeable when you think about it. These two pair together to give us a great, slightly sweet cucumber that compliments and boosts the cantaloupe notes.\r\n\r\nINW Natural Mint - This was actually the note I was struggling with the most for this recipe. Most of the time, it was far too overpowering. It was a matter of testing each new mix by drops until it got where I wanted it. There are obviously other mints that could be used here, but the subtle creaminess and vanilla notes found in INW Natural Mint made it the best choice in my opinion. As you probably know, this shit is incredibly potent, and will quickly destroy a mix in as little as one drop. I've found that two drops per 15ml is perfect for me, but play around with it to your liking. I wouldn't go over 4 drops per 15ml however, because that's where I found the mint to completely decimate any other flavours in this mix. The addition of the slight creaminess of INW Natural Mint brings a perfect mouthfeel to the cantaloupe, while the subtle notes of vanilla also pair nicely with the melons. That mint is here to add an extra layer of complexity and depth to the cucumber, while pushing this mix to be as refreshing and crisp as possible.\r\n\r\nSteep time - This works as a shake and vape, for sure. After an overnight steep, whatever slight off notes from cucumber fade away, and after about 2 full days, everyone gets to know each other and we're left with a nicely balanced mix of cantaloupe, sweet cucumber, and vanilla mint.\r\n","steep_days":"2 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T20:32:11.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"1600","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Cantaloupe","flavor_id":"610","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Cucumber","flavor_id":"4384","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1250},{"name":"Cucumber","flavor_id":"43","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1750},{"name":"Wild Melon","flavor_id":"619","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1250},{"name":"Natural Mint","flavor_id":"856","vendor":"INW","millipercent":100}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"59592","name":"> c///c.flv"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
