Finally that time has come!\r\n.\r\nI have always liked the idea of creating something that also kinda replicates a visual experience in flavour.  \r\nThis is what is known as a \"symphonic sensory\" experience.\r\n\r\nPicture this, you enter a dangerous glacier cavern but take that risk of entering into it to experience something unique but special. \r\nTo help you get the picture take a look at this short 3min Vid:\r\nhttps://youtu.be/R7iLg0tq6Qw\r\n\r\nThis has been my inspiration of creation as I introduce to you,\r\n\"ICEBERG\"\r\n\r\nA delectable vape that is unique, special & beautiful.\r\nA little cool but refreshing. Some subtle sweetness with comforting and familiar back notes of flavour that keep this from becoming just another cool vape. \r\n\r\nThere is so much beautiful complexity in DV Crystal Blue and is an amazing flavour to build off once you get past the blue color. \r\nIt offers fruit's kissed with a little anise that just works & I don't like anise. \r\nI wanted to work on delivering some additional freshness to this recipe and Cap lemon lime certainly delivered that.\r\nTo enhance the feeling of being surrounded in a Blue Ice Cave, while also feeling comfortable and fresh, I lend to the familiarity of those commercial blue candy notes that are inherent in the FW Blue Raspberry and contrast it with RF Blueberry Lemonade Slushie & FW Blue Ice with the right balance and restraint to avoid a collapse. To add a little extra element to this amazing cool experience the FLV Ice offers another subtle dimension to the slight yet pleasant coolness in this profile. \r\nI would recommend this to anyone that even detests a menthol, or cool vape of any description because it is unlike any other, this is an experience! \r\n\r\nAre you ready to go straight ahead? \r\n\r\nEnjoy the Iceberg experience & let me know how you enjoyed it in the comments below. \r\n\r\nCheers for reading this far, now go and get mixing!\r\n\r\n\"Together, Let's Discover!!!\"\r\n\r\nFacebook - https://www.facebook.com/groups/diydownunder/\r\nDiscord - https://discord.gg/kH4Fqbc\r\nYoutube - https://www.youtube.com/c/diydownunder\r\nWebsite - https://www.diydownunder.com/\r\nInstagram IGTV : @diydownunder\r\n\r\nIMO this is a very pleasant and enjoyable vape on a single coil RDA at 60W with a SST single coil at 0.2 ohm \r\n\r\nSteep Time 3 Days for best results.
