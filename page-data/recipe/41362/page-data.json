Ripped off Cheesecake Graham Crust from Skiddlz's God Milk but went with Cream Fresh and Marshmallow in place of the Bavarian Cream so that steeping would be less necessary. I really like the smooth mint flavor of the Natural Mint so I chose that over others.\r\nGreat 5 minutes after shaking and great 3 days later, haven't really let it sit longer than that. It's a light, creamy, cold mint that's an easy ADV for me.","steep_days":"1 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:49:15.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"1600","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Natural Mint","flavor_id":"856","vendor":"INW","millipercent":750},{"name":"Menthol Liquid (pg)","flavor_id":"281","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":250},{"name":"Cream Fresh","flavor_id":"540","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Marshmallow","flavor_id":"332","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Cheesecake (graham Crust)","flavor_id":"152","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1500}],"reviews":[{"user":"Skywxp3d","text":"Absolutely fantastic!
