Unfortunately, I didn’t have all the flavors on hand to mix hers so I changed it up a bit. My palate is not nearly as refined as hers, but this worked well for me.  Oh yeah, I’m a sucker for FW yellow cake so there’s that...and yes I know about how bad it is to vape, but using it every now and then is okay.  If you don’t like yellow cake try subbing it with tres leches.  Anywho, thanks Jennifer for all the awesome recipes and flavor notes. I’m a big fan!\r\n\r\nHere’s the link to Jennifer’s recipe: https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/53069#choco_coffee_peanut_candies_by_jenniferjarvis","steep_days":"3 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-04T22:27:48.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"958","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Chocolate","vendor":"FA","millipercent":750},{"name":"Australian Chocolate","vendor":"HS","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Cream","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":750},{"name":"Mocha","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Peanut Butter","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Oba Oba","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"UP (coffee)","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"77623","name":"Choco-coffee peanut candies my way"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
