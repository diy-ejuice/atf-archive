The  banana custard adds a  creamy sweet note that is at the end of the inhale and the strawberry pops on the exhale .  This  was made for   Mixin in the kitchen on day time franks channel  https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCpzG9vsIgaCUzHVrUMHiV_g  \r\n\r\nCake  -    Pound cake,  cake dip and inw cake create the cake base.   pound cake is a fantastic butter cake base, with cake batter added for sweetness and  frosting.  INW lemon cake was added  to support the cake body and use the lemon to get the strawberry to  really pop up on top, the lemon note fades a good bit and is in the background \r\n\r\nbanana custard, Strawberry custard  - added to provide a  pop of bananna and strawberry  flavor profile  along with a custard.  This is not an EGG heavy custard  and I would call it more of  a thick pastry cream filling   ( cause who does not like the straw - nanna  combo)  -  WF  banana puree could have been  used   as well  but  I wanted to add more of that  rich custard base to the cake \r\n\r\nStrawberry glaze -  VT does jams and glazes really well  and this strawberry glaze is just that   and works perfectly here \r\n\r\nHoly vanilla  - is just my favorite vanilla it adds a body and creaminess with  a   vanilla that sort of settles into a mix  depending in the percent you use - inw shisha vanilla could be used as well    but is not as deep a vanilla \r\n\r\ncan shake and vape -   and the flavors taste bright and  forward with minimal custard notes   as the custard notes  develop the bright banana and  strawberry settle down into a really tasty mix      \r\nif you want that commerical sweetness  add the sweetener of your choice, although this mix is inherently sweet - sweetener will make the strawberry and banan pop a bit more   \r\n\r\nLearn more about mixing here:\r\nhttps://www.diydownunder.com/\r\nhttps://www.facebook.com/groups/diydownunder/\r\nhttps://discord.gg/kH4Fqbc\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCTCwb7ULyfJALQlehomZZQA \r\nwww.instagram.com/diydownunde\r\n","steep_days":"10","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"updated_at":"2020-12-12T14:06:47.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"2879","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Banana Custard","flavor_id":"8825","vendor":"VT","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Cake Batter Dip","flavor_id":"1223","vendor":"FW","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Glazed Strawberries","flavor_id":"8885","vendor":"VT","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Holy Vanilla","flavor_id":"2385","vendor":"DFS","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Lemon Cake","flavor_id":"661","vendor":"INW","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Pound Cake","flavor_id":"4306","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Strawberry Custard","flavor_id":"8975","vendor":"VT","millipercent":3000}],"reviews":[{"user":"JustMixIt","text":"AWESOME!
