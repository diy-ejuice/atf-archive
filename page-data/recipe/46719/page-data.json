Enjoy!!\r\n  \r\n\r\n**NOTES:**\r\n  \r\nThis is a strange mix, but one that is definitely one you'll keep coming back to. The FA Cantaloupe was added as an afterthought to provide a tantalizing contrast against the CAP Tangerine. FA Cantaloupe tastes very authentic to me and in this mix it shows itself on the back of the tongue at the exhale.\r\n  \r\n\r\nTFA Kiwi Double & CAP Sweet Tangerine are a wonderful citrus pair. They are definitely the main players of this mix.\r\n  \r\n\r\nTFA Kiwi Double is also used to complement FA Pear and vice-versa. And speaking of complements, what better addition than FA Fuji Apple to accentuate that pear as well as add slight candy sweetness?\r\nTie it all together with the juicy wetness INW Cactus provides, and you've got yourself a really good eliquid!\r\n\r\n**SNV but a simple overnight steep is beneficial.**\r\n  \r\n  \r\n**Do not take it upon yourself to copy and publish this recipe over to ELR.
