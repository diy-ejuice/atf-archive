I decided to go for a pineapple juice, but I really wanted a sweet, strong and fleshy fruit.\r\n\r\nWF Pineapple Candy/VT Sugar Loaf Pineapple/CAP Golden Pineapple = the pineapple. WF pineapple candy comes off strong, but it settles down after a couple of days and it's sweet. Sugar Loaf has good mouthfeel and middle body qualities and Golden Pineapple is good for juices yet loyal to the fruit.\r\n\r\nCAP Lemon Lime/WF African Horned Cucumber = the African horned cucumber is the juice in this recipe. It acts a bit like TPA Dragon Fruit if you will. Lemon Lime is a great trick to make your tropical fruits pop, and pineapple is no exception.\r\n\r\nIt'll work in 50VG/50PG for a pod/MTL vape and at 70VG/30PG for sub-ohm tanks and RTA/RDAs.\r\n\r\nMany thanks to @MECHMODRN ( https://alltheflavors.com/users/MECH_MOD_RN ) who is, as always, a great sounding board and support.\r\n\r\nEnjoy, be queer and vape on!\r\n\r\n[Photo credits: www.webstaurantstore.com]","steep_days":"3 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:51:10.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"1480","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Pineapple Candy SC","flavor_id":"10119","vendor":"WF","millipercent":2000},{"name":"African Horned Cucumber SC","flavor_id":"9012","vendor":"WF","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Sugarloaf Pineapple","flavor_id":"8978","vendor":"VT","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Golden Pineapple","flavor_id":"61","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Lemon Lime","flavor_id":"83","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1000}],"reviews":[{"user":"groceryboy_jr","text":"Pure pineapple deliciousness.
