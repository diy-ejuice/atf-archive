I'm thoroughly impressed.  My first impression on a SNV, I think to nail the profile, its not quite as sweet as I think it should be.  I'll let my sample steep out and revisit it in a few days.   Thanks for posting this!  Its pretty awesome and totally satisfies my longing for blue cotton candy (I'm diabetic).  I will play with the sweeteners on my next iteration and report back if you'd like!  Seriously, great job!&#xD;\n&#xD;\n"}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"32353","name":"Deep Blue Raspberry"}}}
