I have fallen in love with thes sour Hi Chew candies they are so good and I really love the grapefruit flavored one, and like so many of my favorite sweet treats I can't help but think about how and or if I could turn it into a vape juice.  This particular grapefruit flavor really makes me want to make it because of flavorah's pink gauva and not because its a particularly good concentrate but because it is a perfect grapefruit.  So I used flavorah pink gauva for the main aspect of my profile I did this at a whopping 1.5 % and at that 1.5% it totally takes over the mix with a grapefruit  flavor. I then adde strawberry taffy not for the strawberry flavor at all because the pink gauva completely  whipes  that out the only part of this flavor that survives the pink gauva's extremely strong  grapefruit flavor is the candy or taffy part  of the strawberry taffy and it may help calm down the grapefruit a little because it can taste a bit alcoholic  otherwise. I use strawberry taffy at 4%  to get this effect out of the strawberry taffy concentrate. The other aspect to thes absolutely great candies is the creamy center almost a slight vanilla cream taste to it and mixed with the spurt grapefruit flavor Iit is perfect. I achieve this creamy vanilla center by using flavor art meringue and flavor art cream fresh both at 1.5%. I also added 1% shisha vanilla for the slight vanilla flavor to the creamy center. I also added 1 % of TFA  Sour for the sour taste and feel..  I let this air out for a couple hours and then give it a couple days just to calm down a little.","steep_days":"3","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"updated_at":"2020-12-12T10:14:21.000-05:00","best_vg":"75%","views":"2485","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Pink Guava","flavor_id":"637","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Sour","flavor_id":"336","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Shisha Vanilla","flavor_id":"841","vendor":"INW","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Cream Fresh","flavor_id":"540","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Meringue","flavor_id":"530","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Strawberry Taffy","flavor_id":"4164","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":4000}],"reviews":[{"user":"loppyluggz","text":"New ADV.
