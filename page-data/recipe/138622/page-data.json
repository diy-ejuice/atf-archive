But, they all seemed to be missing \"something\" I couldn't put my finger on it but it needed something else. This recipe is a spin off of one of my most recent fruity pebbles recipes. I added FE Lemon, replaced the strawberry with FA Juicy Strawberry and then upped it to 1%, Then..... I got the WF Vanilla Ice Cream in and decided to give it a whirl in my FP mix. And VOILA I finally found that balance and little \"something\" that was missing... I gave this one a short 1 hour warm bath, an over night steep uncapped, then capped to steep for 5 days. It is a creamy balanced fruity pebbles almost fruit loopy at times yummy vape. Give it a mix and let me know what ya think.. Hope you enjoy..","steep_days":"5","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T23:37:21.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"1171","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Fruit Circles","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Vanilla Ice Cream SC","vendor":"WF","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Cream Milky Undertone PG","vendor":"OOO","millipercent":1250},{"name":"Fruity Flakes","vendor":"FW","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Lemon","vendor":"FE","millipercent":250},{"name":"Meringue","vendor":"FA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Juicy Strawberry","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Cream Fresh","vendor":"FA","millipercent":750}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"138622","name":"Fruit Poops"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
