Maybe a \"Mulato\" is supposed to be less darker chocolate forward?  If so, this could be exactly what the mixer had in mind.  I also wonder if this was created for the vaper that uses the drip method?  I have a tank.  All 3 versions of the Falcon.  I prefer recipes that do well in my tank.  If you like a gentle \"white\" vape.. here you go!  no off notes yet no chocolate coffee notes either.
