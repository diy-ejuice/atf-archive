It's a fairly straight forward recipe but yet a very well layered cookie. Sorry for no flavor notes I had a whole page wrote and I erased it before i saved it by accident. It tastes just like the peanut butter cookies my mother would make when I was a child. Give it a try you won't regret it.","steep_days":"4","temperature":"0","recipe_score":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-10T14:55:01.000-05:00","best_vg":"75%","views":"1983","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Peanut Butter Cookie","flavor_id":"4122","vendor":"RF","millipercent":7500},{"name":"Cookie","flavor_id":"490","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Cheesecake (graham Crust)","flavor_id":"152","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Sugar Cookie","flavor_id":"115","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Peanut Butter","flavor_id":"291","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1500}],"reviews":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"31127","name":"Tootall's peanut butter cookie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
