It's a fairly straight forward recipe but yet a very well layered cookie. Sorry for no flavor notes I had a whole page wrote and I erased it before i saved it by accident. It tastes just like the peanut butter cookies my mother would make when I was a child. Give it a try you won't regret it.","steep_days":"4","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"total_reviews":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T12:45:39.000-05:00","best_vg":"75%","views":"1975","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Peanut Butter Cookie","vendor":"RF","millipercent":7500},{"name":"Cookie","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Cheesecake (graham Crust)","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Sugar Cookie","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Peanut Butter","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1500}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"31127","name":"Tootall's peanut butter cookie"}}}
