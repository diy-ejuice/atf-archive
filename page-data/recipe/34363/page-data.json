The idea with this one was to make a tangerine cinnamon sugar cookie with a bit of powdered sugar on top.\r\n\r\nAgain, don't really have flavor notes for this one, but it did turn out wonderfully. It's a delicious mess, and it's one of my favorites. I regularly keep this in my rotation of juices. \r\n\r\nThe general gist is that we use CAP Sugar Cookie as the base, throw in some cinnamon with CAP CDS, throw tangerine in with CAP Sweet Tangerine and FW Tangerine, and finish it off with some buttery goodness with CAP Butter Cream and throw some powdered sugarriness on top with FA Meringue.
