It's a flavor unto it's own, and isn't really based on anything. It does have a nice Kiwi taste, with some back notes of strawberry, and is accented by the cactus well. What ties everything together is the Cucumber, with it's cool relaxing flavor, and that bitter Rhind note to contrast the sweet fruits. The Koolada smooths everything out, and wraps the whole experience up in a one of a kind flavor that is easy to vape all day. The Toasted Marshmallow is added to lighten and sweeten the mix, and add that little something special over regular Marshmallow.\r\n\r\nThe lime and blackcurrant are just supporting flavors to keep the mix bright and vibrant, and they work to that end very well. \r\n\r\nAfter 3 days, the mix comes together as a sweet, and bright mix with an excellent and different flavor. The cucumber kinda takes a back seat, but lends to the juicy wetness of the mix. The fruits and cactus blend together and the koolada comes down just a bit.

I'm a big fan of cactus, but I don't really find the taste to be dominating the other ingredients here.  It's more working, with the blackcurrant, to give the entire thing a really dense, slightly waxy mouthfeel that is really interesting and a lot better than it sounds.  The Kiwi-Strawberry provides a focus for the recipe, and the rest of it just kind of settles in around that note while the cucumber and lime provide a bright, refreshing counterpoint.  I do get a little more of the toasted marshmallow than I thought I would looking at the recipe, and it adds a bit of interest to the tail end of the exhale. At 75%, the koolada would normally be on the high side for me, but I feel like it lightens up the entire thing pretty effectively. It's well balanced, interesting, and refreshing."}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"46393","name":"Summer blend"}}}
