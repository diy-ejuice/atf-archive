This is exactly what has brought this one together to help create a truly lovely, realistic and balanced fruit loops recipe.\r\nThe secret star of the show here is VTA Orange tang. This is what assists to bring that artificial citrus sweetness out that is so distinct in fruit loops.\r\nIf you haven't already I encourage you to SFT your flavours, make notes, organise them so you can refer to them because that's the real secret to getting you on your way from creating nice recipes to making magic. (if you want to)\r\n\r\nor\r\nSimply mix and enjoy off the shake but allow 3 days for best results!\r\n\r\nI enjoy this at 60W on a Single 0.2ohm SST coil on a Recurve RDA.\r\n\r\nI hope you enjoy this just as much as I enjoyed creating this recipe, but let me know what you thought in the comments below.\r\n\r\nSeriously if you like a solid recipe that works give it a go!\r\n\r\nCheers for reading this far, now go and get mixing!\r\n\r\n\"Together, Let's Discover!!!\"\r\n\r\nFacebook - https://www.facebook.com/groups/diydownunder/\r\nDiscord - https://discord.gg/kH4Fqbc\r\nYoutube - https://www.youtube.com/c/diydownunder\r\nWebsite - https://www.diydownunder.com/\r\nInstagram IGTV : @diydownunder","steep_days":"3","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T00:08:43.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"1771","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Fruit Circles","flavor_id":"8742","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":5000},{"name":"Lemon Orange Rice Candy SC","flavor_id":"10103","vendor":"WF","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Milkshake Base","flavor_id":"8927","vendor":"VT","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Orange Tang","flavor_id":"8930","vendor":"VT","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Super Sweet","flavor_id":"2384","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":750}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"192340","name":"Fruit Loops In 5 "}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
