Unlike other tarts, the Tarte Tatin is made upside down in a skillet.\r\n\r\nAll FLV in this recipe, less is more.\r\n\r\nFruit:\r\nApple Filling, Apple Cranberry and a twist of Lime Wedge are the fruit filling for this dark and delicious vape.\r\n\r\nBakery:\r\nFor the bakery foundation, I used Sweet Dough, Pastry Zest, and Granola, this combination with notes from cinnamon and crunchy nuts makes this a very enjoyable mix where all aromas are perfectly layered. \r\n\r\nFinish:\r\nOpted for Butterscotch as dressing instead of caramel, the FLV Butterscotch has that perfect buttery/brown sugar taste I liked for this mix and added some Marshmallow for a smooth mouthfeel.\r\n\r\nI find this perfectly sweetened for my taste but as always, sweeten to your likings.\r\n\r\nSteeped this 14 days and in my honest opinion the perfect steep time.","steep_days":"14","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"total_reviews":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-02T08:05:51.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"1342","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Apple Filling","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Apple Cranberry","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":850},{"name":"Butterscotch","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":500},{"name":"Granola","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":250},{"name":"Lime Wedge","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":250},{"name":"Pastry Zest","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1250},{"name":"Sweet Dough","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":500},{"name":"Sweetness","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":500},{"name":"Marshmallow","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":250}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"115602","name":"Tatin"}}}
