I've got some others in the works but I feel like this one is good enough to release as is. Nothing ground breaking here and thanks to Goldfish18's Dunkaroos most of the leg work was already done, if you haven't tried it you need to mix it now. \r\n\r\nWhat I'm going for is a light airy glazed donut covered with a rich frosting and an Oreo crumble on top. No notes really needed here. Just enjoy. I gave it a 5 day steep.","steep_days":"5","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"total_reviews":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-05T08:06:32.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"1265","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Cookies & Cream â€“ SC","vendor":"RF","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Glazed Donut SC","vendor":"WF","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Vanilla Custard","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Holy Vanilla","vendor":"DFS","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Meringue","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Hazelnut","vendor":"FW","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Super Sweet","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":500}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"136224","name":"Dirty Nuts"}}}
