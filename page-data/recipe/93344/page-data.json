Inspired from the famous Tzatziki. Its meant to be a summer vape.\r\nCap Cucumber is the best cucumber hands down. It might not be really authentic, but its the tastiest.\r\nFlv Spearmint is a very good mint, no gummy note, not peppery. It has that green/vegetable note that adds complexity. I like that.\r\nCap Creamy Yogurt is awesome, its really soft, not sour like a real fresh yogourt, it adds thickness and a great mouthfeel.\r\nGood as a SNV better after few days.","steep_days":"3","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-06T20:43:49.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"864","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Cucumber","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Creamy Yogurt","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":6000},{"name":"Spearmint","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1500}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"93344","name":"Cucumis"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
