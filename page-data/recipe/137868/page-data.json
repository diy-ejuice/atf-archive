The Grape Juice & White Grape combo is great - but can easily read as sweet wine, which is useful, but not what I was going for. I did want a darker grape, without using Grape Concorde. I wanted it to read as a slightly sweetened, blended grape drink that is somewhat authentic, and somewhat sweetened & flavoured. \r\n\r\nGrape Trinity\r\nFE Grape - lovely mix between authentic, and slightly candy. Works great to add another layer to my grape\r\nFA White - adds a smidge of body, surypy sweetness\r\nTPA Grape Juice - this is mostly the base of the trinity, extremely underated grape\r\n\r\nFA Black Currant - was added very low to bring some body, as most grapes can read quite flat - it also adds a bit of purple to the paler grapes. \r\n\r\nSweeten & Cool as you prefer - my suggestions here is for a more commercial feel sweet grape juice. The WS23 I use is a 20% dilution. \r\n","steep_days":"2 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T23:37:20.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"2723","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Grape","vendor":"FE","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Grape White","vendor":"FA","millipercent":700},{"name":"Grape Juice","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":4000},{"name":"WS-23","vendor":"OTHR","millipercent":1200},{"name":"Super Sweet","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":700},{"name":"Blackcurrant","vendor":"FA","millipercent":300}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"137868","name":"Icy Grapey Vapey"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
