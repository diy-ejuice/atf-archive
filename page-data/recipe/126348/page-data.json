I cannot describe this flavor and I have not met anyone else who can either. I would not presume to compare this recipe to Grack but it does have some of the the same enigmatic flavor and mouthfeel characteristics as that famous juice. The recipe needs a 3 week steep to be at its finest. When it turns gold it is ready to go. It will also work very well with nic up to 12mg, I have not tried it above 12. Would welcome your thoughts.","steep_days":"21","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-06T20:44:24.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"1401","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Forrest Mix (forest Fruit Mix)","flavor_id":"453","vendor":"FA","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Cactus","flavor_id":"647","vendor":"INW","millipercent":500},{"name":"Marshmallow","flavor_id":"473","vendor":"FA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Sweetener","flavor_id":"1432","vendor":"FW","millipercent":700},{"name":"Extreme Ice","flavor_id":"1280","vendor":"FW","millipercent":1250},{"name":"Kiwi","flavor_id":"1330","vendor":"FW","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Red Touch (strawberry)","flavor_id":"421","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Pear","flavor_id":"257","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":3000}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"126348","name":"Enigma"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
