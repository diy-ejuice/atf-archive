I cannot describe this flavor and I have not met anyone else who can either. I would not presume to compare this recipe to Grack but it does have some of the the same enigmatic flavor and mouthfeel characteristics as that famous juice. The recipe needs a 3 week steep to be at its finest. When it turns gold it is ready to go. It will also work very well with nic up to 12mg, I have not tried it above 12. Would welcome your thoughts.","steep_days":"21","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"total_reviews":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-06T20:44:24.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"1401","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Forrest Mix (forest Fruit Mix)","vendor":"FA","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Cactus","vendor":"INW","millipercent":500},{"name":"Marshmallow","vendor":"FA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Sweetener","vendor":"FW","millipercent":700},{"name":"Extreme Ice","vendor":"FW","millipercent":1250},{"name":"Kiwi","vendor":"FW","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Red Touch (strawberry)","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Pear","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":3000}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"126348","name":"Enigma"}}}
