TFA Pie Crust helped along by TFA GCC provides the short crust pastry base here. I like the pastry on a custard tart to be soft, almost undercooked, which is quite hard to achieve and still a work in progress for me. \r\n\r\nThe custard profile brings together 3 very good custard flavours to create a rich and opulent custard main profile. Helped along by the Butter Cream to cream it out a little and give a heavier mouth feel. Top notes are subtle here and are provided by the brown sugar to hint at caramelisation and then sweetened by the Meringue without having to go too far with the Brown Sugar. For authenticity I would include a little nutmeg, but I am yet to find one. Those concentrates that do contain nutmeg also bring other spices I do not want here. So went with the slightly sweet caramel in place of that for interest.","steep_days":"14","temperature":"300","recipe_score":5,"updated_at":"2020-12-12T15:38:55.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"2447","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Brown Sugar","flavor_id":"313","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Butter Cream","flavor_id":"3","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Catalan Cream","flavor_id":"483","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Custard","flavor_id":"484","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Graham Cracker Clear","flavor_id":"325","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Meringue","flavor_id":"530","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Pie Crust","flavor_id":"179","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Vanilla Custard","flavor_id":"131","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":5000}],"reviews":[{"user":"ItsKame","text":"","score":5}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"20044","name":"Basket Case"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
