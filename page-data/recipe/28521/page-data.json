I liked the profile and I wanted to make it my own. I enjoyed the original a lot, but what I really wanted was a hard crunch cereal with marshmallows in between. I used the notes from ENYAWREKLAW and set to work changing his original profile to be something different. This is by no means the exact same mix, this one has more of a crunch speckled with marshmallows. \r\n\r\nThe Cereal Base: FW Cake (Yellow), CAP Sugar Cookie and Acetyl Pyrazine is the perfect hard crunch cereal base,  it isn't overwhelming or distracting, it creates the perfect hard crunch cereal base without adding any off notes to the mix. \r\n\r\nThe Milk:\r\nThe original had a great milk base to begin with, a strawberry milk base was perfect for this kind of cereal, but what I wanted was more of a malt milk note. I also felt the need to remove a lot of the original creams as I wanted the cereal upfront and milk and marshmallows between those cracks. I used FA Vienna cream, FA Meringue and TFA Strawberry (Ripe) the same way as it was used in the original. I also added in FW Hazelnut to create more of that malt note, The Hazelnut also helps highlight the cereal base.\r\n\r\nThe Marshmallows:\r\nI needed a marshmallow that would stand out and note just mix in with the creams. TFA Marshmallow and TFA Toasted Marshmallow was perfect for this. Toasted Marshmallow helped bring the cereal base forward and create a frosted type taste to the cereal. The TFA Marshmallows were perfect to add the small bits of marshmallow between the cereal and stand out more than other marshmallows I tried.\r\n\r\nNow to me this is Shake and Vape, but Vienna Cream and the Hazelnut really needs a week to be a lot less malty. \r\n","steep_days":"7 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:49:03.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"5709","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Strawberry (ripe)","flavor_id":"271","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Vienna Cream","flavor_id":"516","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Meringue","flavor_id":"530","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Sugar Cookie","flavor_id":"115","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":3500},{"name":"Cake (yellow)","flavor_id":"1222","vendor":"FW","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Marshmallow","flavor_id":"332","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Toasted Marshmallow","flavor_id":"340","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Acetyl Pyrazine","flavor_id":"1709","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Hazelnut","flavor_id":"1312","vendor":"FW","millipercent":1000}],"reviews":[{"user":"nightshark","text":"Very good cereal vape. "},{"user":"BenthicVapes","text":"Easy S&amp;V, mixed up two 30mls... one for immediate one for in 5-7 days. Love the cereal and the balance on the S&amp;V is good between the milk and cereal. Maybe just me but the marshmallow (on the S&amp;V) seems a bit subdued right now. Will that come ut more with a small steep?"},{"user":"Pricey666","text":"This is very tasty as a shake and vape, I got a bit of a head cold so my taste isn't perfect but even with dampened taste this is great. The ap gives the crunch cereal that little bit of a dry note that you would expect from eating lucky charms and the sugar cookie and yellow cake give it a great cereal flavor. I'm impressed, this and your lime kiwi strawberry are gonna stay in my rotation for a while!"}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"28521","name":"Crunch Cereal with Marshmallows and Strawberry Milk"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
