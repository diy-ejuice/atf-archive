I have not had one since then. At the moment I am getting a perfect Orange and Milk combo. This is a layered depth of flavors. I did try it the simple way, but it does not even come close to this, so much difference. Was worth the extra work. This is a ADV and I always keep 60 ml. of this in the cabinet. 3 days is good, 7 days is heaven.","steep_days":"7","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T02:16:48.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"1736","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Blood Orange","vendor":"FW","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Cream Milky Undertone PG","vendor":"OOO","millipercent":2000},{"name":"French Vanilla Ice Cream","vendor":"VT","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Honeycomb","vendor":"VT","millipercent":500},{"name":"Milk SC","vendor":"WF","millipercent":150},{"name":"Milkshake Base","vendor":"VT","millipercent":500},{"name":"Orange Cream","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Orange Juice","vendor":"WF","millipercent":1250},{"name":"Shisha Orange","vendor":"INW","millipercent":500},{"name":"Smooth Vanilla","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":60},{"name":"Vanilla Ice Cream","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"136205","name":"Orange JuLius"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
