Not harsh, just really, really dry. I would like to see a version of this that has a slightly wetter mouthfeel if that makes any sense. I'm pretty new to DIY so I have no real idea of how I could make that happen"},{"user":"hfatih","score":"3","text":"Great for 5 minutes, gets boring after that. Not much going on, it really is just a vanilla mint. An interesting profile, feels like it could be made with bolder-sharper flavors but i don't know how much better a vanilla mint can get."},{"user":"Aquaneo","score":"5","text":"very Tasty, sorry I've got no criticisms as it is great as is"},{"user":"hyperlite310","score":"5","text":"Tastes just like a dinner mint! Great for those times when you have vape tounge. I like to pair this with morning coffee and after brushing my teeth :)"},{"user":"LoriDS1","score":"5","text":"Lovely vanilla mint. Will mix again!"}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"9099","name":"PILLOW TALK"}}}
