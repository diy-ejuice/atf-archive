Has that perfect balance in flavor. Light and Fluffy with a nice pie crust taste. This was an attempt at something a bit different. I Find it absolutely great. mixed at 60/40Pg. This flavor really comes together after a 5 day steep. Try it out. I would love your Feedback. super sweet Optional. I think the Blackcurrant adds a nice subltle unique taste to the recipe.
