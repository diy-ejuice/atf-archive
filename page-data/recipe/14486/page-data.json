Great recipe!"},{"user":"lionhrt9","text":"Can't put this stuff down. What a great mix. Awesome play on flavors. Well balanced. The Yakima hops are genius. Thanks for sharing! "},{"user":"lnterlinked","text":""},{"user":"pyroxian","text":"I couldn't wait the full 7 days steeping and cracked it open on day 5. Fruity, juicy, tart/sweet/bitter/funky and creamy all at the same time.  I can't wait to see how it develops with more time and can easily see this as an adv. Will definitely be making this again."},{"user":"beeker","text":"This is truly delicious. Pink Guava and Yakima Hops are a match made in heaven. Thanks Concrete!"},{"user":"SeLeV","text":"A strange but immensely enjoyable vanilla guava cheesecake."},{"user":"NikosD","text":"The closest thing I have found to Grack so far without the chill factor. It is unique which means that you may not like it but I personally love it so far and I'm waiting to see how it will evolve after a couple of days."},{"user":"nowar","text":"I have tried every which way from Tuesday to like this mix but i just cant get behind it. Is it balanced? Yes. Is it unique? Oh Lawd yes! Does it tickle my fancy? Errr, sometimes? It is definitely an experience, one I suggest you take. I think i just finally found the vape that is simply too weird for me. One second it's creamy smooth, the next its fruity tropics, then it's juicy sour cactus and finally slightly fermented. And all over again in the next pull, but in a different order. If you want to try something that makes no sense at all, yet is oddly pleasant and full of surprises, by all means, this is your vape. As for me, I think I'll marry the butcher's daughter instead of eloping with the exotic dancer who's swung through town on a Tuesday night."},{"user":"AndreM","text":"I cannot describe this juice better than the creator above. But what I can say is that the interplay between the sweet, tart and bitter is amazing and has me wanting more and more. Thank for sharing this masterpiece. A grand juice-opera, certainly not your finale!"},{"user":"kitu5","text":"This has to be one of the best examples of weird science in mixing I've ever had the pleasure to run across. The guava is blatant, and that's a good thing. Considering this is coming from someone who until very recently loathed guava, this is saying something. There's a creamy sweetness from that icing and the vanilla swirl that give it a wonderful richness that in no way detracts from the taste. The grapefruit confuses me though. Unless the Pink Guava is an amalgamation of pink grapefruit and guava, then there's seriously some wicked mojo occurring in the bottle. The cactus makes it a touch juicier and tastier.&#xD;\n&#xD;\nI have to agree with the crowd here. This is a fantastic mix, and one that simply must be tried. It's for guava fans, grapefruit fans, people who like a little sweet with their sour, smoothie junkies, or just looking for something tropical and different.&#xD;\n&#xD;\nThis l'il bad boy is a banger. Nice one Concrete!"},{"user":"Ebc88","text":"I am so disappointed................:that i only mixed 30 mls of this excellent job Concrete. Very balanced and unique recipe"},{"user":"tw2k","text":"Thank you for such a unique recipe."},{"user":"FizzChaser","text":"I wish I could give more stars. This is the perfect example why diy is so f'n great! Great Juicy Grapefruit/Guava recipe with perfect sweetness. Thanks so much Concrete for this tasty af mix!"},{"user":"Thadentman","text":"What Cokecan said..."},{"user":"matthewkocanda","text":"I am not a fan of guava, grapefruit, or cream cheese icing, but holy hell, this amalgamation of the three is something special. This recipe takes nearly everything good about vaping and just assaults you with everything. The creaminess and thick mouthfeel from CCI and Vanilla Swirl keeps the harsh brightness of the guava and grapefruit in check. While those same tart notes are allowing the cactus to boost them into that addictive punch of flavour that makes a good recipe great. I have no idea what Yakima Hops tastes like on its own, but from this recipe, I think I am going to have to pick it up. There's a touch of bitterness and dry earthy notes that really just rounds this out into one of the best recipes I've tasted in quite some time. This is one expertly crafted mix, something straight from the gods themselves, if gods existed. Maybe Concrete is a god. At the very least, he is my god now. "},{"user":"Philosaphucker","text":"I had one difficuly with this one and that was finding a beer to pair it with. A session IPA is nice, but it takes away some of that luscious mouthfeel. I ended up going the route of a belgian blonde ale. Personal victory aside, I enjoy how smooth, juicy, weird, and wonderful this is. "},{"user":"6retro6","text":"Super tasty unique flavour."},{"user":"TamVapes","text":"Wow!   No steep yet, Testing in my Hadaly @ .5 ohm.  Absolutely amazing!  Very smooth right off the bat, Looking forward to how it tastes in a few days.  &#xD;\nGreat job.  "},{"user":"mrloqqe","text":"this recipe is phenomenal. someone needs to give that guy some kind of prize or trophy "},{"user":"Chewymidget","text":"Really original and tasty. Yakima Hops is incredibly unique and addictive."},{"user":"MrZigglesworth","text":"This is a fantastic recipe that I am thoroughly enjoying. The bitterness and the sweetness combined with the fruit is a powerful combination."},{"user":"ExclusiveGirl","text":"I am in love with this recipe and got to try it through the mixers club on reddit. Now I have to track down yakima hops.. "},{"user":"Bogey_Again","text":"I just love Guava! The Yakima Hops really transform this into a mellow sweet vape. It does taste like a \"grapefruit shandy\"."},{"user":"ID10-T","text":"WOW! This is very different and super tasty. It tastes like someone took a grapefruit shandy, mixed it with some guava nectar, and then took that and made a bubblegum based on it. That's was the first thing that came to mind when I vaped it. Bubblegum. It doesn't taste anything like bubblegum at all, at least no bubblegum I've ever had, but it's both very thick and super wet and juicy in a way that's not quite like anything I've vaped before. It's exactly like the way good bubblegum makes your mouth water like crazy as you chew it. Amazing recipe!"}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"14486","name":"Fiestas and Fiascos"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
