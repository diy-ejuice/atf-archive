Not as good as inawera but that flavor is dead.  So I'm making this for the people that don't have it.  I used the flavor west cinnamon roll to really make the waffle pop add more flavor and texture.\r\nThe kettle corn is for more of the butter affect but also loans some crispness to the vape.  The maple syrup and sweet cream really moisten things up and just bring together all the ingredients.  This is a great waffle recipe.  I would let this sit for five to seven days at least so everything can meld together.\r\n","steep_days":"5","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"total_reviews":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T17:34:27.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"1597","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Belgian Waffle","vendor":"LB","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Sweet Cream","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Kettle Corn","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Cinnamon Roll","vendor":"FW","millipercent":750},{"name":"Maple Syrup","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1500}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"70809","name":"Waffelicious"}}}
