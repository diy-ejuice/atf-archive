Huck Yeah I think fits right in with my other formulations.\r\n\r\nA number of people stated all they could taste in my older formulation of this profile was the berries, So I decided to update with this revision. If you're into creamy, tart and sweet recipes I can recommend this one. \r\n\r\nFind the old recipe here: e-liquid-recipes.com/recipe/746418/Huckleberry+Cheesecake\r\n\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n🄵🄻🄰🅅🄾🅁 🄽🄾🅃🄴🅂\r\n\r\n■ **TFA CGC, TFA Graham Clear, CAP NY Cheesecake**\r\nThis combination makes up the cheesecake base.\r\n\r\n■ **CAP Sweet Cream**\r\nContributes a \"cheesy\" texture with a little cream cheese filling. Also bestows weight to the mix.\r\n\r\n■ **FLV Blueberry Muffin**\r\nUsed to add bottom ripeness to the huckleberry with a little texture to the graham.\r\n\r\n■ **FLV Strawberry**\r\nUsed to append a fatty jammy depth to the berry while not muddling strawberry notes.\r\n\r\n■ **TFA Huckleberry**\r\nUse this sh*t with a light hand. Not kidding. Goes perfume quickly. Less is more with this bad boy. In this revision I felt it was the best level for prominence while meshing with the creamy tart notes.\r\n\r\n■ **CAP Super Sweet**\r\nObviously cheesecake is sweet.\r\n\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nBe sure to follow me on YouTube for future mixing updates:\r\nhttp://www.youtube.com/c/SteamCraft","steep_days":"10","temperature":"420","recipe_score":5,"updated_at":"2020-12-12T17:12:07.000-05:00","best_vg":"75%","views":"2863","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Blueberry Muffin","flavor_id":"608","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":250},{"name":"Cheesecake (graham Crust)","flavor_id":"152","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Sweet Cream","flavor_id":"117","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Graham Cracker Clear","flavor_id":"325","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Huckleberry","flavor_id":"239","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":750},{"name":"New York Cheesecake","flavor_id":"90","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Strawberry","flavor_id":"626","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":250},{"name":"Super Sweet","flavor_id":"2384","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":500}],"reviews":[{"user":"Woody0707","text":"I love this stuff.
