It's simple, it's blueberry, it's creamy, it's delicious and it's a SNV! No need to make large batches cause I can have another bottle mixed and ready faster than I can re-wick a coil. Great Job.","score":0},{"user":"SatJoe563","text":"From the other 2 reviews, I figured I was safe to make a 30 ml tester on this one, and was correct in my assumption.  As S&amp;V, it is a sweet, candy like blue berry, and stronger candy blueberry on the exhale.  The creams are noticeable, and I can imagine after a few days steep, this will be delightful.  I have not had good luck with FW Sweet Cream and VBIC in the past, favoring TFA / Caps in recipes.  But in this recipe, they seem to work great.  &#xD;\n-Thanks for posting, and thank you for your time in supporting the rest of us.","score":5},{"user":"crumbym","text":"This is a really good SNV, I did not have (FW) Sweet Cream (Subbed with (TPA)) did not have (FW) VBIC (Subbed with (TPA VBIC) and it is good. I have the correct flavors on the way so I can match the exact recipe, but it is VERY good even with those. Can't wait to try with the correct ingredients. Thanks for ALL the work you do on these and the DIY videos.","score":0},{"user":"super8line","text":"This stuff is awesome! I mixed a 30ml to try it out and couldn't even wait the 3 days for the full steep.  Vaped nearly the whole 30ml bottle in 24 hours.  Will definitely be making this again.","score":5}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"48564","name":"FW Blueberry [Blue Yogi] (Flavor Book Entry Recipe)"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
