I always picked out the strawberry ones.  Pazzo Jack on its own would create that flavor, but I wanted something different.  The pink burst I feel gives the strawberry an extra layer, and the tangerine helps with that bite you feel in the back of your throat.  Of course adjust the sweetener to your liking (I am a coil killer and like it at .75%).","steep_days":"1","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"updated_at":"2020-12-12T11:52:36.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"1766","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Pazzo Jack","flavor_id":"9909","vendor":"FA","millipercent":8000},{"name":"Pink Candy - Burst Type","flavor_id":"4125","vendor":"RF","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Sweet Tangerine","flavor_id":"123","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":500},{"name":"Super Sweet","flavor_id":"2384","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":500}],"reviews":[{"user":"alexmori","text":"I've always mixed Pazzo Jack by itself but was getting bored. Along came this recipe and it gives Jack dimension and layers! I was worried the tangerine would be too noticeable but it's not. It serves its purpose quietly in the background. The burst makes it taste more authentic.  Very very good recipe. I will definitely be putting this in my ADV rotation!","score":5}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"140798","name":"Hard Strawberry Candy"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
