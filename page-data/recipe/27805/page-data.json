I decided to work on a few fruit recipes. \r\nHere we have a delicious little combination of candied blueberry and peaches. Using FA Lemon Sicily and FA Pear to accent both flavors. I've really come to enjoy this mix as a nice break away from my usual vapes. FA Pear is sweetening up everything but specifically, to make the White Peach pop a bit more and even out the astringency that comes with that flavor. It can help to make the vape a bit creamier as well over time which helped out since I didn't want to add any creams to this. I love the flavor of FA Pear which is just an added bonus. I also used FA Lemon Sicily to brighten up the blueberry. It has its own delicious tartness and is similar to like...Italian Ice. It's a quite realistic type flavor as well, and if used too high can bring with it a bit of rind, so beware (although some people say that there is no rind but instead brings almost a lemon cookie flavor). HS Blueberry is pretty bright all by itself, but in this recipe I wanted to take away the candy aspect a bit more, so it helps with that as well. FA White Peach I chose simply because it's a more authentic take on a fresh semi-ripe peach. I didn't want a candy/peach rings kind of peach. I also didn't want the peach to take over everything. All in all, this is a very refreshing summertime vape that I just happened to make during Winter.   \r\nShake and vape this all you want, although it's much better after a few days of steeping. 3-5 days and its perfect. Check it out you son of a peach!!   \r\nExtra note: If you do want a little more creaminess, kindly add 1-2% TPA Marshmallow to the equation. It will work with the Pear and create just a little more added body.\r\n","steep_days":"3 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T23:35:19.000-05:00","best_vg":"75%","views":"1762","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Blueberry","vendor":"HS","millipercent":3500},{"name":"Lemon Sicily","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Peach White","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Pear","vendor":"FA","millipercent":750}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"27805","name":"Summertime Sadness"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
