Also nice in a pod device if you crank the ws-23 up to 1%. It’s not really sweet imo but it doesn’t hast to be. My friends keep asking me to mix this for them. Thanks for sharing!"},{"user":"Hexical","text":"Just mixed this up, and honestly just the smell alone is amazing. After vaping it, I have to say this is one of the nicest blueberry lemonades I've tasted. Its full of Blueberry but has the lemon coming right after, and the WS-23 adds the cooling effect to really tie off the drink feel. Thanks for the amazing recipe, ed =)"}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"34458","name":"Blueberry Lemonade"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
