It's not heavy on the creams, but it is creamy once it's steeped.  This is NOT a shake and vape. It needs at least 7 days smooth out and let the creamy notes come through. Before that the marzipan is just too strong and the coconut accents haven't had a chance to develop.  \r\n\r\nFlavor Notes can be found on my site:  http://flavor-pro.com/flavor-notes-flavourart-breakfast-cereals/","steep_days":"7","temperature":"0","recipe_score":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-12T05:49:38.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"4754","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Breakfast Cereals","flavor_id":"8810","vendor":"FA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Juicy Strawberry","flavor_id":"8779","vendor":"FA","millipercent":750},{"name":"Red Touch (strawberry)","flavor_id":"421","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Marzipan","flavor_id":"467","vendor":"FA","millipercent":200},{"name":"Coco' (coconut)","flavor_id":"416","vendor":"FA","millipercent":120},{"name":"Cream Fresh","flavor_id":"540","vendor":"FA","millipercent":400}],"reviews":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"72795","name":"Strawberry Cereal Milk"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
