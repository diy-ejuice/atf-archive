Some are good,some are shit but I’ve NEVER had a true custard that absolutely blows my mind....UNTIL NOW! I know,I know it’s super Cliche of me to blow my own trumpet and sit here claiming I’ve got the king of them all but you need to understand,I create my recipes for my tastebuds and I don’t release recipes unless I’m 100% in love with them! I have a few custard “type” recipes uploaded and they have all done well on ATF and ELR! Some mixers claiming mine is there all time favourite which is very humbling for me. I can whole heartedly say that this recipe right here is by FAR the best custard I’ve created and is worthy of a Throne! Don’t believe me?? Just ask Jon Snow!!! 😀He confirms it’s literally like vaping custard crack!!! If you don’t have MB legendary custard you COULD sub FA custard prem @ 4% you can also sub CC Devon Cream for INW Shisha vanilla @ 1.5% and finally CC Creme Caramel for VT Salted Caramel @ 3%. The rest of the recipe is vital though I’m afraid. Please mix up,leave a rating and review so other mixers can decide whether they would like to mix it up. Happy mixing guys and gals 💙 ***P.S*** This is NOT a straight forward “Vanilla custard”! This is a full on Rich vanilla custard with hints of buttery caramel and topped with crushed digestive biscuits. 😍😋🤤🤤","steep_days":"5","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"total_reviews":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T20:33:21.000-05:00","best_vg":"75%","views":"1910","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Legendary Custard","vendor":"MB","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Butter My Biscuit","vendor":"MB","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Devon Cream","vendor":"CC","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Creme Caramel","vendor":"CC","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Super Sweet","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":500},{"name":"Pie Crust","vendor":"OOO","millipercent":3000}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"185824","name":"Thrones Custard "}}}
