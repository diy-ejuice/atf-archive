DO NOT MISS OUT ON THIS COOKIE LOVERS.  This reminds me so much of those Lofthouse cookies you buy at the grocery store. You know, the ones that are super soft and thick,  with the extra layer soft icing on top. Enjoy!!! Big props to Vdevil, and Chrisdvr1. \r\n\r\nhttps://alltheflavors.com/recipes/31382#vin_s_vanilla_cookies_by_vdevil","steep_days":"1 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-06T02:07:29.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"1399","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Biscuit","flavor_id":"4487","vendor":"JF","millipercent":750},{"name":"Sugar Cookie","flavor_id":"115","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Hazelnut","flavor_id":"1312","vendor":"FW","millipercent":750},{"name":"Yellow Cake","flavor_id":"4560","vendor":"JF","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Holy Vanilla","flavor_id":"2385","vendor":"DFS","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Shisha Vanilla","flavor_id":"841","vendor":"INW","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Strawberry (ripe)","flavor_id":"271","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Sweet Strawberry","flavor_id":"121","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Super Sweet","flavor_id":"2384","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":500}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"34316","name":"Loft-Haus Strawberry Sugar Cookies"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
