Finally the FA ice cream sits on top of the soda, only at 2% as I didn’t want it too heavy it fits in nice at that percentage.\r\n\r\nSuper sweet isn’t essential but totally worth it but to each their own and can be dropped out dependant on your tastes  :) \r\n\r\nWs-23 works a treat in this recipe, you lose a bit of the cream but is really refreshing.\r\n\r\nIf you like this recipe and what I do then please rate and review accordingly ❤️\r\n","steep_days":"3 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:51:12.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"2027","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Sugarloaf Pineapple","flavor_id":"8978","vendor":"VT","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Funky Pineapple","flavor_id":"1515","vendor":"MB","millipercent":3500},{"name":"Super Sweet","flavor_id":"2384","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":500},{"name":"Vanilla Ice Cream","flavor_id":"9957","vendor":"FA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Creaming Soda","flavor_id":"8862","vendor":"VT","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Lemonade","flavor_id":"636","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":500}],"reviews":[{"user":"cxxxxp","text":"Oh yaassss I'll be mixing this one up today!"}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"173162","name":"Pineapple Cream Soda Float"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
