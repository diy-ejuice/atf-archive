Today, the word \"baba\" in France and almost everywhere else outside eastern Europe usually refers specifically to the rum baba. I I decided to give it a bit of a twist and use a coconut cream custard with it that adds a nice top note \r\n\r\nOn the inhale you get a sweet coconut note that transitions to a dark sweet syrup cake on the exhale and a bit of a Malibu rum finish .   \r\nThis  was mixed for the  Daytime franks show  - mixin in the kitchen  episode  41\r\n\r\n**RUM BABA** and **YELLOW CAKE** create the cake base for this mix. I found the cake note in the WF to be a bit lost in this mix and I need some ore moist yellow cake So I added JF yellow makes a nice yellow cake that us useful here \r\n\r\nFor the dark syrup notes I used **RAISIN RUM and GOLDEN SYRUP** it makes for a nice dark sweet syrup with just a tad of a a dried raisin note which is perfect in this mix. The rum note in this mix is a dark slightly spiced rum with a minimal booze note \r\n\r\n**COCONUT CUSTARD and SWEET COCONUT** makes a wonderful creamy coconut filling that holds up to the dark notes in this mix and sits through this mix.  While it is called a custard the steep time is VERY short and provides a  thick creamy body with out an  egg note\r\n\r\n**NOTES/ SUBS** if you want more of a rum note you can add WF coconut rum in place of flv sweet coconut but I like the creamy body I am getting from the FLV sweet coconut and did not want to add any more rum to this mix. You can also sub FA Jamaican rum 1% for FLV rum raisin for that dark sweet spiced note. FW Yellow cake can sub for JF at 1%\r\n\r\n","steep_days":"10","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T19:15:54.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"1255","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Coconut Custard SC","flavor_id":"8363","vendor":"WF","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Golden Syrup","flavor_id":"8887","vendor":"VT","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Raisin Rum","flavor_id":"4443","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Rum Baba SC","flavor_id":"9041","vendor":"WF","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Sweet Coconut","flavor_id":"605","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1200},{"name":"Yellow Cake","flavor_id":"4560","vendor":"JF","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Dessicated Coconut","flavor_id":"9362","vendor":"VT","millipercent":1500}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"136673","name":"RUM BABA CAKE (yellow cake soaked with rum and topped with coconut cream) "}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
