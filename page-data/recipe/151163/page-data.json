Here are the related videos:\r\n\r\nhttps://youtu.be/DhWmleeFnP4\r\nhttps://youtu.be/2OvTG0lokh0\r\nhttps://youtu.be/TcdO1JO5HLI\r\n\r\nThe original idea from this blend comes from a Monster Energy drink called Mucho Loco. This drink is a  juicy tropical mango, blended with a delicious bright Passion Fruit. The drink has orange in it, and those citrus notes are not there to distract you from the Mango & Passion Fruit - they are there to enhance this combo and make it EXTRA vibrant and colourful. We believe the concentrates used in this mix achieves that. The cactus helps add juicynes to this recipe, and also boosts the Citrus notes in FA Mandarin. Jelly Candy used super low adds a thickish texture to this drink, like a sweetened fruit juice.\r\n\r\nSweeten and cool to taste, we recommend 0.3% CAP SS & 0.5% ws23 (20% Dilution) - I would recommend using Super Sweet, it adds a smidge more body to Cap Jelly Candy. \r\n","steep_days":"2 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":4.5,"total_reviews":2,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:50:56.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"2177","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Mango","vendor":"FE","millipercent":4500},{"name":"Yellow Passion","vendor":"VT","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Tanger (mandarin)","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Jelly Candy","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":750},{"name":"Cactus","vendor":"INW","millipercent":300}],"reviews":[{"user":"MECH_MOD_RN","score":"5","text":"I agree with Dave on this  I loved this mix  and  and the mango passion fruit pairing is SPOT  on    -   where Dave and I differ is  i really like the cap jelly candy in this mix  it makes it like a nectar type beverage which I think works well  "},{"user":"ID10-T","score":"4","text":"That FE Mango + VT Yellow Passion combo is killer! If I ever want a mango-passion recipe again (hint: I will) I'm totally stealing that pairing. But the Jelly Candy sticks out a little and takes the whole thing out of juice drink and into gummy candy territory. Maybe just a bit less of that, or thicken it up with a thicker tropical fruit like a low amount of CAP Sweet Mango or TFA Papaya. Or try some CAP Hibiscus, might give it a syrupy base and if the floral shines though, it wouldn't be out of place with those tropical fruits.
