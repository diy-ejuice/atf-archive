If you like WS-23 add 1-2 % also . also there is A  liquid on the market that is 10% for us for in like three or 4% sweetener . so no 10% is a perfect amount for forest fruits especially as a standalone flavor forest fruit is acting as the foundation of the whole recipe and the pear gives it some more depth , with the papaya giving it a delightful experience. Donâ€™t be afraid to mix this!","steep_days":"3 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T14:14:40.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"1232","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Forest Fruits","flavor_id":"4890","vendor":"FA","millipercent":10000},{"name":"Papaya","flavor_id":"584","vendor":"FA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Pear","flavor_id":"411","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000}],"reviews":[{"user":"Zugmaschine","text":"10% Forest Fruit???
