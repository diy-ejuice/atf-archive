I could vape it every day. Not all day, but I'd be perfectly happy to wake up to a tank filled with Cardinal every morning. One of the things I love about that simple, three ingredient recipe is all of its nuances and complexities. One of those is chocolate, something about the combination of Red Burley and the subtle coffee notes in Holy Holy Grail vaguely remind me of delicious dark chocolate. This is outlining that blurry corner of the surveillance video in which chocolate makes an appearance and hitting ENHANCE. Add some sweet FLV Milk Chocolate, but not too much, we don't want Hershey's syrup here. ENHANCE.  HS Australian Chocolate, there's that dark chocolate, but not too much, we don't want it too nutty. ENHANCE. BF Chocolate Truffle, but not too much, we don't want to want it too dry. Mmmmm. There it is. Satisfaction. \r\n\r\nShake & Vape certified, even better after two weeks.

I love the chocolate combo too. I used it in eyemakepizza’s Trinity Vanilla Ice Cream with .2% flv sweetness and oh man...that’s easily the best chocolate combo I’ve tried. Tastes more like a milk chocolate when not used with red burley. Thanks a lot for this!"},{"user":"TamVapes","score":"5","text":"Holy holy Raven!  This is amazing!  What an amazing Vape   I do not like chocolate Vapes, but I love Cardinal, so I knew I had to try this. I could Vape this as an ADV. The inhale is this caramel chocolatety creamy tobacco with a exhale of more creamy chocolaty tobacco goodness. Holy holy chocolate tobacco. This is a masterpiece.
