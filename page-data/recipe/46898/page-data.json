I really hated honeydew vapes until I found JF honeydew melon. It's phenomenal and cannot be subbed so fuck off. \r\n\r\nErythritol is a great sweetener for fruits so yes I used it here, really not necessary though so you can leave it out. \r\n\r\nCAP cantaloupe is a really nice base for melon mixes, it's a pretty nondescript melon flavor that works best as a background note. JF honeydew is the star of the show at 1%. The watermelon mix sweetens things up and adds a nice depth to the recipe. Cactus is here because juicy yummy and it tastes pretty melon like especially at low %. \r\n\r\nThis is pretty straightforward and honestly it is downright delicious and complex enough for me to enjoy.  I normally don't go for fruity blends but this one kept me going for over 50mls, enjoy!\r\n\r\nShake and vape but as always I let my stuff sit for at least 3 days to homogenize.","steep_days":"3 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"updated_at":"2020-12-12T15:39:15.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"3581","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Watermelon","flavor_id":"984","vendor":"LA","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Red Summer (watermelon)","flavor_id":"471","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Cantaloupe","flavor_id":"23","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Honeydew Melon","flavor_id":"4577","vendor":"JF","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Cactus","flavor_id":"647","vendor":"INW","millipercent":500},{"name":"Erythritol Solution (5%)","flavor_id":"5549","vendor":"NN","millipercent":500}],"reviews":[{"user":"Fiftytrent","text":"I've seen the light.
