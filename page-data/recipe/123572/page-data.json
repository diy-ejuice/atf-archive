I then had the idea that it would be great to do this on a cookie and share it with everyone!\r\n\r\nSo I present to you the fruits of my labour; a lovely, rich, warm and delicious recipe. Works as S&V, but improves over time, really seeming to develop a gorgeous richness after a week. \r\n\r\nTo give a bit of insight into the way I develop my recipes, I break the flavours down into layers and then try to find 'bridge' flavours which can join each layer together. \r\n\r\nFor example, I went with TPA hazelnut for the base 'nut' layer of the recipe, bridging to ice cream with both EJM hazelpotamus and WF hazelnuts and cream. \r\n\r\nFor ice cream, I used CC cookie dough ice cream, which bridges to the cookie layer provided by CAP sugar cookie. FW cookie butter rounds everything out and complements all of the layers with a lovely richness. \r\n\r\nYou could very easily tweak this or use subs; a vanilla cream/ice cream would increase the ice creaminess, or you could ramp up the nuttiness with some acetyl pyrazine. The only real *essentials* are hazelnut and sugar cookie. \r\n\r\nI am considering swapping out hazelnuts and cream for some VT toffee ice cream, which would provide a caramel note. \r\n\r\nAnyway, here it is! Please give it a mix and let me know what you think. Your feedback is hugely appreciated!
