This works great as a SNV . . . the rices come together to make an extremely accurate rice flavor.  Mixed with a buttery, caramel pudding, I find this to be a smooth, sweet, and savory vape.  Mixed at 60vg/40pg . . . it will be interesting to see if the VT Rice Base can hold the FE Sweet Rice flavor together (instead of it devolving into a generic stacrch).  The WF Caramel Rice Crispy adds a touch of rice but is an important element of the caramel note paired with WF Caramel Butter.

Lightly sweet base and pretty much on-point to my own homemade rice pudding. Steeped 12 days while it traveled in the mail from recipe creator. The carmel butter floats around with a perfectly balanced flavor adding obvious butter to the base and a bright authentic well caramelized top layer tone. Throat hit is smooth considering how well toasted to top layer is. Just beautiful.&#xD;\n&#xD;\nThis is one very authentic rice pudding. Alternatively I am also getting a \"French Toast\" vibe from it as well. Which means you could pick at the mid layer and get somewhere with a French Toast.&#xD;\n&#xD;\nBrought this around to a local vape shop and the most common two descriptors were \"On-point\" and \"Authentic\"&#xD;\n&#xD;\n&#xD;\n&#xD;\n"}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"90785","name":"Thrice Pudding Twice"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
