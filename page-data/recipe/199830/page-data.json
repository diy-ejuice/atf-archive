Holy hell! Just like thick chocolate and burnt sugar to the point that I thought I was vaping a gritty dank pipe tobacco! Seriously, unless you're after that sort of flavor don't do it LoL! Oof.....\r\n\r\nDay 4: So, after trying to power through what was in the RDA from the day 1 steep I realized that the horrible taste i was getting was from left over juice from a previous recipe. I tried a few times over the last couple days and it was still bad at first, but now with all the old liquid gone and a few days steep it's been pretty nice. If you're looking for a nice milk chocolate it's on point right now. I still want to see if that coconut comes out a bit more with subsequent steeping, but like I said it's good now üëç","steep_days":"4","temperature":"0","recipe_score":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-12T15:41:12.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"622","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Coconut Candy","flavor_id":"223","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":5000},{"name":"Milk Chocolate","flavor_id":"4389","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Super Sweet","flavor_id":"2384","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":500},{"name":"Butter Pecan","flavor_id":"1212","vendor":"FW","millipercent":2000}],"reviews":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"199830","name":"Mounds don't because..."}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
