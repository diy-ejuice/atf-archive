First off, shoutout to the homie Lilhop625 for bringing his negativity towards my previous recipe and bringing attention to it, much love fam üëäüèª  This recipe goes out to the homie Lilhop625! Without further adeu, Pink Season!\r\n\r\nSo Pink Season is an album by Filthy Frank and every single fucking time I watch Wayne's live mixing or any video he puts out I can't help but notice the resemblance lol. Anyways this recipe is my take on a strawberry milk vape. Yes, I know that this recipe has been beaten like a dead horse but strawberry and cream vapes are what kept me from going back to cigarettes. So I've been trying to create a strawberry cream that satisfies my needs and makes me feel all warm and fuzzy inside, (without thinking about Lilhop625üòò). This recipe is supposed to resemble when you were a kid and put waaaaay too much strawberry syrup in your glass of milk and how fucking delicious it was. Anyways here's what I've come up with:\r\n\r\nFA Cream Fresh, Meringue and TFA VBIC - I believe it was in a flavor talk video by Wayne in which he said a 2:1 ratio of Cream Fresh and Meringue create a good milk base so that's what I've done here. The addition of VBIC adds body to the milk without the heaviness and egginess of Vanilla Custard (even though I'll just about find ANY reason to throw VCv1 into a recipe).\r\n\r\nFA Red Touch, INW Shisha Strawberry and TFA Strawberry Ripe - these obviously create the strawberry syrup that I want in this recipe, the Red Touch and Shisha Strawberry act as the sugary potion of the syrup while the Ripe Strawberry helps to add that lacking authenticity. (Honestly I just lined them up and did percentages as 1,2,3 and it seemed to workout ü§ê).\r\n\r\nFW Hazelnut - this is something that you can totally leave out of this recipe, I only use it because I feel that hazelnut and strawberry are better that beer and football. \r\n\r\nSweetener is always subjective. \r\n\r\nThat's pretty much it folks! This is SnV approved but I do believe that giving the recipe about 3 days will allow the creams to calm down and the hazelnut to meld better with the strawberries. Mix this up and lemme know what you think! \r\n\r\nPsst.... - https://youtu.be/U6FIJjmX138","steep_days":"3 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"total_reviews":4,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:49:28.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"2535","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Cream Fresh","vendor":"FA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Hazelnut","vendor":"FW","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Meringue","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Red Touch (strawberry)","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Shisha Strawberry","vendor":"INW","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Strawberry (ripe)","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Vanilla Bean Ice Cream","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Super Sweet","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":500}],"reviews":[{"user":"wattevs","score":"5","text":"Reminds me of strawberry wafers.

This is just so spot on.&#xD;\nDont get scarey by the name pink this such a delightful S&amp;C vape. Even for me who has trouble finding good ones due to Strawberry insensitivity &#xD;\nI have never tastes Strawberry so upfront in any way before which doesnt mean that its lacking in the cream department. &#xD;\n&#xD;\nWhat i like most about this recipe is that it has tastes good in any style of vaping i could think of &#xD;\nRTA (Serpent Mini): Insanely tasty blend of S&amp;C perfectly balanced &#xD;\nHigh Wattage RDA: Highly intense sweet pounding of flavor on the tounge &#xD;\nFlavor RDA (Hadaly): Here is where the recipe really shines with a complex and sweet cream toped with the delicious play of the 3 strawberry flavors which make strawberry tastable even for someone who usually cant taste any strawberries at all.&#xD;\n&#xD;\nMix this up. You wont regret it"}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"54920","name":"Pink Season"}}}
