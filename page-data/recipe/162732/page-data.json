The recipe called it a Bourbon Half and Half, more of a Dirty Arnold Palmer though.\r\n\r\nSweet tea TPA and Black tea FLV make up the tea base. Its actually a great flavor combo for anyone making teas. Got the idea from ID10T off Noted if i remember right. This combo gives good body to the vape, not being to thin. \r\nLemonade LA and Lemonade FW are my favorite lemonade combo right now. Lemonade LA is the power house that brings a tart/sour lemonade and Lemonade FW brings in more flavor closer to the lemonade I like.\r\nFLV Bourbon and TPA Kuntucky Bourbon for the boozy note, kinda sweet, very deliscous. \r\nSweeten to taste.\r\nTested In MTL/Low wattage\r\n\r\n","steep_days":"1 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-12T00:42:11.000-05:00","best_vg":"50%","views":"881","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Sweet Tea","flavor_id":"369","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":10000},{"name":"Black tea","flavor_id":"9377","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":750},{"name":"Lemonade","flavor_id":"951","vendor":"LA","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Lemonade","flavor_id":"1336","vendor":"FW","millipercent":3500},{"name":"Super Sweet","flavor_id":"2384","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Bourbon","flavor_id":"4411","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":500},{"name":"Kentucky Bourbon","flavor_id":"361","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1500}],"reviews":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"162732","name":"Bourbon half and half MTL "}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
