(Orange, Cherimoya and Dragon Fruit)\r\n\r\nI like a lot POG liquids but I'm also tired of mixing tons of recipes with different flavors that end up tasing more or less the same, so I decided to take the same citrus tropical vibe and create a new flavor profile.\r\n\r\nWF Cherimoya is the star of the recipe. I have to thank my friends from Developed for making me try this flavor. It is a perfect mix of sweet tropical fruits in one single flavor, with notes of pineapple, coconut and something like a peach or mango that makes it perfect for this recipe.\r\n\r\nCAP Juicy Orange is mediocre, in a good way. Orange flavors can dominate a mix very easily when paired with delicate flavors (like TPA Dragonfruit) and in this case I only needed a background citrus note, with some body and a light bitterness.\r\n\r\nTPA Dragonfruit + INW Pitaya : This combo brings forward the best from both flavors. TPA is weak but it has the perfect juiciness and kind of strawberry sweetness, also being tropical. INW adds brightness and a floral note similar to hibiscus when used in low porcentajes. A perfect balance between to very different flavors for the same fruit.\r\n\r\nFLV Smoothie Base: This flavor is a great homogenizer and, while TPA Dragonfruit does something similar, Smoothie Base also makes the rest of the fruits pop. The lemon note is not very noticeable at 1% but it manage to bring a good body to the entire mix.\r\n\r\nSalud!","steep_days":"3 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"updated_at":"2020-12-12T18:30:29.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"3479","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Cherimoya SC","flavor_id":"10123","vendor":"WF","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Juicy Orange","flavor_id":"80","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Dragonfruit","flavor_id":"226","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Dragon Fruit - Pitaya","flavor_id":"652","vendor":"INW","millipercent":500},{"name":"Super Sweet","flavor_id":"2384","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":500},{"name":"Smoothie Base","flavor_id":"10153","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1000}],"reviews":[{"user":"lionhrt9","text":"Kick ass summer vape!

If I had to guess I’d say the way the TFA Dragonfruit (which can create some bitterness with other flavors), the more tart parts from INW dragonfruit, and the lemon from smoothie base work on the Orange to make it taste like grapefruit... I haven’t single-flavor tested this particular Cherimoya but those flavors in general can get banana-y. I don’t know. I also don’t care, because a full flavored grapefruit/banana tastes great to me. Refreshing, but creamy and thick, like a fruit cocktail with both citrus and banana in it would be.   ","score":5},{"user":"MaxSavage","text":"This is easily better than any POG that people are obsessed with. The combination of both dragon fruits, orange, and WF Cherimoya make this recipe a winner. The use of Smoothie Base making the orange pop, and blend everything up really makes a difference. Nothing here is really the star of the mix, it's just a well balanced, fruity, summertime vape.","score":5},{"user":"LaJuanaPipa","text":"Haven’t mixed yet but if it comes from a developed team member it should be more than fine.
