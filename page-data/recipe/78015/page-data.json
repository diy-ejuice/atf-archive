FA Raspberry is a pretty potent flavor and at 4.5% is just too much and may be muting itself. I taste mostly honeysuckle with a bit of raspberry and I was hoping for raspberry to be dominant. The hibiscus sits in the back but still apparent. The cactus is perfect, providing a great juiciness without the flavor. The recipe seems like it would be great with the raspberry and honeysuckle dropped to 2% and 2.5% respectively. On a side note, this may be a great recipe in a pod system or an aspire breeze since they seem to benefit from higher percentages of flavor. I dont want to come off too harsh because I still enjoy this flavor and think this has a lot of potential. Also I have not tried the original so I can't comment on the accuracy. Overall this is a pretty good recipe though.","score":4},{"user":"cwill111","text":"First off, I will say I have not tried the original. This recipe is great! I worried about it being to floral with the honeysuckle being that high. It's not an issue at all. I've already went through 60ml and will make more.
