They blend in the middle for a sweet and tart combination thatâ€™s refreshing and bright. I think the sour wizard might be a little high and muting, but that could be a good thing. It could be keeping that peel note from the green apple in check. Simple and straightforward fruit combo that I definitely enjoy. Job well done, Dodger!"}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"32852","name":"Pucker Juice"}}}
