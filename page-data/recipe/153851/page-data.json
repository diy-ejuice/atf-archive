A fully flavored recipe that’s perfect for the coming warmer months. \r\n\r\nKilanca is delicious. Like a lot of the nicotine river concentrates, it’s not terribly concentrated. I start around 10% with it, for this recipe we went to 12. Don’t freak out, it’s how these flavorings work. Try it. \r\n\r\nThe nicotine river concentrates are overall really good, but they’re weak and require some help to get the point across. \r\n\r\nIn this case I accentuate kilanca’s profile with a little wild melon and cantaloupe from Flavorah. \r\n\r\nI use Bull City’s 30% ws-23 because it’s the fucking best. Works great in this recipe. \r\n\r\nFinally, some super sweet cos that’s how I roll. \r\n\r\nEnjoy. It’s very very good.
