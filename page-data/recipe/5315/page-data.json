Impressive!"},{"user":"Exercyst","score":"5","text":"This has been the only juice my buddy has vaped since this recipe came out. Impressive Cannoli!"},{"user":"KenWhitfield","score":"5","text":"This is really great as is, but I want to expand at some point by adding a kiss of lemon to brighten the cream like a true cannoli. Very well done my friend!!"},{"user":"Bogey_Again","score":"5","text":"This is my favorite cannoli out of the 8 top 10 recipes in the contest. "},{"user":"BCrunk","score":"5","text":"Ay yo fam.

Making a 120 so i can see what it's like after it ages a few weeks.  This recipe got me interested in custards again."},{"user":"Coildad","score":"5","text":"I mixed this up 3 days ago and only have about 10 ml's of the 30 left. It's very yummy, Nailed the Cannnoli profile! I'm mixing a 120 right now, want to see what a few week steep does to it.&#xD;\nThanks Trance. "},{"user":"Vurve","score":"5","text":"Pretty good recipe. I happily vaped through 100ml of this and it's fairly spot on. The use of CAP NY Cheesecake and CAP Vanilla Custard mimics the cream of a cannoli very well."}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"5315","name":"Simply Cannoli"}}}
