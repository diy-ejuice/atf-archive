So I was given the task to try and come up with a mix like it. It took a long time to find the right brands of each of the flavors but I am certain and so is my Husband that I have found the right flavors. He couldn't be happier about this mix. He says it is so close to the real thing. He has vaped 2- 60ml bottles of it over the last few weeks. This one really was a labor of love and I am glad I have finally gotten close enough to be able to lay this quest to rest. lol... \r\nLindbergh Vapor Company New York to Paris: Flavor Description- Exotic Fruits and Cream. A sweet unique blend of Peach, Lychee, Coconut and Cream.\r\nWe smell and taste a light Graham Cracker finish in the original as well so that is why there is Graham in this mix.. Give it a mix and let me know what you think, have I gotten as close as my husband says I have?","steep_days":"7","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-06T20:51:36.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"1245","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Cheesecake Graham","vendor":"PUR","millipercent":1550},{"name":"Coco' (coconut)","vendor":"FA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Coconut","vendor":"INW","millipercent":350},{"name":"Lychee","vendor":"FA","millipercent":450},{"name":"Peach","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1250},{"name":"Peach White","vendor":"FA","millipercent":150},{"name":"Sweet Cream","vendor":"VT","millipercent":750},{"name":"Tahitian Vanilla Cream","vendor":"WF","millipercent":1000}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"143412","name":"New York 2 Paris v3"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
