It fulfills the role of nut (duh) but more importantly, it adds a delicious creaminess and in doing so, blends seamlessly with the toffee to create a fabulously thick and creamy toffee.  \r\nFW Hazelnut boosts the nuttiness a tad and assists further with the overall, nutty, creamy feel.\r\n\r\nCaramel Toffee and English toffee has been my go-to caramel/toffee flavour for quite some time now and is just a phenomenal combo. Itâ€™s versatility is boundless and this is my maiden voyage by using it with a nut base. It does a splendid job in creating a thick and creamy toffee with zero off notes.\r\n\r\nThis baby needs 5 days to come together and will just improve with a longer steep.\r\n\r\nEnjoy!\r\n","steep_days":"5","temperature":"0","recipe_score":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-10T16:01:44.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"1023","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Almond","flavor_id":"528","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Caramel Toffee","flavor_id":"2121","vendor":"HS","millipercent":1500},{"name":"English Toffee","flavor_id":"8873","vendor":"VT","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Hazelnut","flavor_id":"1312","vendor":"FW","millipercent":500}],"reviews":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"185451","name":"Sticky Nuts"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
