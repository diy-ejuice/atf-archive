There is so much room for customization, and this base can fit into any recipe. The recipe says itâ€™s meant to be a shake and vape, but it really shines even after steeping for a month.

Turns out to be a perfect clone of Liquid Barn's \"BASIC eLiquid TM.\" Awesome, I have been spending way too much on that stuff, now I can make it myself at home. THANK YOU!  #RecipeofTheYear P.S. It's even better if you add some flavors to it.  "},{"user":"Synergy","score":"5","text":"Immaculate amount of flavor with this guy, just bursting with berries, color and air.
