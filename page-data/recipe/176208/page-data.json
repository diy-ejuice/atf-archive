Now i like it much more.&#xD;\nThis is a simple, good old type of RY4 - D that you normally get but i feel butterscotch adds more layers to RY4D than most caramels or other sweeteners in general.&#xD;\n&#xD;\nTo make a little bit more like cigarrette tobacco  i think i'll add just a tiny bit of tpa werstern maybe around 0.3% but haven't tried it out yet. I do that because i like the little bit of tobacco flavour that ry4d shows at around 3 weeks plus of steeeping, not the same thing but tpa werstern in very small amounts exercebates that flavour at leat to me  it does.","score":0}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"176208","name":"Simple Butterscotch Tobacco"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
