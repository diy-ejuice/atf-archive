I really wanted to use VTA Shisha Blackcurrant. It is easily my favorite standalone currant flavor, but it is pretty potent and tends to want to take over a mix which is why I used it really low. The CAP Gingerbread & CAP Graham is an idea I stole from @ID10-T he used it in his recipe  https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/48608#titanic_by_id10_t. The CAP Whipped Marshmallow I used by mistake. I wanted to use CAP Vanilla Whipped Cream, but grabbed the Whipped Marsh by mistake and didn't notice it until after I mixed it, but it worked out pretty well.\r\n\r\nPLEASE RATE AND REVIEW IF YOU MIX","steep_days":"3 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-06T20:51:31.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"774","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Blackberry","vendor":"FW","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Boysenberry","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":500},{"name":"Gingerbread","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Graham Cracker","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Shisha Blackcurrant","vendor":"VT","millipercent":750},{"name":"Whipped Marshmallow","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":2000}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"138950","name":"BBB Grams"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
