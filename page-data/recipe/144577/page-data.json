We wanted something daring and lesser known to stretch our combined mixing skills. We settled on Acai berry fairly early on in the recipe development process and knew that we just had to utilize this unusual and intriguing berry.  We decided to create chocolate covered bananas without using any chocolate , as this is a fruit challenge after all...\r\n\r\nFLV Acai is a hidden gem in the mixing community (until now) and finally deserves it’s day in the sun. This mysterious berry is the fruit of the Acai palm tree and its flavour profile is a cross between a blackberry, raspberry and chocolate! The inherent tartness and realistic, rich berry flavour is second to none, but that is not the best part... This little gem has a little trick up its sleeve! The acai berry’s natural cocoa characteristics comes through beautifully on the exhale and provides a rich, natural chocolate note. \r\n\r\nTPA Banana Cream was the obvious banana choice, given the vendor restriction for the compo. The banana cream, with its innate creamy banana custard characteristics, is the perfect vehicle to receive the rich, dark chocolate sauce bestowed on it.\r\n\r\nFA Pear’s role is to impart some juiciness and sweetness without detracting for our heroes and does the job here with ease. \r\n\r\nThis is how you pronounce it https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f7/A%C3%A7a%C3%AD.ogg ","steep_days":"3 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-06T20:44:42.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"1794","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Acai","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Banana Cream","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Pear","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"144577","name":"Palmana"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
