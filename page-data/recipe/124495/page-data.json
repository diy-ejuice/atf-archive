Additionally, I wanted TPA Meringue for the sweet powdered sugar properties that it would bring to this candy nougat.\r\n\r\nLemon Meringue Pie V2 (CAP): This was just a stroke of genius, a hunch, whatever you call it, but I was toying with this recipe using Toffees and had an \"AHA\" moment , â€¦ so I tried it and I liked it.... \r\n\r\nVienna Cream (FA) :  Vienna cream adds to that creamy punch needed to balance the nuttiness of Torrone\r\n\r\nVanilla Swirl (TPA): Again to add dimension to the creaminess and hopefully, at 2 %, add some chewiness to the recipe.\r\n\r\n\r\nI hope you enjoy this as much as I do. You comments are welcome and appreciated. \r\n\r\n","steep_days":"1 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"total_reviews":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-06T20:44:22.000-05:00","best_vg":"65%","views":"1097","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Torrone","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Lemon Meringue Pie V2","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Vanilla Swirl","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Cream Fresh","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1250},{"name":"Meringue","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1250},{"name":"Vienna Cream","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Almond","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1250},{"name":"Marzipan (yc)","vendor":"INW","millipercent":400},{"name":"Ethyl Maltol","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":250},{"name":"sweetener (sucralose)","vendor":"OTHR","millipercent":1250}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"124495","name":"Torrone Lemon Nougat"}}}
