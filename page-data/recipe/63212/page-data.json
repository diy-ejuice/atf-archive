I prefer a good 1-2 week steep on it, but there's never enough to last that long.\r\n\r\nHappy mixing. ðŸ‘½","steep_days":"5 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":4,"total_reviews":1,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:49:35.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"1911","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Strawberry","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Vanilla Bean Ice Cream","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Sweet Strawberry","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":4000},{"name":"French Vanilla Icecream","vendor":"HS","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Meringue","vendor":"FA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Super Sweet","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":250}],"reviews":[{"user":"cdaniell30","score":"4","text":"When I make this again, I'll probably sub Strawberry Ripe in for TPA strawb, but the cream base is nice and rich."}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"63212","name":"Pinky"}}}
