I prefer a good 1-2 week steep on it, but there's never enough to last that long.\r\n\r\nHappy mixing. ðŸ‘½","steep_days":"5 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":4,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:49:35.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"1911","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Strawberry","flavor_id":"272","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Vanilla Bean Ice Cream","flavor_id":"186","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Sweet Strawberry","flavor_id":"121","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":4000},{"name":"French Vanilla Icecream","flavor_id":"2129","vendor":"HS","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Meringue","flavor_id":"530","vendor":"FA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Super Sweet","flavor_id":"2384","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":250}],"reviews":[{"user":"cdaniell30","text":"When I make this again, I'll probably sub Strawberry Ripe in for TPA strawb, but the cream base is nice and rich."}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"63212","name":"Pinky"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
