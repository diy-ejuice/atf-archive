Enjoy!\r\n\r\nFLV MM, Lemonade, and Passionfruit are the\r\nessentially the cocktail base. You could\r\nlayer almost anything on these and get a\r\nreasonable \"cocktail\" vibe unless you go too\r\ncandy/syrupy. \r\n\r\nGrapefruit is pretty straightforward, 3 part \r\nlayer. \r\n\r\nI chose FW Sweetener because A: It needed a \r\nsmidge and B: It's superior to CAP SS in \r\nevery way possible.\r\n\r\nNote: I didn't include WS-23 in the original recipe, but I feel that .5% really elevates it a step beyond. But not everyone likes cooling effects so use your judgment here. I think it really adds something special to the finished juice, but not everyone will feel that way likely.","steep_days":"3","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"updated_at":"2020-12-12T10:34:58.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"2490","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Morning Mimosa","flavor_id":"8558","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Passionfruit SC","flavor_id":"10100","vendor":"WF","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Ruby Red Grapefruit","flavor_id":"1404","vendor":"FW","millipercent":3500},{"name":"Pink Guava","flavor_id":"637","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":500},{"name":"White Grapefruit","flavor_id":"892","vendor":"INW","millipercent":250},{"name":"Lemonade","flavor_id":"636","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Sweetener","flavor_id":"1432","vendor":"FW","millipercent":500}],"reviews":[{"user":"ID10-T","text":"I added 0.5% WS-23 with Kopel’s encouragement. I can’t tell you how well it works or sparkles without it, but with the cooling in there, that is 100% grapefruit mimosa. The combination of grapefruit flavors including Pink Guava is a well-rounded ruby red grapefruit juice. I’m surprised that sparkling wine base isn’t too funky, with that Morning Mimosa that has that prison wine vibe and a pretty ripe passion fruit flavor from WF, but the sweet lemonade seems to clean it up real nice.
