FLV Apple filling and CAP double apple provide the spiced stewed apple, finally VTA English toffee thickens that curd up further and brings a nice buttery finish.\r\n\r\nLastly it’s all topped off with whipped meringue that WF flapper pie provides so brilliantly.\r\n\r\nthis is really good off the shake but the apple is too tart and the toffee doesn’t show up until a week into the steep, best after around a week but the longer the better.\r\n\r\nIf you like this recipe and what I do then please rate and review :)\r\n","steep_days":"7","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:50:50.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"2252","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Double Apple","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Apple Filling","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Custard Premium","vendor":"FA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Flapper Pie SC","vendor":"WF","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Apple Pie","vendor":"FA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Super Sweet","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":500},{"name":"English Toffee","vendor":"VT","millipercent":4500}],"reviews":[{"user":"Nickinthemix","text":"It is an ADV for sure if you like this profile!
