One of those recipes that, to me, tastes 110% like the picture in the description. I swear the lemon comes in the front, followed by a delicious sugar cookie, covered in a lemon flavored powdered sugar glaze. It's a great play on layers, i feel as though you taste two different lemons here, sandwiched around an amazing cookie base. I don't typically vape a lot of lemon or even baked goods for that matter but something about this has me coming back for more. I have made over a gallon of this stuff over the last year or so for me and my friends, it's safe to say this is my favorite most ADV I've had thus far."},{"user":"KingPiggums","text":"Can't believe I haven't reviewed this yet since I've been vaping it almost exclusively for the past 2 months. Probably my favorite recipe on ATF. Tastes just like a lemon cookie and I can easily vape it all day every day. Fantastic MTL or DL and anywhere in between. It's just a really good all around mix. If you've got the stuff for it and you haven't mixed it, I can't recommend it highly enough. "},{"user":"spicemustflow","text":"I can't speak to how well this would fare after a proper steep because I haven't had a bottle last longer than 5 days, but for those 5 glorious days this is a 10/10 recipe. Beautifully balanced, reminds me of yo-yo/'melting moment' biscuits I loved as a kid. Great work!"},{"user":"RockyHarlow","text":"Fantastic Lemon Cookie. The high percentage of FA Lemon Sicily may initially throw some people off, but it really does well to stand up to the supporting elements in the mix. After about 2 weeks the lemon really starts to fade, but alas it is rare for a bottle to last that long. Outstanding recipe and I hope more people will try it."},{"user":"Grorco","text":"I tried this right off the shake, and it was like having an actual lemon cookie, I was completely amazed. I had my wife try it and she immediately told me she wanted me to mix her some, the first desert she has ever liked! However after steeping the flavors melded together a little too much for me. Still a delightful lemon cookie, but you just can't pick out the individual notes like meringue as easily. I think this is 5 stars for a snv and hits spot on to the description, after a bit of a steep I think it actually drops down a bit to 4.5 but still is a wonderful vape! "},{"user":"cdaniell30","text":"Pretty damn good lemon cookie mix"},{"user":"photohap","text":"Very good cookie recipe.  Basic and to the point.  Flavor is great right off the bat, definitely a shake and vape.  Good job."}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"80042","name":"Biscotti Al Limone"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
