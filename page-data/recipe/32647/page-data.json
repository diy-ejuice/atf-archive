I'll give it a whirl.\r\n\r\nI don't have much from the JF line but what I do own, I love. So far i've tried their strawberry sweet, biscuit, yellow cake and lemon juicy; all excellent. \r\n\r\nHere is a recipe to highlight how yummy strawberry sweet can be, and how nicely it can play with everybody else.\r\n\r\n*The Strawberry*\r\nGoing for a macerated strawberry effect. JF Strawberry sweet is already 90% there, the addition of FW hazelnut and FA meringue just bring it to another level. This strawberry takes a couple of days to really shine. Meringue brings a ton of powdered sugar. Hazelnut boosts the strawberry and also plays very well with our buttery stuff.\r\n\r\n*The Butter*\r\nTPA butter is the obvious choice. I threw in CAP sugar cookie because it is buttery, and sweet and adds to the butter effect in this mix. FW hazelnut is also playing a role in the butter taste. In this recipe, hazelnut is doing triple overtime playing a role in the strawberry, butter and cream.\r\n\r\n*The Cream*\r\nI did not want this to be a super creamy or milky thing, this is buttercream. The butter is also the cream but we've got one other guy to give this recipe a full bodied creaminess. \r\nFA vienna cream in combination with FW hazelnut, CAP sugar cookie and FA meringue make this recipe smooth and thick like butter(cream). \r\n\r\nThere it is, pretty simple and I tried to use some of the most common basket ingredients so everyone could mix this up, enjoy!\r\n\r\nI've only just shake and vaped this one but it is very similar to another recipe i've been working on. Give it 3-4 days, strawberry sweet needs to steep. \r\n\r\n\r\nOPTIONAL ADD ON: TPA Vanilla Swirl 1%, let it steep a week for that tablespoon of vanilla extract effect.
