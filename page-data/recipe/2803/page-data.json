Flavors on point super delicious. It's a bit muted for me but I'm pretty much flavor blind so I'm going to step it up a little the next time I make it. But I'm definitely making more then a 10ml next time!"},{"user":"Ebc88","score":"5","text":"Excellent job this is 1st recipe of yours i have tired and it did not disappoint "},{"user":"tw2k","score":"5","text":""},{"user":"mlNikon","score":"5","text":"You did it again Cheebs, another banger. This is a very well balanced recipe imo. It is sweet and creamy without being cloyingly so. The banana meshes so well with the butterscotch. Good job on this killer recipe."}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"2803","name":"Butterscotch Banana Frozen Custard"}}}
