Flavors on point super delicious. It's a bit muted for me but I'm pretty much flavor blind so I'm going to step it up a little the next time I make it.

This is a very well balanced recipe imo. It is sweet and creamy without being cloyingly so. The banana meshes so well with the butterscotch. Good job on this killer recipe."}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"2803","name":"Butterscotch Banana Frozen Custard"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
