Problem is he found everything too sweet or it always had something extra, it was never just a straight tobacco. So one drunken night I whipped this up for him. Got lucky the first try and this has been his ADV since then. If you find yourself really craving the taste of a cancer stick or just have someone that is just wanting to get into vaping have them try this.\r\n\r\nThe Desert Ship and RY4 is what really makes the tobacco flavor that I think a lot of people miss, then with addition of the Flue Cured it gives it that slight ash flavor.","steep_days":"1 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":4,"total_reviews":1,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:49:12.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"1999","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Desert Ship","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Flue Cured Tobacco","vendor":"INW","millipercent":500},{"name":"Ry4 Double","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":3000}],"reviews":[{"user":"goosegirl","score":"4","text":"I tried this one out, and although it is not exactly what I was looking for, it is a good mix.
