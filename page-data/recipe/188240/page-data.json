I designed this recipe with the intentions of it being a S&V and free of any extra sweetener however I did give in to temptation and add 0.25% CAP Super Sweet and found it absolutely delicious so if you do like that added sweetness then I would recommend as above,it doesnâ€™t need it though IMO. The profile to this recipe is a banana and blueberries blending with a light coconut cream. If you enjoy this recipe and my work please be so kind to leave a short review and rating on said recipe so that other mixers can see. Happy mixing guys and gals and stay hazey ðŸ˜‰ðŸ’™","steep_days":"3 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-10T16:01:46.000-05:00","best_vg":"75%","views":"1098","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Banana Custard","flavor_id":"8825","vendor":"VT","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Soft Banana","flavor_id":"1524","vendor":"MB","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Blueberry Jam","flavor_id":"8837","vendor":"VT","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Blueberry","flavor_id":"1201","vendor":"FW","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Madagascar (Vanilla Classic)","flavor_id":"526","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Vanilla Pudding","flavor_id":"4433","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Sweet Coconut","flavor_id":"605","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":500}],"reviews":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"188240","name":"Blue Haze"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
