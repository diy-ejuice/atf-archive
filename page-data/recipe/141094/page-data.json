I figured a Tropical vibe would be weird enough with a Grape layer and gave it a try.\r\n\r\nThis turned out very tasty! A strange and delicious mix that I can only describe as a Pink or slight red Tropical fruit Juice with a unique mouth watering grape twist to it.\r\n\r\nThe Pink - The combination of the Shisha strawberry and FLV Pink Guava is where I got the tropical notes from. The Shisha melting the tropical guava and Citrus notes down into a sweet nectar that mixes into the Grape layer.\r\n\r\nWS23 - added to bring in the cool Beverage boost\r\n\r\nSweetner - Yes add it. the profile is not the same if you leave it out. I would say the lowest the SS should go is 0.25... LOWEST!\r\n\r\nGive this a Mix if you are looking for something fresh\r\n\r\nShakeNVape This!!\r\n\r\nChanges: If you like a longer lasting Guava, Add some CAP Sweet Guava to this!\r\n\r\n","steep_days":"1 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:50:45.000-05:00","best_vg":"65%","views":"1067","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Moscato","flavor_id":"8559","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Apple Fuji","flavor_id":"4886","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Country Apple","flavor_id":"7754","vendor":"PUR","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Pear","flavor_id":"411","vendor":"FA","millipercent":250},{"name":"Shisha Strawberry","flavor_id":"1711","vendor":"INW","millipercent":2600},{"name":"Pink Guava","flavor_id":"637","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Super Sweet","flavor_id":"2384","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":400},{"name":"WS-23","flavor_id":"8085","vendor":"OTHR","millipercent":400}],"reviews":[{"user":"ID10-T","text":"This is awesome! It’s a very sweet and very juicy tropical strawberry, guava, and white white grape fruit punch. This is much, much better than the Cheap Date. Even though it has what looks like a scary amount of Moscato to me, it’s combined with other strong flavors that stomps down that laundry room sort of floral into nonexistence, though it does taste like there’s a bit of lychee in here, that works with a tropical punch. There’s some magic going on here in that the pink grapefruit citrus quality of the Pink Guava is pushed or pulled down, but the bit of tropical funkiness comes through. I think the Shisha Strawberry is doing a lot of the heavy lifting here. Strawberry and guava is a great combination, first of all, but it makes me want to explore more things that combine Shisha Strawberry with Moscato. It’s almost like a tropical version of strawberry wine. It seems like you could use that pairing, maybe with some FLV Oak Barrel and a touch of FLV Sangria and make a traditional strawberry wine, which might be amazing. The apples and pear just sort of fade into the fruity body the way apple juice is a benign component in a lot of fruit punches. If this were a Capri Sun flavor, I’d guzzle it, just like I’ve been guzzling this slightly weird but wonderful juice.
