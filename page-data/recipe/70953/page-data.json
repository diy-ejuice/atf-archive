The Raspberry cuts though the often monotonous notes of the Blueberry and offers a refreshing angle to this mix. \r\n\r\nLet the berries mingle for at least a week before enjoying this baby!\r\n","steep_days":"10","temperature":"0","recipe_score":4,"updated_at":"2020-12-12T14:05:50.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"2454","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Creme Brulee (yc)","flavor_id":"894","vendor":"INW","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Custard","flavor_id":"4210","vendor":"INW","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Blueberry","flavor_id":"1201","vendor":"FW","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Bilberry","flavor_id":"533","vendor":"FA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Raspberry","flavor_id":"667","vendor":"INW","millipercent":1000}],"reviews":[{"user":"DeadHer0ine","text":"This recipe is fantastic. Reminiscent of Liquid State's Cowboy Cobbler, which makes me want to play with the recipe to get a little closer. A nice sharp berry flavor that still cuts through the cream and sugar of the heavy brulee base.","score":5},{"user":"SlashaLO","text":"Let me start off with: This is tasty af. Like, really freaking good Your addition of Raspberry had me worried at first, but after it settled down, it plays with the blueberries so well, I love it. I will probably take this idea to switch up my berries too honestly. I love the INW custard/brulee combo, one of my favorite combos, which is why I mixed this up. I get no off notes from Brulee being this high, where I know some will. The reason I gave it 4 stars, was more of confusion though. The title is Brulee, but in the description you called it a custard, but then you said it was using your brulee base? When making this, I personally expected a Brulee, which unfortunately I don't get a brulee, as much as I do a rich creaminess. I feel for me, the berries cover some of the notes that the brulee is supposed to give off. If this is supposed to be more of a custard, then I would say 5 stars. No matter what, this is freaking lovely and I love it. ","score":4}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"70953","name":"Blueberry Brulee"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
