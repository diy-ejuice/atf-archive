Reminiscent of Liquid State's Cowboy Cobbler, which makes me want to play with the recipe to get a little closer. A nice sharp berry flavor that still cuts through the cream and sugar of the heavy brulee base."},{"user":"SlashaLO","text":"Let me start off with: This is tasty af. Like, really freaking good Your addition of Raspberry had me worried at first, but after it settled down, it plays with the blueberries so well, I love it. I will probably take this idea to switch up my berries too honestly. I love the INW custard/brulee combo, one of my favorite combos, which is why I mixed this up. I get no off notes from Brulee being this high, where I know some will. The reason I gave it 4 stars, was more of confusion though. The title is Brulee, but in the description you called it a custard, but then you said it was using your brulee base? When making this, I personally expected a Brulee, which unfortunately I don't get a brulee, as much as I do a rich creaminess. I feel for me, the berries cover some of the notes that the brulee is supposed to give off. If this is supposed to be more of a custard, then I would say 5 stars. No matter what, this is freaking lovely and I love it. "}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"70953","name":"Blueberry Brulee"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
