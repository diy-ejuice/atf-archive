NOT OVERPOWERED AND MADE FOR AN ALL DAY VAPE. \r\nDEFINATELY ONE OF MY FAVOURITE JUICES FROM MINE! \r\n\r\nNOTES:\r\n\r\nCAP Creamy yogurt / TPA Dairy Milk: this is the cream base with an extra light tartness and a fully white creaminess from the yogurt combined with dairy milk to give a light milk taste.\r\n\r\nCAP Vanilla bean ice cream / FW Vanilla bean ice cream / CAP Vanilla whipped cream: CAP VBIC used to boost a little the vanilla profile without exceeding and FW VBIC to give a sweet ice cream base to the ice cream base. CAP Vanilla whipped cream give that extra whipped cream profile to the ice cream.\r\n\r\nCAP Blue Raspberry cotton candy: a sweet blue Raspberry touch to emulsionate the fruits and give a an extra airy layer to the creams.\r\n\r\nFA Bilberry / INA Blackcurrant / TPA Berry crunch: this is the main purple fruit note: FA is a genuine bilberry flavor and here it act like a base for the INA Blackcurrant which has a wonderful genuine 'Cassis' profile (very concentrated flavor, I started @ 0.3% and then decided to stop @ 0.75% because the risk of obtaining a too much florar profile). TPA Berry crunch give a rounded boost to the berries without being too crunchy @ 1.5%.\r\n\r\nFA Blackcurrant: FA blackcurrant is different from the INA version: it is more like a red currant instead of a black one, and in this this recipe is used to give depth and complexity to the berry part. \r\n\r\nFA Blackberry: FA Blackberry is an extreme concentrated flavor and here I was searching for an added depth to the other berries 0.05% (3 drops in 60mls) is spot on, just the amount to be noticeable without overpower everything.","steep_days":"5 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T09:43:45.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"2959","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Berry Crunch","flavor_id":"136","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Bilberry","flavor_id":"533","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Blackberry","flavor_id":"534","vendor":"FA","millipercent":50},{"name":"Blackcurrant","flavor_id":"545","vendor":"FA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Blackcurrant","flavor_id":"645","vendor":"INW","millipercent":750},{"name":"Blue Raspberry Cotton Candy","flavor_id":"15","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Creamy Yogurt","flavor_id":"5","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Dairy/Milk","flavor_id":"2164","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Vanilla Bean Ice Cream","flavor_id":"4","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Vanilla Bean Ice Cream","flavor_id":"1451","vendor":"FW","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Vanilla Whipped Cream","flavor_id":"1","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1500}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"53462","name":"Dip Purple"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
