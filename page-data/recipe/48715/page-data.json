Something about \"log in to post\", but I wanted to hit you up about this...I mixed some up on morning 6/2... Went to work, came home and tried it.

I've been on the hunt for a great Strawberry Cheesecake recipe and I haven't quenched my thirst yet... Anyways, I've been shaking the hell out of it and I got it in my steeping box hoping everything will settle down in a couple days...ðŸ¤ž","score":2}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"48715","name":"Devils Favorite Strawberry!!!!!!!!"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
