Something about \"log in to post\", but I wanted to hit you up about this...I mixed some up on morning 6/2... Went to work, came home and tried it. I'm thinking that the CCF is pretty high especially with 1% SS...I used .5% SS and it still seems SWEET! Also the GC is high? Everything else seems good but I keep getting a cinn-off note and alot of sugaryness to my mix... I've been on the hunt for a great Strawberry Cheesecake recipe and I haven't quenched my thirst yet... Anyways, I've been shaking the hell out of it and I got it in my steeping box hoping everything will settle down in a couple days...ðŸ¤ž"}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"48715","name":"Devils Favorite Strawberry!!!!!!!!"}}}
