This stuff is more potent than Kryptonite and should not be taken lightly... I have taken it to 1.5% as a single flavour but anything over that mutes the delicate plum and turns this stuff putrid.\r\n\r\nThe INW Sesame adds a little intrigue and is a perfect partner for any stone fruit. Feel free to omit the sesame it if you do not have it - BUT, I highly reccommmend it.\r\n\r\nI can write an dissertation on the INW Creme Brulee and Custard combo but I will restrain myself.  Is is my go-to combo and it just works beautifully to create a stunning thick and luscious custard base with that delicious Brulee finish...\r\n\r\nGive this at least 5 days to come together...","steep_days":"5","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-05T18:47:10.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"1379","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Creme Brulee (yc)","vendor":"INW","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Custard","vendor":"INW","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Smoked Plum","vendor":"INW","millipercent":500},{"name":"Sesame","vendor":"INW","millipercent":100}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"34233","name":"Plum Custée"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
