If you would like to submit a clone request, please visit this link https://www.facebook.com/notes/freedom-to-mix/suggest-remixesclones/461914887596726/ and I will do my best to create a remix.\r\n\r\nVaper's Knoll describes this as a blue rock candy with berries and cotton candy and that's a very good description of the profile. It's a pretty straight forward recipe, but when vaping the original, I was picking up on a hint of creaminess. So I added CAP Creamy Yogurt at 1.5%. This seems to \"break-up\" the fruits a bit and adds a deeper dimension to the recipe. It's defiantly not a yogurt profile, and adding it doesn't turn it into a yogurt profile. It just adds depth to the over-all recipe.\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks to Avon Barksdale for sending this remix suggestion. If you like candy vapes, I'm sure this will be one you will like. This can be a shake and vape, but just a couple days and it's better.\r\n\r\nAny comments, reviews, good or bad is welcomed. It makes us all better mixers. :)\r\nVisit Freedom To Mix on Discord https://discord.gg/cMUjtPf\r\nJoin our Freedom To Mix FaceBook group https://www.facebook.com/groups/415341418920740/ \r\nVisit https://freedomtomix.com/ for resources and information on DIY mixing!\r\n\r\n\r\n","steep_days":"3 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-12T03:45:57.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"4798","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Creamy Yogurt","flavor_id":"5","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Blackcurrant","flavor_id":"545","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Raspberry (sweet)","flavor_id":"267","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Cotton Candy","flavor_id":"941","vendor":"LA","millipercent":500}],"reviews":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"107412","name":"Blue Moon (Lunar Harvest Remix)"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
