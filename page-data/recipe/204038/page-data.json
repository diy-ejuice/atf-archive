A chill in the air. Along with the chill comes the spiced pumpkin lattes and cakes. I'll be honest. I can't stand carrot cake. Carrots in a cake??? Hmmmm no. VTA Carrot Cake as a vape?? Amazing!!! The sweet spot is at 5%. It is a wonderfully deep-rounded cake. I wanted to give the cake a spicy aspect. I didn't have to look far. FLV Pumpkin Spice compliments VTA Carrot Cake wonderfully. This stuff is strong so I only needed .7%. VTA Vanilla Buttercream Frosting is a deep and delicious cream. It's so buttery and thick. With VTA Carrot Cake there's no need to add that many flavors. I kept it simple and I'm really enjoying it.\r\n\r\nEnjoy and share your feedback.","steep_days":"5","temperature":"0","recipe_score":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-12T15:41:15.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"404","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Carrot Cake","flavor_id":"9279","vendor":"VT","millipercent":5000},{"name":"Pumpkin Spice","flavor_id":"4436","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":700},{"name":"Vanilla Buttercream Frosting","flavor_id":"8990","vendor":"VT","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Super Sweet","flavor_id":"2384","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":500}],"reviews":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"204038","name":"Pumpkin Spiced Carrot Cake "}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
