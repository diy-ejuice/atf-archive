Let's put that in a bottle, yeah? I took the cream base for \"Ginger Sauce\" and augmented it a bit to make a caramel cream that is sure to knock at that sweet tooth. FA Caramel and FA Catalan Cream were made for each other, and a quick sniff of the two is plenty enough to tell anyone that.  I took out the CAP Graham Cracker v1 and CAP Vanilla Custard v1 out of \"Ginger Sauce\" and kept the cream base for this recipe. It's fairly straightforward.  I hope you enjoy it.","steep_days":"0","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"total_reviews":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-06T11:39:02.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"1838","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Carmel (caramel)","vendor":"FA","millipercent":3500},{"name":"Catalan Cream","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Marshmallow","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"New York Cheesecake","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":650},{"name":"Sweet Cream","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Vanilla Bean Ice Cream","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":3000}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"15198","name":"Jenny From the Block"}}}
