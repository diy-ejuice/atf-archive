Let's put that in a bottle, yeah? I took the cream base for \"Ginger Sauce\" and augmented it a bit to make a caramel cream that is sure to knock at that sweet tooth. FA Caramel and FA Catalan Cream were made for each other, and a quick sniff of the two is plenty enough to tell anyone that.  I took out the CAP Graham Cracker v1 and CAP Vanilla Custard v1 out of \"Ginger Sauce\" and kept the cream base for this recipe. It's fairly straightforward.  I hope you enjoy it.","steep_days":"0","temperature":"0","recipe_score":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-10T13:44:21.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"1845","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Carmel (caramel)","flavor_id":"503","vendor":"FA","millipercent":3500},{"name":"Catalan Cream","flavor_id":"483","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Marshmallow","flavor_id":"473","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"New York Cheesecake","flavor_id":"90","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":650},{"name":"Sweet Cream","flavor_id":"117","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Vanilla Bean Ice Cream","flavor_id":"186","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":3000}],"reviews":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"15198","name":"Jenny From the Block"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
