It‚Äôs comments like this that keep myself and many other mixers longing to help people on their journey with quitting the stinkys. Feel free to add your sweetener of choice, I personally enjoy this the most with 0.50% CAP SUPER SWEET and I must also say this recipe works great with WS-23 @0.50%. Please mix it up and leave me your feedback good or bad (S&V APPROVED) peaks @ 3 days. P.S *** if you prefer an alcoholic tinge, remove the CAP sweet guava and add FLV Brut bubble wine @ 2% üëåüèª","steep_days":"3 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T17:35:51.000-05:00","best_vg":"80%","views":"1188","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Cactus","flavor_id":"647","vendor":"INW","millipercent":750},{"name":"Cucumber","flavor_id":"43","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Dragon Fruit - Pitaya","flavor_id":"652","vendor":"INW","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Persian Lime","flavor_id":"8942","vendor":"VT","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Pink Guava","flavor_id":"637","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Sweet Guava","flavor_id":"118","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Shisha Strawberry","flavor_id":"1711","vendor":"INW","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Strawberry (ripe)","flavor_id":"271","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":4000}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"160629","name":"Pimm‚Äôs O‚Äôclock "}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
