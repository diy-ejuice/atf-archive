Grape vapes are often taken for granted as they seem to be a ‘common’ fruit... BUT, when used correctly, it pays homage to the magnificence that is the humble grape. \r\n\r\nInw grape celebrates the grape, in its full glory, with a master stroke. Inawera has a nack for creating the most authentic fruit flavours and this is evident in INW Grape. It is a well balanced authentic grape with no profile dominating (sweet or acidity) which creates the most incredible, busts in your mouth, true grape flavour. This beauty does not contain the skin nor pips, which can often bring an unwanted bitter element.\r\n\r\nThe Fuji and Cactus provides a little juicyness and prevents linearity, often present in simple fruit vapes.\r\nThe cream adds a touch of mouthfeel to provide a bit of body and adds a little intrigue.\r\nWS23 (or cooling agent of your choice) can be omitted or altered, depending on your taste profile.\r\n\r\nGive this one 3 days to settle and she’s ready to go!","steep_days":"3 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":4.5,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:50:09.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"7313","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Grape","vendor":"INW","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Cream Fresh","vendor":"FA","millipercent":500},{"name":"WS-23","vendor":"OTHR","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Apple Fuji","vendor":"FA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Cactus","vendor":"INW","millipercent":500}],"reviews":[{"user":"CatWillMew","text":"The flavor profile is right on for this (maybe a little less sweet than an actual Icee, but that's ok).  But I think something is muting the flavor a little here which keeps it from being perfect."},{"user":"amouthforwar","text":"Super simple, stellar vape. INW grape was a great choice and I think is probably the swiss army knife of grapes IMO. Usage of Fuji and Cactus are at the perfect amounts to add that juiciness and a bit of snap to the grape. Didn't notice any flavor from the fresh cream, but it did add a nice silky smooth note to the whole thing. Can't stop vaping this mix! Perfect for summer."}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"100426","name":"Icee Grape"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
