Won the alchemist flavorah pack from fotw drawing and was researching red cinnamon from odies flavor facts. Found the cinnamon episode I had seen before but forgot the red cinnamon review as I didn't have that flavor at the time. I believe Dave or Emily mentioned apple option i thought sounded interesting so i thought of sour apple first to compliment the candy componet of red cinnamon.  Then wanted another apple to soften the sour and not more tart so ended up with inw 2 apples.  The last part was finding a bridge from red cinn inhale to apple exhale but it ended up being more of a binder. Caramel was the obvious answer. So used the old stand by with caramel candy to achieve a deeper flavor that's there but still let's the apple peek through. 0.25 percent on the red cinnamon provides a full sticky mouth feel and just works with the sour/tart of the apples. Hope you enjoy, it's different and delicious. Shake and vape approved but the caramel will develop after a couple days.","steep_days":"4 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-05T15:44:49.000-05:00","best_vg":"65%","views":"468","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Red Cinnamon","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":250},{"name":"Sour Apple","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Two Apples","vendor":"INW","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Caramel Candy","vendor":"FW","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Caramel (salted)","vendor":"FW","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Sweetener","vendor":"FW","millipercent":500}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"194974","name":"Hot Sin Apple"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
