Not that it’s not a good pair with the apple profile. It’s just that CAP kiwi always reminded me more of a pear then a kiwi. In this mix it works that way, to soften a bit the Fuji. If you don’t have (cause it’s not much used), 1% marshmallow worked well and made it fluffiest.\r\n\r\nI didn’t put it, cause the challenge was making only fruit and mint. \r\n\r\nHope you MintAddicted enjoy this one! \r\n\r\nLots of love and flavor <3\r\n","steep_days":"2 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"total_reviews":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T00:08:34.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"734","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Kiwi","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Apple Fuji","vendor":"FA","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Koolada 10 Pg","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":750},{"name":"Menthol Liquid (pg)","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Super Sweet","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":500},{"name":"Acai","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1000}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"177241","name":"Freezy Apple"}}}
