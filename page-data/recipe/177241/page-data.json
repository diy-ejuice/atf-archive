Not that it’s not a good pair with the apple profile. It’s just that CAP kiwi always reminded me more of a pear then a kiwi. In this mix it works that way, to soften a bit the Fuji. If you don’t have (cause it’s not much used), 1% marshmallow worked well and made it fluffiest.\r\n\r\nI didn’t put it, cause the challenge was making only fruit and mint. \r\n\r\nHope you MintAddicted enjoy this one! \r\n\r\nLots of love and flavor <3\r\n","steep_days":"2 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-10T14:53:31.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"740","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Kiwi","flavor_id":"5855","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Apple Fuji","flavor_id":"4886","vendor":"FA","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Koolada 10 Pg","flavor_id":"280","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":750},{"name":"Menthol Liquid (pg)","flavor_id":"281","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Super Sweet","flavor_id":"2384","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":500},{"name":"Acai","flavor_id":"204","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1000}],"reviews":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"177241","name":"Freezy Apple"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
