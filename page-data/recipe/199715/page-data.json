Needs a transformation so removed ingredients and tweaked flavour percentages. \r\n\r\nHoneycomb Ice Cream w̶i̶l̶l̶ ̶b̶e̶ ̶b̶a̶c̶k̶ is back :D\r\n\r\nThe journey-\r\n\r\nRemoved the following as there was either no reason for them or were muting the recipe=\r\nCoffee Milk Froth VT | Greek Yogurt FLV | Pound Cake FLV | Smoked Butterscotch FLV | Smooth Vanilla FLV |\r\n\r\nThis has now left me with the flavours that will create that Honeycomb Ice Cream i'm looking for.\r\n\r\nButterscotch Ripple FW (single flavour test @ 6%)- I get a light toffee, gooey, creamy flavour from this, perfect for the toffee/honeycomb in this recipe.\r\nHokey Pokey Ice Cream VT (SFT @ 3%)- Again very simliar to the Butterscotch Ripple. Creamy, slightly sweet toffee flavour.\r\nVanilla Ice Cream LB (SFT @ 7%)- Strong and flavourfull Vanilla cream, almost like i'm sipping a bowl of melted vanilla ice cream.\r\nHoneycomb VT (SFT @ 3%)- I get a subtle Honeycomb. Not a blow your face off profile, will need to back up with another toffee or dark cream.\r\nCream FLV (SFT @ 2%)-A beautifully smooth slightly sweet creamy flavour. \r\nDevon Cream VT (SFT 3%)- I think this will go well in a Honeycomb Vape. Its dark, creamy, and has a subtle Toffee note to it.\r\n\r\nSo i've now refined the recipe to 6 flavours plus Super Sweet.\r\nButterscotch ripple and Hokey Pokey both tasted fairly similar in my opinion, but they both have a unique taste so wanted to keep them both in the mix. Butterscotch Ripple in at 1.5% and Hokey Pokey at 3%. \r\nI also included VT Devon Cream as it has a nice dark taste to it, which I feel goes well with the Toffee/ Honeycomb.\r\nI lowered down the Honeycomb for 4% to 2.5% as I think I was over doing it 1st time round, leading to muting issues. 2.5% tastes like the perfect balance here.\r\nAlso kept the FLV cream, but this time increasing from 0.25% to 0.8% really helping soften and smooth out the various creams in the recipe.\r\n\r\nThis time round I get a lovely creamy and sweet vape. Flavour really shines, whereas before there was way to much going on and flavours were getting lost. \r\n\r\nGive it a try and let me know what you think!!\r\n\r\n\r\nTested on an Entheon RDA with Fused Staple .20 @  0.52Ω & Citadel RDA with Fused Staple .20 @ 0.37Ω both 45W\r\n\r\n","steep_days":"3","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T17:36:28.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"1120","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Butterscotch Ripple","flavor_id":"1217","vendor":"FW","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Hokey Pokey Ice Cream","flavor_id":"10018","vendor":"VT","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Vanilla Ice Cream","flavor_id":"1511","vendor":"LB","millipercent":5000},{"name":"Honeycomb","flavor_id":"8901","vendor":"VT","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Milk","flavor_id":"523","vendor":"FA","millipercent":750},{"name":"Devon Cream","flavor_id":"4223","vendor":"CC","millipercent":250},{"name":"Super Sweet","flavor_id":"2384","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":500}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"199715","name":"The Honeycomb Ice Cream"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
