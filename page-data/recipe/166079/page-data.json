I was thinking of adding a tad more of citrus soda, but it is perfect at .85%. Great job!"},{"user":"beeker","text":"A deliciously crisp and unique blend of melon, apple and pear flavors that compliment one another perfectly. Remniscent of some of the more exotic Jones gourmet sodas-- which I adore. You won't regret mixing this one up! (Note: I didn't have any prickly pear on hand, but vish suggested I substitute 0.75% cactus and 0.75% WF Ripe Pear SC instead)."}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"166079","name":"Prickly Soda  "}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
