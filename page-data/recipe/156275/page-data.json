Right off the shake **HS Banana** will be quite candy like, but after just a day or two of steeping it becomes much more realistic and in line with the mango.\r\n**FLV Citrus Soda** & **CAP Lemon Lime** is my go-to fizz combo and together with the cooling from **WS-23** it's really refreshing to vape. FLV Citrus Soda brings those sharp citrus notes to give that fizzy feel, and CAP Lemon Lime adds another dimension of citrus with those sweet tart lemon lime notes.\r\n\r\nSeeing as the mango and banana both are sweet and relatively \"bold\" in their texture, they pair beautifully with the fresh citrus notes and together with the cooling it makes for a very refreshing vape.\r\nUnfortunately we don't have **PUR Banana** available anywhere in EU, but what I have read and heard about it, I can see it being a possible sub for HS Banana.\r\n\r\nPersonally I wouldn't recommend adding any sweetener to this, as I think it removes the freshness of the citrus notes in this recipe.","steep_days":"1 (SNV)","temperature":"420","recipe_score":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-12T02:45:49.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"1644","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Shisha Mango","flavor_id":"8964","vendor":"VT","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Banana","flavor_id":"2072","vendor":"HS","millipercent":500},{"name":"Lemon Lime","flavor_id":"83","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1750},{"name":"Citrus Soda","flavor_id":"10083","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1500},{"name":"WS-23","flavor_id":"8085","vendor":"OTHR","millipercent":500}],"reviews":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"156275","name":"mañana soda"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
