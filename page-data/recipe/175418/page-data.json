It kind of reminds me of some kind of matcha petit four.  That cake base, along with the waxier parts of the eisai and the butteryness of the coffee milk froth.\r\nWhat's most surprising here is that the coffee funk from the tiramisu and the coffee milk froth aren't really coming through clearly? I think that was the most concerning thing to me, just looking at the recipe.\r\nI'll have to go back and check my notes on the tiramisu, but I think has some coffee in there, and the coffee milk froth has some as well.  But the earthier lead-in from the eisai kind of bends around that finish on the coffees into tasting a lot more cohesive than it should.\r\nI wouldn't call it especially \"grassy\", especially with something like a green tea in the recipe.\r\nAlthough, I totally admit I eyeballed those percentages a bit, lol.  You went full Jarvis with that .62% nonsense.\r\nBut yeah, pretty good.\r\n","steep_days":"0 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T20:33:15.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"736","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Angel Cake SC","flavor_id":"9014","vendor":"WF","millipercent":620},{"name":"Coffee Milk Froth","flavor_id":"8858","vendor":"VT","millipercent":1240},{"name":"Cr√àme De Menthe","flavor_id":"1266","vendor":"FW","millipercent":120},{"name":"Eisai tea","flavor_id":"9378","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1340},{"name":"Fluffy White Cake SC","flavor_id":"9024","vendor":"WF","millipercent":1580},{"name":"Tiramisu","flavor_id":"8543","vendor":"JF","millipercent":680}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"175418","name":"Lumi - Deep-Throating Dandelions - EP#90"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
