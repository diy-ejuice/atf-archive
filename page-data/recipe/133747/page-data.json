Using just few flavors to achieve a cracker jack type vape. Wonder Flavours Honey roasted Peanuts plays a big role in this recipe to give it that authentic Cracker Jack taste. While Tpa Kettle Corn lacks in the corn department Ap is added to give more of a corn note. Flavor West Salted Caramel is a  great flavor that has 2 different roles in this recipe by adding to the kettle's  sweet butter notes and wrapping itself around the peanuts to tie in the Cracker Jack experience. Ejoy!!\r\nNew Mixers always welcome at the Crew!!!\r\n  https://www.facebook.com/groups/456512471380574/","steep_days":"1 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T17:35:24.000-05:00","best_vg":"75%","views":"1281","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Caramel (salted)","vendor":"FW","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Honey Roasted Peanuts SC","vendor":"WF","millipercent":750},{"name":"Kettle Corn","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":3500},{"name":"Super Sweet","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":250},{"name":"Acetyl Pyrazine 5%","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":250}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"133747","name":"Cracker Me Jacks!!"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
