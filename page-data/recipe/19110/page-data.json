I was leaving for work and had no juice to vape. So made this up. When I got off work I spent some time to perfect it.\r\n\r\nCAP. Sweet tangerine  and TFA orange cream is obviously the orange in the tic tac. These two together are not quite the exact flavor you get from a tic tac but I didn't want that wierd sour after taste that the candy can leave. \r\n\r\nCAP. super sweet is obviously the sweetener here so sting less than a percent is just right.\r\n\r\nCAP lemon lime. Now when I left for work this wasn't in the recipie I made. After vaping it for 10 hours and it was good, it was still missing something. As soon as I picked this off my self I knew this was it. It gives it that citrus flavor and at 1.75% it still doesn't give that wierd after taste. \r\n\r\nSo a mix and a good steady shake this is great. But 2 days is perfect\r\n\r\nFeel free to give any ideas to see if you think it could be better.","steep_days":"2 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":3,"total_reviews":2,"updated_at":"2020-12-06T02:07:17.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"3213","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Sweet Tangerine","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Orange Cream","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Super Sweet","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":750},{"name":"Lemon Lime","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1750}],"reviews":[{"user":"BigRed","score":"none","text":"add ooo powder sugar at 1 %"},{"user":"koldfusion","score":"3","text":"Flavor was a bit low for a TFV12 Smok tank (X6 coils). In my Dead Rabbit RDA dual 26/32g claptons at around 0.4Ohms it was pretty good as well. Seems more like a creamscicle than an Orange Tic-Tac but still super tasty.
