Was an obvious choice after tasting this be liquid. No doubt in my mind flavor West. I'm certain you could substitute the CAP sweet strawberry, JF sweet strawberry ,or 2-1 combination TFA strawberry, strawberry ripe.\r\n\r\nCAP golden pineapple- this is a great flavor and was my first choice. Nailed it ðŸ˜ƒðŸ˜ƒðŸ˜ƒ.\r\n\r\nFLV sweet coconut &  FA coconut- this is where I think my remix is better than the original. I'm certain they are not using FLV, probably TFA. Adding FA coconut makes the coconut more complex, and realistic. Besides I could not resist, this is hands-down my favorite coconut!! (tends to fade a little overtime.)\r\n\r\nCAP super sweet- if I was going for a one-to-one clone this would probably be a much higher percentage. Just a Touch does make everything a little sweeter.\r\n\r\n","steep_days":"1 (SNV)","temperature":"420","recipe_score":4,"updated_at":"2020-12-12T17:10:50.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"30801","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Strawberry","flavor_id":"1420","vendor":"FW","millipercent":5000},{"name":"Golden Pineapple","flavor_id":"61","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Sweet Coconut","flavor_id":"605","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Coco' (coconut)","flavor_id":"416","vendor":"FA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Super Sweet","flavor_id":"2384","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":500}],"reviews":[{"user":"whthek","text":"Hey Chris, This stuff is the best!

With the FW it's probably even closer, but I wasn't really crazy about the original anyways.  Off the shake, I like this much more.","score":5},{"user":"skineedog","text":"Definitely an under-rated recipe. Very good. Thanks Chris","score":4},{"user":"oxlong27","text":"so good.   been vaping this 120ml at a time.  sometimes i add some koolada and its super refreshing.  Never had the real lava flow but this is a killer recipe","score":5},{"user":"reasonably_dan","text":"made exact steeped 3 days. superb mix and better than the original because the coconut doesnâ€™t taste like sunscreen in your version. recipe remains clear after a steep and has become one of my ADVâ€™s. 5/5 stars. mix this up, you will not regret.","score":5},{"user":"Irrelevant_Being","text":"Wow, this is very tasty. I was originally mixing this for my wife and did not think this was something I would like. I typically do not like coconut or pineapple in any ejuice, however upon first taste I changed my mind. Great combination of flavors and I'm with you on loving FW Strawberry, I overlooked it for a couple of years since no one really used it but then I was trying to recreate a strawberry custard and realized that was the strawberry that I was looking for. Well done!","score":5},{"user":"6retro6","text":"Never had the original but this was really tasty!","score":5}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"51363","name":"Lava flow ðŸŒ‹ by naked remix"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
