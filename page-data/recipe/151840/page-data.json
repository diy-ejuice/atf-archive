This is only the first stab at it, so I'm wondering if I should lower the FA Forest Fruit a bit and maybe add a touch of Dragonfruit as an emulsifier, but, for the moment, it's fun and tasty enough to share as it is.\r\n\r\nThis is a shake & vape, but, if you're at all squeamish about INW Cactus, give it 3 days, and the actual flavor of it will disappear, leaving behind only the exquisite juiciness.","steep_days":"3 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"total_reviews":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T17:35:43.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"1784","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Blackberry","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Cactus","vendor":"INW","millipercent":250},{"name":"Forest Fruits","vendor":"FA","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Grape","vendor":"INW","millipercent":3000},{"name":"WS-23","vendor":"OTHR","millipercent":750}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"151840","name":"Panther Blood"}}}
