Under-rated, under-used **TFA Jackfruit** for an even fleshier body with soft hints of pineapple and mango coming though. It keeps things more interesting than just a straight cantaloupe vape. **CAP Cantaloupe** blends with the Jackfruit to keep the melon ball rolling though where FLV Cantaloupe starts to drop off in meloniousness and just fades into thick almost creamy softness. This flavor has a tiny bit of some sharp perfumey thing going on briefly in the top note in single-flavor testing, but FLV Cantaloupe is just completely overriding and obliterating that for me. This is the only version out of half a dozen experiments throwing different manufacturers' Cantaloupe flavors on top of this TFA Jackfruit/CAP Cantaloupe base that actually worked and made for a perfectly pleasant vape without any weird off-notes. \r\n\r\nBUT, it feels incomplete - which is why the \"In Progress\" box is checked. Mostly it just needs to be juicier, but rather than going for one of the knee-jerk juicifiying reactions (INW Cactus, etc), I want to try adding pineapple or mango flavors to add acidity while also playing off those notes from the jackfruit, or if that comes off too just generically yellow-orange, maybe a juicier grape, cherry, or dark berry. I wouldn't recommend anyone mix up a big batch of this, but if you're looking to create a cantaloupe-forward recipe, give it try and see if it inspires you.  \r\n  ","steep_days":"3","temperature":"420","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T17:34:57.000-05:00","best_vg":"69%","views":"3410","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Cantaloupe","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Jackfruit","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Cantaloupe","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1000}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"102532","name":"1-2-3 Jackalope "}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
