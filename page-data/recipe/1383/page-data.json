I did switch the VBIC to LB VIC. Thanks. ","score":5},{"user":"kitu5","text":"Okay, how have I not reviewed this yet? I've mixed it before, loved it. Hell, it's one of the recipes i used when i was making sense of why diy was cost effective. Seriously, how did i miss this?&#xD;\n&#xD;\n*ahem*&#xD;\n&#xD;\nSo, this lovely little number calls itself a cliche, as it is a strawberry and cream at its heart. Reality is much further from the truth. Yeah, there's a lot of strawberry and cream flavor. The raspberry sweet shows up to add sweet, and add a berry that compliments ripe quite well. The genius is the forrest fruit tho. The mix of boysenberry, blueberry, blackberry, and others I can't identify really makes this a much more brilliant flavor than just another strawberry and cream. And speaking of the cream: the combination of the vanilla bean ice cream and fresh cream makes for a lush flavorful bed for the berries to lay in.&#xD;\n&#xD;\nThe fact that in your [reddit article](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/4coc8v/clich%C3%A9_a_rotating_strawberry_cream_from_my/) about this, you also have alternatives for the forest fruit makes this one versatile juice.&#xD;\n&#xD;\nSeriously, this one is a must try for anyone who likes fruits, creams, combinations therein, and people who are tired of just another strawberry and cream. I can promise that THIS is anything but.&#xD;\n&#xD;\nDude, I thank you for listening to your inner vape bro for this one.","score":5},{"user":"FizzChaser","text":"I had hard time with this recipe. I love FA Forrest Mix but I'm getting a dank/swampy off-note, i'm guessing it's the mix with the VBIC/Fresh Cream. Although separately, in different mixes, I like both those flavours. I am not rating because it seems most people like it and this may just be my palate.","score":0},{"user":"spite","text":"","score":4},{"user":"Fiftytrent","text":"This is a delicious berries and cream.  Maybe my favorite.  ","score":5},{"user":"ChefJohn","text":"I don't know what this is. &#xD;\nIt's not strawberry and cream. But it's fantastic. &#xD;\nIt's well balanced and quite tasty. &#xD;\nRaspberry hardcandy is the profile I'm getting.&#xD;\n&#xD;\nDefinitely not a Cliche. ","score":4},{"user":"cincinnatiking","text":"Tastes like a raspberry creamsaver, like said below. Nice change from all the S&amp;C recipes I have made. I would recommend mixing this. It's a very good recipe. If you want a GREAT recipe, then mix God Milk!","score":5},{"user":"Crazyndalazdayz","text":"Finally mixed this up after getting the flavors and forgetting for a while and damn this is great!! Very much like a mix between strawberry and raspberry creamsavers.  I also mixed up God Milk and unfortunately still don't care for dragonfruit or TFA strawberry, but this recipe is right up my alley. Well done.","score":5},{"user":"Fear","text":"As one of those people that have trouble tasting strawberry, and yet love strawberry vapes... This recipe is amazing. I have long been a fan of FA Forest Fruit and love it in most berry vapes. I try everything after a mix and each day there after. This seems to be best from 4 days on, the Raspberry Sweet calms down around day 3 and things start coming fully together around day 4 and beyond. Glad I mixed a 100mL of this","score":5},{"user":"zwermp","text":"This recipe is dope.  The name and description are kind of ironic imo - this isn't your regular ole strawberries and cream.  The mixed berry flavor really comes through in a great way.","score":0},{"user":"Mixepic","text":"This has become a regular flavor in my rotation, friends love it as well. The raspberry and forrest mix give it a great additional berry with some citrus back notes that blend very well with the strawberries and cream base. The forrest fruit is not overwhelming but sits just right within the recipe. ","score":4},{"user":"Queuetue","text":"I think Skiddz just created this to fill out his line with a popular standard, but this is probably the best take on strawberry milk I've ever tried.  This is a regular for me, often getting mixed up with other fruits.","score":5}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"1383","name":"Cliché"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
