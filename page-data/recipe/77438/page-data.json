It's astonishing to me how much this flavor works in vape form. Specifically TFA's variation. It does a whole bunch of different things in a mix. Its sweet, kinda buttery, perfectly nutty, but can be rather thin. It needs help but not too much, depending on what you're going for. \r\n     \r\nI know, I know...it's also been an extremely played out flavor. Used time and time again but there obviously is a reason for it. The one nut that can be both sweet and rather savory, at least in the nuttier sense of the word. TFA's version cleary went for the former, but they did a really good job emulating it. A friend of mine who loves my other pistachio recipe [Dillinger's Dairy](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/15679#dillinger_s_dairy_by_kriswk), wanted something similar minus the tobacco aspect. I didn't want to just take out that part and hand him the same thing, so instead we decided on a pudding. Anyways without further rambling, for your vaping pleasure, is that concoction. \r\n    \r\n**TFA Pistachio** - This was going to be the top note no matter what. You're basically already at the pistachio pudding level when you use this flavor. I tried to add in other pistachio flavors and even use other ones to get a better level of realism but it wasn't necessary. Here, you have all the sweet 'stachio elements you need so I only needed to work on the pudding base.\r\n   \r\n**FA Oba Oba** - Actually, this was added to give that pistachio an even deeper candied element and boy does it do that. I never realized how much I liked this flavor when using it for that very reason. It also seems to help with the sweet pudding-like mouthfeel. Try to add this into any hard candy recipes or anything with like a candy shell or a sugary glaze. It has that very same sweet flavor. Some say it's likened to a marshmallow flavor but that's really only if you take it any higher.\r\n     \r\n**TPA Vanilla Swirl** - This here is one piece of my pudding base. Simple, yet elegant. Vanilla Swirl is the perfect flavor for a cream dessert. It's not too heavy, very sweet, and the vanilla is not too dark nor overpowering. It stays in its place as a base note which was exactly what I wanted.\r\n     \r\n**FA Fresh Cream** - A nice light dairy cream to punch up the...well dairy aspect of a pudding. The nice thing about this flavor is it blankets anything in a smooth, subtle mouthfeel without adding way too much flavor to anything. It does have its own tiny bit of sweetness but its hardly noticeable with other sweeter flavors.\r\n  \r\n**CAP Super Sweet** - This is actually not optional. At least, I wouldn't try it without it. This is pushing the candied side of the pistachio flavor forward and making the creams into a real commercial pudding.  Without it, you can't really shake and vape until everything steeps together. If you had to replace it, I guess I would use (maybe) 1.5% Oba Oba instead of 1% and make sure you steeped it for the full 4-5 days.\r\n    \r\n**FLV Butterscotch** - Ah, the finishing touch. I am telling you, any sort of pistachio dessert will be pumped up to 11 if you add even a small touch of any caramel or butterscotch. This particular one is perfectly smooth and ties in with the pudding. There isn't an overpowering butterscotch flavor to it either. It's there but  it simply sat with the pistachio sweetness and connected itself and the pudding together as one. The DAAP in this flavor is just a bonus ;-)\r\n      \r\nP.S. If you don't have Butterscotch, try to use FLV Caramel but you're missing out. \r\n\r\nSo, put this away for a few days and enjoy(5 days at best). Keep on mixin' on!
