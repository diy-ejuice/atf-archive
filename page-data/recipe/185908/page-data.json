I gave this two weeks to blend and mellow out from what I remember the original was not as tasty it was ok but I loved the profile...thanks for checking it out.  *Note I dont have any suggestions for substitutes for the coffee Purilum caramel coffee with Sweet milk contributes to the entire recipe and blends everything to a creamy goodness..","steep_days":"14","temperature":"0","recipe_score":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-10T16:01:44.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"1138","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Bavarian Cream","flavor_id":"1187","vendor":"FW","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Butter Pecan","flavor_id":"1212","vendor":"FW","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Caramel Coffee with Sweet Milk","flavor_id":"7748","vendor":"PUR","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Hazelnut","flavor_id":"1312","vendor":"FW","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Hazel Grove (hazelnut)","flavor_id":"417","vendor":"FA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Vanilla Custard","flavor_id":"131","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Super Sweet","flavor_id":"7787","vendor":"PUR","millipercent":500}],"reviews":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"185908","name":"I ROCKE ðŸ¤˜ðŸ˜ŽðŸ¤˜ Philip Rocke grand reserve (remix)"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
