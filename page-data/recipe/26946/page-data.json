It was supposed to be called \"In the Garden of Eden\" however the lead singer of Iron Butterfly was so messed up, he slurred the words together, thus In A Godda Da Vidda was born.  To me this truly tastes like a blend chosen from the fresh, fantastical, and abundant Garden of Eden.  Heavenly indeed! \r\nThis is a velvety, delicate yet flavorful and exotic fruit blend that could easily be an ADV. This mix is very smooth right out of the gate with no harshness, which is sometimes difficult to do with fruits. Despite the complimentary fusion of these ingredients you can still pick out quite easily all of the flavors and how they add to and refine the entire recipe.\r\n\r\nTFA Papaya - I wanted this entry to be a bit tropical in nature and I really love what the papaya does. It has a deep sweetness that really shines in this mix with a touch of muskiness. I wanted something that was sweet but also balanced with a gentle tart flavor and papaya fills this gap beautifully.\r\n\r\nFA Pomegranate - I just love how this flavor adds an extra bit of juicy tartness to this recipe. It\"s succulent and bright and compliments the fleshy papaya. I chose FA's offering over TFA because it seemed more authentic to me and has a touch of a bitter note that I really wanted to bring out in this mix. I wanted this blend to be multi dimensional and to showcase the complexity of these melded flavors.\r\n\r\nCAP Sweet Tangerine - This sweetens up the mix and adds some delightful citrus. This flavor normally has quite a throat hit, but at this percentage and in this particular mix it is surprisingly polished.  I have added just enough tangerine too to add a mellow but sweet tang to the papaya and pomegranate. The result in my opinion is a sophisticated yet fresh fruit combination.","steep_days":"0","temperature":"0","recipe_score":4.9,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:49:00.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"25422","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Papaya","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Pomegranate","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Sweet Tangerine","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":2000}],"reviews":[{"user":"QussiJ","text":"I had to renew my subscription only to write my review. This is how amazing this mix is! it's very delicious that I can't put it down until I'm swimming in the clouds. Simple and nice recipe, but I had to say that I notice it becomes better with a short steeping, like 3-4 days. For me, it becomes sweeter, less harsh (almost not there), and I can taste pomegranate more now in comparsion to SNV (which was very good). Try it, you won't regret it if you like fruity recipes as me. Thanks for sharing it, keep it up man."},{"user":"zenith","text":"A simple 3 flavour recipe, easy and cheap to mix and it's absolutely gorgeous.  Beautifully balanced and flavourful.  Thanks for sharing, this is going to be an ADV for me!"},{"user":"toprod","text":"Cant belive i didn't try this sooner its a delicious  juice well balanced and smooth  well done Emily and thanks for sharing this recipe xxxx"},{"user":"Ebc88","text":"Excellent job simple quick and easy to mix and absolutely tasty "},{"user":"Gordo","text":"Amazing, Tropical and Addicting"},{"user":"dougc","text":"Absolute genius. Simple, three flavor mix that's flavorful, balanced and complex. Well done Emily! Thanks for sharing."},{"user":"AlfredPudding","text":"Incredibly well-balanced combination of three flavors. It's a completely full-flavored vape that doesn't need to steep at all. The Pomegranate tames the TPA Papaya perfectly, and the Sweet Tangerine adds some wonderful citrus brightness in the background. I highly recommend you give this a shot if you're a fan of Pomegranate. "},{"user":"horrend","text":"This is a wonderfully balanced fruity mix. I'm really enjoying the tangerine/pomegranate combination, they compliment each other so well. "},{"user":"Katumbas","text":"Great execution on this recipe! The 3 flavours are perfectly noticeable. The papaya staying at the front while the pomegranate comes behind and the sweet tangerine accentuates the tartness of the pomegranate and the flavour is present as well. Nice job!"},{"user":"alexis666","text":"I really wanted to like this, it sounds so delicious. However, something in it gives me a very unpleasant aftertaste, like a bitter green skin/peel note. I believe it’s the papaya because I have experienced it with other recipes. I might try reducing the papaya, perhaps that will help. "},{"user":"corvape","text":"Super tasty 3 flavor tropical mix. Each of the 3 flavors are balanced in a way you can taste them individually. Also, as previously stated below, the aroma this vape throws turns heads when it is exhaled! Excellent example of how recipes do not need to be over complicated."},{"user":"kitu5","text":"Gotta admit, this flavor is weird for me in all the right ways. The pomegranate, papaya, and tangerine are all discernible in their own right, but they blend beautifully into this absolutely tropical storm on the tastebuds. I was describing this to a buddy i slid some to, and the customer standing next to us was going, \"That sounds like an amazing smoothie!\" So, I let out a small cloud (I was on break), and he was all \"I see the appeal now!\" This is indeed a mix that makes me go \"I'm vaping a friggin scented candle without the wax\", and it is a very high compliment.  &#xD;\n&#xD;\nWhat makes this weird for me is that up until now, I've never really liked papaya. It's one of those fruits that makes me go, \"Yup, it's tropical. Where's the rum to get rid of this aftertaste please?\" Not this time. the fact that it can be noted on its own, as well as in the overall melange...sheer brilliance.&#xD;\n&#xD;\nLastly, I'm going to second what @hfatih said. While this is good in a rda/tank, it friggin shines mtl. Dropped some into my almost empty Icare2, which for all intents and purposes is a closed system, and what comes out (other than a touch of tobacco, cos I didn't change coils) is a brilliant tropical taste that shrieks \"tropical fruit with a bit of sour and sweet\". Anything else I've dropped in there so far that isn't a tobacco or strawberry cream has been meh. And yes, even here, the brain decodes all three flavors, which you shouldn't be able to do in such a device.&#xD;\n&#xD;\nIn short, BANGER. I see this as a total ADV, especially in the summer, or middle of winter when you're longing for summer to come back. For fruit fans, sour fans, people who like tropical drinks, and people who have scented candles in the bathroom for those times when even Calgon can't take you away."},{"user":"hfatih","text":"First of all this thing is delicious. You can taste all 3 fruits and they also blend together in harmony. It is sweet without the help of sweeteners or creams which is awesome. Clean coils for days!&#xD;\n&#xD;\nNow with lung hits, for me, it is tasty for first few puffs, but makes my taste buds insensitive after that. I don't like this on my rda's at all for this reason. The flavor just goes away so easily and you are left with just a sourness.&#xD;\n&#xD;\nWith mtl hits though, this is probably the best fruity mtl juice i've ever tried. Mtl'ers mostly go for tobacco, or heavier,thicker profiles but everyone should try this one imo. I get a ton of flavor in every hit. It is juicy, sweet, smooth. Hit after hit and the flavor just doesn't stop shining. Papaya is always there, pomegranate is always there, tangerine is always there, sourness is always there, sweetness is always there. I don't think my mtl rta's will se any other juice for a long time :)"},{"user":"MrBurgundy","text":"What is this black magic? This recipe packs such a punch for being only three ingredients. Each fruit shares the spotlight in delicate balance. The layering makes this endlessly vapable. It’s always interesting, refreshing, and satisfying. I blew through 30ml in two days and had to mix up a 120 to last any amount of time. Fantastic job, Emily! Thanks for sharing. :)"},{"user":"Gonzilla","text":"Easily one of my favorite fruit mixes, fantastic balance to the flavors. Exotic and delicious."},{"user":"FizzChaser","text":"What a spectacular mix of fruits. Truly delicious! I will be making much more after this first taster."},{"user":"cdaniell30","text":"This is beautiful"},{"user":"trandism","text":"As everyone said already publicly this is one of the best recipes of the year so far. Papaya + Tangerine became one of my favourite duets and I based some recipes on it."},{"user":"6retro6","text":"Beautifully crafted recipe, yes you can pick out each flavour. Just love it!"},{"user":"Boomdog07","text":"This recipe is simply delicious. I have mixed and used 500ml plus of it with 1 tiny addition... .25 CAP Super Sweet just to add a little sweetness. I don't know why but it really helps take the \"dry\" out of it that I was getting without it. This is still great just as it is for most people I am sure, I just like stuff a little sweeter and \"wetter\" on the mouth feel."},{"user":"ID10-T","text":"As promised, you can pick out all the fruit flavors, but they also move together as one like synchronized swimmers. The selection and balance of flavors here is superb and it's luscious, silky smooth, super juicy and fresh, and full-flavored yet delicate. Graceful, even. Amazing recipe!   "},{"user":"MediocreVibes","text":"I find myself mixing this over and over. I finally said \"fuck it\" and mixed 240mL of it. Well done recipe."},{"user":"AlexYanchunis","text":"This recipe has made me have to reorder Pomegranate now twice it is such a nice recipe and look like i should start ordering larger bottles of Pomegranate in the future thanks for the great recipe!."},{"user":"Bogey_Again","text":"I love pomegranate and never had much luck with FA Papaya. However when using it here at .75% it worked great! "},{"user":"method1","text":"Simple &amp; elegant, very imaginative pairings.
