This concentrate has been a favorite of mine for over a year. This is like a jammy blackberry with slight bakery notes. This is a great concentrate to start any cobbler,, pie,, or dark Berry pastry. Just yummy. Can you tell I like it?\r\nThis recipe is a blackberry & blueberry tart. \r\nThe berries for this tart, I used **FW Blackberry and Hangsen Blueberry** . They work great together in this recipe. \r\n\r\nI use **FA Custard Premium** to add the creamy pudding in with the berries. \r\n\r\nTo enrich the slight pastry note of the wild Berry Cobbler.  I added **TFA Graham Cracker Clear** & **JF Biscuit**\r\nEnjoy. \r\n\r\n\r\n","steep_days":"3","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"updated_at":"2020-12-12T15:40:15.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"2295","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Biscuit","flavor_id":"4487","vendor":"JF","millipercent":500},{"name":"Blackberry","flavor_id":"1194","vendor":"FW","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Blueberry","flavor_id":"2076","vendor":"HS","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Custard Premium","flavor_id":"9118","vendor":"FA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Graham Cracker Clear","flavor_id":"325","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Wild Berry Cobbler ala Mode","flavor_id":"8499","vendor":"FW","millipercent":3000}],"reviews":[{"user":"DumHed","text":"yes.","score":5},{"user":"hibbadoray","text":"This is really good.
