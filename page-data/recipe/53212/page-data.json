When I think of blue I think of the Sky on a nice cool Clear day. It has that nice beautiful blue sky but add that coolness of the Breeze. When I think of blue I think of being on vacation sipping on a nice cool drink. Enjoying my relaxation which makes me happy. \r\nA very nice Sweet and Sour Blue and raspberry flavor. \r\nRF Blue Razz is a great blue razzberry flavor perfect amount of sweet and sour. \r\nFW blueberry adds more of that authentic blueberry flavor.\r\nTFA Raspberry sweet helps to add some citrus to balance recipe out. \r\nLA Lemonade is a very good Lemonade and at 1.5% is perfect as to not take over the whole profile. \r\nVanillin makes this taste more like a nice candy vape. \r\nAdd .25 Super sweet optional for a nice sweet vape off the Shake.  Add 1% Cap cool mint for that nice cool vape as well.","steep_days":"2","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T10:43:30.000-05:00","best_vg":"60%","views":"2197","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Blue Raz","flavor_id":"2222","vendor":"RF","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Blueberry","flavor_id":"1201","vendor":"FW","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Raspberry (sweet)","flavor_id":"267","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Vanillin 10% (pg)","flavor_id":"190","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Lemonade","flavor_id":"951","vendor":"LA","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Cool Mint","flavor_id":"40","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1000}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"53212","name":"Blue Razzberry Lemonade (Flavor Book entry)"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
