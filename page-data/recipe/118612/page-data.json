I used the HS-Grape and INW-Grape along with the FLV-Cranberry to create the cranberry grape juice base.  The SC-Blackberry and TPA-Plum are the fruity bits floating in with the FW-Pink Champagne and FA-Brandy that every good Sangria requires.  This really needs a week of steeping to come together.\r\n\r\n***You can add around 0.3-0.5% of your preferred sweetener to this if you prefer sweet vapes.  If you want a chilled effect you could add around 0.3% WS-23 as well.
