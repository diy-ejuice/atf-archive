I almost felt like I didn't like it when I first tried it but then I really did.  I can't say it'd be an ADV but it is certainly nice for something different.  I do wish though that the sorbet base did not have cooling in it, Id prefer to add ws-23, as I don't care for the menthol-y note in that.  Could just be me though.  much thanks!","score":5},{"user":"TamVapes","text":"Excellent!   Just as you describe.  On the inhale, I get this lovely sweet and tart berry taste, hitting my tongue, with lemon and lime, on the exhale, definitely get the subtle note of the boozy cocktail.  Well done!
