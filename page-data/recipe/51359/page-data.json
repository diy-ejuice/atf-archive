"},{"user":"SlashaLO","text":"For not a tobacco, this is great! ;) Mixed this up, as my wife loves peppermint/mint vapes quite a bit. I'm not normally a fan. The peppermint/white chocolate is just an amazing flavor, and its sooooo good. The cookie base here just works to give a nice, simple, and tasty base for this to lay on. Let it set for a bit, and I fell in love. My wife loves it as well. Have already made her several batches, and she keeps asking for more. "},{"user":"CheebaSteeba","text":"Excellent stuff! Subtle delicious creamy peppermint with a pleasant texture to keep you going. I really enjoy the use of the butter, biscuit, and sugar cookie to make a well balanced cookie base for the peppermint to lay with. Great as S&amp;V But certainly does develop more over time -- the cookie comes out a bit more and the creaminess seems to get a little creamier. If you have the ingredients, definitely mix this up. &#xD;\n&#xD;\nThanks for the delicious mix and inspiration!"},{"user":"KAUZ514","text":"Blown away by how good this recipe is.
