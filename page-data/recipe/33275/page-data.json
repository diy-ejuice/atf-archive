Today I was mixing up some recipes from the community and I decided I wanted to mix up a mixed berry type Juicy Juice like I had as a kid. \r\n\r\nHarvest Berry: The base of this yummy recipe. Smell it, taste it on the back of your hand this is definitely screaming to be in a juice-based recipe. Being as this flavor is so complete on its own, there are only a couple things added to make it pretty much perfect.\r\n\r\nCactus: It is well known that this concentrate will add a bit of juicy-ness and this is the perfect percent to do that. Not much else to say about that. \r\n\r\nAnton Apple and Strawberry: I thought these two flavors needed to be in this juice to make it slightly more complex and not as linear as the Harvest Berry on its own.\r\n\r\nThis recipe is Shake-n-Vape certified and it will come together in 2 days. Don't let this thing sit on the shelf too long because it is only fruit so it will get weaker after a while.
