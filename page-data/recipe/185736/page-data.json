In the rotation it goes..Hell, the wife even likes it and she isn't a Bakery/Custard girl. Only thing I'll do is drop the sweetener a tad. Thank you for sharing,Red."},{"user":"bjorama","text":"Gotta hand it to ya Big Red, Out of the Blue, you have become one of my favorite mixers.  If its posted its worth mixing and likely to be on the top shelf in a big ass bottle.   This one is damn good and it's only day 4 of the steep.  The \"regular\" version damn good too.  And even though I want to say I've tried the original, I haven't and don't really have any plans on paying that much when I have mixes like this to go to."}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"185736","name":"Blueberry Corn Bread Pudding (A Country Clouds Clone)"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
