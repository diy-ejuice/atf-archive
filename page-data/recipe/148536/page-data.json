The candy was a favorite of mine growing up and while I haven't had the candy in years vaping this brought it all back to me. Right off the shake the lemon is a bit too forward, but after a solid night of steeping it moves to the background just enough to compliment everything else and tie in that sour patch flavor you get when you throw a bunch of them in your mouth all at once. I do feel like there could have been more jelly texture, but I think that's just me. I seem to have trouble tasting \"gummy\" and have tried a number of gummy recipes hoping for that mouth feel. Perhaps that's my white whale. Either way this is a fantastic recipe, taste true to the profile and I really enjoyed it. Thank you !"},{"user":"Davidvapes49","text":"Really good  candy sour recipe I have looking sour  e liquid for long time founded now with this recipe all ready  made 200mls of this all ready wont last  long "}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"148536","name":"Boyz n the Hood.
