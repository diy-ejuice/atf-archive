The description of pipeline punch is a perfect blend of the best flavors Hawaii has to offer passion fruit, guava, and oranges. Now whether these are Hawaii's best flavors or not is not for me to decide but I do enjoy this energy drink made by monster.\r\n\r\nI used Flavorah passion fruit because it's a great passion fruit flavor in my opinion and at the end of the day it achieved the flavor I was trying to emulate. Next was guava and if I am normally going for guava I don't use Flavorah pink gauva because it tastes more like a grapefruit to me but the last day I had a pipeline punch I also had one of my favorite candies a sour grapefruit hi chew and wouldn't you know it I could taste that sour grapefruit note in the pipeline punch now maybe I am missing something or just don't remember what a guava tastes like but I didn't think they tasted like grapefruit. But because I can taste the grapefruit notes I added pink guava by Flavorah  it's a great flavor a lot strong so I used Flavorah pink guava at .50â„… so it wouldn't completely take over the mix. Even at such a low percentage it's flavor carries through the whole mix. Then I had the orange flavor to come up with and for this I ended up using a combination of sweet tangerine by Capella and mandarin by flavor art both at 1.5% this blends with the other flavors to pull off the orange notes. Last but not least this recipe needed some ethyl maltol to round out the fruits it really helps mellow and blend the pink guava  as well as help blend all the fruits together into this pipeline punch. So for the ethyl maltol I used none other than cotton candy by the flavor apprentice. The cotton candy is absolutely vital to making this recipe taste even remotely close to the real pipeline punch monster.  This is good on a shake but has quite a strong throat hit but if you give it 3 days to steep the throat hit mellows conciderably.  In my opinion this is pretty spot on pipeline punch by monster.  Well there it is pipeline punch give it a try a and let me know what you think in the review section let me know if this tastes like pipeline punch to you???????","steep_days":"3 (SNV)","temperature":"420","recipe_score":5,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:49:21.000-05:00","best_vg":"75%","views":"5172","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Pink Guava","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":500},{"name":"Passion Fruit","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Sweet Tangerine","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Tanger (mandarin)","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Cotton Candy","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1000}],"reviews":[{"user":"areena","text":"I used FA passion fruit cuz thats what I had, just mixed this a few mins ago and this is a super nice mix, I actually get guava from pink guava...beautifully balanced , mixing 250 ml now thanks for sharing!"},{"user":"Grorco","text":"This was my first batch of diy, my wife had asked me if I could find a \"pink\" monster flavor.
