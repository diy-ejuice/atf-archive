My partner like fruit flavors that don't taste artificial so I grabbed all the berries in my stash and put them together at an average. He loves strawberry so thats what I wanted up front but the blackberry stole the show, but its still a great vape for us. Please give feedback I want to improve this. \r\n\r\nEdit: I dropped the the raspberry and blackberry I believe it is a far better blend, thanks to community advice.
