It's just a simple apple fritter, or bearclaw as called in the south-western part of the states. It's very similar to /u/returnity 's Cinapple Fritter from Reddit, but made simple. It can be shake n vape'd, but the Fuji tends to calm down from the harshness after a few days, and the CDS fills out a bit. Doesn't seem to stick around on your coils or change the profile. TFA Dragonfruit absolutely makes this recipe, it helps bring out the Fuji while simultaneously blending it with the danish, I wouldn't recommend making it unless you have this. Using a richer, stronger cinnamon such as FLV Rich Cinnamon (.33%) might make it a more robust cinnamon fritter is always an option as well. This is also similar to /u/1D10-T 's Apple Danish, but in no way a direct copy.\r\n\r\n","steep_days":"5 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":4,"total_reviews":4,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:48:55.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"5388","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Fuji","vendor":"FA","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Cinnamon Danish Swirl","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":5000},{"name":"Bavarian Cream","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Dragonfruit","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1000}],"reviews":[{"user":"Kudo","score":"4","text":"This is a good recipe, though I agree with the other reviewer that this definitely tastes more like apple sauce"},{"user":"jasss22","score":"5","text":"Love it"},{"user":"MediocreVibes","score":"2","text":"Way too much Fugi.
