WHY IS IT CALLED BRAZILIAN LEMONADE AND NOT BRAZILIAN LIMEADE ?!?!?  I don't see ANY effing lemons anywhere in this recipe !!!   Because the word for both lemons and limes in Portuguese is limão.   In the US this drink is served at the Brazilian steakhouse chain Fogo de chao. - I have altered one aspect of the traditional drink recipe - I added raspberry.  Feel free to omit the raspberry concentrates from this recipe if you don't have them or don't like raspberry.   Note all of the concentrates I used to simulate carbonation - I have seen recipes for the actual drink with and without the bubble factor - I personally LOVE all things bubbly.
