The three strawberries here should, in theory, present themselves to even those who have a hard time detecting strawberry in mixes. FLV Alpine Strawberry, WF Strawberry (Baked), and JF Sweet Strawberry bring a deep, dark strawberry to the fold. Strawberry (Baked), with its honey backend also serves as the secret ingredient in the mix. \r\n\r\nTPA Vanilla Custard II is a fantastic new-ish vanilla custard. It rivals the boring ass original TPA Vanilla Custard with more body....well more everything. CAP NYC is in here to bolster that creaminess. It serves a place in almost all creamy/custard mixes. FLV Rich Cinnamon morphs the custard with a slight spicy warmness.\r\n\r\nLet this one steep a couple weeks. The honey takes the forefront and kills the custard notes until then.","steep_days":"14","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:51:47.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"533","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Alpine Strawberry","flavor_id":"4360","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":200},{"name":"Strawberry (Baked)","flavor_id":"10270","vendor":"WF","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Sweet Strawberry","flavor_id":"3073","vendor":"JF","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Vanilla Custard 2","flavor_id":"10427","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"New York Cheesecake","flavor_id":"90","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Rich Cinnamon","flavor_id":"638","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":100}],"reviews":[{"user":"lionhrt9","text":"Fantastic juice.
