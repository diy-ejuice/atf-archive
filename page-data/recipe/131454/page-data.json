Combined eggnog and horchata to create the spicy thick cream base. Coconut Candy adds the coconut notes and the macadamian nut adds a realistic nut note to the blend. Sweet cream and cream fresh create the buttery milk notes and the FA Bavarian cream rounds it all out without adding too many vanilla notes. \r\nOptional : Add 0.5% FW candy cane for the picture authenticity. Enjoy and Merry Christmas Familia.
