It is delish.  Summer and Fall of 2017, I kept at least 500ml of this ready to vape all the time.  I have a problem with peaches, I love them.  So, I thought what would Cardinal be like with Peach?  So, I tried it and came up with **GA Cardinal**.  Why not Peach Cardinal?  Well, have you seen a Peach Cardinal?  \r\nSo, I kept the base recipe the same.  I added **FA White Peach** and **FA Apricot**.  What comes out of this, is a delicious RY4 tobacco with a caramelized Peach on the exhale.  I am in love.  \r\nEnjoy\r\n","steep_days":"5","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"updated_at":"2020-12-12T18:30:10.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"4841","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"HOLY HOLY GRAIL RY4","flavor_id":"5037","vendor":"DFS","millipercent":8000},{"name":"Red Burley","flavor_id":"4355","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":750},{"name":"Kentucky Blend","flavor_id":"4362","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":250},{"name":"Peach White","flavor_id":"543","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Armenia (apricot)","flavor_id":"507","vendor":"FA","millipercent":750}],"reviews":[{"user":"hibbadoray","text":"I'm not a peach lover.

Running it in a MTL  rda  on the inhale I get a light peach followed by a delightful slightly sweet tobacco . NEVER in a million years would I think that I would enjoy a tobacco mix , but this has started me down the tobacco rabbit hole .  So dont be ascared of tobacco people!!
