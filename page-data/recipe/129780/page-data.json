It is delish.  Summer and Fall of 2017, I kept at least 500ml of this ready to vape all the time.  I have a problem with peaches, I love them.  So, I thought what would Cardinal be like with Peach?  So, I tried it and came up with **GA Cardinal**.  Why not Peach Cardinal?  Well, have you seen a Peach Cardinal?  \r\nSo, I kept the base recipe the same.  I added **FA White Peach** and **FA Apricot**.  What comes out of this, is a delicious RY4 tobacco with a caramelized Peach on the exhale.  I am in love.  \r\nEnjoy\r\n","steep_days":"5","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"total_reviews":5,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:50:35.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"4826","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"HOLY HOLY GRAIL RY4","vendor":"DFS","millipercent":8000},{"name":"Red Burley","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":750},{"name":"Kentucky Blend","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":250},{"name":"Peach White","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Armenia (apricot)","vendor":"FA","millipercent":750}],"reviews":[{"user":"hibbadoray","score":"5","text":"I'm not a peach lover. Not at all. This recipe has shown me when properly balanced peaches are awesome. It's a great recipe."},{"user":"thefogvlog","score":"5","text":"My partner and I have been killing 100's of ml's of cardinal - and we were looking for a different spin on it, so we mixed this up.

Running it in a MTL  rda  on the inhale I get a light peach followed by a delightful slightly sweet tobacco . NEVER in a million years would I think that I would enjoy a tobacco mix , but this has started me down the tobacco rabbit hole .  So dont be ascared of tobacco people!!

Light peach flavor and Fearâ€™s Cardinal. 8% RY4 was a worry for me but seems where it needed to be. Great job Tammy!"}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"129780","name":"Georgia Cardinal"}}}
