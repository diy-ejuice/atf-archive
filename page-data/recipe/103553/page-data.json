Give it a new mix!\r\n\r\nThis is my key lime pie, there are many like it, but this one is mine. As I said on Reddit the other day (u/BlameReligion) I figured I should make this public, 1. I posted it on Reddit anyway and 2. This is probably as far as I'm going to get with it. This hits all the right spots for me and after investing a few months in batches I think this is as far as I'll go.\r\n\r\nThe Key Lime: As much as I want to flavor test 5 more key lime flavors (I did quite a few) FA's Florida Key Lime does the trick. Anything higher than 1.5% you get that syrupy note that u/ConcreteRiver talks about, go any lower and the pie filling base takes over.\r\n\r\nMy Pie Filling: The amalgamation of creams you see in here are what I've really been tweaking the most to try and get a dense and creamy key lime pie, with that whipped/meringue type finish, and this combination does a pretty damn good job. You could argue that it's more of a key lime cheesecake but having had a few key lime pie's in my day, the density and richness that CAP NY Cheesecake/LA Cream Cheese icing brings to the table make it absolutely perfect for what I want out of a Key Lime Pie. Combined with TPA Whipped Cream and FA Meringue, it makes for a symphony of pie filling on your tongue.\r\n\r\nDat Crust: The crust was kind of a tough one too, I don't know why I hate doing flavors in 1/3's % but it always irks me, and gets to me even more when it actually works the way I need it to for the profile. The combination of TFA Cheesecake Craham Crust and FW Graham cracker help give that granular graham cracker crust with just a hint of cinnamon that I have really been enjoying. \r\n\r\nI'd say let it sit for at least 2 weeks, but if you're patient the longer you wait the better it gets. When you happened to have mixed it, I'd appreciate any feedback. this one I've put my heart into.\r\n\r\n\r\n","steep_days":"21","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"total_reviews":1,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:50:12.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"1613","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Florida Key Lime","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Meringue","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Cheesecake (graham Crust)","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Graham Cracker","vendor":"FW","millipercent":330},{"name":"New York Cheesecake","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Whipped Cream","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1500}],"reviews":[{"user":"lococarnage","score":"5","text":"Just mixed, will update in a week.
