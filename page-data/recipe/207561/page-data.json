Lorann's Banana Cream was just as good as TFA's but it just overpowered the recipe.\r\n\r\nTFA Banana Cream is a great banana candy flavor. Very creamy and smooth. I added WF Marshmallow (Gooey) to give the recipe a sticky and gooey candy like feel. I ran across some taffy a few months back that had Sprinkles in them. The sprinkles made it taste even better. It made my recipe stand out. FW Sprinkles is a great additive to ice creams and yes, taffy. FW Salt Water Taffy is a great tasting Taffy. You definitely get the mouthfeel of Taffy with a hint of vanilla. All around I'm very happy with the results.\r\n\r\nPlease enjoy and give me your feedback!
