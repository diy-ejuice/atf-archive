It was sort of a test recipe to see how the flavors work together.  It was surprisingly good.  \r\n\r\nThe Eisai tea has a light floral herbal tea flavor that creates the base of the recipe. \r\n\r\nThe Red Cherry from Molinberry is to me a toned down version of FLV's discontinued Bing Cherry.

Juicy Strawberry and Raspberry are only supporting flavors adding to the red notes of the overall flavor.
