When I started DIYing, one of my goals was to create an interpretation worthy of the real thing. I tried every clone recipe out there I could find - none came even close. More than 6 months and 20 versions later, the one below ticks all the boxes for me - a really simple recipe compared to some of the others tried.\r\n\r\nThe Peppermint, Menthol and Koolada percentages below are as close to the real juice as one can get imo, but feel free to play around with these to suit your personal taste.\r\n\r\nThe original recipe used INW Milk Chocolate, which has since been reformulated. Feel free to use INW Milk Chocolate if you have the original formulation. Otherwise, use JF Milk Chocolate, which fill those boots perfectly and more.\r\n\r\nA 4 week steep is optimal.\r\n\r\nhttp://tjek.nu/r/8DHB","steep_days":"30","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:49:31.000-05:00","best_vg":"60%","views":"2159","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Milk Chocolate","vendor":"JF","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Mild Winter (peppermint)","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1750},{"name":"French Vanilla Creme","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Vanilla Custard","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Menthol Liquid (pg)","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Koolada 10 Pg","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":500}],"reviews":[{"user":"RudeRudi","text":"This is a masterpiece Andre and has been in my rotation for may months!! Well done mate!!!"},{"user":"Gonzilla","text":"Haven't had the chance to taste Bowden's so I can't comment on the closeness to the original but I really enjoyed this mix. Flavor-wise it reminds me strongly of those white chewy Endearmints if it was given a light chocolate shell. The cooling and mint combination covers all the marks for me and gives a full mouth and throat freeze. The creamy peppermint/chocolate was a perfect combo for our hot summer Christmas, thanks for posting it up Andre!"}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"58459","name":"Andre's Mate (Bowden's Mate remix)"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
