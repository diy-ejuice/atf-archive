So having that said , i wanted to make a Honey snacks cereal bar . They don’t actually make these but if you ever had a cinnamon toast crunch cereal bar then you know they are bomb as fuck! It’s basically a bar of cereal that’s all stuck together with a thick hard cream either at the bottom of the bar or sometimes it sits in the middle kind of like a cookie cereal bar sandwich is the best i could describe it . so the cream cheese icing by LA and vanilla cream extra by WF make the creamy goodness . The graham cracker clear by TPA and the Coolie by FA give it some texture and give the whole recipe some support . I also use FW sweetener because it’s not as sweet as super sweet and i didn’t want to make it too sweet, i think this sweetener is best to use but you can use any sweetener i’m sure . So enjoy !
