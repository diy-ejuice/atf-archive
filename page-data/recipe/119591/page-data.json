So I twisted it a bit to make a peppermint pattie. I had this mixed up and steeped for a week then added the lava cake. I find lava cake shake and vapeable. I don't remember how lava cake  steeps. Its low anyways. I'd give it a 3 to 5 day steep, but this is good as a shake and vape.\r\n\r\nMalted Milk adds milky and grainy flavor to the minty center. On the high side to stand up to chocolate and mint\r\n\r\nWhite Chocolate Peppermint and FW CrÈme De Menthe make up the mint. Only two I had and they work well. CrÈme De Menthe being the bridge.\r\n\r\nVanilla Cream Extra Adds a nice soft vanilla and light cream flavor.\r\n\r\nLava cake. Used real low. I might just be lazy.\r\n\r\nSweetener I don't used it much at all, but when I so I use FW and very low. This is optional. \r\n\r\nThrow some grainy cookie and bump the chocolate a percent and it might be a good thin mint cookie.","steep_days":"3 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-10T19:00:47.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"1156","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Lava Cake","flavor_id":"1493","vendor":"LB","millipercent":1000},{"name":"CrÈme De Menthe","flavor_id":"1266","vendor":"FW","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Malted Milk (conc)","flavor_id":"175","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Vanilla Cream Extra SC","flavor_id":"8382","vendor":"WF","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Sweetener","flavor_id":"1432","vendor":"FW","millipercent":250},{"name":"White Chocolate Peppermint","flavor_id":"6795","vendor":"LB","millipercent":1500}],"reviews":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"119591","name":"My Peppermint Pattie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
