It's the most delicious vape I've ever personally made.  This reminds me of a Butterscotch Pudding more than a custard, and the Kettle Corn really transforms the way this recipe \"sticks\" to your mouth.\r\n\r\nAs far as development notes, since it was based off someone else's recipe I went a different route.  I added some of my favorite flavors, at %'s I KNOW I could taste them at.  I didn't change a single thing from my first attempt, as it's so damn good to me that it lacks nothing.  Sometimes you get lucky, and personally this is on the level of \"Golden Oreo Custard\" with respect to accurately portraying the real life, edible version.\r\n\r\nGive it 7-10 days, at 10 days it's a different animal than even at 5 days.\r\nI hope you enjoy it.","steep_days":"10","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"total_reviews":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T22:32:40.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"1880","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Popcorn","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":500},{"name":"Kettle Corn","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":5000},{"name":"Shisha Vanilla","vendor":"INW","millipercent":1750},{"name":"Vanillin 10% (pg)","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Vanilla Custard","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":8000},{"name":"Caramel (salted)","vendor":"FW","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Sweet Cream","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Butterscotch","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Super Sweet","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":350}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"86322","name":"Butterscotch Pudding"}}}
