But I ve come to the point of thinking any more changes won't benefit it for the good. \r\nGood as s&v but give it a week and you'll be amazed. Percentages are low compared to some other good strw&creams but be assured no flavor is lacking here. Enjoy. \r\n","steep_days":"6","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-06T20:43:53.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"1766","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Bavarian Cream","vendor":"FW","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Cream Fresh","vendor":"FA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Marshmallow","vendor":"FA","millipercent":400},{"name":"Whipped Cream","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Strawberry (ripe)","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Juicy Strawberry","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1200},{"name":"Shisha Strawberry","vendor":"INW","millipercent":750},{"name":"Strawberry","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Lemon Sicily","vendor":"FA","millipercent":200},{"name":"Graham Cracker Clear","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Sweetness","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":500},{"name":"Vanilla Custard","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":500}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"97063","name":"Strawberry Whip"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
