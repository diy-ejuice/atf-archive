But I can see where this is going. Raspberry balance is pretty close and doesn’t taste like Icecream laced with cough syrup. I would toss in a little more VBIC or ramp the percentages up a bit all around and add something to give that ice cream a little more body and dairy sweetness. &#xD;\nIn a RDA you again get the general direction where this is going.&#xD;\nMaybe hit a touch of Bavarian Cream, a small hit of a darker raspberry to add volume/range/extra levels to the raspberry, and steep longer than 7 days. Say... 2 weeks minimum.&#xD;\nI’m strangely attracted to the potential of this recipe."}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"75611","name":"Raspberry IceCream"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
