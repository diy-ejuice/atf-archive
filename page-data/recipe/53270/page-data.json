I can't taste strawberry for the life of me and I wanted to play with mango, so here ya go. I was wanting to go a little more basic than this but felt it needed all the mango flavors. Apricot gives it a nice bit of tartness and the CAP Sweet Cream was completely an accident as I was meaning to grab CAP Super Sweet and didn't realize I had grabbed the wrong thing until it was already in the mix. Happy accident and it stays. This will absolutely be in my regular rotation from now on. I gave it 5 days steep, but I'm sure you can get by on a shake. Enjoy!","steep_days":"5","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-05T06:47:19.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"1574","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Costarica Special (mango)","flavor_id":"579","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Sweet Mango","flavor_id":"120","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Mango","flavor_id":"4507","vendor":"JF","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Meringue","flavor_id":"530","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Holy Vanilla","flavor_id":"2385","vendor":"DFS","millipercent":500},{"name":"Armenia (apricot)","flavor_id":"507","vendor":"FA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Super Sweet","flavor_id":"2384","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":500},{"name":"Cream","flavor_id":"604","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Sweet Cream","flavor_id":"117","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":500}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"53270","name":"Man Cream"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
