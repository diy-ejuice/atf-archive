To me it Is a sweet nectar with that little bite of bitterness. It plays very well with dragon fruit and cactus.\r\nThese three were made to be vaped together.\r\nInw pitaya:\r\nThe juice emulsifier with some floral nuances. Here it plays better than tpa df\r\nJust for that floral feel.\r\nInw cactus: a little lemony back note and tons of wetness, it makes wonders paired with guava.\r\nFa jasmin: one of my fav floral flavors. It provides  very well that petals perfume I wanted in the mix.\r\nThe ws-23 is the perfect coolant to get a summer refreshing vape.\r\nCap super sweet helping the guava become more vibrant. \r\nFor a smooth juice let it steep for 8-10 days. Can be S&V but better after steep\r\n","steep_days":"10 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-12T11:52:54.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"838","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Sweet Guava","flavor_id":"118","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":3500},{"name":"Dragon Fruit - Pitaya","flavor_id":"652","vendor":"INW","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Jasmine Natural","flavor_id":"410","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1150},{"name":"WS-23","flavor_id":"8085","vendor":"OTHR","millipercent":500},{"name":"Cactus","flavor_id":"647","vendor":"INW","millipercent":500},{"name":"Super Sweet","flavor_id":"2384","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":350}],"reviews":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"158611","name":"Flogua"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
