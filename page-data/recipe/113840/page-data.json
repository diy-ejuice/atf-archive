This remix has pushed my skills to the limit. You would think a custard  would be one of the easiest remixes to tackle, but this profile took over 40 batches to get right!  Vapetasia's Killer Kustard has a certain sharpness or brightness that was very difficult to mimic. I have no idea what they use, but I think I've come about as close as I can without absolutely going insane trying to figure out what flavorings they use. \r\n\r\nI want to give a big shout out to Wayne Walker for his insight on this profile. Although his thoughts on what goes into Killer Kustard is much different than my final version, he has been a huge help tackling this profile, thanks Wayne.\r\n\r\nMy first 20 or 30 batches were loosely based on Waynes public release of his Killa Kustard. And while it is very close, there seemed to be missing that \"sharpness\" or \"Brightness\" I mentioned earlier. I honestly used every conceivable combination of custards, creams, ice creams, and sweeteners that I could and created a shit-ton of really good custards, just not Killer Kustard. \r\n\r\nOne \"break-through\" I had was when I ordered DFS Holy Vanilla. I had been using INW Shisha Vanilla for that sharp vanilla note I was getting in the original, but it wasn't quite right. I heard Wayne say that he too got a \"sharpness\" from the original and thought by turning up his percentages, he might could get that sharpness. I normally don't use vanillas over say .5%, but DFS Holy vanilla can be cranked up, and that was the secret sauce that was needed.\r\n\r\nMany mixers think that the custard used in the original is CAP Vanilla Custard V2 and while that may be the case, I found that CAP Vanilla Custard V1 worked better for me giving it a much deeper, eggier feel.\r\n\r\nHS Italian Cream is there to give the mix and even deeper, rich note that most creams lack. At 1% it really adds character to the mix.\r\n\r\nLast but not least, FW Sweetener.  Many mixers say it's best to use EM in custards, and for the most part I agree that sweeteners like CAP SS is not the best for this particular profile.  However, when I used TPA EM I got a muting that was taking away from the brightness I was going for and when paired with DFS Holy Vanilla, FW Sweetener was the best choice for this profile.\r\n\r\nThis recipe is very simple in it's structure, but it was not a simple recipe to try to clone/remix. I've done my best and anyone who loves Killer Kustard will, I'm sure, love this.\r\n\r\nSteep time is a minimum of 1 week, 2 weeks is better for the CAP Vanilla Custard to shine. I mixed this at 70/30 VG/PG as that's what the original is mixed at.\r\n\r\nI hope you will mix, comment, and or rate, it make us all better mixers. :)\r\n\r\nVisit Freedom To Mix on Discord https://discord.gg/cMUjtPf\r\nJoin our Freedom To Mix FaceBook group https://www.facebook.com/groups/415341418920740/ \r\nVisit https://freedomtomix.com/ for resources and information on DIY mixing!\r\n\r\nIf you would like to submit a remix/clone profile, head over to https://www.facebook.com/notes/freedom-to-mix/suggest-remixesclones/461914887596726/ .

I do think they are using V2, but I don't have any, so I used V1. Wow, this is way better than Killer Custard imo. The best thing about this recipe is what I learned from it. I always used INW Shisha Vanilla in my custard recipes to tone down that oiliness. I think TFA Vanillin also really helps with that. I wish Holy Vanilla wasn't discontinued. It does wonders for a custard! I'm going to try it with some INW Custard now. A must have flavor if you're a custard lover. You better get it while you can!  When it's gone it's gone from what I hear. Thanks for a great recipe and showing me what Holy Vanilla can do with Cap's VC."},{"user":"Millions81","score":"5","text":"Really nice &amp; bright like the original. Well done."},{"user":"DixxleRoo","score":"5","text":"I loved the original- this is so close if not the same. I had a couple of drops left in an old bottle of the commercial liquid and tasted them side by side on the back of the hand- they’re so similar. I think the holy vanilla paired with the Italian cream gives it that richness and slight sourness that sets Killa Kustard apart from other custards (sour in the loveliest way- I don’t mean to make it sound as though it’s gone bad). Ive mixed 150ml so far so I’ll have some steeped. BTW anyone know what strawberry they used in their strawberry version? Was it obvious? I’ve never had that one but someone wants me to mix it up for them. "},{"user":"Untitled","score":"5","text":"The original one was my adv and this one is pretty close if not the same. Thank you folkart!"},{"user":"coop34","score":"5","text":"As a lover of simple recipes with as few ingredients as possible, this one appealed to me. Very nice custard! I wish more mixers would take a simpler approach when developing their own recipes. &#xD;\n&#xD;\nThis perfectly nails the profile, and easily rivals any vanilla custard that I have had. The 2 weeks steep is really worth the wait. I forced myself to save half for a month, such bliss! Mixing a 200ml tonite. Thanks for sharing!"},{"user":"kindground","score":"5","text":"I've never had the original but this is a nice commercial custard flavor. I tried it without sweetener or EM and wasn't fond of the sharp/tang note (personal preference). I used .5% EM to round that off for my own tastes."}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"113840","name":"Assassin (Killer Kustard Remix)"}}}
