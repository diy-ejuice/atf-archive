I know a lot of people and some people I know cannot taste strawberries for whatever reason so I decided to just really pound in the strawberries in this one. TFA Dragonfruit is the emulsifier as well as the TFA Lemon, to really let the vividness and the realness come out. If you are a person who has a hard time tasting strawberries, you should really give this a go! NOTE: Of course a little sweetener wouldn't hurt for obvious reasons so add as much as you like or just don't bother. I prefer sweetener in everything i Vape, but I know a lot of us don't. .5 CAP SS is what I'd recommend or even 1% f you want to get crazy.
