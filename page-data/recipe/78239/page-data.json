She used to be a dinner lady then she became a tart, \"Devine\" intervention helped her to become one of the most popular tarts of 2017.   She not only brings all the boys to the yard but is also the envy of the other ladies and has won the title of being \"the ultimate tart! \"\r\n\r\nThe Description: \r\nThis is a remix of a remix of a remix and now is truly (IMO) the ultimate lemon tart! One of the most interesting and fun things to experience in mixing is being able find a recipe you like and learn from how all the flavors work together then tweek it to something that you like better. This is exactly what I have set out to do here. The Remix of the Original called \"Dinner Lady A Lemon Tart Remix\"  by DAZCOLE has been one of the most popular ever remixes in DIY history and so much so companies including \"Chef's UK\" now stock the popular concentrate under the \"Devine\" brand of concentrates. So how can I make this better? I think I can make the lemon notes smoother and more rounded on the edges and bring some more mouthfeel and cream to this profile that suit the way I like to enjoy my vape. Will it be better/worse or different from the \"Devine\" remix? You be the judge! Enjoy :) #RemixMonth","steep_days":"5","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:49:46.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"3893","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Butter Cream","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Vienna Cream","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Caramel (salted)","vendor":"FW","millipercent":250},{"name":"Cookie","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Biscuit","vendor":"INW","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Meringue","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Toasted Marshmallow","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Custard","vendor":"FA","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Lemon","vendor":"INW","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Lemon","vendor":"FE","millipercent":2000}],"reviews":[{"user":"wadeyloops","text":"I didn't know that genetic cloning of humans was allowed but this Lemon Tart has managed to do just that. Without using any lemon meringue pie concentrate she has managed to pull off a stunningly glorious recipe. The choice of lemons in this spot on.  Easily tweaked to suit your tastes but I love it as is. You can thank your lucky stars and clouds for this recipe."}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"78239","name":"Oh You Tart"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
