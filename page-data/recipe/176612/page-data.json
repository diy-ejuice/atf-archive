Won’t regret it) -_-\r\n\r\nHope you enjoy! \r\nLots of love and flavor <3","steep_days":"14","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"updated_at":"2020-12-12T17:12:57.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"1237","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Acetyl Pyrazine 5%","flavor_id":"1709","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":750},{"name":"Cream Fresh","flavor_id":"540","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Hazelnut","flavor_id":"289","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Marshmallow","flavor_id":"332","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Meringue","flavor_id":"530","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Cereal 27","flavor_id":"4163","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Cream Milky Undertone PG","flavor_id":"6539","vendor":"OOO","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Bavarian Cream","flavor_id":"145","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1000}],"reviews":[{"user":"ChefSlurry","text":"This mix is right up my ally.
