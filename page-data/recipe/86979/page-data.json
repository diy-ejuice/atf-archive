The only problem  is I keep adjusting the percentages ever so slightly. Well I guess eventually I have to be satisfied because this combination of fruits is the closest fruity pebbles flavor I have personally tried but getting the milk right has been the tricky part. So here it is my fruity pebbles and milk I like to call it \"Rubble Rock\".\r\n\r\nThe recipe and the reasons why:\r\nSo I was developing so!e flavors for a client and stumbled upon the fact that fw blueberry and lemon meringue pie mixed together tastes extremely close to fruity pebbles. I find that the work anywhere from 1.5% -2% both mixed equally or giving the lemon meringue pie a slight edge ahead of the blueberry depending on how strong you want your fruity pebbles flavor. Its missing just a little something and that something is 1% flavor art Mandarin. Well I guess its missing a little something else which is the grainy aspect of the cereal and for that I used 1.25% rice crunchies. Now this works well but I can't help but think there is a better option out there but I have this 4 oz bottle of rice crunchies tfa so I kind of wanted to use it and it works damn good don't get me wrong. Its like I said I have been making this recipe in some form for a while and not releasing it due to being to critical of the recipe when its already spot on fruity pebbles. So next I had to figure out the milk aspect I have done many different combinations of creams and this was the simplest one because I have the tendency to layer the shit out of things and this simple yet affective combination works. If you want your milky cream a little thicker add some capella new York cheesecake at a low percentage or just play around with your milk combination of choice. Me I used 2% cream milky undertones by ooo and 1% sweet cream by flavorah.\r\n\r\nSweetener:  \r\nWith this mix it is definitely not necessary to use sweetener because the lemon meringue pie fw is really sweet!!! Me I used sweetener anyway .35% of Flavorah sweetness which is the only sweetener I use I figured even though it is sweet already its fruity pebbles cereal which is supposed to be sweet!!
