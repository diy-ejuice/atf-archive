This is gonna need its full steeping time to come together.\r\n\r\nUpdate: Added FLV Cream to help the cream a little more since this BB seems to be a little potent and to help balance things out. Also kicked up the FLV Cheesecake .5% and took the TFA Cheesecake (GC) down .5% to balance out things a little further\r\n\r\n***If you mix this, please leave a review and let me know what you think or if you think there is something that could be changed to make it better!***","steep_days":"7","temperature":"0","recipe_score":4,"total_reviews":1,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:49:32.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"2126","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Cheesecake (graham Crust)","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Blueberry","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Cheesecake","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Blueberry","vendor":"FW","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Cream","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":500}],"reviews":[{"user":"NaCHeF","score":"4","text":"Great recipe!
