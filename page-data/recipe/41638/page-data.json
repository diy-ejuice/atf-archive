Considering how strong it is I went low, but I wanted it to be the main flavor profile in this recipe.  The Thai Chai is also incredibly strong so I went super low with that as well. I wanted that bit of spice and citrus notes from the Thai Chai to balance with leafy floral notes of the Turkish tobacco. I think an alternative to the turkish could be the FLV Commercial Cigarette at the same amount, it wouldn't have as much of the leafy but it would work.  \r\n\r\nThe dash of FlavourArt Cardamom adds to the Chai taste, adding warmth and spice to the overall flavor.  The FA Bergamot filled in an empty spot that I felt the recipe had when I first mixed it without it.  There was just a little something missing.  The dry citrus note of bergamot was perfect to fill in that space, and the added spicy note just blends into the chai flavors. I didn't want to add too much more sweetness since Marzipan is already present as a sweetness in this recipe. \r\n\r\nAdding in the Cream and Marzipan was to smooth the tea and tobacco flavors out and marzipan sweetens the mix overall and works so well with cardamom. \r\n\r\nI've vaped most of the 30ml batch, and I've steeped it for 6 days now and haven't noticed any change today to this recipe.  I think it is fully steeped at day 5. \r\n\r\nI would say this is one of the most interesting tobacco flavors I've created even though I am known for making some far out weird tobacco blends. I've gone ahead and mixed myself a 120ml bottle, and when I do that I know it's a flavor I want to vape pretty frequently for the next month. Give it a try and maybe you'll find a new ADV.
