I took the cue from Wayne and used Cap Lemon Lime for the sherbet base and paired it with fw vanilla bean ice cream because it is a nice and light yet sweet ice cream. Its not too buttery so it translates to sherbets very easily. I used a touch of pink guava for a bit more tart citrus since it tastes more like grapefruit to me. Then I sweetened and thickened up the mix by adding a bit of cap vanilla cupcake. I have mixed this up with .75% polar blast and it is nice but if you don't want to steep this (you don't have to at all) then I would suggest using .5% fa polar blast or use your preferred cooling agent.","steep_days":"3 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-10T17:57:30.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"2007","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Pomegranate","flavor_id":"418","vendor":"FA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Lemon Lime","flavor_id":"83","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Passion (passionfruit)","flavor_id":"585","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Pink Guava","flavor_id":"637","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":500},{"name":"Polar Blast","flavor_id":"5910","vendor":"FA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Vanilla Bean Ice Cream","flavor_id":"1451","vendor":"FW","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Vanilla Cupcake","flavor_id":"129","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1000}],"reviews":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"99624","name":"Cupid's Sorbet"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
