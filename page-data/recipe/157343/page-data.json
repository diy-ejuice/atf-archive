Then he says \"that's all I can give you for now, I will reveal it later\". \r\nHe has side-stepped and made excuses every time he was asked. Since I bought his first one shot of \"the other\" recipe, I was in awe of how one can create such a beautiful and balanced strawberries & cream recipe. I didn't have the necessary skill back then to not only get something close but something better than that recipe, now I do. \r\n\r\nIt's been a long, long time of trying various flavour combinations to create my ultimate strawberries and cream recipe. \r\nNow, I will present it clearly on the two main DIY recipe websites. \r\nNo cryptic goose chase, or side stepping. \r\n\r\nYes this is a war of monumental proportions as I take on \r\n\"Strawberries & Cream\" \r\n\r\nThis is \" War Of The Roses ! \" \r\n\r\nThis is not some simple recipe that tastes like some cheap strawberry and cream candy with a little marshmallow. \r\nThis is a recipe that has evolved through countless versions. \r\nCreated using only the best concentrates that offer something different and delightful to a popular profile such as this. \r\nThis recipe has evolved, not revolved around one persons desire to keep a secret.\r\nI happily reveal my knowledge, as I encourage others to do the same so we can all enjoy the best recipes with out those rose thorn obstacles. \r\n\r\nThe War is over to getting hold of a beautiful top shelf recipe that offers something different. No cryptic code, no glitches, no goose chase, it's all here. \r\nThis is not a \"Remix\", this is a better way of mixing! \r\n\r\nThat's why I say and encourage others to say\r\n\"Together, Let's Discover!\"\r\n\r\nWe all learn something that way! \r\n\r\nWhat I did & how I did it: \r\n\r\nStrawberry - I played with candy style strawberries, authentic strawberries and everything in between. I wanted something as unique as it is beautiful that would carry a lovely depth of flavour throughout the vape. This is why I finally settled on pairing WF Baked Stawberry & JF Strawberry Sweet together. Together they offer a deep, delicious depth of strawberry flavour that contrast against each other deliciously at this ratio and percentage.\r\n\r\nThe Cream - I wanted something again that was unique, textually perfect and not only in balance, but complimentary to the entire recipe. \r\nThe VTA Devon cream offers a silkiness when steeped for 5 days that is a must have here.\r\nI wanted more volume and a compliment to the sweetness that is also smooth, this is why the delectable Flavorah Marshmallow was used. \r\nThe WF White fudge brings some depth and texture through the middle. The white choc within this concentrate really assists in this cameo role. \r\nFlavorah Sweet Coconut is used with restraint to delicately compliment the cream but also assists with balance of the overall flavour. While it's used subtly, I tried this recipe without it but found it really assists with the balance of sweetness. \r\nA little good old Capella New York Cheese cake even as low as this offers a necessary compliment to the volume and texture to this vape. \r\n\r\nThe War Is Over now because we have much to learn from each other in this community. \r\nWe are the part of the vape community that keeps the peace, has fun and enjoys learning from each other while we stay of those dam stinkies! \r\n\r\nKeep having fun on your smoke free DIY journey! \r\n\r\nYes this recipe description is a little shit stir, but all in good fun & in the spirit of a good roast! (Aussies Roast better lol) \r\n\r\nI hope you enjoy this just as much as I enjoyed creating this epic recipe, but let me know what you thought in the comments below. \r\n\r\nSeriously if you like a solid recipe that works give it a go!\r\n\r\nCheers for reading this far, now go and get mixing!\r\n\r\n\"Together, Let's Discover!!!\"\r\n\r\nFacebook - https://www.facebook.com/groups/diydownunder/\r\nDiscord - https://discord.gg/kH4Fqbc\r\nYoutube - https://www.youtube.com/c/diydownunder\r\nWebsite - https://www.diydownunder.com/\r\nInstagram IGTV : @diydownunder\r\n","steep_days":"5","temperature":"0","recipe_score":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-12T03:46:45.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"2533","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Devon Cream","flavor_id":"8869","vendor":"VT","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Marshmallow Vanilla","flavor_id":"10092","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":500},{"name":"New York Cheesecake","flavor_id":"90","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Strawberry (Baked)","flavor_id":"10270","vendor":"WF","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Sweet Strawberry","flavor_id":"3073","vendor":"JF","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Sweet Coconut","flavor_id":"605","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":500},{"name":"White Fudge SC","flavor_id":"8383","vendor":"WF","millipercent":1000}],"reviews":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"157343","name":"War Of The Roses - Strawberries and Cream"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
