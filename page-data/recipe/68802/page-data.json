Over all its a good rootbeer, light on the float and light on the wallet. ðŸ˜‰\r\n\r\nTFA Vs/FW VBIC-  FW'S VBIC sits nicely in the background adding sweetness and works with VS's soft serve qualities.\r\n\r\nCAP Marsh- Used to add mouthfeel with out distracting the rootbeer. Feel free to sub your preferred marsh.\r\n\r\nGood SNV, though it can be a little throaty. If it's to harsh, give it a week and the creams will come out a little more. Sweeten if desired.
