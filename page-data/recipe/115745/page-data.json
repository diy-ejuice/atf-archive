There's something about it that I notice in every recipe that lends to a dry chemical like custard.  I dunno but today I figured out the common denominator.   So I thank you for the revelation and suprised myself that I was able to tell it had INW Custard.  A cool learning lesson for me.  All in all its not bad, Sorry for the ramble of a review but your recipe did help me out alot.  I'm gonna add some Sweetener to see if it lends a little wetness."},{"user":"Zugmaschine","score":"4","text":"Was to weuak for me, in a MTL-RTA.
