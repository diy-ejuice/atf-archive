At first I was simply trying to do a peaches and cream with a little basil, but it wasn't working out how I wanted. Adding a little CAP Cucumber really brought the basil to where I wanted it. Then the peaches weren't coming out right, so a little lemon and strawberry kicked the recipe into gear. To lay a nice foundation I went with a simple Greek Yogurt and Vanilla, which I like because it doesn't distract too much from the main players in the recipe.","steep_days":"5","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"total_reviews":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T10:43:41.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"1065","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Basil","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":500},{"name":"Cucumber","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Greek Yogurt","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Juicy Peach","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Juicy Strawberry","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Lemon Sicily","vendor":"FA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Shisha Vanilla","vendor":"INW","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Yellow Peach","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":4000}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"72237","name":"Peaches and Basil"}}}
