Rereleasing because it somehow got deleted from my catalog of public recipes. Recommend this to any lemonade fans out there.\r\n\r\nINW Cactus: Typical reason for inclusion.. Beverage enhancing moisture.\r\n\r\nFA Forest Fruits: Can be subbed for CAP Harvest Berry. This ingredient contributes the fruit note to contrast the lemonade.\r\n\r\nFLV Lemonade: Country time sweet lemonade. Keeping it around the 3% mark avoids throat hit. Sweet and enjoyable.\r\n\r\nFA Lemon Sicily: Adds some oomph to the overall lemonade note.\r\n\r\nTPA Vanilla Swirl: Very enjoyable exhale component. Light on the mouthfeel, bit of a texturizer. Rounds off the berry notes.\r\n\r\nFLV Lime: Added for complexity. Contrasts nicely with the berries and lemon. Let it steep!\r\n\r\nCAP Super Sweet. Kept low to not overpower the rest of the mix. You can opt it out if you're trying to save your coils and prefer a cleaner experience.\r\n\r\n","steep_days":"7","temperature":"420","recipe_score":5,"updated_at":"2020-12-12T14:06:46.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"4972","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Cactus","flavor_id":"647","vendor":"INW","millipercent":250},{"name":"Forest Fruits","flavor_id":"4890","vendor":"FA","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Lemonade","flavor_id":"636","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":3250},{"name":"Lemon Sicily","flavor_id":"524","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1250},{"name":"Super Sweet","flavor_id":"2384","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":250},{"name":"Vanilla Swirl","flavor_id":"189","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1250},{"name":"Lime","flavor_id":"634","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":250}],"reviews":[{"user":"Ebc88","text":"Nice berry lemonade. Mixed 50/50 9MG for my Orion. &amp; was not a fan but it wasnâ€™t a fan of the Orion in general, but when I dumped some in my billetbox. Is when i really enjoyed this recipe. Berries blend perfectly with the lemon/limeade base you have. The TPA Vanilla Swirl works well and fills out the overall mouthfeel of the vape.
