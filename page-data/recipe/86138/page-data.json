This is pretty straight forward, and the flavours don't need much explaination. I added Devon Cream to add a tasty, thick whipping cream to the cheesecake. All these flavours require about a weeks steep to come together.","steep_days":"7","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"total_reviews":1,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:49:53.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"1646","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Cheesecake Graham","vendor":"PUR","millipercent":2500},{"name":"New York Cheesecake","vendor":"PUR","millipercent":5000},{"name":"Devon Cream","vendor":"CC","millipercent":2500}],"reviews":[{"user":"cultureviolet","score":"5","text":"I love this recipe! Needed a mix to test out my new PUR cheesecakes and Devon Cream for that matter and this fit the bill in spades. I flew through the original 30mL and I just mixed up a 60mL. My plan is to presteep it and try out different 10mLs adding various fruit bases or nuts/caramel or whatever to it. What I found this was especially good for is after vaping 1/2 to 3/4s of a tank of something, filling the rest of the tank up with this, shaking it and vaping it, then vaping a tank or two just Creamy Cheesecake, then vice versa; adding another recipe, shaking and then vaping that recipe for a while and so on. Like the perfect in-between flavor for cheesecake lovers. Not to diminish its merit on it's own, it's absolutely fabulous! Thank you FizzChaser."}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"86138","name":"Creamy Cheesecake"}}}
