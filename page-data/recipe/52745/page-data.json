Pear on the inhale and not too much coconut on the exhale.  A really good balance for my taste. Waited 3 days to try it out. Been looking for a nice pear vape and I think I found a good one. Not too sweet either. Thank you for sharing."},{"user":"KylezKloudz","score":"1","text":"Wayyyy too much Pear! Can't really taste anything over that at all! Now maybe it's me, but it's been almost a week and that's all I'm getting... Its a nice idea for a recipe but it needs some fine tuning (imo) &#xD;\n*** Not trying to be harsh, just trying to give you honest feedback. Hope this helps...ðŸ™‚"}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"52745","name":"Relax"}}}
