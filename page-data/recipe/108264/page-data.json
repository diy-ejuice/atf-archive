Five Pawn's Castle Long meets Fear's Cardinal.   A smooth blend of caramel, bourbon, toasted coconut/almonds, vanilla, tobacco, and oak.  The blend carries slight notes of coffee and cocoa, as well.  I began this working on a clone of Castle Long and a Cardinal-based custard, when it dawned on me . . . drop the custard and make a Castle Long/Cardinal mash up.  Even though it has not hasn't been around as long . . . Cardinal has far surpassed O.G. status, in my book.  I mix this up 60vg/40pg.  This works great as a SNV, but gets better with age.  Enjoy with a cup of coffee blacker than Old Scratch's heart.","steep_days":"7 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-12T20:30:13.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"2788","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"HOLY HOLY GRAIL RY4","flavor_id":"5037","vendor":"DFS","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Red Burley","flavor_id":"4355","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":750},{"name":"Native Tobacco","flavor_id":"4393","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Bourbon","flavor_id":"4411","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":750},{"name":"Kentucky Bourbon","flavor_id":"361","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Coconut Candy","flavor_id":"223","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Toasted Almond","flavor_id":"294","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Holy Vanilla","flavor_id":"2385","vendor":"DFS","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Red Oak","flavor_id":"375","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Oak Wood","flavor_id":"470","vendor":"FA","millipercent":500}],"reviews":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"108264","name":"Castello del Cardinale"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
