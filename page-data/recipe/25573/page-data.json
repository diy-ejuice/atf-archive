I used strawberry biscuit from nicotine rivers house concentrates  for my jelly flavor. Strawberry  biscuit is a great flavor it tastes  almost like fresh strawberry jam with a slight buttery taste it's a wonder full offering from nicotine river. If you don't have strawberry jam from nicotine river I am sure you could use a strawberry flavor of your choice in place of the strawberry biscuit. But I will say that strawberry biscuit is a great flavor and you can't go wrong buying it. Wow from flavor art also has a slight jelly type flavor as well but mainly has a doughnut taste. I mix the wow with glazed doughnut by capella to complete the doughnut flavor. I then add in funnel cake by capella I used this flavor to give it a deep fried taste and feel. I like funnel cake by Capella  in small percentages I think it gives a perfect deep fried taste at  lower percentages.  I feel that doughnut flavors normally take a longer steep time but I tried this  recipe after a  7 day steep  and it tastes really good. Give it a try!!
