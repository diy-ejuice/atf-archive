Yeah it looks silly and simple but it tastes absolutely fabulous after a 1-2 day steep.

I'm not sure if it's one of the concentrates that doesn't agree with me or if it's just overflavored.  Halved the percentages, but I still get a sharp vanillin overdose (or something like that).  I'll let it sit a few more days and will try again. Maybe dilute it some more.  Smells delicious though.  Update:  Halving made it digestible.  Will reduce a little further though.","score":0},{"user":"altneurose","text":"This is the third time I'm updating my review: Milky horchata, not too rich and not too bland. Not much rice coming through after a few days, mostly soft vanilla, milk, and a hint of spice and nuttiness. Simple enough to make the most of the two ingredients and the amounts are just right. Goes well with beer.","score":5}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"28115","name":"Horsey"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
