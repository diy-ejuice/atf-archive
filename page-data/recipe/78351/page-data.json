One of the recipe name ideas was TNT, and I thought of the flavors \"Tobacco-NY Cheesecake-Toasted Marshmallow\". With that in mind I came up with this recipe after a month or so of mixing. While vaping the final iteration of this recipe I was thinking how classy it vaped, and since there are a lot of e-liquid recipes already named with \"TNT\" I decided on \"A Touch of Class\" for the recipe name.\r\n\r\nFor the tobacco note I went with TPA RY4 Double. I really like its mild tobacco presence in the vape, and I also thought the caramel flavor in RY4 would go well with the cheesecake base notes. \r\n\r\nThe cheesecake base is a blend of Capella's New York Cheesecake and TPA Cheesecake Graham Crust. I have tried these cheesecake flavors individually, but they each seem lacking with regards to the intended flavor outcome. A lot of cheesecake e-liquid recipes out there blend these two flavors together so I went with the average ratio I found, and it works fairly well even though there is this slight coconut flavor present (at least to my tastes.)\r\n\r\nOf course I settled on TPA Toasted Marshmallow for that flavor note in the recipe. I added FlavorArt Meringue to round out that overall toasted marshmallow flavor which seems to work quite well to my tastes.\r\n\r\nThere is no doubt that New York Cheesecakes are pretty sweet and rich, and so I added a slight amount of Capella's Super Sweet to impart that sweetness. I also found that it brings the graham cracker and toasted marshmallow flavors to the pallet at the end of the vape.\r\n\r\nI would not consider this e-liquid recipe as an ADV, but it definitely makes for a good slow, methodical, purposeful, evening after dinner vape. When I vape this recipe I get the RY4 tobacco notes on the inhale and the initial exhale. At the end of the exhale the cheesecake flavor comes into the vape. Finally the toasted marshmallow and graham cracker flavors settle on the pallet that lingers for quite some time after the vape.\r\n\r\nUpdate: I reduced the Cap Super Sweet by 0.25% as I was finding 0.5% a bit cloying over time. If you have a sweet tooth by all means stick with the original 0.5% level.\r\n\r\nOptional: I have been adding 0.25% of Flavorah Brie Cheese to this recipe which adds a nice hint of cheesy tartness to the Cheesecake. If you have Brie Cheese give it a try as I think you might enjoy it, but you should probably add another week to the steep if you do.","steep_days":"7","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-06T22:02:21.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"1944","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"New York Cheesecake","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Ry4 Double","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":3500},{"name":"Toasted Marshmallow","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Cheesecake (graham Crust)","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Meringue","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Super Sweet","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":250}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"78351","name":"A Touch of Class"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
