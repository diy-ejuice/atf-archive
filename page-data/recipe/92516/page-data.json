The Irish cream, and coffee combine to create the main profile for this mix. The meringue, whip cream and coconut  add some fluffy mouth feel and create a sweet top note. The hazelnut, brown sugar and  are the base notes.  The vodka  gives you that slight dryness on the exhale similar to what  to the finish of a dry martini cocktail.   \r\n\r\nAs with actual vodka this does not  add a flavor to your profile - it add a dryness and extends the length of the finish on your exhale - which is a nice contrast to the sweet creaminess on the front end.
