It was not dark, harsh, bitter or \"old stock\" tasting. I always try to find my target in 0....little to no degradation on the shelf. I have a bottle of their Custard Cookie at 3% to work on and its so dark and bitter and harsh I can't vape it much less get a bead on what it was a year or two ago when it was probably originally made.

Unfortunately I have never had the original ejuice to compare it's authenticity other than that good job! This recipe will help new mixers getting into DIY because of the simplicity  but complex flavor...üòéüëç"}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"194691","name":"Sad Boy Butter Cookie Remix SPOT ON!"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
