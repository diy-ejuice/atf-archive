With the cold fronts we've been having here in the US, I wanted a nice dark Pistachio blend, And I feel this one turned out really well.\r\n\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n**FW Salted Caramel**\r\nUsed low to accentuate the dark tone and assist w/ authenticating the Butterscotch notes.\r\n\r\n**TFA Brown Sugar**\r\nAssists the overall profile by providing a slight burnt sugar taste. (In a good way)\r\n\r\n**TFA Bavarian Cream**\r\nAttributes a light vanilla note while contributing some slight creaminess to the mouthfeel.\r\n\r\n**FW Butterscotch Ripple**\r\nNext to FW Butterscotch, This is my favorite butterscotch. Adds a nice dark richness to accompany the nuttier tones.\r\n\r\n**TFA Acetyl Pyrazine**\r\nTried with and without during trial revisions and found I enjoyed it much more with it's inclusion. Used here as a traditional flavor enhancer to add a slight \"grain\" texture and to help push forward the nut profile.\r\n\r\n**FW Butter Pecan** \r\nUsed low to supply richness and depth without altering the Pistachio note too much.\r\n\r\n**TFA Pistachio**\r\nObviously the star of the show here. If you would like to add a little more authenticity, Try adding in a little FA Pistachio.\r\n\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n**Follow me on Social Media for more content**\r\nYouTube: http://www.youtube.com/steamroomvaping\r\nFacebook: http://www.facebook.com/steamroom\r\nInstagram: http://www.instagram.com/steamroomvaping\r\nPatreon: http://www.patreon.com/steamroomvaping","steep_days":"5","temperature":"420","recipe_score":5,"updated_at":"2020-12-12T14:06:20.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"2981","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Pistachio","flavor_id":"293","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":6000},{"name":"Caramel (salted)","flavor_id":"1232","vendor":"FW","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Brown Sugar","flavor_id":"313","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":250},{"name":"Acetyl Pyrazine 5%","flavor_id":"1709","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Bavarian Cream","flavor_id":"145","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Butterscotch Ripple","flavor_id":"1217","vendor":"FW","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Butter Pecan","flavor_id":"1212","vendor":"FW","millipercent":750}],"reviews":[{"user":"gravi-tea","text":"this is delicious would recommend to anyone likes pistachio.","score":5},{"user":"Mr-G","text":"looks ok","score":0}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"96129","name":"Pistachio Dreams"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
