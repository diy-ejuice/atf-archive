The slight hint of blueberry brings it in as less of a full on fruit but more like adding a bit of blueberry syrup into the peach pie filling. THe crumble part and the OOO pie crust plus the pastry zest turn create the crust flavor with just a touch of that cinnamon from the CAP blue crumble flavor.  A little bit of whipped coconut cream on top finishes off this recipe and a touch of sweetness just makes the pie filling part stand out more.
