So I did some hard planning and what I mixed up was F***ING delicious so I had to share.\r\n Playing with vanilla cupcakev2, cake batter and sugar cookie as a base I built up the the authenticity with meringue and hazlenut and of course my all time favourite blueberry FW! \r\nGreat shake & Vape but the recipe does change a lot after 2 weeks and flavour becomes richer and darker, I could Vape this for weeks on end! \r\n\r\n ENJOY ","steep_days":"7","temperature":"0","recipe_score":4,"updated_at":"2020-12-12T15:38:55.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"17765","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Cake Batter","flavor_id":"22","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Vanilla Cupcake V2","flavor_id":"130","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Sugar Cookie","flavor_id":"115","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Blueberry","flavor_id":"1201","vendor":"FW","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Meringue","flavor_id":"530","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Hazelnut","flavor_id":"1312","vendor":"FW","millipercent":1000}],"reviews":[{"user":"grumpyoldfart","text":"this gotta be my favorite blueberry muffin shit its even better than anything I ever came up with and im damn picky &#xD;\n","score":5},{"user":"cincinnatiking","text":"One of the best blueberry recipes I've had. Great job making a muffin with these flavors! My friends love it too! I used Cap VC V1, but it's still good!","score":5},{"user":"MediocreVibes","text":"This reminds me of a Blueberry Belvita crisp, but without the flaky texture. Not quite a muffin. Damn good vape, though.","score":4},{"user":"diesel223","text":"Good recipe here. I'm almost through my first 30 ml batch. I do think it leans more towards cupcake than muffin but either way it's a great vape that I can easily keep in my tank all day.","score":5},{"user":"p00pb0t","text":"By far the best BBM recipe I have tried. I do not find any of the flavors to be overpowering as it is well balanced. The blueberry has a nice blend of natural and baked just like an actual muffin. The only reason I could not call this a perfect blend is that I find it lacking in the muffin taste/texture area. It needs something to bring out a little more oomph to it.","score":4},{"user":"amouthforwar","text":"I'm gunna agree with Loonicorn's review here in that the bready part of the profile is a bit more dry like a cupcake rather than a  thick muffin. But overall the vape is great. I've discussed with ID1OT before that I think the use of cake batter is crucial to the gooeyness of a good muffin, so definitely hit that note right. But I think maybe a bit of custard or poundcake would have really helped solidify the recipe.","score":4},{"user":"wh1skeyk1ng","text":"Great recipe!  I actually did FW BB at 3% and FA Bilberry at 1%, but what can I say, I like the added zing FA Bilberry gives.  5/5 either way.  I would say you could tweak the blueberry part to your preference, or even throw in your favorite fruit blend, but that muffin sensation is absolutely stellar!","score":5},{"user":"Loonicorn","text":"Very tasty recipe. I did have to use v1 of the Vanilla Cupcake and that may make it a bit different. I made a vanilla cupcake recipe last year that uses the same combo of cupcake/cake batter/cookie for the base, so to me it tastes like a blueberry cupcake rather than a muffin but still delicious. Nice job! ","score":4},{"user":"FizzChaser","text":"Very impressive as a s&amp;v. Can't wait to try after steep. I'll try and report back in a week.","score":5},{"user":"SlashaLO","text":"This is one of the best BB Muffins I have tried. I loved every bit of it, minus some sort of off note that I get. No one really seemed to get it other than me, and I cant place it. I think it comes from the Cake Batter/Vanilla Cupcake mix. It is a very good vape though, and I did enjoy it as much as I could. ","score":4},{"user":"peachykeen","text":"Fantastic muffin recipe, and I too used CAP vanilla cupcake V1. I also added FA billberry at .5%. My third time making it I went for the 120 ml!  Thanks for sharing!","score":5},{"user":"Dalpho","text":"I used vanilla cupcake V1 and this juice was very good! It totally reminds me of the \"vapor in a bottle\" juice called blue bread. Thanks for the recipe.","score":5},{"user":"mlNikon","text":"I really like this mix! The balance between blueberry and muffin seems perfect. I don't have v2 cap vanilla cupcake so I had to use v1, I hope this doesn't mess with the flavor too much. Good job.","score":4},{"user":"Ch3f_Rams3y","text":"After a few days steep this turns into gold. Great mix look forward to making it again","score":5},{"user":"matp75","text":"increased the bb and cake batter freaking awesome","score":5},{"user":"mk0","text":"After some steeping, this is amazing.

ELR is riddled with horrible BB muffins recipes. I have tried many times to nail down a good BB muffin and have had no luck. Looking at your recipe I had never even though about taking that approach but you nailed it on the head buddy. It still needs to steep so time will tell but off the bat this is amazing. Keep it up","score":5}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"19975","name":"Adams blueberry muffin"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
