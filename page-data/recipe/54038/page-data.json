It's actually one of my favorites unless I want jolly rancher. If you don't have it, try using FA at 3.5 or FLV at 3%. Now the interesting thing about FLV wild melon is that it helps boost whatever melon it's playing with. If you use honeydew, it'll make it taste more authentic like honeydew. If you mix it with cantaloupe, it makes it pop. This flavor is a true chameleon for melons and just takes this to the next level.\r\n\r\nThe strawberry ripe is really only there to help give this a more natural juice type sweetness which it does well here without a strawberry flavoring.\r\n\r\nThe cactus as everyone knows will lend wetness, but it's not why I used it. This is a nice \"green\" flavor than helps hold this melon down from being pulled too far into candy land by emulating a bit of the rind.\r\n\r\nNow the peach, this is such a wonderful peach to mix with other fruits. Honey Peach has a fleshy flavor and that's why I used it here. White peach by FA would be a decent sub at the same %, but JF has a unique sweetness that works great with light fruits so I highly recommend you get it.\r\n\r\nThe blackberry is here to add a bit of depth which is where I find contrasting a dark Berry with a lighter fruit to work beautifully to it's strength.\r\n \r\nThis is a nice juicy mix, but it's full enough to satisfy even the custard lovers (like myself). Certified S&V, but settles in real nice after 24-48 hours...
