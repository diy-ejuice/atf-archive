It's got brilliant green notes and subtle Jasmine that are excellent on their own, but since they'll be mixed with some strong competitors I've decided to bulk that base up with a little FA Black Tea to boost the tannic/tea base and some additional Jasmine from FA to create a strong over all tea base. These 3 together in this combination make an excellent tea base with room for fruit or any other additives.\r\n\r\nThe Melon: FLV Wild Melon is a brilliant melon mix that never dissapoints. The downside to it is that when you take it up to 1-2% it starts to overpower more delicate flavors like our jasmine. So I've left it down at .5% and boosted the sour/melon notes with FLV Sour Apple. You could likely use FA Fuji here in it's place if you don't have FLV Sour Apple, but I really like the way FLV Sour Apple interacts with FLV Wild Melon. Over all you get a sweet, mixed melon overtone to the tea base.\r\n\r\nSweetener: Sucralose works here if you don't keep Erythritol handy, but the earthy sweetness of Erythritol works incredibly well with tea. It's a fair bit weaker than traditional sucralose, so I've settled at 2% here to keep things nice and sweet.","steep_days":"5","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"total_reviews":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-05T02:13:11.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"1286","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Jasmine Green Tea","vendor":"VT","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Jasmine Natural","vendor":"FA","millipercent":750},{"name":"Tea Black Water Soluble","vendor":"FA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Sour Apple","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Wild Melon","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":500},{"name":"Erythritol 5%","vendor":"OTHR","millipercent":2000}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"79082","name":"Wild Tea"}}}
