If you know coffee cakes itâ€™s a nice and buttery cake with a cinnamon streusel and brown sugar swirl.  Sometimes with a crumb topping on it and a drizzle of creamy icing.  It goes great with a cup of coffee. Hence the name! Look no further if you are looking for a nice and rich bakery flavor.  This is one I have worked on for a while and very to happy to share as my second recipe on ATF. ENJOY!!","steep_days":"5","temperature":"0","recipe_score":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-10T14:52:51.000-05:00","best_vg":"75%","views":"1424","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Fluffy White Cake SC","flavor_id":"9024","vendor":"WF","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Cake (yellow)","flavor_id":"1222","vendor":"FW","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Cheesecake (graham Crust)","flavor_id":"152","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Cream Fresh","flavor_id":"540","vendor":"FA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Cream Cheese Icing","flavor_id":"2380","vendor":"LA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Bourbon (vanilla Bourbon)","flavor_id":"420","vendor":"FA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Cinnamon Danish Swirl","flavor_id":"35","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Moose Milk","flavor_id":"1359","vendor":"FW","millipercent":5500},{"name":"Buttercream Frosting SC","flavor_id":"8361","vendor":"WF","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Super Sweet","flavor_id":"2384","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1000}],"reviews":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"117435","name":"CRUMB-E"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
