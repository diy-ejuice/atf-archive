But this was the first one that really convinced my boyfriend, witch is why I call it “daddy’s”. \r\n\r\nI started off using tpa hazelnut, but after a good steep I realized the reality of FW would fit better the profile. Feel free to use TPA’s without the hazel groove (changes completely, but works well). \r\n\r\nI feel it well blended only after a month of steeping, despite after two weeks is already vapeable. Don’t dare trying before... there’s a metallic thing coming out from the hazels that creeps me out. \r\n\r\nHope you enjoy :)\r\nFeel free to comment \r\nLots of love and flavor <3","steep_days":"28","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T20:33:16.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"807","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Hazelnut","flavor_id":"1312","vendor":"FW","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Hazel Grove (hazelnut)","flavor_id":"417","vendor":"FA","millipercent":250},{"name":"Meringue","flavor_id":"530","vendor":"FA","millipercent":250},{"name":"Cookie","flavor_id":"490","vendor":"FA","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Vanilla Custard","flavor_id":"131","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Bavarian Cream","flavor_id":"145","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Almond","flavor_id":"528","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Brown Sugar","flavor_id":"313","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Marshmallow","flavor_id":"332","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Acetyl Pyrazine 5%","flavor_id":"1709","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":250}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"176397","name":"Daddy’s Hazel Cookie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
