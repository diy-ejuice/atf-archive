The goal was to make a delicious summertime vape during the warm weather.  I like to mix 120ml of this at a time, and vape through the steep.  It starts very strong on the strawberry and lemon when fresh.  As I vape through the bottle, it becomes very peach forward. Overall, it feels very fresh the whole way through.  I have been vaping this and tweaking this recipe since about April, and I think I am comfortable enough to share it for the first time!\r\n\r\nSuper Sweet is a necessary addition in this one. It really brightens this mix up.  Without it, all of the notes are weak.  The amount is up to you; I'd mix anywhere between 0.25% and 1%\r\n\r\nEDIT 11/13/20: Removed Marshmallow from this mix entirely, it really doesn't add much to the overall profile.","steep_days":"0 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-12T10:35:23.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"914","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Lemonade","flavor_id":"951","vendor":"LA","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Strawberry (ripe)","flavor_id":"271","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Peach (juicy)","flavor_id":"254","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Shisha Strawberry","flavor_id":"1711","vendor":"INW","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Peach White","flavor_id":"543","vendor":"FA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Lemon Sicily","flavor_id":"524","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Super Sweet","flavor_id":"2384","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":500}],"reviews":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"200798","name":"Splemonade"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
