But what I did get was this recipe...formerly Duchess version 21. It still isn't Kings Crest Duchess but in some ways it's better. It is a very buttery butterscotch and I have vaped liters over the past 8 months. I know percentages are high and if that bothers you then don't mix it...or dilute it if you like. Its very rich and probably not very good for you but well worth it as a treat. Enjoy and leave feedback if you like. Best after 2 weeks for it to settle properly.","steep_days":"14","temperature":"380","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T20:31:42.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"1883","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Bavarian Cream","flavor_id":"1187","vendor":"FW","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Hazelnut","flavor_id":"1312","vendor":"FW","millipercent":3500},{"name":"Butter Pecan","flavor_id":"1212","vendor":"FW","millipercent":3500},{"name":"Butterscotch (natural)","flavor_id":"1219","vendor":"FW","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Sweet Cream","flavor_id":"183","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2500},{"name":"French Vanilla","flavor_id":"1284","vendor":"FW","millipercent":2000}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"14234","name":"Nobility butterscotch"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
