As a shake and vape, you will be able to enjoy the strawberry combination, the donut and creams just take a little longer to really come thru to complete the donut.","steep_days":"7","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:49:32.000-05:00","best_vg":"60%","views":"5805","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Zeppola","vendor":"FA","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Frosted Donut","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Meringue","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Vanilla Whipped Cream","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Red Touch (strawberry)","vendor":"FA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Shisha Strawberry","vendor":"INW","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Strawberry Sweet","vendor":"JF","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Super Sweet","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":250}],"reviews":[{"user":"amouthforwar","text":"Planned to review this a long time ago, but this is a stellar mix. Your usage of Id1ot's strawberry trinity is fantastic here, and oddly enough in my experience heavy profiles like donuts and custards amplify strawberry more than any other, so you get a really upfront strawberry profile here that I personally haven't even been able to recreate in other mixes. None of them have tasted as sweet, gooey, and tart as this. The donut base is great, sometimes a bit doughy depending on the atty, but that's not unwelcome. Delicious  stuff, I love it. My girlfriend loves it. So thank you :)"},{"user":"kirstyla8","text":"I didnt have jf so used cap sweet strawberry as a sub. This is one of the best donut recipes ive tried.
