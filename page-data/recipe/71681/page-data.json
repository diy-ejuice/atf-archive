What do you do for exercise? Mall-walk. Youâ€™re a mall-walking, tall-talking, stall-stalking machine. One thing youâ€™re sure to build with that sort of lease on life is an appetite. Naturally, you settle down at the Factory where itâ€™s a cool but comfortable 84F. When your 2:30pm dinner is said and done, itâ€™s time for business to begin. Enter the dessert you dreamt up in the depression era dustbowl despair of your childhood: oreo ice cream cheesecake. That was likely science fiction back then, so cheers to you for having such a forward-thinking mind during a time when people smoked cigarettes to cure disease. Before you start devouring this contemporary delicacy, you better put on your windbreaker.. Ice cream always puts a chill in your bones, but itâ€™s just so darned tasty.\r\n\r\nHappy mixing. ðŸ‘½","steep_days":"7","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:49:41.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"2909","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"New York Cheesecake","flavor_id":"90","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":5000},{"name":"French Vanilla Icecream","flavor_id":"2129","vendor":"HS","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Cookies & Cream â€“ SC","flavor_id":"7484","vendor":"RF","millipercent":500},{"name":"Biscuit","flavor_id":"4487","vendor":"JF","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Vanilla Bean Ice Cream","flavor_id":"186","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Super Sweet","flavor_id":"2384","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":250}],"reviews":[{"user":"MrZigglesworth","text":"Honestly I wish I had a better way to describe this, but I really enjoyed this recipe.
