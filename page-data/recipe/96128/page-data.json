I used this to create a delicious tobacco dessert vape. It has a great bite free taste. It tastes of Butter Rum and Jamaican Rum. \r\n\r\nTo help with the dessert feel, I used Holy Holy Grail, an RY4 Type concentrate. Flv Toffee really helps to build on the toffee flavor, but the Vape Train Hard Crack Toffee really gives that extra bite to the caramel and toffee combination, it gives the taste of real hard toffee. The Vape Train Devon Cream has this warm butter note that goes perfectly with Caramel and Toffee. This really helps blend all the flavors together. To top it off, FW Butter Pecan adds the extra delicious flavor. \r\n\r\nThis is delicious after the shake, but for optimal taste, a week steep would be best because of the Devon Cream. \r\nOptional: add .25 to .5% of AP, this will help bring more of the nuttiness notes out. \r\nEnjoy \r\n","steep_days":"7","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"updated_at":"2020-12-12T14:06:20.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"2654","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Butter Pecan","flavor_id":"1212","vendor":"FW","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Butter Rum Cavendish","flavor_id":"9304","vendor":"SM","millipercent":5000},{"name":"Devon Cream","flavor_id":"8869","vendor":"VT","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Hard Crack Toffee","flavor_id":"8896","vendor":"VT","millipercent":400},{"name":"HOLY HOLY GRAIL RY4","flavor_id":"5037","vendor":"DFS","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Toffee","flavor_id":"4425","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1000}],"reviews":[{"user":"Ge-Ma","text":"Great recipe... delicious","score":5}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"96128","name":"Butter Rum Toffee Tobacco"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
