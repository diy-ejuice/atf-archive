I hadn't tried formulating a Blueberry sweet dough before but I had WF Deep Fried Pastry Dough on hand and thought....\r\n\r\nSelf: What can we do with this?\r\nOther Self: Well.. It's dough you dipshit! A friggin' bakery!\r\nSelf: Alrighty then, Behavioral therapy it is.\r\n\r\nSo this flavor needs a bit of a steep to allow the complexities of the bakery elements to meld together, But the aroma right away will make you glad you mixed this up. Enjoy :)\r\n\r\nFull flavor notes... Loading... Loading..

Smelling it smells damn close to blueberry donut. However vaping it is more like a blueberry cream pastry. Which is just fine because it is a very tasty recipe. Also WF Fried Dough had a terrible oil taste when i solo tested it. Iâ€™ve tried to pick out the oil in here and its nonexistent. Glad I found a recipe i can use that flavor in. "},{"user":"Tootall","score":"5","text":"First and foremost this is a 5 star recipe because it just tastes awesome. I am not sure I exactly get a doughnut but it's Damn  close. What it is is an absolutely amazing blueberry flavor/recipe don't sub anything it's perfect the way it is I waited 8 days to  taste this recipe so it may get more doughnutty in the next couple of days  but hey I am not mad at it. Not at all this is simply  put just a great blueberry recipe and I am big on blueberries so that's saying a lot. "}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"65971","name":"Blue Doh!"}}}
