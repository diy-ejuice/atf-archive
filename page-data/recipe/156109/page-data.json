Not much to say for this mix. I decided to see how the the champagne layer we created would work with other fruits... I must have had Dave on my mind so I went with **FLV Mango**. Then I wanted to try it with  **FLV Pink Guava**, but since I love them together I just mixed them up in the same batch. I'm a huge fan of Pink Guava and it adds a lot to the champagne layer without being noticeable. So here you go, play around and mix other fruits with it.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe stream is over but the fight is not, please donate to [Beating The Odds, My Fight With Esophageal Cancer.](https://www.gofundme.com/f/1msdgy5g00)","steep_days":"1 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":4,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:51:00.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"1593","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Mango","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Brut Bubble Wine","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":500},{"name":"Citrus Soda","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1750},{"name":"Fizzy Sherbet","vendor":"VT","millipercent":1000},{"name":"WS-23","vendor":"OTHR","millipercent":250},{"name":"Pink Guava","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":250}],"reviews":[{"user":"ID10-T","text":"I love this, but if I’m being picky, which I’m in the mood to do right now, it’s too citrusy. Not too citrusy to be enjoyable, I absolutely enjoy the hell out of it, but to just be mango and champagne without any lemony business. The citrusy elements (Citrus Soda, Fizzy Sherb) in the base that was stolen for this just enhanced the blueberry in the blueberry champagne recipe that it was stolen from, but in this mix they stick out more, possibly amplified by the touch of Pink Guava. I happen to like the mango + citrus combination, but there should be a warning about that for any weirdos who don’t. The base is super-realistic bubbly chilled sweet (but not too sweet) champagne that works wonderfully.
