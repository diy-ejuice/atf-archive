The mid notes of pitaya adds that tropical taste to the overall vape.  Finally the (FA) Lemon Sicily to add a little sweet and sour lemony taste on the exhale.  \r\n\r\nPretty new to crafting my own recipes from scratch so let me know what you think!","steep_days":"0 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-05T23:56:08.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"990","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Blueberry Jam","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Blue Raspberry Cotton Candy","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1250},{"name":"Dragon Fruit - Pitaya","vendor":"INW","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Sour","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":250},{"name":"Lemon Sicily","vendor":"FA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Super Sweet","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1000}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"184058","name":"Blueberry Dragons"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
