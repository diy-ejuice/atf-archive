I finally decided to pick up some WS-23 to play around with and this is what I came up with... It's a blue jolly rancher(esque) tasting freeze, comparable to one of those cheap blue freeze pops...\r\n\r\n Feel free to lower the Blue Raspberry to 6% or increase the Lemon Sicily .5 - 1% or both...depending on your liking... 1% WS-23 seems sufficient. You'll probably want the sweetener it's a cheap freeze pop what else is there in it besides Blue & Sugar? ðŸ˜œ","steep_days":"1 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"total_reviews":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-06T20:45:57.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"868","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Blue Raspberry","vendor":"LB","millipercent":8000},{"name":"Lemon Sicily","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Super Sweet","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":500},{"name":"WS-23","vendor":"OTHR","millipercent":1000}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"195669","name":"Blue 32"}}}
