It really needed more time to steep though.  I would have loved to try the VT Chocolate Mousse but I have not bought that one yet.  This is fairly decent but the flavors are light by nature and hard to convey into an e-liquid.  This was my first attempt at a mousse profile.  It is hard to pull off that texture without using flavors that can potentially mute the white chocolate which is already an extremely light flavor.   I may come back and update this recipe later on after I see how it steeps.\r\n\r\n***You can add in some FLV-Sweetness to this as well if you would like it to be sweeter.***","steep_days":"3","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T22:33:11.000-05:00","best_vg":"60%","views":"1096","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Whipped Cream","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":600},{"name":"Love DIY","vendor":"VT","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Vanilla Pudding","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Cookies & Cream","vendor":"RF","millipercent":1800},{"name":"Marshmallow","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":800},{"name":"White Chocolate Base","vendor":"VT","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Golden Syrup","vendor":"VT","millipercent":800},{"name":"Toffee Ice Cream","vendor":"VT","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Vienna Cream","vendor":"FA","millipercent":400}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"123933","name":"Moussed Up #MixinVixens"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
