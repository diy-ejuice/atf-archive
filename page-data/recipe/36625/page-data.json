It's not strictly a cookie profile, but that's the name she gave it in honor of the original, Lord Cookie. \r\n\r\nI started this clone when I was very new to mixing, and was so proud of myself for realizing instantly that the main note in the recipe was CAP Vanilla Custard! Oh, sweet summer child. At any rate, this is very sweet and full, with a mild artificial vanilla note. It's similar to what a traditional 'Nana Custard would taste like if you took away the banana.\r\n\r\nNot bad as a shake & vape, but much better after a week.","steep_days":"7","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T12:45:44.000-05:00","best_vg":"60%","views":"1586","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Sugar Cookie","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Vanilla Cupcake","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":500},{"name":"Vanilla Custard","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Whipped Cream","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1000}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"36625","name":"Count Cookie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
