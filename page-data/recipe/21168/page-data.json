I played with several versions of this recipe and found 6% to be the sweet spot. It's a weaker flavor, so under 3.5 % it's almost unnoticeable. At 7+ it's too dry to be enjoyable to me. \r\n0.5% AP adds the grain we're missing from the flavor. \r\n\r\nOur marshmallow base is 4 ingredient deep. \r\nFirst, the main flavor cap new marshmallow. This is a fantastic jet puffed marshmallow flavor. \r\nIt's however a tad flat in complexity. A small percent of meringue helps with that. Adding that dry marshmallow texture/flavor. It's hard to describe. Cap new marshmallow is great, like marshmallow cream. But it's missing that corn starchy flavor on the outside. Go lick a jet puffed marshmallow and you'll understand what I'm talking about. \r\nNext is the cap vanilla custard & golden butter. This is the melted butter base. The custard adds a wonderful mouth feel and fullness to mix \r\nThe butter is obligatory for our flavor to work. \r\nNext is fw caramel candy. \r\nThis is my favorite caramel. It's well rounded and flavorful. \r\nAt 1% it's just enough to \"drizzle\" the top. \r\n\r\nSucralose I feel is 100% necessary for this mix to work. \r\nI have not tried it with erythritol as of yet and pyure/other stevia do NOT complement this recipe. \r\nIf using cap super sweet, drop the percentage to 1.","steep_days":"30","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-06T20:41:50.000-05:00","best_vg":"100%","views":"1429","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Acetyl Pyrazine","flavor_id":"1709","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Sucralose Solutions (5% VG)","flavor_id":"5563","vendor":"NN","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Caramel Candy","flavor_id":"1233","vendor":"FW","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Golden Butter","flavor_id":"60","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":250},{"name":"Meringue","flavor_id":"530","vendor":"FA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Marshmallow","flavor_id":"87","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Rice Krispies Type","flavor_id":"1398","vendor":"FW","millipercent":6000},{"name":"Vanilla Custard","flavor_id":"131","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":2000}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"21168","name":"Aphrodite v2"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
