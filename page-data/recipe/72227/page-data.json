After going through two 30ml one shots, and only having one 50ml of mixed up Rose Milk, I knew i needed to finalise my clone attempt.\r\n\r\nIf you like these kinds of profiles, I highly recommend buying the one shot and supporting @ENYAWREKLAW, but if you are in country where the possibility of buying this amazing one shot isn't possible, no stress, mix this up, at least to my palette this is 1:1.\r\n\r\nTHE STRAWBERRY\r\nCap Sweet strawberry, because that is an already released ingredient, TFA strawberry is the other main strawberry in this mix, i taste it almost immediately and it's one of the best strawberries out there.\r\n\r\nTHE CREAM\r\nHS FVIC is an already released ingredient and it works so well in this mix. TFA VBIC is one of my favourite creams and I'm convinced its what i taste in rose milk.  A while back Wayne mentioned that CAP VC V1 was in rose milk very low, I kept it at 0.5% because he has used it this way numerous times in the past. CAP New York Cheesecake is THE Cheesecake in Rose milk, Cheesecake ( Graham Crust) has too much of a malty cookie note that won't work in rose milk. \r\n\r\nTHE OBVIOUS\r\nIt can only be Waynes recipe if it has 0.5% CAP Super Sweet\r\n\r\nALL THE CREDIT GOES TO WAYNE FROM DIYORDIE\r\nSupport him by buying the one shot at ECX or Chefs Flavours.\r\nhttps://www.chefsflavours.co.uk/diy-or-die/5557-rose-milk-30ml.html\r\nhttp://www.ecigexpress.com/shop/diy-e-liquid/diyordie-concentrates/strawberries-and-cream.html","steep_days":"7 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:49:41.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"12875","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Sweet Strawberry","flavor_id":"121","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Strawberry","flavor_id":"272","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"French Vanilla Icecream","flavor_id":"2129","vendor":"HS","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Vanilla Bean Ice Cream","flavor_id":"186","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":3000},{"name":"New York Cheesecake","flavor_id":"90","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":3500},{"name":"Vanilla Custard","flavor_id":"131","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Super Sweet","flavor_id":"2384","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":500}],"reviews":[{"user":"robolto78","text":"Off the shake this is amazing. I can only imagine how the creams will present themselves in 5-7 days. Great Job!!!

The initial hit of creamy strawberries followed by a residual milky exhale is incredible. Adding the vanilla custard to the mix gives off some really good highlights as well. Easily a five star recipe!"},{"user":"cdaniell30","text":"I've been waiting on Wayne to release his recipe far too long.  Til then, this is my go-to S&amp;C...it's so good"},{"user":"SMILEY","text":"I hear and see all the hype about ROSE MILK but being the penny pinching diy'er that I am I will not cough up the coin to try it. I just mixed this recipe up and it is by far the best S&amp;C I have ever tried. Thank you so very much for sharing this with all of us here on ATF. Mix this up y'all won't need ROSE MILK. IMO!"}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"72227","name":"Rose Milked"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
