It's so good that I have to share it with others. I've made this one on top of another great recipe of mine - Brown Pears ( http://tjek.nu/r/jNmK ) but Duess is far more delicate.\r\n\r\nWhy that much sweetener? I like it sweet. You can add as much as you want, it's not chiseled in stone...","steep_days":"12","temperature":"0","recipe_score":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-10T13:45:40.000-05:00","best_vg":"20%","views":"926","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Corn Bread","flavor_id":"2007","vendor":"OOO","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Pear","flavor_id":"1372","vendor":"FW","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Pudding Base","flavor_id":"8948","vendor":"VT","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Super Sweet","flavor_id":"2384","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Walnut SC","flavor_id":"9052","vendor":"WF","millipercent":2000}],"reviews":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"114653","name":"Duess : Tapioca pudding with corn bread, pear and walnut"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
