I'm going to go ahead and give it all five stars because it's a cherry lemonade that tastes amazing, though I have a little bit of beef with description. WIth the juice itself, zero beef whatsoever. But the relatively high amount of INW Dragon Fruit here that \"takes it in a unique direction\" seems to take it outside the realm of a beverage. That Pitaya has a lot of base body to it that comes across thicker and chewer than something that could come up through a straw. The end result here is like eating a frozen white gummy bear and frozen cherry lemonade gummy bear at the same time. Sounds strange. IS strange. But I'm digging the hell out of it.
