Not too authentic and not too fake. Flv pumps it up a bit and the Fresh Cream, Whipped Marshmallow, VCV! and VBIC round out the drink with cream vanilla goodness. The Sugar Cookie adds some body and depth and binds the coffee, cream and RY4 together. I have been trying to make a decent coffee vape for a few friends for awhile now and I think its pretty on point! Sweeten to taste.","steep_days":"5","temperature":"0","recipe_score":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-10T17:57:20.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"1486","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Coffee","flavor_id":"2250","vendor":"RF","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Vanilla Bean Ice Cream","flavor_id":"186","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Vanilla Custard","flavor_id":"131","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Cream Fresh","flavor_id":"540","vendor":"FA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Whipped Marshmallow","flavor_id":"8744","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Sugar Cookie","flavor_id":"115","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Ry4 Double","flavor_id":"379","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Coffee","flavor_id":"635","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":500}],"reviews":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"91361","name":"WHOAK"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
