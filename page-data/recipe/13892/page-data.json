The best Horchata recipe you can ever imagine. After several revisions this is what I end up with. A mix full of richness and creamy all the way from the inhale to the exhale. The Condensed Milk play a big roll here, it just complement so well with all the other creams that is almost impossible to described. The cookie gives the Horchata that extra weight to not let the creams take over the mix,at least in my humble opinion. I have to say that this recipe was inspired by \"Squonk\" at VU. Squonk has another version that I'm sure he'll welcome you to try as well. I've been tweaking this recipe for some time and has become one of my daily vape. I hope you enjoyed as much as I do.\r\n\r\nSteep: Medium (Normally cycle through sonic cleaner for about 2 Hr and is good between 7 to 10 days)\r\nMix at 80vg/20pg\r\n","steep_days":"0","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"total_reviews":1,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:48:48.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"1962","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Cinnamon Ceylon","vendor":"FA","millipercent":250},{"name":"Horchata","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":6000},{"name":"Cookie","vendor":"FA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Cream Fresh","vendor":"FA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Milk Condensed","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Sweet Cream","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Vanilla Bean Ice Cream","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Shisha Vanilla","vendor":"INW","millipercent":750}],"reviews":[{"user":"Aquaneo","score":"5","text":"Very nice vape.
