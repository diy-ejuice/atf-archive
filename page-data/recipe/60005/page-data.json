I didn't like it at first, but ended up really liking it. I tried cloning it a few times with no success. When I started playing around with a few POG recipes I started getting that taste I was looking for.  ENYAWREKLAW's POG Remix recipe was the one I was mixing when I found the flavor I was searching for. Thank you Wayne. I added and subtracted, back and forth. This is what I came up with. I may tweak it a tad in the future, but this is tasty.. These fruits just blended into just what I was looking for. In the end I actually like this one better. I get a little more orange flavor. The juicy lemon brings this one together IMO. Good shake and vape. It really comes together after a few days.","steep_days":"3","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:49:33.000-05:00","best_vg":"%","views":"1888","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Sweet Guava","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":6000},{"name":"Passion (passionfruit)","vendor":"FA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Dragonfruit","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Orange","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Blood Orange","vendor":"FW","millipercent":500},{"name":"Sweet Tangerine","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Juicy Lemon","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":500},{"name":"Super Sweet","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":500}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"60005","name":"Guava Lolly"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
