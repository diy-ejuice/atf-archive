I have to say, I have never has this as a desert. I had to do a bit of research to see the ingredients in this profile, http://mirchitales.com/salted-caramel-custard-a-belated-eid-mubarak/ . I didn't go too heavy on the custard. I wanted the chocolates, caramels, and brown sugars to be the star of the show. It's a dark, heavy desert, just the way I like it. The FA Cookie, HS Australian Chocolate, and Bavarian Cream make up the \"Oreo\" cookie layer. The FW Salty Butter Balls adds the caramel and brown sugars. The CAP Vanilla custard,...well it is a custard profile. Just a touch of CAP Super Sweet to brighten things up a bit, and voila, my interpretation of a Chocolate, Salted Caramel, Custard. \r\nI would suggest steeping this for at least 3 days for the best flavor.\r\nVisit Freedom To Mix on Discord https://discord.gg/SmSc8Ef\r\nVisit Freedom To Mix on FaceBook https://www.facebook.com/groups/415341418920740/ \r\n\r\nPlease comment, mix, and or rate,....it makes us all better mixers.
