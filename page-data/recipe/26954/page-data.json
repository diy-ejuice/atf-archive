Although not the original recipe from my local shop, it comes very close. I may even like this recipe better & I feel confident enough & with a much needed little push to publish. I know this recipe is high in flavor % but it is all (TPA) which requires higher %'s anyways & it works. Add 1 drops of 10% Citric Acid per 15ML. The Citric Acid is key to this recipe. These are popular flavors everybody should have in their arsenal. Sweeten to taste. IMO best as shake & vape. This has been my ADV for several months now & for any strawberry lover out there Im sure it will become yours too.\r\nThe Pineapple & Pomegranate are just additives to give the Strawberry something to hold onto. The Citric Acid pops the fruit flavors and is absolutely necessary. The marshmallow is self explanatory, giving a light fluffy feeling to this vape. None of these flavors can be substituted. I hope you all enjoy...
