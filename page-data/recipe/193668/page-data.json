This time it was Inw Grapes/JF blueberry which make a banging 2 flavor mix. But still it wasnt a full recipe it needs a supporting cast in the form of american bubble gum, but it still needed something else. Shoutout to Isuamadog and Robot because without their use of cap double apple I dont know if I ever would have finished this. The mix needs an overnight steep as Inw grape needs a minute to calm down a bit. Sweeten to taste.","steep_days":"1","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:51:33.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"1289","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Blueberry","vendor":"JF","millipercent":1400},{"name":"Grape","vendor":"INW","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Double Apple","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":3000},{"name":"American Bubble Gum","vendor":"MB","millipercent":4000}],"reviews":[{"user":"RUG_ly","text":""},{"user":"CupcakeFetish","text":"Tastes exactly like I remember that 5 seconds of flavor from that super sugary bubble gum in the purple wrapper, except it lasts forever (until you run out of juice). &#xD;\nSuper delicious. super (pardon my language) moist, juicy, gummy, grape-y, and just spot on.&#xD;\n-Almi'zi"}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"193668","name":"Everlasting Bubba Hubba"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
