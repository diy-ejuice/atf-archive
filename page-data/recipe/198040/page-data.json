I get a vanilla and banana malted shake instead of fresh banana in vanilla ice cream which is what we wanted. I pick up the tartness from the strawberries which Iâ€™m not upset about. I like this being banana and vanilla forward with the tart on the end. This one is strawberry blind friendly."}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"198040","name":"Milkshake Madness"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
