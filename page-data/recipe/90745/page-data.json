So this new version of this tea utilizes a large amount of flavors at very low amounts each. This recipe isn't going to be for everyone, really it's only for us weirdos who like this type of flavor, like me and Kopel.  If you are feeling daring and have all of these flavors give it a mix.  If you have no idea if you like floral flavors, this could be a bit much of a recipe to get all the flavors for and not know if you like florals.   \r\n\r\nYou can add a touch of sweetener to this if you want to, I personally don't sweeten it beyond the flavorings that are in there. But if I were going to sweeten it I would go rather low with it so it doesn't turn into candy. \r\n\r\nYes you can shake and vape this, but it will be lacking in notes that take longer to steep.  I say give this a minimum of 14 days to steep, 21 will have even more of the tea flavors coming through the fruit and the floral notes continue to calm down until it's steep for a full month.
