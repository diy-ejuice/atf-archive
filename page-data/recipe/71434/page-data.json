I just couldn't resist and  had to add a bit of (FA) Almond to it. \r\n\r\nMy friend  just jumps right at it as a S&V. I would recommend a week tho, so the flavors can really come together. \r\n\r\nAny comments, suggestions and additions are highly appreciated. \r\nHave fun! \r\n","steep_days":"7 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:49:41.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"1915","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Biscuit","flavor_id":"642","vendor":"INW","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Cookie","flavor_id":"490","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Cinnamon Danish Swirl","flavor_id":"35","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":750},{"name":"Almond","flavor_id":"528","vendor":"FA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Vanilla Bean Ice Cream","flavor_id":"186","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1000}],"reviews":[{"user":"cdaniell30","text":"It would have been a solid cookie without the almond, but the almond is a very nice touch."}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"71434","name":"#4 Just Cookie Jules"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
