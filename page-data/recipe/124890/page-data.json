WF glazed donut is a pretty spot on  light fried dough with a cinnamon and slight berry note.   in order to turn this into a  cake type of donut, I needed to add an additional  flavor and FW cinnamon roll provided some additional body to the donut along with  butter, cinnamon and caramel notes.\r\n \r\n**FLV apple filling,  INW two apples  and FA Brandy**   create that apple cider flavor  that has been infused into the batter .  INW two apples was used over other apples since  on it own has a cider  apple juice type of vibe  that works in this application.  it would make a great base for a spike apple cider beverage.    FA brandy  works to  turn fruit into a sweet cooked flavor.  Apple pie filling is  exactly that  the pie filling  with a nice bakery cinnamon, so it helps to support the cooked apple and spice notes \r\n\r\n**flv milk and honey**  adds some  body and creaminess and adds some of the darker sweet bakery notes \r\n\r\n**VT sweet cream** helps to blend, add moisture, and body to the mix \r\n**NOTES AND SUBS**   FW caramel  cinnamon roll can be subed  with CAP cinnaom danish  but the cinnamon is  slightly different  and I tend to get a bit of a metallic note from it.     INW two apples  can be subed with Pur county apple, which will give you more of a cooked apple vibe,.  FLV apple pie filling can be subed for  FA apple pie  but it needs to be used  around 3% to pull out some of those apple notes \r\n\r\nThis  was  made for  Day time Franks show   mixin in the kitchen fall flavors \r\n\r\nLearn more about mixing here:\r\nfacebook - https://www.facebook.com/groups/diydownunder/\r\nDiscord - https://discord.gg/kH4Fqbc\r\nYoutube - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCTCwb7ULyfJALQlehomZZQA\r\nwebsite - https://www.diydownunder.com/\r\n","steep_days":"5 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"total_reviews":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-02T07:31:58.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"1428","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Apple Filling","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Brandy","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Caramel Cinnamon Roll","vendor":"FW","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Glazed Donut SC","vendor":"WF","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Milk & Honey","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Sweet Cream","vendor":"VT","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Two Apples","vendor":"INW","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Sweetener","vendor":"FW","millipercent":500}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"124890","name":"Put that Cider in EVERYTHING  ( caramel and apple cider donut) "}}}
