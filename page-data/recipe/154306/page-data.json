Adds a bit of butter, mouthfeel and a sour milky note to the frosting.\r\n\r\nThis recipe could be much more complex but simple things some times are better so.. enjoy! \r\n","steep_days":"15 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T23:37:48.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"1193","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Lemon Meringue Pie","flavor_id":"84","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Pandoro","flavor_id":"538","vendor":"FA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Butter Cream","flavor_id":"3","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Super Sweet","flavor_id":"2384","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":500},{"name":"Vanilla Cupcake","flavor_id":"129","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":3000}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"154306","name":"Lemon Frost Cupcake"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
