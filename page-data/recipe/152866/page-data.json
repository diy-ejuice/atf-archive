Add some shisha strawberry and a little sweetener and gtfo. Simple and absolutely beautiful strawberry kiwi. Refreshing and smooth. Shake and vape but definitely improves over 24 hours.\r\n\r\nLike most of these NR flavors, they’re basically 75% complete recipes, they seem to work around 7-12% and have been shake and vape so far. They all need a little help.
