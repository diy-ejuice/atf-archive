It is like a French Vanilla Mousse Pie in a Graham Cracker crust with caramel.  This is very Graham Cracker forward.  \r\nbutter Pecan Ice cream by OOO is more like a oven roasted Pecan. It has a delicious taste.   \r\nFrench Vanilla Ice Cream by Hangsen is a great creamy, buttery French vanilla with Caramel notes. \r\nCreme Brulee by OOO gives a slight burnt caramelized note, this helps the Graham Cracker in the Lucky Shot.\r\n\r\n\r\n","steep_days":"7","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"total_reviews":4,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:50:18.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"3056","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Butter Pecan Ice Cream","vendor":"OOO","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Butterscotch Ripple","vendor":"FW","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Creme Brulee","vendor":"OOO","millipercent":1500},{"name":"French Vanilla Icecream","vendor":"HS","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Lucky Shot","vendor":"OSD","millipercent":6000},{"name":"Madagascar (Vanilla Classic)","vendor":"FA","millipercent":500}],"reviews":[{"user":"Grfxman","score":"5","text":"This is just absolutely divine. In some ways this comes off like an RY4 without the tobacco... over a bed of ice cream. I think that is coming from the Lucky Shot - which is one of my favorite ingredients to use solo or in a recipe. The more I use that flavor, the more I fall in love with how useful it is... this is a great example of how it can richen and make a recipe pop. This is robust with flavor and mouth feel, buttery, creamy, caramel for days..."},{"user":"Daytimefrank1","score":"5","text":"Mouthfeel for days! Rich and creamy with natural sweetness. This will easy be in my ADV rotation!"},{"user":"MECH_MOD_RN","score":"5","text":"Th is is  just heaven to me .  It is all the things I LOVE   but balanced in a way that I have not been able to achieve    Tam you are one heck of a mixer truly, thank you for sharing this beautiful mix    "},{"user":"VapinTrucker","score":"5","text":"OK so I did have to substitute Madagascar vanilla with FA Vanilla bourbon. This being said this recipe used a new flavor I had just got which is what led me to mix it. I wanted to try the OOO butter pecan ice cream. Now what to say here. Thus recipe reminded me how much I love butterscotch ripple. Combined with the OOO  It leaves that creamy pecan taste just like eating the ice cream. The recipe is very well balanced and tasty. It's sweet enough but not too sweet. If I had to say anything negative at all I'd say I wish the flavor was just slightly stronger but that being said I have mixed 2X50ml and today I will make a 100ml batch as is. There is just something about the cream and the nutty flavor with the slight buttery finish that keeps me coming back. Thanks Tammy for a great recipe that I will be Vaping  well into the fall I'm sure v"}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"109992","name":"50 Shades of Cream"}}}
