If you want more grape flavor just turn up the tfa grape juice a bit and sweeten to taste. Less sour just lower or emit flv candy roll and/or flv lemon. This is a shake and vape but a couple days and everything really comes together.\r\n01/17/20 So i bumped grape juice  from 3.5-4% and I am liking it a bit more..It's more grape tasting without loosing the tangyness.\r\n01/26/20..I added la lemonade 1% which adds a juicy tangier aspect to it.\r\n","steep_days":"2 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-06T04:12:12.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"876","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Berry Blend","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1200},{"name":"Boysenberry","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1800},{"name":"Candy Roll","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":700},{"name":"Grape","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":2600},{"name":"Grape Juice","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Lemon","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":700},{"name":"Raspberry","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Sweetness","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":250},{"name":"Lemonade","vendor":"LA","millipercent":1000}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"180929","name":"Amethyst Sour"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
