It is pretty close though, but I honesty wanted something better than Apple Jacks. \r\n\r\nFA Breakfast cereal is an amazing wheat type cereal flavor. A perfect base for this recipe and thank God we don't have to rely on sub par cereal concentrates now like in the past.\r\n\r\nCAP Double Apple and CAP CDS worked out nicely for the apple and cinnamon without having to turn this into an overly complex layered recipe with 20 ingredients. The CDS also helps a little with the cereal base.\r\n\r\nThe creams are rather light in this recipe, but they do add some nice mouthfeel and keep the overall recipe from feeling too dry.","steep_days":"14","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"total_reviews":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T12:46:36.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"1475","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Double Apple","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Breakfast Cereals","vendor":"FA","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Acetyl Pyrazine 5%","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":250},{"name":"Cinnamon Danish Swirl","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Cream Fresh","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Vienna Cream","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Cream Milky Undertone PG","vendor":"OOO","millipercent":1500}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"89260","name":"Angry Apple, Stoned Cinnamon"}}}
