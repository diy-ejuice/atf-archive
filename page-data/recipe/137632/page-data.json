This works for me for now, so we'll see if I can't improve upon it later. Knowing me, this will be average at best until I hit version 26, so do what you want with this shitpost.\r\n\r\nBasic idea was to work with a bunch of ambiguous flavors in order to create something reminiscent of a white gummy bear soda. It's on the way there. Notes below.\r\n\r\nCAP Silverline 27 Bears - this shit is interesting. I've played around with it a bunch in the last two weeks I've had it, and there's a lot you can do with it. Low percentages just gives a candy citrus note, while the higher it's pushed, the more we get a sort of \"white gummy bear\" suggestion. It's moderately smooth, pretty low on the chemical taste (good job Capella, you gave us an all in one candy that doesn't taste like the piss from a Chernobyl victim), and has some nice mixed fruit flavor. It's still very citrus/pineapple forward, but there's hints of everything in here. At 4%, it holds weight in the mix as the gummy bear base.\r\n\r\nTPA Dragonfruit / INW Dragonfruit - so to play off the pineapple notes of a white gummy bear, without actually using a pineapple flavor, TPA Dragonfruit is the way to go. I find that a lot of the pineapple options really overpower any mix that they're in, so I wanted to accentuate that profile without obliterating the mix. TPA Dragonfruit has some really nice ambiguity to it as you push it's limits. Instead of using it here as a way to bind flavors together or accent other flavors, it's actually being used to add to the citrus/pineapple profile. Using INW Dragonfruit provides us with a bit more body and depth, as that flavor is significantly more \"realistic.\" With that, we get some mouthfeel, a little bit of suggested creaminess, which is crucial to preventing this recipe from just being akin to licking a car battery.\r\n\r\nVT Fizzy Sherbet / FW Beetle Juice - so these two work together nicely to create our soda base. VT Fizzy Sherbet is a delicious lemon-lime soda profile, feels oddly similar to if you added Sprite or 7-Up to some sort of fruit punch. While it isn't simply a lemon-lime soda, it definitely gives us a bit of bite and, well, fizziness to the recipe. FW Beetle Juice is here to fill in the gaps and provide a little extra full fruit flavor to prevent the onslaught of pineapple and citrus. I've found in previous recipes that FW Beetle Juice does a great job at filling in the gaps and adding some depth to TPA Dragonfruit, and that's exactly what it's doing here. If anything, I believe we can push this even higher in future attempts, while dialing back a bit on the Dragonfruit(s)/27 Bears.\r\n\r\nCAP Super Sweet - I've seen the light last year, and 2019 is no exception. In recipes like this, adding some Super Sweet helps round out some of the harsh edges. Adjust percentage to your own preference, but this seems like a mix that really could benefit from even more sweetener. We'll see.\r\n\r\nOPTIONAL - WS-23 - I made the recipe, and it's a fruity one, so obviously I'm adding 0.75% WS-23. You don't need to, but a little bit of this will definitely add to the \"soda\" aspect of the mix. \r\n\r\nAlright, do what you want with this. I needed something new to vape, and this does what I needed. You all already know I dial in 95% of the shit that I post on here, so don't take it too seriously.","steep_days":"1 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:50:42.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"3435","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"27 Bears","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Dragonfruit","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":3750},{"name":"Dragon Fruit - Pitaya","vendor":"INW","millipercent":1250},{"name":"Fizzy Sherbet","vendor":"VT","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Jammy Berry","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Super Sweet","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":500}],"reviews":[{"user":"wolfwheeler","text":"Let me start this by saying I never really liked fruit vapes. They’re either too thin or too sweet, but this.. this is killer. I just got the Dragonfruits and wanted to try them out and I’m so surprised. The pineapple notes in 27 Bears help brighten this up and the gummy mixed with Fizzy Sherbet is giving me a nice full mouthfeel. I love this. Good job."},{"user":"NickG","text":"just curious if jammy berry is supposed to be beetle juice at 3%. Not seeing any mention to Jammy Berry in the description, but found the reddit post and got the percentage of beetle juice @ 3%. I do love me some Jammy Berry and was just wondering if you revised the recipe."},{"user":"Ebc88","text":"Very tasty stuff. 27 bears brings an excellent gummy texture. The dragonfruits and jammy berry blend perfectly to make pleasant fruit note. I did sub in flv sweetness instead of super sweet &amp; found the sweetness level perfect for my likings. Excellent job and thanks for sharing "}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"137632","name":"Soda Bears #001"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
