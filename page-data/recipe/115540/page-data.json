The flavor is good, but I am going to have to single flavor test 2 of the flavors as I had a reaction to one of the flavors.  I have the same reaction to super sweet, so there must be a similar chemical make-up in one of the flavors.  Just thought I would give the warning if anyone else has that problem.
