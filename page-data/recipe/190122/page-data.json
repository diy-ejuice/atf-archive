Taking some inspiration from AlfredPudding's Stardrop recipe in the combo of 27 Bears, Dragonfruit, and Forest Fruits. Adding in some Strawberry Ripe to fill in the sweetness, Sweet Currant for a little more \"wild\" fruit flavor, and some Vanilla Swirl to blend it all together with a hint of creaminess. \r\nShake well, make the sacrifice to Satan, and vape away! \r\n(named after one of my favorite record labels)","steep_days":"0 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"total_reviews":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T15:22:05.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"693","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"27 Bears","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Dragonfruit","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Forest Fruits","vendor":"FA","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Strawberry (ripe)","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Sweet Currant","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":500},{"name":"Vanilla Swirl","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2000}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"190122","name":"Forest Freaks"}}}
