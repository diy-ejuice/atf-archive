To me tropical fruit flavors are over the top in your face bold, and combined with a somewhat, for the most part, unpleasant texture it ends up being just too much for this landlubber. I was somewhat amazed that I embarked on this recipe given my relative dislike of this 'genre' of food. I received a bunch of flavors from Flavorah of which one was Pink Guava. The aroma of Pink Guava is so intriguing that I was driven to find a recipe for it. I proceeded to scour the Internet looking for Guava recipes. The result of my query ended on a Mango, Guava, and Strawberry smoothie recipe that also incorporated Bananas and Coconut Milk as a base. \r\n\r\nOff I went trying to get this together, and the results are quite amazing IMHO. While you can SNV this recipe, after a three to five days steep the banana cream really starts to fill out as a base.\r\n\r\nFLV Mango is just a great all around Mango flavor. It may not capture all of the true Mango essence, but for a smoothie it really does the job. FLV Pink Guava is such a unique and aromatic flavor. I did not want to wander into the Grapefruit territory so I kept it low in this recipe. I can't really taste Strawberry flavorings that well, so I chose FA Juicy Strawberry and FA Red Touch at a level that is providing a tart natural Strawberry back note behind the Mango and Guava - others may find a more pronounced Strawberry flavor in the mix - sorry about my Strawberry muted olfactories. \r\n\r\nFor the base I chose FLV Sweet Coconut for the Coconut Milk along with a little FLV Cream to bolster the fullness. For the Banana I had to go with VT Banana Custard. This is such a smooth natural Banana flavor. After the steep it provides a very nice natural Banana addition to the vape. I also added just a few drops of FLV Coconut which increases the depth and creaminess to the Coconut Milk base. I know it is somewhat expensive, but it is so good that you really need to have it in your arsenal. If you don't have it you can probably leave it out, but a very rich aspect will be lacking.\r\n\r\nWhen I vape this the initial exhale is that full creamy Banana with a slight hint of Coconut, and then that wonderful Mango, Guava, Strawberry mix settles on the palate that lasts for quite some time. This is one of my favorite recipes. It it is very rich, and if I over do it my palate can get worn out due to the bold flavors involved. I will also add that nicotine will alter the vape of this recipe quite a bit. I find that running between 1.5 to 2 mg/ml of freebase nicotine is best. You might be able to push the level more with Nicotine salts.\r\n\r\nFor the most part this recipe is complete, but I reserve the right to maybe tweak the percentages a bit. I have vaped this in both a single coil RDA and an RTA (the RTA leans toward the creamy banana, and the RDA toward the Mango-Guava) with excellent results, try it and let me know what you think.\r\n\r\n[Update] I've been waffling on the overall percentages of this recipe between two 'final' versions that I have. The first version of this recipe I posted is quite strong, and is possibly too much flavorings if used in an RDA. I thought it would tame down in the steep, but it did not. The second version I have of this recipe reduces most of the flavor percentages down by 25%, and I find it a lot smoother in an RDA without sacrificing too much flavor. I reduced the FLV Mango, VT Banana Custard, and the FA Strawberries from 2% to 1.5%, the FLV Sweat Coconut from 1.5% to 1.25%, and finally the FLV Cream from 1% to 0.75%.  I left the FLV Pink Guava, FLV Coconut, and Sweetener as they were.\r\n\r\nPhoto by Alan Chen on Unsplash (Vignette added by me)","steep_days":"3 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"total_reviews":null,"updated_at":"2020-11-30T13:24:47.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"1212","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Cream","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":750},{"name":"Sweet Coconut","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1250},{"name":"Coconut","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":250},{"name":"Mango","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Pink Guava","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":750},{"name":"Banana Custard","vendor":"VT","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Juicy Strawberry","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Red Touch (strawberry)","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Sweetener","vendor":"FW","millipercent":500}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"139685","name":"Tropical Tryst"}}}
