A spot of marshmallow to fluff and sweeten things up and we are good to go! \r\n\r\nThe simplicity  and brilliance of FW Blackberry Is put to the test here and works perfectly to provide a fresh, juicy blackberry flavor. The CAP Lemon Lime compliments and balances the creaminess and fruitiness with finesse. \r\n\r\nBeing cream heavy, this baby needs at least 7 days to shine, 10 days best.
