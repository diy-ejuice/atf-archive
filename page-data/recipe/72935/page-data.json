The wetness and authenticity of the peach in this mix because the apricot in this small % rounds the flavor and gives the moist lips feel here. The LB VBI is a gorgeous thick rich and lovely ice cream and the vanilla in that concentrate really offers a delectable bonus in this easy recipe. Enjoy! :) ","steep_days":"3","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-02T07:28:50.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"1773","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Peach White","flavor_id":"543","vendor":"FA","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Vanilla Ice Cream","flavor_id":"1511","vendor":"LB","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Armenia (apricot)","flavor_id":"507","vendor":"FA","millipercent":500}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"72935","name":"Peachy King"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
