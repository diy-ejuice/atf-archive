I couldn't find a tobacco that paired better with cherry or chocolate in the entire flavorah line. Layered on top of a classic combination of cured and red burley it really shines. The red burley really adds a touch of nuttiness and wonderful tobacco body and the cured just goes hand in hand with it. \r\n\r\nCherry Extract is surprisingly light at 3 percent and really helps brighten up an otherwise dark and rich vape. It can also really help those chewing tobacco notes from Tatanka pop and keep them interesting. That touch of cherry also reminds me of that lovely red fruit note you get from some of the really nice chocolates like valrhona.\r\n\r\nChocolate Deutsch lends an all-encompassing dark rich chocolatey body for everything to settle into, turning this into a lovely vape to have with your morning coffee. It really also helps dry out the vape a bit and keep it in that lovely tobacco realm. Some people get a light coconut from this flavor, I think the cherry and tatanka mask it quite nicely making this more of a rich dry chocolate back note with a slight hint of riesen. \r\n\r\nThank you FEAR and Graham for testing it for me and telling me to release it ASAP, and LonesomeRhodesTN Ckemist and Chemical Burn Victim for keeping it real in the tobacco world.

Easily the best use of Tatanka Iâ€™ve come across. I tried this without Chocolate Deutsch initially, subbing in VT Chocolate Custard at 1%, which was wonderful, but nothing compared to the magic that happens with Chocolate Deutsch. That flavour is the perfect match for this profile. A luxurious vape. Amazing work. "},{"user":"shaunculwell","text":"OUTSTANDING! Dude, you are the shit! This and Mango Sticky Rice are my go-to vapes! Very well done again @shyndo!"},{"user":"Fleming","text":"this is amazing.  Iâ€™ve been working on tobacco recipes and this is a good recipe to refer to. Itâ€™s not easy getting Flavours to stand up to tobacco and blend at the same time. Iâ€™ve only steeped one day and itâ€™s bliss.  Tip of the ðŸŽ© sir well done."},{"user":"SlashaLO","text":"I wish it hadnâ€™t taken me so long to mix this up! Amazing balance here. Everything blends very well. The hints of coconut and nice cherry just mix with that chocolate so well. Then throw that on a tobacco and Iâ€™m sold! Well done my friend, very well done. "},{"user":"Ebc88","text":"This is good!!!! The chocolate and tobacco make it a coil, but i donâ€™t care its that good. The coconut note in the FLV Chocolate Deutsch is what makes this recipe for me. I donâ€™t really get any cherry, but the chocolate coconut tobacco is good enough for me.  Your tobacco combo was an excellent choice its hard to go wrong with FLV Red Burley &amp; Cured. I have SF tested Tatanka but I have never tried to mix with it. After trying this I will mess around with it. "},{"user":"jbird","text":"Oh man! That Tatanka is delicious with the chocolate. Definitely the star of this recipe. The other tobaccos really drive home that this is a tobacco vape. The cherry actually taste like it's baked right into the cake. Very well layered and balanced. I typically don't vape tobaccos all day but I can't see myself putting this one down any time soon. Awesome job shyndo!!"},{"user":"ID10-T","text":"HELL YES. If actual chewing tobacco tasted this good I'd have lost half my face to mouth cancer and still been happy about it.  "},{"user":"asmirm","text":"My favorite bacco vape!&#xD;\nThank you so much."},{"user":"folkart","text":"Chocolate, cherry, sweet tobacco, what more would you want. This is a perfect blending of these flavors! As with most tobaccos you need to let them steep. Off the shake there is a slight mustiness that's common with most tobaccos. Just give it a few days and everything blends nicely. Great job Shyndo!"},{"user":"Drawaes","text":"Brilliant tobacco. The first tobacco that I can see entering my rotation. Mixit up for sure"},{"user":"LonesomeRhodesTN","text":"A spectacular tobacco!  Black Forest Bacco : Chocolate Tobacco :: Cardinal : Caramel RY4!!  The trio of tobaccos are perfectly accented by the Black Forest cherry-chocolate heaven!!  I'm in awe.  My new go to morning vape with coffee.  Shyndo shines again!!"},{"user":"shakenvape007","text":"Superbly done. You have done it again. Every layer in this is present and well balanced. "},{"user":"SteamOn","text":"You've got a winner bro! Loving that chocolate cherry note. The enjoyable nature of tatanka shines through holding hands with the cured, Absolutely one of my favorite tobacco mixes to date. I'm mad I didn't make a bigger bottle. Excellent mix dude!"},{"user":"Fear","text":"To be quite honest this scared me, had it not been Shyndo asking me to mix it I would not have. This is so far out of my lane of enjoyment on paper that it is not even funny. SO, on the shake, this stuff is amazing, day two this stuff is amazing. It is very tobacco upfront with cherry chocolate notes playing nicely in the back ground. It is a bit chewing tobacco forward at times, which I quite enjoy. All in all 10/10"}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"87014","name":"Black Forest Bacco"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
