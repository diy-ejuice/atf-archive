Tastes alot like the bottom of a starbucks frappuccino when you drink it really fast and end up sucking all the whipped cream through the straw trying to get more....  Nice, sweet, and straightfoward.  Be patient, It needs the steep and goes from good to great. Seems like this would be a great creamy backdrop to a main note."}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"149332","name":"Wu C.r.e.a.m"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
