It is just white rice, whole milk and sugar cooked until the rice is very soft, and then she adds fresh blueberries after it cools.  I wanted to try to duplicate the flavor.\r\n\r\nThe base is FE Rice Milk since it is a creamy, plain rice.\r\nI added FLV Cream to add a milky richness.\r\n\r\nThe beverage is very sweet, but I wanted to try to add the sweetness with a blueberry flavor, FW Blueberry, but it does not duplicate the flavor of fresh blueberries.  I hadn't tried VTA''s Blueberry, so I used it, just to get a feel of how it would work in a mix, and FW Black Current to add some depth to the berry flavor.\r\n\r\nSweetener is optional, but I did prefer it with a little sweetener.\r\n\r\nTested on Engine Nano 0.31 Ohm, 43 watts","steep_days":"7","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-05T08:07:05.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"734","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Black Currant","flavor_id":"1191","vendor":"FW","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Blueberry","flavor_id":"1201","vendor":"FW","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Blueberry","flavor_id":"8836","vendor":"VT","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Sweet Rice","flavor_id":"7727","vendor":"FE","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Cream","flavor_id":"604","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Rick's Sugar Daddy","flavor_id":"9413","vendor":"TBV","millipercent":250}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"168187","name":"Blueberry Rice Milk"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
