I think going above 2.5% would ruin the recipe. \r\n\r\nThe vape I get from this is a sweet mango on the inhale followed by a pleasant creamy rice flavor in the middle and a deliciously sweet coconut milk on the exhale.\r\n","steep_days":"15","temperature":"420","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T17:33:42.000-05:00","best_vg":"75%","views":"1612","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Coco' (coconut)","vendor":"FA","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Costarica Special (mango)","vendor":"FA","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Cream Fresh","vendor":"FA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Mango","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Rice Crunchies","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Sweet Cream","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Vanilla Custard","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Whipped Cream","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2000}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"21541","name":"Khaoniao mamuang (Mango Sticky Rice)"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
