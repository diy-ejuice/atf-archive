The Brown Sugar helps with a slight richer sweetness and goes with the shell and cooked apple.\r\n\r\nFA Fuji & FA Liquid Amber stewed/fried/seasoned sweet apple.\r\n\r\nFeel free to Vape at 600F for blistering authenticity.\r\n\r\nThat's about it.\r\n","steep_days":"3 (SNV)","temperature":"450","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T02:15:13.000-05:00","best_vg":"80%","views":"3212","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Apple Pie","flavor_id":"8","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":3500},{"name":"Brown Sugar","flavor_id":"313","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Churro","flavor_id":"4168","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Cinnamon Danish Swirl","flavor_id":"35","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":750},{"name":"Fuji","flavor_id":"506","vendor":"FA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Liquid Amber","flavor_id":"476","vendor":"FA","millipercent":400},{"name":"Zeppola","flavor_id":"6312","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1800},{"name":"Super Sweet","flavor_id":"2384","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":600}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"48432","name":"McFuckle Pie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
