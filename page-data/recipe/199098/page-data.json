I have no idea if this taste closely to the real ‚Äúthingy ‚Äú on the picture, but as a vape it sure I DELICIOUS!\r\n\r\nMy notes are short, but they are here.\r\n\r\n- Sugar cookie: is the bottom of the slice.\r\n\r\n- Custards premium + Bavarian cream is the middle layer\r\n\r\n- Strawberry ripe + shisha strawberry: strawberry ripe is the ripe strawberry and shisha strawberry and sweet Strawberry is the jelly. \r\n\r\nThat‚Äôs it. That is how to make a delicious recipe without the recipe and without going crazy with all sorts of things. Just keeping it simple and use the ingredients that you see on the picture. That‚Äôs it.  \r\n\r\nIf you enjoy pls comment or something. \r\n\r\n- Joe Roots \r\n","steep_days":"7","temperature":"0","recipe_score":4.5,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:51:39.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"1064","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Shisha Strawberry","flavor_id":"1711","vendor":"INW","millipercent":500},{"name":"Strawberry (ripe)","flavor_id":"271","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1250},{"name":"Sugar Cookie","flavor_id":"115","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Custard Premium","flavor_id":"9118","vendor":"FA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Bavarian Cream","flavor_id":"145","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Super Sweet","flavor_id":"2384","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":500},{"name":"Strawberry Sweet","flavor_id":"4745","vendor":"JF","millipercent":1000}],"reviews":[{"user":"cxxxxp","text":"I love a jelly slice Joe. It's quite easy to make but takes a little time to set.

I mix'd up a bottle and I will leave a review after the steep time. Thank you and good work already!&#xD;\n&#xD;\nedit: So in my opinion the liquid needs more than 7 days steep because the Sugar Cookie is much too present and everything is not balanced yet. I like the strawberry combination it is in the background and also fits perfectly with the recipe. I don't think the recipe is breathtaking but it is good and will definitely be even better after one more week. Good job Joe :-)"},{"user":"whatiswiththeworld","text":"I mixed 10mls of this up over 7 months ago And forgot about it, not really liking fruit flavors, but just bored and mixing things I wouldn‚Äôt normally. &#xD;\n&#xD;\nThis is nice.
