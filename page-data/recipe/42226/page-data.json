It's an extremely tasty SNV, where the strawberry doesn't dominate the other fruits as it will tend to do. \r\n\r\nCap Double Apple - Of the apples in my collection, this one matched the honeysuckle strap-on the best. Adds that little twinge of sweetness in with the apple that helps round out the pair of strawberries. \r\n\r\nTFA Honeysuckle - The intended star of the show, I think this really ends up working as a bridge between the strawberries and the watermelon. Arguably the easiest of the more popular florals to work with, this flavor lightens and brightens up the mix\r\n\r\nTFA Strawberry & Strawberry Ripe - Used here in conjunction to give a more holistic strawberry to supplement the wateriness of the watermelon. \r\n\r\nRed Summer / Watermelon - Yeah. Uh. This was here because strap-on, but it adds a really nice accent to the back end of the strawberries. This flavor might be bottom bitch in the recipe, but as any pimp can tell you, you're nothing without a strong bottom bitch to back you up.
