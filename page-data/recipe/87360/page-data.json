Does it pretty well without having any kind of off notes. Does need some help becoming a latte of course. \r\n\r\nDairy Milk (TFA): the milk, in the latte. \r\n\r\nGraham Cracker v2 (Cap): used to give the profile more of a sweet brown sugar effect. Can not sub for v1, as v1 has much more body to it. \r\n\r\nSuper Sweet (Cap): optional, but preferred in this recipe. \r\n\r\nToasted Marshmallow (TFA): this is what makes the mix in my opinion, this is used to add some froth to the latte. Does a great job at that in this recipe, itâ€™s delicious. \r\n\r\nVanilla Custard v1 (Cap): this is simply used for its body in this recipe. At 3% it adds some vanilla to the latte without taking over and turning it into a custard. \r\n\r\nNeeds at least 3 days to steep for the flavors to settle down. \r\n\r\nThis recipe has been an easy ADV for me.
