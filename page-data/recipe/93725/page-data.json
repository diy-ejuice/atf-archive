Lacking the cinnamon note in DL but I prefer it this way.\r\n\r\n\r\nStill very much a work in progress, but let me know your thoughts. \r\n\r\nI'm thinking of changing Sugar Cookie to CAP CDS for the cinnamon note, to make it more authentic.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBest after a nice long steep. Throw it in a drawer and forget about it.","steep_days":"14","temperature":"0","recipe_score":4,"total_reviews":1,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:50:03.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"2767","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Bavarian Cream","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Fuji","vendor":"FA","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Lemon Sicily","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1750},{"name":"New York Cheesecake","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":5000},{"name":"Sugar Cookie","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Cheesecake (graham Crust)","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Acetyl Pyrazine 5%","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Graham Cracker Clear","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2500}],"reviews":[{"user":"PCHEFLIN","score":"4","text":"The graham cracker is very forward and the apple note is way to light, could use a touch more apple and cinnamon in my opinion.
