Didn’t have FW GC so I left that out and tweaked his recipe slightly to get as close as possible to my ideal s’more. \r\nIf you want his exact recipe you’ll have to watch the vid as I don’t think it’s on ATF. \r\nAnyways, I kept the FA Cookie, TFA GCC and AP the same as his, banking on it giving me enough Graham without using FW, which it does... just! \r\nFor the Marshmallow I opted for FW instead of FAs because it’s a more authentic artificial/gooey marshmallow flavour in my opinion. I love FAs but it wasn’t the type of Marshmallow I wanted to taste in this recipe. \r\nI had to add some TFA Toasted Marshmallow to ‘toast’ the Marshmallow, gives a little diversity to it as well as the obvious toasted notes that I think helps the Cracker out a bit too. \r\nTotally agree with the FW VBIC. Gives a bit more weight to the Marshmallow and very subtle vanilla, without smacking you in the face with it like TFAs. \r\nDropped the FA Meringue half a percent, so it’s an almost imperceptible sugary little accent.\r\nI used the old INW Choc, but JFs would be fine in the same percentage. It’s not enough to scream Chocolate, but it’s there sitting nicely at the back end of the vape doing as it’s told. \r\nSuper Sweet to enhance the perception of chocolate. Adjust to preference. \r\nAnd that’s that! \r\nIt’s still not what I would consider ‘perfect’, the only thing I think it’s lacking is the Graham Cracker. It’s there, underneath the ‘Mallows but it could do with a boost. The Marshmallow and Chocolate are spot on in my opinion though.  Benefits from at least an overnight steep, more if you don’t enjoy fresher flavours.\r\nBig thanks to Wayne for the base recipe to tweak from, legend as always! 👏\r\n","steep_days":"3","temperature":"0","recipe_score":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-10T17:57:20.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"1486","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Acetyl Pyrazine 5%","flavor_id":"1709","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Graham Cracker Clear","flavor_id":"325","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Cookie","flavor_id":"490","vendor":"FA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Marshmallow","flavor_id":"1351","vendor":"FW","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Vanilla Bean Ice Cream","flavor_id":"1451","vendor":"FW","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Meringue","flavor_id":"530","vendor":"FA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Milk Chocolate","flavor_id":"796","vendor":"INW","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Super Sweet","flavor_id":"2384","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":500},{"name":"Toasted Marshmallow","flavor_id":"340","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1000}],"reviews":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"91301","name":"Please Sir, Can I Have S’More?"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
