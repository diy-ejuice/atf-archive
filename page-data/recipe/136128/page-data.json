I get the best Blackberry I have encountered, and this is Blackberry in your face, but not overdone.\r\nI usually don't use sweetner, but it is needed in this, It makes that Blackberry really pop, plus vta is sometimes on the dry side.\r\nI also vape at around 35-55 watts. I bumped it up to 70 watts and got a whole better vape.\r\nUsing citadel at 14 ohms @ 70 watts with Topside Squonker.
