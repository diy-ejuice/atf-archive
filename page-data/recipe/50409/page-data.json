Turkish to bring in the Eastern influence, Native to darken it up more and lend a more cigarish edge to the mix.\r\n\r\nTurkish and Native can both get a bit dark, but also are not super complex on their own which is where Connecticut Shade comes in. It brightens while adding depth with it's naunced notes.\r\n\r\nThis is a spiced Cigar, and how can you have spiced without spice. I wanted a woodsy tone thus the Wood Spice, Pumpkin Spice is a great blend for a lot of reasons, used here for all those reasons :) FLV Clove, because, well, if you have not you should.","steep_days":"3 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"total_reviews":1,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:49:23.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"3678","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Native Tobacco","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Turkish Tobacco","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Connecticut Shade","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":800},{"name":"Wood Spice","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":500},{"name":"Pumpkin Spice","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":700},{"name":"Clove","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":300}],"reviews":[{"user":"ali","score":"5","text":"Used Oak Wood (FA) and Storm (FA) for Wood Spice and Clove in same percentages respectively.&#xD;\nIt turned out great, and I'm sure it would be even better with the original.&#xD;\nIt tastes to me like a perfectly spiced creamy cigar.
