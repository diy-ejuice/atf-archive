I get mostly blueberry and cinnamon without a lot of the pastry and gooeyness but its still very tasty.  Usually people fail at making this profile but I feel you hit it pretty well, just slight room for improvement.  "},{"user":"ENYAWREKLAW","text":"Tasty bakery that has a lot going on. A bit imbalanced for me, a bit too blue distracting from the bakery, but a tasty vape indeed. "},{"user":"triangulatethisdick","text":"As others have said I absolutely love the blueberry note in this, which is not an easy task as it changes dramatically in respect to each recipes competing flavors. That being said the pastry was a little flat and dry for me. I've been on the hunt to figure out that 'gooey' aspect. Anyways well done!"},{"user":"ConcreteRiver","text":"Blueberry note is fantastic.  Very blueberry forward, but the pastry acts as a wonderful complement.  Gorgeous."},{"user":"ID10-T","text":"Beautiful blueberry flavor! I wouldn't have guessed blueberry and CDS could get along quite this well but they really do. Perfect pairing with morning coffee just like a fresh blueberry cinnamon roll would be, but with far fewer calories. Thank you for this!
