So basically not a cheesecake at all. Slop some custard on some graham crackers and you've got the gist. \r\n\r\nBav Cream/Custard Pi/ Vanilla Custard\r\nThe aim here is to create a really dense custard base with a slightly eggy nature that all good custards have.  The Bav Cream provides that slight eggy nature that I'm looking for, with both custards forming the foundation.\r\n\r\nBiscuit/Graham Cracker Clear \r\nThis provides a base, a firm foundation and I find that Graham Cracker works nicely with Biscuit to do just this. It may become a little peppery/ginger-y. the steep will tell and percentages will be updated accordingly.\r\n\r\nVanilla/Almond\r\nThese provide your top-note, the Almond to provide a nutty feel, and the vanilla as a true top-note. \r\n\r\nDefinitely not a Shake and Vape.","steep_days":"14","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T17:34:23.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"1055","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Almond","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Bavarian Cream","vendor":"FW","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Biscuit","vendor":"INW","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Custard Pi 3.14","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1500},{"name":"French Vanilla","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Graham Cracker Clear","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Sweetener","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Vanilla Custard","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":2500}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"66163","name":"Coopy"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
