During summer vacations growing up we would go to  visit my grandparents in NC , we would go and pick  peaches   for our   SWEEEET fruit tea.  This is my take on that tea\r\n**FLV Black tea** - is my  current favorite black tea , it is solid and not overpowering with  a light drying effect that you get from tea.   It is less earthy and dark then FA and has a  slight floral note that works really well in a sweet  fruit mix  tea. \r\n**FA white peach/CAP juicy peach** - my perfect peach mix  of a ripe sweet  peach - with some juiciness in it.\r\n**FA Blood orange**  -   This combo adds some acidity and brightness to mix along with some sweetness.  red orange is a slightly deeper orange note that works well with the  peach and tea as  opposed to a a more orange juice flavor that works  better in cocktails.  \r\n**flv milk and honey** adds a base dark sweetness to this almost like a darker honey  and helps to add some body to this mix  and softens some of the tannin aspect of the tea\r\n**ADD TO YOUR TASTE** sorbet - add a slight cooling with citrus and mint which is noted at the end  of the vape.   sweetner to taste - I like my tea to be  SWEEET!     best vaped at a slighter higher wattage   ( 50 watts or so)  to gain some of the darker notes from the black tea \r\n\r\n**Looking to learn  more about how to make your own mixes - Check out what DIY Downunder has to offer:**\r\nhttps://www.facebook.com/groups/diydownunder/\r\nhttps://discord.gg/kH4Fqbc\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCTCwb7ULyfJALQlehomZZQA\r\nhttps://www.diydownunder.com/","steep_days":"3 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-06T12:55:38.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"1307","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Black tea","flavor_id":"9377","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1200},{"name":"Blood Orange","flavor_id":"7698","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Juicy Peach","flavor_id":"81","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":3500},{"name":"Milk & Honey","flavor_id":"609","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Sorbet Base","flavor_id":"8970","vendor":"VT","millipercent":500},{"name":"Peach White","flavor_id":"543","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1500}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"112371","name":"Rocking Chair Iced Tea "}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
