No strawberries? No worries, we'll get your cornflakes fixed up. Let's load this bowl... With sliced bananas.\r\n\r\nToasted Redux #2. Pulled the cinnamon and I pushed Cereal 27 from 3% to 5% to stand up to the banana. I dialed back Meringue from 2% to 1.5% and Cream Fresh from 1.5% to 1%. The banana flavoring I used is already quite creamy, so I didn't need as much \"milk.\" If you're interested in the cereal/milk notes, check out Toasted.\r\n\r\nFlavor Notes:\r\n\r\nTPA Banana Cream is the one, simple, easy, malleable, reliable, tasty addition to the recipe. It's a sweet banana flavor that can pass as authentic enough in the right situations. One of those situations is a bowl of sugary cereal and sweet milk. It's a very easy flavor to work with. It tends to do it's own thing with everything but creams. In this recipe it melts into the cream, while the inherently starchy flavor of banana plays well with the flaky cereal. 2% is all we need. Don't want it to take over. We aren't eating a banana covered in cornflakes, even though I want to now.\r\n\r\nThis is pretty much ready to rock from the get go. Give it a few days to a week for the creams to figure themselves out and it gets even better.\r\n\r\nHappy mixing. ðŸ‘½","steep_days":"3","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"updated_at":"2020-12-12T14:05:21.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"5232","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Cereal 27","flavor_id":"4163","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":5000},{"name":"Graham Cracker Clear","flavor_id":"325","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Meringue","flavor_id":"176","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Cream Fresh","flavor_id":"540","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Toasted Marshmallow","flavor_id":"340","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Super Sweet","flavor_id":"2384","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":250},{"name":"Banana Cream","flavor_id":"210","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2000}],"reviews":[{"user":"cdaniell30","text":"I've avoided mixing any of these cereals for the abstract reasoning that since there's so many of them, they can't be that great.
