Sour Apple (Flavorah) adds some tartness and a great smooth sweetness. These two make the main profile.\r\nTwo Apples (Inawera) and a touch of powerful Fuji Apple (FA) help fill in the middle.\r\nCoolada (Inawera) is like WS-23, helps chill, use to taste.","steep_days":"1 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"total_reviews":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T10:44:43.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"1073","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Anton Apple (yc)","vendor":"INW","millipercent":2250},{"name":"Apple Fuji","vendor":"FA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Two Apples","vendor":"INW","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Coolada","vendor":"INW","millipercent":500},{"name":"Sour Apple","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1500}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"176228","name":"Greener Apples"}}}
