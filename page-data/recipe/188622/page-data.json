This is a nice a sweet banana custard with a hint of bake strawberries.  I just wanted to use some newer 2019 flavors here and see what I could come up with in a 1-2-3 format.  \r\n\r\nThe TFA VC II is an amazing vanilla custard.  Its rich, a bit sweet with some nice vanilla notes to it.  The banana custard at 2% isn't really a custard, but more just a nice fresh banana.  This gives you a very interesting baked strawberry with ripe banana's mixed with a vanilla custard.","steep_days":"14","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"total_reviews":1,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:51:27.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"984","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Strawberry (Baked)","vendor":"WF","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Banana Custard","vendor":"VT","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Vanilla Custard 2","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":3000}],"reviews":[{"user":"Vishousvapez","score":"5","text":"I know its tempting before the full 8 day steep but trust me your patience will be rewarded this is a simply delish recipe everything is perfectly balanced "}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"188622","name":"1 2 3 Strawnana Custard"}}}
