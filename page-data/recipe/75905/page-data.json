Warning this recipe is addicting lol. Just a delicious moist pecan sugar cookie!!! This recipe is good after a short two day steep but it keeps getting better and better every day after but by day 5 it is pretty much blended it may get better with age but its definetly ready at 5 days. I am vaping  a bottle from three weeks ago and its really good in my opinion of coarse. Another reason for this recipe is there aren't any recipes using real flavors super concentrate sugar cookie. When I absolutely love it. Rf sc sugar cookie is a secret weapon  it adds fluffiness to anything. If you add 2% of rf sc sugar cookie to even the densest of cakes it will make them fluffy. With that being said that is not why I used it in this recipe and I kind of combatted that fluffy trate in this recipe but I figured I couldn't be one of the first to use it on atf and not talk about using it to add fluffiness.  Give it a try and let me know what you think and that goes for my recipe and adding rf sc sugar cookie to add fluffiness it works try it!!","steep_days":"5","temperature":"420","recipe_score":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-10T16:00:23.000-05:00","best_vg":"75%","views":"2079","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Sugar Cookie â€“ Super Concentrate","flavor_id":"7999","vendor":"RF","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Sugar Cookie","flavor_id":"115","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Cookie Dough","flavor_id":"4373","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1250},{"name":"Madagascar (Vanilla Classic)","flavor_id":"526","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Sweet Dough","flavor_id":"4406","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":350},{"name":"Whipped Marshmallow","flavor_id":"8744","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1250},{"name":"Hazelnuts & Cream","flavor_id":"6056","vendor":"WF","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Butter Pecan","flavor_id":"1212","vendor":"FW","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Brown Sugar","flavor_id":"313","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":750},{"name":"Sweetness","flavor_id":"4413","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":500}],"reviews":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"75905","name":"Sugar Nut Cookie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
