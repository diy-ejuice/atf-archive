Raspberry, strawberry, grape, peach, and watermelon combine to make one of my personal favorites. This started as a reimagining of one of my favorite store bought Eliquid's which is a grape peach hard candy (from Stache Vape) that I have been vaping for years and it morphed into skull candy. I actually like this more, I can vape it all day without loosing flavor and it's great on coils. I hope you enjoy it and leave feedback if you are so inclined. It's great as a SnV but 4-5 days and it really pops.","steep_days":"4 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:51:22.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"1022","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Grape","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Grape Juice","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":3500},{"name":"Peach (juicy)","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2250},{"name":"Raspberry (sweet)","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Razzleberry","vendor":"FW","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Sour Ball Candy SC","vendor":"WF","millipercent":1250},{"name":"Strawberry Taffy","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Sweetness","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":350},{"name":"Watermelon","vendor":"LA","millipercent":1400}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"183645","name":"Skull Candy"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
