What do you know it vapes good too. I think  this tastes just like I imagined the ones from the commercial to  taste. I do suggest a minimum  of a 7 day steep  due to the super concentrates  being made with alcohol. I feel it needs time for the alcohol  to evaporate off. But after the steep this tastes  great. Enjoy!!!!","steep_days":"7","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-06T07:14:53.000-05:00","best_vg":"75%","views":"2117","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Cinnamon Crunch","flavor_id":"611","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Pancakes â€“ SC","flavor_id":"7526","vendor":"RF","millipercent":3500},{"name":"Cinnamon Danish Swirl","flavor_id":"35","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Cream Cheese Icing","flavor_id":"2380","vendor":"LA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Toasted Marshmallow","flavor_id":"340","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1500}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"36627","name":"Stuffed Cinnamon Roll French Toast"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
