We'll pretend it's topped with some 24k gold flake just to really sell the theme.\r\n\r\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/bvpjzm/mixer_showdown_4_newbie_booster/\r\n\r\nCome join us on Discord! https://discord.gg/ufVTyAQ","steep_days":"0 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":4,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:51:00.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"2655","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Yes, We Cheesecake","flavor_id":"9272","vendor":"INW","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Vanilla Custard","flavor_id":"131","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Meringue","flavor_id":"530","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Milk & Honey","flavor_id":"609","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":400},{"name":"Cactus","flavor_id":"647","vendor":"INW","millipercent":750},{"name":"Strawberry (ripe)","flavor_id":"271","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Strawberry Sweet","flavor_id":"4745","vendor":"JF","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Fuji","flavor_id":"506","vendor":"FA","millipercent":500}],"reviews":[{"user":"BigRed","text":"it’s good but i wish the flavor was pushed a little more . maybe it just needs a steep but i’ll see"},{"user":"ID10-T","text":"Addictively delicious. It tastes like nothing I’ve ever tasted before, which makes it hard to describe. The cactus is identifiable, but mutated into something more like a prickly pear and less like a cactus paddle.It’s not soapy or floral or aloe-y or anything like that, it’s just fruity and natural yet unnatural at the same time, like something grown on another planet. It tastes like the green-yellow-red color of a mango if that color were a flavor, with some gently citrusy notes and a wet fruity bubblegum syrup body. All of that is situated, somehow, in a creamy silky custard, which, even without sweetener, has a sweet, sugary finish, like the alien making this custard did not skimp on the sugar or maybe forgot to brûlée a snozzberry crème brûlée.
