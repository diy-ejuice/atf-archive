Most P&C recipes out there I've tried are either cream forward, lacking in flavour, or harsh when the peach is pushed too high, that's not the case here. Don't let the percentages fool you this recipe is full of flavour. Given the use of vienna cream, this mix really needs to steep for about 10 days to let everything settle in and reach it's full potential.\r\n\r\n\r\n1:2 FA White Peach and CAP Yellow Peach is a great peach combo with a full bodied flavour that really hits the spot.\r\n1:1 FA Vienna Cream and Marshmallow is a light cream base that helps lift up the peach and give it more body.\r\n\r\n\r\nTested at 70/30 on a single fused clapton 3x28gN80/38gN80 - 6 wrap - 0.35ohms - 45W","steep_days":"10","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:51:04.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"1317","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Yellow Peach","flavor_id":"135","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1400},{"name":"Peach White","flavor_id":"543","vendor":"FA","millipercent":700},{"name":"Vienna Cream","flavor_id":"516","vendor":"FA","millipercent":800},{"name":"Marshmallow","flavor_id":"473","vendor":"FA","millipercent":800}],"reviews":[{"user":"Skywxp3d","text":"First peaches and cream recipe that I would make again, usually not a fan but this is off putting at all, in fact itâ€™s delicious ðŸ˜‹ "}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"160459","name":"Yet Another Peaches and Cream"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
