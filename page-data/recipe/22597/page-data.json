Rather than being than pushed out by the creams and fading away after a week, it only becomes stronger and more refined.\r\n\r\nThe TFA VBIC and HS Ice Cream form a splendid homespun ice cream texture that is extremely creamy and flavorful. Exceptionally rich and decadent without going overboard.\r\n\r\nKeeping the FA Pear at 0.5% does an amazing job at adding a little bit of extra tang to the strawberry profile. Not only that, it also gives the overall recipe a nice wet mouth feel. After 3-4 days, the pear flavor is no longer detectable at all, but leaves behind all the other great qualities.\r\n\r\nFor a little bit of extra zing and freshness, we add the FA Lemon Sicily to really bring the strawberry to life.\r\n\r\nLastly, we add a little bit of FA Meringue to sweeten up the ice cream profile.\r\n\r\nThis is best after 4-5 days once the pear and lemon have dissipated, but still makes an incredible and interesting shake and vape.","steep_days":"5","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:48:56.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"9302","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Vanilla Bean Ice Cream","flavor_id":"186","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":3500},{"name":"Shisha Strawberry","flavor_id":"1711","vendor":"INW","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Ice Cream","flavor_id":"4449","vendor":"HS","millipercent":750},{"name":"Pear","flavor_id":"411","vendor":"FA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Lemon Sicily","flavor_id":"524","vendor":"FA","millipercent":250},{"name":"Meringue","flavor_id":"530","vendor":"FA","millipercent":750}],"reviews":[{"user":"Ebc88","text":"Solid recipe. The pear and lemon work you described to bring some freshness to the strawberry. The hs ice cream mixed with the tpa vbic make a really nice cream. And the meringue makes it just sweet enough without being overly sweet. "},{"user":"MrBurgundy","text":"Sweet, buttery strawberry ice cream. I was worried about Shisha Strawberry; that flavor and I tend to disagree. Somehow the HS Ice Cream bullies it down from its syrupy high horse into an authentic ice cream sort of strawberry. The Pear and Lemon Sicily work together to lift the right parts of the strawberry without letting that jammy quality emerge. Obviously HS IC and TPA VBIC are a fantastic combo. They're so thick and buttery and rich.. I felt like they were fighting with the strawberry as a shake and vape, but after a 2 week steep everything has melded together into a cohesive and fully satisfying ice cream. Highly recommended."},{"user":"Kriswk","text":"How the hell has no one reviewed this? My god, you people are all crazy and missing out on something fuckin amazing. I've made this 3 times already, I can't get enough of it. The first time, I didn't have FA Pear, so I chose to use FA Fuji instead just to see how it would be. Mostly I just wanted to taste the creams because I love that combo. Wow...Shisha Strawberry is really the only strawberry you need. Its the perfect candied strawberry without being too bright. Its not very syrupy, its just...idk, red is the best way to describe it. But in this particular recipe, the FA Lemon Sicily accents and brightens the red into a nice sexy shade of pink. The Pear just completes that by knocking out any sort of over-tartness that may happen from the lemon and the strawberry together. Its true that after a good week the Pear fades and leaves behind its own creamy properties. But its a different cream from that of the ice creams. Its more of a creamy air(?) that sits alongside one *super* buttery, rich, delicious ice cream combination. HS Ice Cream is just amazing with TFA VBIC. There's nothing better than those two together. Of course there's a small lack of sweetness but the Meringue brings that along while also filling in the spaces of the Pear and the creams combined almost like it creates a bridge that makes the Pear's properties that much more noticable. Ugh, man..Its just so effing tasty, I dream about this shit. As I said before, I used FA Fuji the first time. The difference between the real mix and the Fuji mix was a crazy tartness. Instead of the Pear holding that back a little, it like opens the tartness door. Its obviously without that airy creaminess from the Pear but still very enjoyable. If you feel like a tart strawberry cream, try some FA Fuji instead. IMO 1 and a half to 2 weeks steeping is perfect for this but that's just me.  &#xD;\n For being a mix with only 7.25% total flavor, this mix is PACKED with flavor. But then again I feel that's a signature Vurve move.   &#xD;\nQuite the banger..go mix it right now!"}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"22597","name":"Anubis' Nectar"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
