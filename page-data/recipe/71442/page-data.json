I wanted to put a recipe out to remind us that you don't need to get super complex and intricate to create a bangin' flavor, especially when it comes to a simple profile like strawberries and cream.\r\nFA Strawberry: I've been using this much more frequently trying to get  away from the good old TFA Strawberry (or strawberry ripe) and CAP Sweet Strawberry combo lately. While that is delicious I find FA's Strawberry to have more notes and nuances than those fairly linear flavors, and this keeps me interested in the flavor longer. It's just a bright and fulfilling strawberry.\r\nCAP Sweet Strawberry: Although linear, like I mentioned above, I love this  flavor. It isn't super complex but it is a sweet, simple, delicious strawberry. Adding this to the FA Strawberry really makes it go from a complex berry flavor to something that is immediately recognizable as strawberry. This flavor really works as a \"glue\" here if you will, making the end product a very delicious and cohesive flavor.\r\nFA Vienna Cream: This adds that wonderful \"pudding\" note that really sweetens up the Bavarian Cream and helps distract from how dry that flavor is.\r\nTFA Bavarian Cream: Bavarian Cream is probably my favorite cream. It's delicious and nutty, but kind of dry and bitter. It's great but it definitely needs some help if you want it to shine.\r\nFA Butterscotch: When it comes to flavor profiles that have been done and done again, you need something to make your recipe stand out from the crowd. I think it's best to find one ingredient that you wouldn't think of being a staple in that profile, but one that sounds delicious as an additive to the profile you're after rather than trying to over complicate things and stick in 3-4+ flavors on top of your profile. FA Butterscotch really works here as that key element that makes people want to keep hitting this juice, it adds butter, and a darker sweetness that balances out all of the  brightness in the fruit and Vienna Cream. If you don't have FA's, FW Butterscotch Ripple, FA Caramel, and TFA Brown Sugar could all work here.\r\nAnd of course, Sweeten to taste if you like. I like to be able to feel that wet stickiness from the sucralose but I don't like adding so much that it throws off the balance of fruit to butterscotch here. I usually use 0.25% PUR Super Sweet. I use Purilum simply because it is about half the price of Capella, and I usually order from Nicotine River anyways.","steep_days":"5 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"total_reviews":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T02:15:44.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"5402","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Red Touch (strawberry)","vendor":"FA","millipercent":2250},{"name":"Sweet Strawberry","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":3500},{"name":"Vienna Cream","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Bavarian Cream","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2250},{"name":"Butterscotch","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1250}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"71442","name":"Simplicity (A Strawberry Cream vape)"}}}
