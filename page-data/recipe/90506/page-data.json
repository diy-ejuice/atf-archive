I guess I have really been on a custard kick lately, with Mighty Beard being my last recipe release, but I think you all will really enjoy this one!\r\n\r\nFruity Fruit McFruitFace: I actually did try other fruits with this, but I knew they were all fruits that everybody used already and a lot of people have parfait recipes out there. So I figured I wanted to try something a little more original, which is how I arrived at Boysenberry. FLV Boysenberry at 1% is a more tart boysenberry and when combined with PUR Boysenberry preserves, helps create a sweet and jammy boysenberry with just a little bit of tartness.\r\n\r\nDem Creams: CAP Vanilla Custard V1 really helps with a nice dense creaminess that we are going for in a Custard parfait. When paired with FLV Cream, it helps smooth out the eggy notes a little bit and helps support Cap Custard V1 as well. \r\n\r\nDem Grains: I had been trying to figure out a recipe for FLV Granola since u/ConcreteRiver put a review up for it about 6 months ago, and it really works great here. By itself it is a bit dry and bitter, but it has a great granola flavor. Combined with a little bit of TPA Cheesecake Graham Crust it helps create a sweeter granola flavor. This is also why CAP VC v1 is so high, FLV Granola really fights against other creams. I realize that 0.66% is a weird % to use, but at 0.5% you can't taste it at all and at 0.75% it overwhelms the rest of the recipe. It's simply perfect where it's at. \r\n\r\nThe Holiest of Holys: Holy Vanilla is really just a great addition. It helps sweeten up FLV Granola and helps support the creams as well. \r\n\r\nThe best part about this recipe? You can easily sub the boysenberries for a lot of other fruits. I would probably avoid strong citrus flavors, but things like strawberry, blueberry, cranberry, and maybe even apple cinnamon would make great replacements. \r\n\r\nAnyway I hope you enjoy this! I look forward to your reviews and constructive criticisms.","steep_days":"14","temperature":"0","recipe_score":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-12T02:45:06.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"1373","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Granola","flavor_id":"8555","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":660},{"name":"Cream","flavor_id":"604","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Vanilla Custard","flavor_id":"131","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":5500},{"name":"Holy Vanilla","flavor_id":"2385","vendor":"DFS","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Cheesecake (graham Crust)","flavor_id":"152","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Boysenberry","flavor_id":"614","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Boysenberry Preserves","flavor_id":"7741","vendor":"PUR","millipercent":2500}],"reviews":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"90506","name":"Pardon my Fait"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
