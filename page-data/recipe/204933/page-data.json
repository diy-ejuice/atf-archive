I decided to use 2 of the lesser used Strawberry concentrates from my inventory, for 2 reasons... to see what I could do with them,and to...use them! Kiwi(Double) was an easy choice because it's the only one I have! I made 3 testers for him to try, with this version receiving the go ahead. The Alpine Strawberry and Dragonfruit gave the two, otherwise uncommon, SB pairings just what they needed to complete this task. I worked my way up with the Kiwi,having started at 1%. Add a little polish with the CAP SS, and done! If your a Kiwi fan I'd appreciate some feedback on this one. Thanks!
