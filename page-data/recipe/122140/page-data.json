A nice watermelon bubble gum. This recipe is great for a beginner diy mixer transitioning from a commercial juice to diy mixing. It gives that commercial feel and appeal  but with a little more depth. I have also left this some what of a open canvas for beginners and experienced mixers to play around with. Great as is or get creative and throw some other Flavorah fruits at it to complement the melons like pear, strawberry ect.... have fun with it and enjoy.
