Custards and bakeries are just too heavy in hot weather and much more suited to autumn and winter . I wanted to mix something simple avoiding most of the usual standard fruits . I decided on grapefruit as it's something i haven't used very much previously . I chose VT Grapefruit as it is quite authentic tasting and also pairs well with other citrus flavours and combined this with Inawera Grapefruit to add more tartness and body . FA Mandarin is a real favourite of mine . It adds some sweet , zesty notes and i think it works well alongside the grapefruit . I added FLV Guanabana to give a tropical backnote without overpowering the grapefruit and mandarin . I've used a small amount of sweetener and ws-23 but this is optional depending on personal taste , can be higher or lower if you prefer .\r\nAlthough this is can be a shake and vape i think it is much better after a 24 - 48 hour steep.\r\n\r\n","steep_days":"2","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"total_reviews":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T09:46:01.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"432","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Grapefruit","vendor":"INW","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Grapefruit","vendor":"VT","millipercent":3500},{"name":"Guanabana","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1300},{"name":"Tanger (mandarin)","vendor":"FA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Sorbet Base","vendor":"VT","millipercent":1600},{"name":"Super Sweet","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":300},{"name":"WS-23","vendor":"OTHR","millipercent":300}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"203178","name":"Grapefruit Sorbet #Developedsummer"}}}
