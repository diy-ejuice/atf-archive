Here, Exotic Roots is up front and personal with its ginger and spice notes (if you have had the pleasure of meeting it, you know what I mean). INW Black Currant plays with Exotic Roots to tame it a bit and lend some creaminess that sinks the whole thing into the sweet base (Guanabana). INW Rhubarb takes up the very rear in this recipe to provide a fresh taste to the finish. A little spicy, a bit sweet, a tad earthy, and wholly satisfying, it takes just 3 days steep to fully appreciate the mouthfeel on this random beauty.","steep_days":"3","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-06T22:01:40.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"1806","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Exotic Roots","flavor_id":"655","vendor":"INW","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Rhubarb (yc)","flavor_id":"711","vendor":"INW","millipercent":500},{"name":"Blackcurrant","flavor_id":"645","vendor":"INW","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Guanabana","flavor_id":"4427","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":3000}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"25700","name":"Major Errors"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
