I have been wanting spring to start here in NYC so while dealing with the snow outside, I was dreaming of sipping something like this on a hammock somewhere sunny and warm. \r\n&nbsp;\r\n**Hibiscus (CAP) 3% / Black Tea (FLV) 1.5%:**\r\nThe tea is a lighter element to this mix. I like the Black Tea flavor tho its really close to a sweetened tea. I wanted to help back it up and make it blend better with some of the citrus elements found in Hibiscus.\r\n&nbsp;\r\n**Pink Guava (FLV) 1% / Pineapple (INW) 2% / Lychee (FE) 0.75%:**\r\nThe Pink Guava is definitely the more dominate note. One of the things it boost this recipe to make it feel more like a tea is upping the astringent element drinking tea provides. Black Tea already does that some. I have been wanting to find a good recipe to use this Lychee flavor in for a while. Its an excellent lychee flavor. Its pretty strong even in lower % so be careful. Since this was a bit sweeter than I wanted, I then used Pineapple to add a nice tropical citrus. Came out delicious. The flavor will stick to your coils for a little bit.\r\n\r\nI tried this right after mixing it and was pleasantly surprised how close it felt to drinking a tropical fruity tea. After a few days, it really blends together well and mellows out enough that it isnt as much of a guava punch to the tastebuds.","steep_days":"3 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"total_reviews":1,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:50:03.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"2125","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Pink Guava","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Lychee","vendor":"FE","millipercent":750},{"name":"Pineapple","vendor":"INW","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Black tea","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Hibiscus","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":3000}],"reviews":[{"user":"cmyjones","score":"5","text":"this is amazing. thanks. &#xD;\ni didn't have INW pineapple, but i switched it with VT Pineapple Sugarloaf and it's real nice"}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"93605","name":"ExclusiveGirl's Little Bit of Paradise Tea #MixinVixens"}}}
