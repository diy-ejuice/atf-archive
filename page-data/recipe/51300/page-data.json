That all would change later in life when my mother graduated, but that wasn't until I was about 14. Up until that point, there was weekly trips to the fire station for that good government cheese and peanut butter. Most of the times my milk came in a box so seeing my dad putting water in my cereal was normal. However, when we did have real milk breakfast was a little different...It wasn't rice crispys, but actual rice. \r\nYou fill your bowl up with cooked rice, add a few scoops of sugar to it and then cover the top with cinnamon, now top it off with some actual milk! As odd as this sounds, it was so good. Good enough that I still eat it to this day every once in a while.","steep_days":"4","temperature":"450","recipe_score":5,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:49:23.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"2995","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Bavarian Cream","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Coco' (coconut)","vendor":"FA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Cream","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":500},{"name":"Meringue","vendor":"FA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Sweet Rice","vendor":"FE","millipercent":5000},{"name":"Rich Cinnamon","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":100},{"name":"Super Sweet","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":250},{"name":"Vanilla Swirl","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1500}],"reviews":[{"user":"DixxleRoo","text":"I love this recipe- it’s creamy, the touch of cinnamon is lovely and it’s really customisable. You could try adding fruit like a cooked apple, nuts- pistachio etc. Although it’s absolutley delicious as it is. Plus it uses one of my favourite flavours-sweet rice. Something I heard from NordicFlavours was to use VT rice base in conjunction with FE sweet rice to help stop it fading after a week or so. I’ve been making this with 4% sweet rice and 1% rice base and it’s just a nice and fades less. Thought I’d pass the tip on as I’ve found it really helpful.

Thank you for this recipe! It is very good and addictive! (next batch I'll skip the super sweet, it's not necessary I think).
