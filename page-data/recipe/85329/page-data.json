Not that original as it's been done time and time again and will probably done a few thousand times more... But I think it's gonna be worth your effort to mix this up üòä\r\n\r\nThe name comes from using 3 stones(bases) in combination with each other so I have to give credit to Wayne Walker (Enyawreklaw) for my ideas in developing this recipe.\r\n\r\nStarting from the ground up...\r\n1) Graham Cracker Crust (FA Cookie/TPA Graham Cracker Clear/FW Graham Cracker/TPA Acetyl Pyrazine) Wayne's Graham Cracker that he just talked about in the S'mores video. This combo will give you a nice thick crunchy layer of grahammy goodness for our next layer to sit on.\r\n\r\n2) The Cheesecake (CAP NY Cheesecake/CAP Sweet Cream) This combo is Wayne's Cheese Stone that he has talked about time and time again which gives you a nice thick and creamy cheesecake body.\r\n\r\n3) Strawberry Topping (CAP Sweet Strawberry/FA Strawberry/TPA Strawberry Ripe) This is my lil tweak on Wayne's Strawberry Stone. This will give you a nice sweet almost syrupy strawberry topping. This combo seems to work pretty well for me as I cannot taste strawberry too good.\r\n\r\nLast but not least, CAP Super Sweet. Wayne puts it on everything and so do I...üëä\r\n\r\nThat's it! Feel free to sub your sweetener if choice (or not) if preferred as well as any of your favorite stones, and build yourself a tasty vape! üëçüëç","steep_days":"5","temperature":"0","recipe_score":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-12T03:45:35.000-05:00","best_vg":"60%","views":"1812","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Cookie","flavor_id":"490","vendor":"FA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Graham Cracker Clear","flavor_id":"325","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Graham Cracker","flavor_id":"1297","vendor":"FW","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Acetyl Pyrazine 5%","flavor_id":"1709","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":500},{"name":"New York Cheesecake","flavor_id":"90","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":6000},{"name":"Sweet Cream","flavor_id":"117","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Sweet Strawberry","flavor_id":"121","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Red Touch (strawberry)","flavor_id":"421","vendor":"FA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Strawberry (ripe)","flavor_id":"271","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Super Sweet","flavor_id":"2384","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":500}],"reviews":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"85329","name":"Cornerstone Cheesecake"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
