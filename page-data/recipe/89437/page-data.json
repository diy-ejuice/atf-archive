Throw in some LB Ice Cream + FA Vienna Cream and you’ve got the ice cream portion of the mix.\r\n\r\nI see LB Belgian Waffle get some hate but I myself am I fan. I like it at 3% in this mix. CAP Cereal 27 brings it to life by giving some grit to the waffle cone while INW Biscuit adds a buttery note I enjoy.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nHope you dig this mix as much as I do. If not, that’s cool too. Would love to hear your feedback in the comments.\r\n\r\n    -Modesto Bravo","steep_days":"5","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-05T16:43:24.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"1258","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Belgian Waffle","vendor":"LB","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Biscuit","vendor":"INW","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Butterscotch","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Caramel Candy","vendor":"FW","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Cereal 27","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Sweetener","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Vanilla Ice Cream","vendor":"LB","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Vienna Cream","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1500}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"89437","name":"Den Scoth"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
