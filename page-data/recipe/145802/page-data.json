I tasted honeydew, kiwi, some green mint, and a pound of sweetener. I'm not a huge fan of sweetener, so I left that out, then I went on to build it with some staples. In the end, this ended up tasting way better than the original.\r\n\r\nI picked TFA Honeydew since it seemed to be the most popular Honeydew, and it works very well, here. Wet, sweet, accurate to profile, nothing to complain about. But I felt it needed a bit of tart, so in comes INW Cactus. \r\n\r\nI tested INW Cactus at 0.75% at first, which was really nice at that level, but it worked so well with everything that a little more definitely couldn't hurt. 1% is amazing. Just meshes everything in your face and you can actually start tasting the Cactus apart from everything.\r\n\r\nFW Kiwi is my favorite Kiwi, but if you gravitate more towards FA Kiwi be my guest and try swapping it out and let me know how it goes. At this level, the flavor stays right on par with the Honeydew and they become inseparable.\r\n\r\nCAP Cool Mint fit the original mint flavor in Pachamama accurately for me. This wouldn't've worked as well as with a peppermint or straight menthol. IMO it gives off the sort of mint you'd get from a Creme de Menthe chocolate. It's quite potent, so just a few drops suffice. Anything more and it begins to dominate the profile.","steep_days":"2 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:50:50.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"1956","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Cactus","flavor_id":"647","vendor":"INW","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Cool Mint","flavor_id":"40","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":100},{"name":"Honeydew","flavor_id":"238","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Kiwi","flavor_id":"1330","vendor":"FW","millipercent":2500}],"reviews":[{"user":"Whooptidooh","text":"Very nice as a shake and vape :)"}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"145802","name":"Desert Dew"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
