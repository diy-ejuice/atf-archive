My take on a watermelon bubble gum with some support from other melons. \r\n\r\n**FLV Bubble Gum** - FLV nailed this profile. A very good base to add your favorite fruits to. No chalkiness like I get from TFA and not as harsh as FW. \r\n\r\n**FLV Watermelon** - This is a good candy watermelon. Although, you can taste a little bit of the white part (rind) which I wasn't expecting from a candied flavor. It lends a hand at making the recipe a bit more juicy too.\r\n\r\n**FLV Wild Melon** - This is a great mix of melons. Watermelon and honeydew being the main fruits that I detect. It leans more towards the fresh fruit category, imo. If someone asked \"what's the best melon flavor?\" this would be the one I recommend. Very bright and refreshing.\r\n\r\n**FLV Cantaloupe** -  This is used not only to add more melon, but lend a hand in making the overall mix more juicy and almost creamy. It has a thickness that gives this recipe a good mouthfeel. And makes the whole experience seem more authentic.\r\n\r\n**FLV Sweetness** - As always, sweeteners are optional. I usually would only use this at 1 drop per 10ml. But, this is a candy and 2 drops worked out nicely. It does a good job providing you with the sweet while, at the same time, not gunking up your coils. Feel free to sub for your sweetener of your choice (I'd say 1 drop per 10ml of CAP SS would work well).\r\n\r\nThis is very much a shake and vape recipe but will benefit from an overnight steep. Best after 3 days.  Don't forget to leave a comment and/or review.

FLV Wild Melon and FLV Bubblegum is a perfect combination. Sweet, creamy and bursting with Bubblelishiousâ„¢ goodness. Thanks jbird!"},{"user":"ID10-T","text":"This is phenomenally tasty. I wouldn't call it especially authentic to anything, since I've never had a melon gum that also contained that classic pink bubblegum flavor, but hardly matters because that mixed melon/bubblegum flavor is just so great together on top. Watermelon and bubblegum forward with just the bit of honeydew and cantaloupe behind it. It tastes like an excellent harnessing of the base from FLV Cantaloupe where it does that thing where it's almost creamy but in an entirely non-dairy way.  "},{"user":"shyndo","text":"Fantastic recipe! Wild melon and Flv bubblegum is a dream pairing and something I've been using together myself recently! Flv cantaloupe really fills out the recipe perfectly with these 2 top heavy concentrates. Great balance and also something special if you add a little ws-23"},{"user":"TheDrStore","text":"You are one of the most underated mixers out there.
