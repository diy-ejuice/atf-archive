Very nice vape... Tasted Watermelon right off the bat, followed by something a little \"green\" and sour which I felt may have been Apple or possibly Kiwi, then a subtle smooth vanilla creaminess, and just a hint of something else hidden in there adding a little berry color to the mix. \r\n\r\nThis is my inspired first attempt at what I tasted that day. It is by no means a clone recipe (maybe vanilla whipped cream instead of vanilla swirl), but it's close on the flavor profile, very smooth, and passes the test of \"Is it a good vape?\" with flying colors (I think). 30 days and 240ml gone, the guys at work are asking for more... Hope you enjoy!","steep_days":"3 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T14:12:15.000-05:00","best_vg":"80%","views":"2520","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Apple Fuji","vendor":"FA","millipercent":750},{"name":"Kiwi (double)","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Strawberry (ripe)","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Shisha Strawberry","vendor":"INW","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Vanilla Swirl","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Watermelon","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1500}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"38567","name":"GAMMA"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
