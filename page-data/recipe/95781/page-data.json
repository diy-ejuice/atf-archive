This is really good and ADV for me. The use of catalan cream and hangsen Italian cream will bring more unique flavor profile without overwhelming sweetness or vanilla notes - if you are looking for a sweeter more american cannoli then you can use Vienna cream, a dash of a vanilla ice cream and cheese cake of you choice for the filing\r\n\r\naustralian chocolate - smooth, somewhat sweet, dark chocolate. used low up to 1% - if you go higher it does not bring you more flavor but more a chalk mouth feel - this is more of a accent chocolate to me in a recipie and does that well here ( VT dark choclate could also be used ) \r\n\r\nBurlone (Joker) FA Pazzo - is a spot on cannoli shell with a dash of cinnamon and powered sugar - you get that fried dough crispiness for sure ( very much like Zeppola) . I can see this being used in many many combinations of cream, chocolates, and fruit . I can see this working well with a brandy cream filling or a vanilla burbon RY4 cream filling \r\n\r\nitalian cream/ Catalan cream / lemon sicily - these are used for the filling - catalan cream is a niche type cream to me it is weak on the cream texture and body but has some flavor profiles that are needed in this mix - most notably the citrus, vanilla and cinnamon . The cheese cake and the Italian cream work to create that thick type of ricotta cream filling. NY cheese cake needs a little more of that \"cheese\" note and Italian cream does that - it a thick tangy cream that really bring that unique note almost like a mascapone cheese - it has a low ceiling to to me and needs to be under 1%\r\n\r\nThe torrone is used for mild powdery sugary almond and citrus back note - used low to support the exhale \r\n\r\nMade for Mixin in the kitchen episode \"leave the gun take the cannoli\"  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Es07SSpD-Ow   ","steep_days":"10","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-10T17:57:26.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"1775","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Australian Chocolate","flavor_id":"2657","vendor":"HS","millipercent":500},{"name":"Pazzo Burlone (Joker)","flavor_id":"9911","vendor":"FA","millipercent":5000},{"name":"Catalan Cream","flavor_id":"483","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Italian Cream","flavor_id":"2132","vendor":"HS","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Lemon Sicily","flavor_id":"524","vendor":"FA","millipercent":500},{"name":"New York Cheesecake","flavor_id":"90","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Sweetness","flavor_id":"4413","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":300},{"name":"Torrone","flavor_id":"550","vendor":"FA","millipercent":300}],"reviews":[{"user":"Mr-G","text":"u","score":0}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"95781","name":"MBs OG Jerzzey Italian Cannoli "}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
