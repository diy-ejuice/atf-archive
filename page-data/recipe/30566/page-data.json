Arby's Jamocha Shake. Why? Because I wanted something different. I wanted something I myself would really enjoy. And if I go to Arby's, I always get Jamocha. It is light and cool and sweet, and it almost never fails to make me wish I had gotten a bigger size. Now to Create an accurate shake, you need the right base. I could go with one of probably 6 or 7 choices for the creamy milky base. But with the need for a quick steep and not a lot of room in the recipe for helpers, Capella's Sweet Cream was the clear winner. I went a little higher with the percentage so that it would be present right away. But even though it is a slightly heavier cream, I did want to bring in a component that would fill it out. That is where Flavor West's Creamy Hazelnut comes in. At slightly higher percentages, the hazelnut really comes through, and I did not want to do that. Kept at this low percentage, it actually accomplishes two purposes. It acts as a milk, to fill out the sweet cream, but then the slightly nutty undertones create a bridge for the next flavor to come in...The Coffee. Flavour Art's Up is perfect for this shake, because it is a coffee that is already sweetened, and has this element to it that is just slightly creamy. Not obviously so, but just sweet and creamy enough for it to be a perfect match for this recipe. Because you can't have mocha without chocolate, that is where Flavor Apprentice's double chocolate clear comes in. It blends with the other components and offers that element necessary to accomplish what I was going for. Once we had the flavor married together and happy, there was that singular last thing I needed. Cold. For my one allowable enhancer, I chose Flavor Apprentice's Koolada 10% PG. At just under 1%, it gives you the chill in your mouth and throat to let you know you have a milkshake, without an overwhelming blast of freeze that causes an ice cream headache. Again, I kept all the percentages pretty low, because if you have ever had a Jamocha shake yourself, you know it is a very lightly flavored milkshake, and for accuracy's sake, I needed to remain true to the real thing. While a shake and vape, this recipe benefits greatly from an overnight steep.
