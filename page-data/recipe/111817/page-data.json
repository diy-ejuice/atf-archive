Still, It's a lazy ass mix that simply tastes good.\r\n\r\nI went with the plainest tobaccos I could find. Sweet dessert baccos with fairly simple profiles and medium to light body on top of a malty hazelnut butterscotch pudding base.\r\n\r\n\r\nShout out to one of my favorite bands that I was blasting the entire time I was thinking this mix up. If you like groovy, doomy and fuzzy metal, check out Windhand! The sheer heaviness and droning fuzz of their music helped inspire me to create a thick and malty recipe to chain vape while listening to their stuff. The title of this mix is taken from one of their recently released songs.","steep_days":"7","temperature":"0","recipe_score":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-12T05:50:04.000-05:00","best_vg":"65%","views":"1491","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Vanilla Pudding","flavor_id":"4433","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Sweet Tobacco","flavor_id":"7789","vendor":"PUR","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Deluxe Tobacco","flavor_id":"2026","vendor":"HS","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Tobacco Absolute Garuda","flavor_id":"2717","vendor":"INW","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Butterscotch Ripple","flavor_id":"1217","vendor":"FW","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Hazelnut","flavor_id":"1312","vendor":"FW","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Oak Milk","flavor_id":"1668","vendor":"FE","millipercent":1000},{"name":"French Vanilla Creme","flavor_id":"168","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1000}],"reviews":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"111817","name":"Old Evil (1-2-1-2 Tobacco Puddin')"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
