It may not be name brand but it is very close. Great refreshing pop.

It dew taste like Mountain Dew. It’s sweet and wet and chilled and if you squint with your tasters real hard, you can almost get some fizz out of it. I had some concerns about harshness based on some of the ingredients here but the way they’re used here keeps that from being an issue for me. Sodas can be difficult, in my experience. I can imagine a lot of work went into this recipe and it feels like it paid off. I dew wonder whether a better dew could possibly be created using LB Dew Mountain instead of TFA Citrus Punch as the heart of it and fixing the shortcomings with that flavor with some of the same or similar flavors as what’s been used here. But that’s just an idea, I haven’t tasted a perfected Mountain Dew vape made that way yet. I’ve tasted this, and it tastes like five stars, at least until someone proves they can top it.
