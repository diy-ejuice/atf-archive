The first bottle was gone pretty quick and I let the 2nd steep for 50 days.  Still good but flavor seems to have been quieted. Could be my taste buds have grown used to it.   I still have some left and I have zero self control.  If the 2nd bottle goes just as fast as the first then I'd give it the 5 stars.***UPDATE*** This is one of if not THE BEST custard recipe on this site.  Don't know what I was thinking earlier.  Easy 5 stars","score":5},{"user":"phried","text":"If you love anything custard, you won't go wrong with having a bottle of this on your shelf. I'm having quite a few ideas on how to utilise this as a base for tobaccos and other fruits - it's really good. And if you've been disappointed with other custards as a DIYer, this one won't. Does leave a little gunk - after about going through 50mL of this stuff - but still worth it. Will definitely remix.","score":5},{"user":"FizzChaser","text":"This turned out to be an incredible custard vape! Great job wllmc","score":5},{"user":"SlashaLO","text":"This is a great custard. Smooth, sweet, great custard notes, which a good amount of vanilla and mouthfeel. Fell in love with this custard quickly, and have returned to it several times!","score":5},{"user":"gopher_byrd","text":"GOC is one of my \"On the Road\" juices. I travel a lot for work and this is one of four juices I always take with me. And it's versatile as well. Want a strawberry custard, just add your favorite strawberry.
