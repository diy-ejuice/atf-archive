If you like creamy and fruity vapes, this one is for you. On the inhale you get a slightly sour pear-note which, on the exhale, turns into a creamy smoothie with a sweet green tea and mild coconut undertone. I hope you like it as much as I do. \r\nThis round was again pretty hard for me because I created three very different recipes which came out pretty nice IMO. It was a hard decision and I hope I chose the right one to win the comp ;)   I'm probably going to release at least one of the other two recipes when the contest is over. Good luck to the other three contestants!\r\n\r\nAttention: For the coconut I used Jungle Flavors (JF) Coconut!!! Unfortunatly I couldn't find it in the flavor list, so I used TPA's as a placeholder!!!!!\r\n\r\nFA Pear\r\nI wanted to keep pear as the main profile and FA Pear is a very realistic one IMO. You can probably add a bit TPA Pear to highlight it a bit more, but being limited in the number of flavors to put in I chose not to do so.\r\n\r\nFA Fuji Apple & FA Lemon Sicily\r\nI used Fuji and Lemon Sicily to boost the pear and to make it a bit brighter und upfront. Both used at low percentages to not overpower the pear. \r\n\r\nFA Whipped Cream & TPA Bavarian Cream & FW Hazelnut\r\nThese are obviously the cream components. I added Bavarian Cream to make it a bit sweeter and I found that, after a few days steep, it blended very good with the coconut and gave a coconut-milk like taste. The hazelnut served as enhancer for the creams and again brings everything together.\r\n\r\nTPA  Green Tea\r\nAbout 2 % added a nice sweat green tea flavor, creating an overall more interesting vape-experience. \r\n\r\nJF Coconut\r\nFor the coconut I used Jungle Flavors (JF) Coconut at 0.7%!!! Unfortunatly I couldn't find it in the flavor list, so I put in TPA's as a placeholder which might work as a replacement as well!!!!! JF Coconut is my favorite coconut flavor at the moment. I used it under 1% because in combination  with the creams it tends to mute the fruit flavors after a while. It takes about a 2-3 days steep to sit down in the mix and not to be to dominant.\r\n\r\nTPA Sweetener\r\nI used just about 1 drop/10 mL to add a bit more sweetness to the mix. Add more if you like but beware that it potentially mutes the fruits as well.\r\n\r\nNotes: mixed at 80/30 (VG/PG). Steep: minimum steep over night, best after 3-5 days.\r\n","steep_days":"5","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T03:30:33.000-05:00","best_vg":"80%","views":"2639","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Pear","flavor_id":"411","vendor":"FA","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Lemon Sicily","flavor_id":"524","vendor":"FA","millipercent":800},{"name":"Cream Whipped","flavor_id":"541","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1200},{"name":"Hazelnut","flavor_id":"1312","vendor":"FW","millipercent":600},{"name":"Apple Fuji","flavor_id":"4886","vendor":"FA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Green Tea","flavor_id":"355","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Bavarian Cream","flavor_id":"145","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Coconut Extra","flavor_id":"316","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":700},{"name":"Sweetener","flavor_id":"339","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":200}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"26934","name":"Pears under Palms"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
