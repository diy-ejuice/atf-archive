That being said, after trying the first attempt nostalgia kicked in as that graham cracker crust taste came through. Then ever so gently as if to say we are real, the slight strawberry hits you. So this recipe just has to stick for me and I will start from scratch on my original idea. This is a great little all day vape especially here during the holidays.  Added quick note, after 3-5 days it is almost spot on imho. Any feedback humbly accepted as I am only about 3 weeks into diy as of this post.","steep_days":"1","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-05T04:17:00.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"1433","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"New York Cheesecake","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":4500},{"name":"Sweet Cream","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Sweet Strawberry","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":6000},{"name":"Strawberry (ripe)","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Cheesecake (graham Crust)","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Super Sweet","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1000}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"131638","name":"Strawberry Cheesecake"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
