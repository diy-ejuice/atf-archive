See my note below. \r\n\r\nCTC by FLV is almost a good enough single flavor. I used that for most of the cinnamon, it creates the grain, and a small amount of cream — so a random cream base was made and used to help boost the milk. Overall happy with my first recipe, a simple one, after mixing others since 2016! Nothing perfect but it’s mine!","steep_days":"0 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:51:30.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"683","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Cinnamon Crunch","flavor_id":"611","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Cream","flavor_id":"604","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Meringue","flavor_id":"530","vendor":"FA","millipercent":500}],"reviews":[{"user":"Kittybit","text":"This is a pretty enjoyable vape actually and a great attempt for a first recipe.
