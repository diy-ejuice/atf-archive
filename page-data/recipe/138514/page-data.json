If you like what I do and want to support me all you have to do is rate and review my recipes if you choose to mix them up :)\r\n","steep_days":"7","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"total_reviews":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T17:35:29.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"2144","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Banana Purée","vendor":"WF","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Whipped Cream","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Milk","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Creamy Custard","vendor":"VT","millipercent":500},{"name":"Frosting","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":500},{"name":"Honeycomb","vendor":"VT","millipercent":5000},{"name":"Super Sweet","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":350}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"138514","name":"Nanacomb Milkshake"}}}
