The meringue and starch base contribute to the “frosted” element while the starch base also contributed to that wheaty vibe you look for in a cereal, the milk is self explanatory, FA milk is by far the best milk concentrate I’ve tried especially if you’re just looking for that full fat milk. The sweetener is for my tastes and is totally subjective, it just helps me test and work with chocolate based concentrates.\r\n\r\nIf you like what I do and this recipe then please rate and review ;)\r\n\r\n \r\n","steep_days":"3 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:51:00.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"1391","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Cookie Bite","vendor":"MB","millipercent":5500},{"name":"Puff Cereal (Cocoa) SC","vendor":"WF","millipercent":1250},{"name":"Super Sweet","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":500},{"name":"Starch Base","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":80},{"name":"Meringue","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Milk","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1500}],"reviews":[{"user":"Nickinthemix","text":"Very delicious recipe..
