Probably my fault for testing it at 5%. Got rid of it a while back and picked it up again more recently, but this time tested it at .5%. Muuuch better. Instantly became my favorite “western” flavor. Leathery tobacco with some cocoa notes. \r\n\r\n**WF Vanilla RY Custard:** Can’t really say I get the “custard” part very much, but it is a good vanilla with just enough of an RY kick to be satisfying. \r\n\r\nThose two flavors are what I really wanted to be the focus of this recipe, and I think I got them to work pretty well together.\r\n\r\nDecided to give it a little southern twang, so I went with some Kentucky Bourbon because other bourbon flavors hurt my throat a little bit without a decent steep. \r\n\r\nThe Am4a is there to add a bit more depth to both the cocoa notes in the Western and the booze notes from the bourbon. The best way I can describe it is a cocoa liquor with some mystery mixed in. It’s unique and keeps things interesting. \r\n\r\nRed Oak just doing its thang to give some oak to the bourbon and it plays nice with tobaccos. \r\n\r\nFA Shade has an interesting top note to it with a bit of a less aggressive tobacco taste. I needed some more top notes because it was mostly only getting the tops from some of the Am4a, and that one is still more hearty than it is top heavy. \r\n","steep_days":"14","temperature":"0","recipe_score":4,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:50:09.000-05:00","best_vg":"60%","views":"2093","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Tobacco Western Blend","vendor":"INW","millipercent":1300},{"name":"Vanilla Ruyan Custard","vendor":"WF","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Shade","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Kentucky Bourbon","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Red Oak","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":800},{"name":"Am4a By Inwera","vendor":"INW","millipercent":1000}],"reviews":[{"user":"goosegirl","text":"I really like the tobacco blend, but I think I am going to have to make this a \"virgin\" mix and keep my bourbon in a glass.
