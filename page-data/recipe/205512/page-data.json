By itself as a single flavor WF S'mores Cupcake is great but I wanted more Ooomphhh! I felt like I needed a little more marshmallow so I added WF Marshmallow (Gooey). This is a great rendition of a sticky, gooey marshmallow. It gives the marshmallow more body and thickness. I wanted to add a buttery crust to the recipe so I added TPA Graham Cracker (Clear). TPA Vanilla Swirl balances out the marshmallow, graham cracker and the Chocolate. It's perfect for really bringing out the marshmallow and adding that cohesiveness to the recipe. It's also one of my all time favorite vanilla creams.\r\n\r\nI'm really proud of this one!!\r\n\r\nPlease enjoy and share your feedback!!","steep_days":"5","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T22:34:19.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"829","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Vanilla Swirl","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Marshmallow (Gooey) SC","vendor":"WF","millipercent":500},{"name":"Graham Cracker Clear","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2250},{"name":"S'mores Cupcake SC","vendor":"WF","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Super Sweet","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":500}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"205512","name":"Crack S'more"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
