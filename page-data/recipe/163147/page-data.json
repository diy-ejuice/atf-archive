After a few weeks steep recipe is steeping nice. I also have another version which I will just update notes Here. You can sub out the fw butterscotch ripple, wf caramel butter and replace it with TPA butterscotch at 3% and FA Carmel at 0.75% give about 2 weeks as well. It will be more butterscotch top notes and a deeper caramel flavor. Both are good imo but that's up to you on how you want to mix the recipe ðŸ˜‹ enjoy.\r\n\r\nDiy Mixers Crew attempt at Steep PopDeez. #DMC #cloningwiththecrew #popdeez\r\n\r\nRecipe notes here=====> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQTSOsd8pbg\r\n\r\nNew mixers always welcome=====>  https://www.facebook.com/groups/dmcdiy/","steep_days":"3 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-11T14:17:31.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"1070","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Kettle Corn","flavor_id":"329","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":6000},{"name":"Candy Corn","flavor_id":"1225","vendor":"FW","millipercent":750},{"name":"Butterscotch Ripple","flavor_id":"1217","vendor":"FW","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Brown Sugar","flavor_id":"313","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":250},{"name":"Acetyl Pyrazine 5%","flavor_id":"1709","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":150},{"name":"Caramel Butter","flavor_id":"6046","vendor":"WF","millipercent":2500}],"reviews":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"163147","name":"Steep PopDeez: Cloning with the Crew"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
