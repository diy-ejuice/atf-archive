Had to sub some things v2 of sugar cookie and CAP sweet strawberry in for the TFA strawberry..  But damn it's good!  I was a bit scared of 20% flavoring as I thought it was too much...  It's not.  Mix up a batch and you'll see.  The strawberry to shortcake balance is great.  Good as a SnV, much better after the bakery notes steep.  About 5 days and it's good-to-go.  Great job on your adaptation minus the YC."}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"8342","name":"I Can't Believe It's Not Manson's Strawberry Shortcake Bar!"}}}
