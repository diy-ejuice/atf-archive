But if you do that, you have to deal with the taste of INW Cactus. Enter the new INW Prickly Pear. It's almost as juicy as Cactus. I don't think it actually tastes like prickly pear fruit, though it might if mixed with something like CAP Sweet Guava. But, I digress. It really tastes like some kind of juicy, sweet apple/melon blend. Which makes it a perfect complement for honeydew/pear. Next, cooling. The Honeydew-Pear pairing was already a fantastic summer juice because it's so juicy and refreshing, but I never thought to add cooling to it back in the day because Koolada/Polar Blast never seemed like it would be a good fit. Add some WS-23, though... wow.

RDL tank .5 ohm 25-30 watts. I can use this all day and not lose any of the nuance. For me I think the honeysuckle is what reeeeally sets it off. Great work on this one. "},{"user":"rougeislander401","score":"5","text":"So I finally got my hands on a 30ml of inw prickly pear and this was the first mix I made to test it out and boy was I pleasantly surprised! I wasnt expecting the prickly pear to juice up the mix as well as cactus does but oh my is it damn close and with way better flavor.  This is the perfect way to use this new concentrate released by inawera as it pears with these specific fruits wonderfully and is immensely well balanced. Great for a nice hot day without need for ws23 imho! Thanks dave!"}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"195175","name":"Prickly Pearry"}}}
