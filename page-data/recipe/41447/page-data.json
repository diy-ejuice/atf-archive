The recipe does more than deliver a pleasant profile, it delivers an experience, which is something I have always wanted to do. \r\n\r\nThough the name obviously plays off of /u/ID10-T's recipe, it is also personal. Ever since I smelled FLV Persimmon, I fell in love. It's got this aroma that's floral, sweet, fruity, and just plain delicious -- everything I've wanted in a vape. Upon mixing up a SFT @ 1.5%, the taste translates just as beautifully as the smell, but the throat... oh the throat... so harsh... I tried bringing it down to 1%, 0.5%, and even 0.25% and it was still giving me trouble in recipes, but I knew there must be a way to tame it, and by golly I was on a mission. \r\n\r\nI had tried mixing Persimmon in with florals, fruits, bakeries, cocktails, creams, etc, and nothing seemed to be working. I decided to try just throwing it on top of what I've dubbed now as my [Cream Stone](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/40944#cheebasteeba_s_cream_stone_by_cheebasteeba) and was surprised that the throat was almost entirely subdued. Then I tried bringing it up a little higher and I was getting the full delicious flavor of FLV Persimmon, on top of a nice creamy base, with little-to-no throat (none on the inhale, slight tickle on the exhale). Originally I wanted to do this recipe with Cherry Blossom and Persimmon, but it wasn't working out, and I believe I achieved the goal of a similar style vape to [Longing](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/31323#longing_by_id10_t) while still staying within the constraints of the contest it was a part of.\r\n\r\n**\"Oh how I yearn to relive\r\nThose missed opportunities.\r\nLovers lost,\r\nCareers canned,\r\nExperiences expelled,\r\nBut they're gone...\r\n\r\nOh how I yearn to relive\r\nThose happier times.\r\nCarefree and spontaneous,\r\nExcited and outrageous,\r\nJubilant and generous,\r\nBut they're gone...\r\n\r\nOh how I yearn to relive\r\nThose eras of freedom.\r\nTo come and go as I please,\r\nTo try new things and\r\nTo feel new feelings.\r\nBut they're gone... \r\n\r\nBut that's not who I am\r\nNot anymore.\r\nI love who I am,\r\nand the world around me I adore.\r\nOh how I yearn to live,\r\nThe future and all that it holds in store.\"**\r\n","steep_days":"3","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"total_reviews":2,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:49:15.000-05:00","best_vg":"80%","views":"2262","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Persimmon","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":500},{"name":"Sweet Cream","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":750},{"name":"Frosting","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":500},{"name":"Vanilla Bean Ice Cream","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Vanilla Bean Gelato","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2000}],"reviews":[{"user":"MotherPunker","score":"5","text":"I can't believe this doesn't have a million reviews.  This is my favorite recipe to date ever made by another mixer.  Im not even going to try to say it better than the words master ID10-T lol cuz what he said, says it perfectly as usual...how the f does he do that?!.   This is one of the few cream based recipes I can say, I'll vape off the shake but of course it gets better with a steep, so make LOTS!  I think persimmon has got to be my favorite concentrate now, I just can not stop opening the bottle and smelling it, thank god it smells nothing like the inside of the actual fruit,! (b/cause semen scented vape juice would NOT have me yearning!)"},{"user":"ID10-T","score":"5","text":"Smooth, creamy vape that I give five stars for just being so darn delicious, but it also drove me a little crazy. It tastes like grasping for something that's just out of reach. As soon as I opened the bottle of FLV Persimmon, I knew \"Yearning\" was the  perfect name for a recipe with a plot, a sort-of story in a bottle about wanting to be able to have a vape that tastes the way that smells, but without the throat razors. This seems to stop just barely short of that full persimmon flavor, but so close to it that it's less of a disappointment and more like being edged to the point of insanity. Like every hit is so good, but instead of fully satisfying, it leaves you craving more. It tastes like no matter how much of this you make, you'll be sad when it's all gone.
