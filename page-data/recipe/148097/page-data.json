OOO Rhubarb Crisp is a perfect baked rhubarb and doesn't have so much bakery that it takes away from the profile. I added a bit of spice with flv apple filling to warm up the mixture some more and give the whole thing an overall baked feel. Flv Apple Cranberry is a nice balance of apple and cranberry with Flv Cranberry boosting up the cranberry element of the recipe.
