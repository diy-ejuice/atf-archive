Really great MTL Vape after 10 days of steeping. I don’t get much vanilla from it and it doesn’t taste sweet to me but it is delicious and on point. Somehow it reminds me of the oatly milk drink even though there is no oat in this recipe. Anyway everything feels really well balanced and I like this recipe. Thanks for sharing!"},{"user":"Creamgirl","text":"Great recipe, i love it! The best Almond Milk i vaped so far.&#xD;\nAfter 9 days of steeping, it really a excellent, full milk flavour. &#xD;\nOn exhale the Almond is coming out and playing so well with the Vanilla and the creamy milk flavour.&#xD;\nGood balance of flavours. I have add 0.4%  Cap Super Sweet because iam a sweet tooth :-)&#xD;\nThanks for the recipe, good job."}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"193174","name":"The Vanilla Almond Milk"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
