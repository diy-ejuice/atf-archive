Feel free to choose but marshmallow treat ice cream? This should be really sweet..","steep_days":"5 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"updated_at":"2020-12-12T14:08:03.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"613","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Vanilla Bean Ice Cream","flavor_id":"1451","vendor":"FW","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Vanilla Custard","flavor_id":"188","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Marshmallow","flavor_id":"332","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Rice Crunchies","flavor_id":"142","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":5000},{"name":"Pazzo Burlone (Joker)","flavor_id":"9911","vendor":"FA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Super Sweet","flavor_id":"2384","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":750}],"reviews":[{"user":"Skywxp3d","text":"First time I’ve actually tasted “ice cream” in a vape - *edit - after a couple weeks this lost a lot of the delicious rice/cone flavor I loved early on - strange!
