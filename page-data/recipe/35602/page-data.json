I was inspired by steam room vaping's not your grandma's peach recipe. I am trying to make my flavor notes easier and better and more to the point. This is just the peach cobbler you will have to add your favorite whipped cream base or ice cream base if you want that aspect. I just found this recipe tasted so damn good without adding any whipped cream or ice cream that I didn't add it into this recipe but it does taste amazing with a ice cream or whipped cream base added on top.\r\n\r\nThe peachy filling:\r\nJuicy Peach by TFA = 2.5%    White Peach by FA =1.5%\r\nCactus by INW =.25%   Added to make the peach juicier and I strongly believe this flavor is necessary. it enhances this recipe so much and also makes it unlike an peach cobbler on the market.\r\n\r\nThe Cinnamon crumbly Goodness:\r\nCinnamon Crunch by  FLV =2.5%  Yellow Cake CAP =2%\r\nBrown Sugar TFA =.50%  Biscuit  =.50%\r\n\r\nI just felt this recipe needed to be posted just the way it is because me and my wife absolutely love this recipe I hope you enjoy it as much as we do. This recipe changes with a longer steep I am told whenever I make it for my house we end up killing a 120ml bottle by day 7 LOL. I AM LUCKY TO EVEN GET TO DAY 5. ENJOY!!!!!!!
