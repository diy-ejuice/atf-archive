Thought it would be an interesting combo. I am not going to break the flavors down here, read this as not even pretending to have a goal in mind with this, I thought it would be interesting and good, and it is ;) \r\n I have only done two versions of this one just as is and one with .3% Super Sweet. I really like both versions. This version is a bit more interesting in that as you change your wattage, airflow different aspects of it will shine through. The version with super sweet seems to be a bit more in your face but more linear losing a bit of it's complexity.\r\n\r\nHave a mix, have a vape, enjoy ","steep_days":"1 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"total_reviews":1,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:49:41.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"4518","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Strawberry â€“ SC","vendor":"RF","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Strawberry Sweet","vendor":"JF","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Mango","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Forest Fruits","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1750},{"name":"Peach","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1000}],"reviews":[{"user":"ID10-T","score":"5","text":"Well that is simply delicious. And why wouldn't it be? I mean, just look at the ingredients. The way they come together here is very interesting; I get individual aspects of mango/peach and strawberry/mixed berry that are intertwined without being combined and nothing remotely unpleasant or out of place.
