I used **Banana Nut Bread** by TFA as a jumping off point. It's a great flavor that has a delicious banana note (albeit light), with a nice nut and bready bakery texture. This is the foundation for our recipe.\r\n\r\n**AP** is here to boost those bready and nutty notes, and after a nice steep it works very nicely. I know it seems a touch high, but trust me on this one. It's one of the first times I've used it this high, but after folkart used it in his [**Boss Reserve Clone**](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/76822#boss_reserve_clone_remixmonth_by_folkart) to great effect, I had faith it would work here. It did. \r\n\r\n**TFA Banana Cream** is here to help out that light banana note, we only need a little( it also lends creaminess to our pudding). \r\nWhen I think of Banana Nut Bread I need some cinnamon in there, so **CAP Cinnamon Danish Swirl** does wonders adding that note, and solidifying that bread that our recipe calls for.\r\n\r\nBrown sugar is needed in the mix as well, but I decided to skip the **TFA Brown Sugar** - we use **INW Creme Brulee** to thicken up that pudding base and to add that brown sugar caramelization. **FLV Vanilla Pudding** is a great creamy base that is very accurate to it's name, and really puts this recipe right where it needs to be. It brings some thickness and vanilla, and in combination with the Banana Cream and Creme Brulee it makes a nice pudding to drop our banana bread into. All these flavors play together well and it makes for a very tasty vape!\r\n","steep_days":"7","temperature":"0","recipe_score":4.5,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:50:17.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"3626","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Banana Nut Bread","flavor_id":"144","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":5000},{"name":"Banana Cream","flavor_id":"210","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Acetyl Pyrazine 5%","flavor_id":"1709","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Creme Brulee (yc)","flavor_id":"894","vendor":"INW","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Vanilla Pudding","flavor_id":"4433","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Cinnamon Danish Swirl","flavor_id":"35","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1000}],"reviews":[{"user":"bjorama","text":"Very authentic recipe.
