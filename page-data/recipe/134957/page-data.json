I used Zeppola because it's one of my favorite donut flavors and easy to work with. Sweet Cream is a lovely thick cream filling. VTA Glazed Strawberry was used on a whim to add an almost jelly component, but moreso over the top instead of inside. (cream is already inside) Pastry Zest is merely to add the lovely bakery aspects it provides. (powderiness, citrus zest, etc) Apricot was used to boost the strawberry as it was a bit too flat without.","steep_days":"5","temperature":"0","recipe_score":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-10T20:01:02.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"1601","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Armenia (apricot)","flavor_id":"507","vendor":"FA","millipercent":250},{"name":"Glazed Strawberries","flavor_id":"8885","vendor":"VT","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Pastry Zest","flavor_id":"8562","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":250},{"name":"Sweet Cream","flavor_id":"8979","vendor":"VT","millipercent":500},{"name":"Vanilla Buttercream Frosting","flavor_id":"8990","vendor":"VT","millipercent":250},{"name":"Zeppola","flavor_id":"6312","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000}],"reviews":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"134957","name":"Strawberry Glazed Filled Pastry"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
