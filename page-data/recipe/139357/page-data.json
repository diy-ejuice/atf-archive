The pastry zest seems to add a grainy sugar  note and the citrus helps bring froward the sweetness of the creme brulee   as well. \r\n\r\n","steep_days":"5","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-06T07:16:04.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"1980","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Cinnamon Sugar","flavor_id":"8741","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Creme Brulee","flavor_id":"8864","vendor":"VT","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Graham Crust","flavor_id":"9950","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Meringue","flavor_id":"530","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Flapper Pie SC","flavor_id":"10106","vendor":"WF","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Pastry Zest","flavor_id":"8562","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":600}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"139357","name":"Flapping For Addy  ( custard,  brown suagr, cinnamon, meringue, graham cracker pie) "}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
