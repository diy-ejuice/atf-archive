I have based this recipe on the leading commercial and loved iced coffee here in Australia called \"Ice Break\".  After two years of trying, I'm happy to say I have found a way to  to get the special unique note of sweetness that has been the hardest part of this recipe to nail down.\r\n\r\nNever did I think a TFA Coffee would make up the missing piece of the puzzle here. After trying TFA Coffee Extra Clear quite a while ago I swore I wouldn't use a TPA coffee flavoring again. However I found a sweet coffee(TPA Coffee Kona) that when used in context with other solid flavors and used low at no more than 1% it is lovely.  Using the French Vanilla 2 paired well to assist with the unique kind of sweet & almost malty vanilla note that has made this recipe such a challenge for me. Along with the mouthfeel, sweetness and balance all the other concentrates brought to this profile, each one layers and assist to achieve the notes that makes up my favorite everyday iced coffee and come to life. I encourage you as you mix this to single flavor test these concentrates and note what each does and I have no doubt you will learn more by this recipe in how I have gone about layering it all in. Hence why we don't see many \"Coffee Base Recipes\", it's difficult. This recipe would be my personal best and most patient recipe I have brought together and I hope you enjoy this as much as I have developing it. Let me know your thoughts and thank you for mixing it and staying off those dam stinkies with my recipe! :)\r\n\r\nIf you wish to give a \"Cold\" effect start at 0.25% up to  1% FA Polar Blast at your liking. \r\nI talk about my recipe here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcg9dsBDkE0","steep_days":"3","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"updated_at":"2020-12-12T17:11:44.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"3228","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Milk Fresh","flavor_id":"8926","vendor":"VT","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Mocca (mocha)","flavor_id":"798","vendor":"INW","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Coffee Milk Froth","flavor_id":"8858","vendor":"VT","millipercent":500},{"name":"Coffee (kona)","flavor_id":"197","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Caramel Coffee with Sweet Milk","flavor_id":"7748","vendor":"PUR","millipercent":2000},{"name":"French Vanilla Ii","flavor_id":"323","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Super Sweet","flavor_id":"2384","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":500}],"reviews":[{"user":"Demented76","text":"I made this a while back but I did not have the TPA-Coffee so I had to trade it for .50% of WF-SC Brazilian Coffee and I did not notice a burnt taste to it.  I really liked this one.  I will probably cut back the sweetener a tad when I make it again or try Tam's suggestion on the Vanilla Sugar Daddy but that is just a matter of preference.

So I recommend to anyone who loves coffee to mix this, and if you get this the burnt taste, I have a solution.  &#xD;\nI added Sugar Daddy Vanilla Sweetener to it a .5%. Not sure what magic it has in it, but it cut the popcorn taste out. ","score":5}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"102397","name":"Breaking The Ice"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
