This is an immensely creamy, fresh out the oven, European style baked cheesecake which, I am certain, will be the new gold standard for Cheesecake flavours. Period. \r\nThis is a Philadelphia style cream cheese set atop a delishious, delicate graham style base, perfectly balanced.\r\n\r\nThe 3-2-1 Creme Brulee needs no introduction and combined with the Cheesecake, results in next level oral pleasure...\r\n\r\nYou can absolutely not substitute anything in this recipe with the exception of the Shisha Vanilla with your favorite vanilla.\r\n\r\nThis baby shines after 5 or 6 days, thanks to the wizardry at Inawera... \r\n","steep_days":"6","temperature":"0","recipe_score":4,"updated_at":"2020-12-12T11:52:14.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"7899","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Creme Brulee (yc)","flavor_id":"894","vendor":"INW","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Custard","flavor_id":"4210","vendor":"INW","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Shisha Vanilla","flavor_id":"841","vendor":"INW","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Yes, We Cheesecake","flavor_id":"9272","vendor":"INW","millipercent":3000}],"reviews":[{"user":"KylezKloudz","text":"Based on the other good reviews, I would say INW Creme Brulee is NECESSARY... Do Not Substitute w/ VT Creme Brulee! ðŸ˜  It just seems to fall short and possibly makes a 5 ðŸŒŸ recipe about a 3 ðŸŒŸ... That being said I'm gonna give it 4 and don't do what I did...

I've said it before and its been rather consistent that inw custard isnt very good to me.  Several recipes have fell short in my book because of that note I get.  But ruderudi I held onto it cuz I knew you would come to the rescue.
