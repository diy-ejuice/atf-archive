Went down the coconut/lime road and went with some Rum for a great boozy flavor.\r\n\r\nVienna Cream/Vanilla Swirl/Holy Vanilla: The ice cream base. After about a 5-7 day steep time, the vienna cream settles down and turns into a beautiful flavor and lends itself to a great ice cream flavor. Swirl/holy are used for the heavy vanilla that I love, and the swirl helps blend a lot of this together. \r\n\r\nThe two coconuts I take from HashSlingingSlasher from Leche de Coco. Its a beautiful coconut pairing. \r\n\r\nThe two limes I use for a heavy sweet lime. The lime wedge is a tad higher because after the steep, it fades very hard. I wanted it present in the final taste but not heavy.\r\n\r\nThe rum is just that, a beautiful spiced rum and pairs well with the tropical flavors to add something special\r\n\r\n","steep_days":"7","temperature":"400","recipe_score":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-10T16:01:17.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"1226","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Vienna Cream","flavor_id":"516","vendor":"FA","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Vanilla Swirl","flavor_id":"189","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Holy Vanilla","flavor_id":"2385","vendor":"DFS","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Lime","flavor_id":"634","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":800},{"name":"Sweet Coconut","flavor_id":"605","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1750},{"name":"Coco' (coconut)","flavor_id":"416","vendor":"FA","millipercent":750},{"name":"Lime Wedge","flavor_id":"4374","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":800},{"name":"Super Sweet","flavor_id":"2384","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":250},{"name":"Jamaica Special (jamaica Rhum)","flavor_id":"521","vendor":"FA","millipercent":2500}],"reviews":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"143787","name":"Jamaican Breeze"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
