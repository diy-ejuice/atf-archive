They have a hint of a vanilla/peaches and cream style to half of them and the jellied peach top.\r\n\r\nFA Peach White & INW Peach : The INW Peach is the main note, with the FA White Peach to boost it up.\r\nCAP 27 Bears : Brings the jelly sweet note this is a solid jellied candy flavour\r\nVanilla Swirl : This makes it a thicker mouth fell and a touch of the vanilla in there\r\nVT Fizzy Sherbet : This brightens the peach and brings it forward as well as making it more \"candy\"\r\n\r\nI hope you enjoy its my first public recipe. Its a nice SNV and not harsh for a peach vape. It settles nicely over a couple of days.... feedback good or bad is welcome!","steep_days":"2 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:49:54.000-05:00","best_vg":"80%","views":"1523","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Peach","flavor_id":"804","vendor":"INW","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Peach White","flavor_id":"543","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"27 Bears","flavor_id":"8735","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Vanilla Swirl","flavor_id":"189","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Fizzy Sherbet","flavor_id":"8878","vendor":"VT","millipercent":1000}],"reviews":[{"user":"goosegirl","text":"I have enjoyed this recipe.
