I have the correct watermelon, but gave up because this is so much better.  Nice ADV that doesn't overload your senses.  \r\n\r\nNeeds about an overnight to steep and its ready to go, on the shake the gummy candy stands out too much.  I really like the little bit of the sour aftertaste. You can play around with the sweetener I found 1.5 to be the point where it doesn't leave a sweet diet soda taste in your mouth and brings out the candy aspects.  Added the Marshmallow in my 3rd version to round everything out and keep it smooth. \r\n\r\nTried alot of batches with TFA bubblegum and Loranns bubblegum and none of them tasted like chubby, this is as close as I have got. I actually like this a lot better than Chubby, the addition of sour makes it a nice run around town vape.
