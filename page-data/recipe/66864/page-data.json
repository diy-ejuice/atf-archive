The Kentucky has a nice, Robust Tobacco flavor, and the Classic Cigarette brings a bit of shag tobacco taste to me. Throw those two together, and you’ve got something interesting, but it’s missing a little something. This is the point where i would usually reach for the INW Dirty Neutral Base. But now there’s a new kid on the block. FLV Pucker isn’t going to give you that dirty ash taste, but it enhances those ashy notes in the Kentucky and Classic, and also adds a nice, full smoky exhale. The tart kick on the front of the exhale seems to amplify the taste of the Kentucky without altering it. \r\n\r\nPucker is some pretty cool stuff.
