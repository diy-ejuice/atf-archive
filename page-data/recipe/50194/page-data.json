It's pretty much all strawberry for me ! It's a very poorly made Eliquid !!!! There's no strawberry shortcake there for me !! This is pretty close, even a little better in my opinion, and I do believe if you enjoy Milky Cones Vapory Strawberry Shortcake Eliquid that you will enjoy this one !! So here's my remix ! Go mix it up, rate it, and leave some feedback !!!!!!!!! #RemixMonth ","steep_days":"7","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:49:23.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"6292","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Strawberry","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":5000},{"name":"Strawberry (ripe)","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Sweet Cream","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Whipped Cream","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Cheesecake (graham Crust)","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Bavarian Cream","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1500}],"reviews":[{"user":"RdaJunkie","text":"This is slowly becoming my favorite strawberry as it keeps steeping.
