It takes a while to steep but its so worth it. Development notes: Steeped for 4 weeks, very good cinnamon flavor and some sugar cookie. Custard Flavor is a little light at 4.5%. Raised Custard to 6.25% . Lowering Cinnamon Crunch to 2.5% to bring out more sugar cookie, raising sugar cookie from 2% to 3%.
