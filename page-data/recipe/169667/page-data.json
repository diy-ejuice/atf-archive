In combo with whipped cream and marshmallow tfa makes a nice vanilla cream flavor.\r\n\r\nSuper Sweet CAP - Sweetening the juice up to really give it that ice cream pop sickle sweetness.","steep_days":"14","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"total_reviews":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:51:10.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"1160","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Whipped Cream","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Blood Orange","vendor":"FW","millipercent":1250},{"name":"Marshmallow","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Vanilla Swirl","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Super Sweet","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":750}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"169667","name":"Dream Scythe"}}}
