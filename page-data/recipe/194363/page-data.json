And my mixing capabilities are like \"you sure you dont want peanut butter or cheesecake or custard or somethin!?\" And he said \"nope just a graham cracker please\".\r\n\r\nFw graham cracker is my favorite. Its a wonderful honey vanilla graham cracker. Cap graham cracker fills it out. Inw biscuit adds to the cracker aspect, keeps it dry n crunchy n slightly buttery.\r\n\r\nVta honeycomb and inw shisha vanilla are here to boost the depth of the graham cracker flavor!\r\n\r\nMy buddy really likes this stuff and it smells soooo good.\r\n\r\nSuper sweeten to your preferences. .25%-.5% for a graham cracker is plenty.\r\n\r\nVta honeycomb can be bumped to 1.5 if you want a lil more of a honey note.\r\n\r\nSteep time: literally 3-5 hours later this juice will change color and is ready to go.

I really like the that this doesn’t take very long to steep at all and is even full of flavor right after a shake. I Am sensitive to cinnamon, but I still couldn’t help but vape this until my sinuses burned. I’m going to order some more flavors to try more of your stuff soon man.
