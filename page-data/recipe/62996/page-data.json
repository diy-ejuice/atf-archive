Amazing smoothness that just rolls off the palate. But it shouldn’t have references to pumpkin or pie anywhere in the description. There’s no spice beyond what you might call the spice from the vanilla. No one would add that silky pumpkin pie filling to a custard without adding spice, that’s just silly. Add any amount of FLV Pumpkin Spice to this from 0.25% to 0.75% and you’ve probably got yourself a perfect Pumpkin Custard. Add some crust like FA Apple Pie and you’ve got a Pumpkin Custard Pie. It is a bit too sucralosy to me but that’s just so subjective, YMMV. I wouldn’t recommend leaving it out, but maybe reducing it to somewhere between a 0.25 and 0.4% would cut down on that Splenda aftertaste.
