I wanted to give it longer but the end of the month is here already! The pistachio and ry4 double is nothing new but delicious as ever. Caramel and Bavarian cream add to the creamy goodness the ry4 double already has. Vanilla for pipe is here to give a boost to the tobacco but not so much that it is off putting to non tobacco fans. It also gives us an extra punch of that wonderful inw vanilla we all now and love. The end result is a creamy caramel, pistachio tobacco with some vanilla to smooth it all over","steep_days":"10","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T22:32:14.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"3538","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Pistachio","flavor_id":"293","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Ry4 Double","flavor_id":"379","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Carmel (caramel)","flavor_id":"503","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Bavarian Cream","flavor_id":"145","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Vanilla For Pipe","flavor_id":"886","vendor":"INW","millipercent":1000}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"52119","name":"Pistachio Ry4 Remix"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
