It is excellent, def. in my top 10."},{"user":"BuryMeInSmoke","score":"5","text":"Minty, watermelon hard candy.  Very good.  Haven't had the original so can't comment on it as a clone.  I've also mixed a version with FW Grape and FW Watermelon in place of the FW Jungle Juice which came out quite nice for a reduced menthol version."},{"user":"Chewymidget","score":"5","text":"Feels good"},{"user":"super8line","score":"4","text":"As I've mentioned in other reviews I had been someone who hated any melon flavored juices.  This stuff is great, it's not bad as a SNV but after 3 days it's perfect!  "},{"user":"MrBurgundy","score":"5","text":"This is good stuff. I expected that Hard Candy to hit me like a brick sack of potatoes, but it's actually layered into the recipe really well. It isn't off-putting whatsoever. I never use menthol or koolada, however mint does fit this profile so perfectly. The sweet and candied Watermelon is right up front. Jungle Juice and Hard Candy give it those weird sugary notes. Pretty spot on watermelon  candy to me. Thanks for sharing!"},{"user":"RuntDastardly","score":"5","text":"FW Hard Candy and Jungle Juice are two flavors I can pick out in any mix to it's detriment. I don't know how you managed to make them taste so damn good here, but you did. This is some sweet, juicy, cool watermelon candy deliciousness right here. "},{"user":"GTACanuck","score":"5","text":"Right out of the gate, 2 hours after mixing it is stunning.  All I taste is candy watermelon, nice cool watermelon exhale with a pure fresh watermelon candy inhale.  The aftertaste is unreal too! This is a must try if you got the ingredients!  Thanks so much for sharing this with us!"},{"user":"Smoky","score":"4","text":"Can i up the la watermelon to 11-12% if i dont have fw watermelon?"},{"user":"CriticalVape","score":"5","text":"Not having tried the original, I can't attest to accuracy in comparison. However, as a standalone mix, it is quite good. After about a 2 week steep you get a smooth, slightly creamy watermelon menthol. Personally, I despise Koolada and menthol, but this is an exception. I made this for a buddy, but set aside a tank for myself. Now I'm hooked. The cooling is quite powerful, but up against the candy watermelon it works. Really surprised the FW Hard Candy didn't dominate the recipe, as it usually does in my experience. I suppose the LA Watermelon/FW Jungle Juice combo is powerful enough to subdue the Hard Candy. This is a knockout mix if you like candy, watermelon, or cooling-styled liquids."},{"user":"matp75","score":"5","text":"never had the original but mixed this up tonight and gave it a shake and vape its awesome. i did overshoot the cap cool mint on accident from .8 to .13 om a 30 ml but its fine. it is a little perfumey and floral but not as bad as pluto right after opening i bet this would be a good breathe and steep i am considering adding some cream and a bit of cake batter and butter and see if if i can get a milky cream on it&#xD;\n"},{"user":"Hannah7620","score":"5","text":""},{"user":"dazcole","score":"none","text":""},{"user":"WasRaziel","score":"5","text":"Never tried original. Tried a day after mix, LA gave me a nasty floral taste and I almost threw it out. I gave 10ml each to two friends to try and they loved it. So after 3 weeks I still had almost 10ml left and tried again. Floral is practically gone and tastes awesome. I have problems with a lot of fruit flavors being floral, I have yet to find a strawberry I can vape and I have tried all the typical brands."},{"user":"ParDeus","score":"5","text":""},{"user":"Philosaphucker","score":"5","text":"This is not exact but it is pretty damn close and totally awesome.

Watermelon Crack was one of my fav B-X juices. if i wanted more of a menthol kick what could i add without totally destroying the overall flavor? this is a ADV for me."},{"user":"mk0","score":"5","text":"This is SPOT ON!
