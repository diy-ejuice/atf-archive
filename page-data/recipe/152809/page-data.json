It is about as close as you can get to recreating the actual drink in vape form. I added 1% WS-23 and .5% CAP SS, but I like my teas cold and sweet. For \"normal\" people, you probably don't need more than .25% sweetener, if any."},{"user":"humanpuck","score":"5","text":"This really is a refreshing juice.  Its sweet and a tiny bit tart drink.  Can't believe Cap Sweet Mango works so well here."},{"user":"beeker","score":"5","text":"This recently joined the ranks of my favorite summer vapes. Refreshing, well balanced, and accurate to the beverage, all accomplished without requiring the use of any special-order flavors, you should just mix this up and see for yourself.
