A Pecan to be exact. Pecan tarts are my absolute favourite and I could probably live on these if they didn't contain about a million calories each.\r\n\r\nVersion 2, Removed CAP VC1 and replaced w/ INW Custard, Added sweetness with Brown Sugar and added Pie Crust for more texture.\r\n\r\nINW Biscuit / TPA Pie Crust / CAP Sugar Cookie - Make up the flakey goodness that is the outside pastry of the tart.\r\n\r\nFW Butter Pecan / INW Custard / CAP Butter Cream / TPA Brown Sugar - The sweet gooey deliciousness that makes up the inside of the tart\r\n\r\nFA Hazel Grove - Just gives the impression that you are biting into a nut that tops the tart.\r\n\r\nThis recipe benefits greatly with additional Acetyl Pyrazine - I add .5 - .75 which adds additional flakiness to the pastry.","steep_days":"7","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"updated_at":"2020-12-12T11:51:17.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"1654","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Butter Pecan","flavor_id":"1212","vendor":"FW","millipercent":5000},{"name":"Biscuit","flavor_id":"642","vendor":"INW","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Butter Cream","flavor_id":"3","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Sweet Cream","flavor_id":"183","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Custard","flavor_id":"4210","vendor":"INW","millipercent":2750},{"name":"Brown Sugar","flavor_id":"313","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":600},{"name":"Pie Crust","flavor_id":"179","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":250},{"name":"Hazel Grove (hazelnut)","flavor_id":"417","vendor":"FA","millipercent":150},{"name":"Sugar Cookie","flavor_id":"115","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":500}],"reviews":[{"user":"VaperKitten","text":"This is so delicious, I just finished 120 ml in like five days now I am mixing another batch.  I have had to make a few changes because of what I had on hand like using CAP Custard instead of INW  Hazelnut instead of Hazel Grove, and I lowered the Butter Pecan from 5 to 3 due to personal taste but this mixture is Amazing...so so good.
