I was hoping for a juicy tropical punch with a bit of a creamy back end, did some research and then put this together and was surprised. It's yummy delicious.\r\n\r\nIt's a sweet juicy orange juice, subtle pineapple with hint of coconut and a slight and very faint bit of strawberry, the strawberry is admittedly a little lost, however, I don't want to remove it as I like what this is. Then on the exhale its less orange and a bit more cream. Then when you've finished your exhale, you get this faint banana around your mouth with some coconut sat at the back. All round, I like it and you might too!\r\n\r\nSUBBING - the only one I can think of is switching Red Touch for TFA Strawberry Ripe/Strawberry but maybe drop it to just 2%. I haven't tried it though and I don't really like the concept of subbing ingredients (BOOOOOOO!).\r\n\r\nSHAKE THE SHIT OUT OF YOUR CONCENTRATES BEFORE MIXING, ESPECIALLY BLOOD ORANGE.","steep_days":"1 (SNV)","temperature":"450","recipe_score":4.5,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:49:21.000-05:00","best_vg":"80%","views":"3656","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Blood Orange","vendor":"FW","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Juicy Orange","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Golden Pineapple","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Red Touch (strawberry)","vendor":"FA","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Banana Cream","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1250},{"name":"Coconut Extra","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Vanilla Whipped Cream","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Super Sweet","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":600}],"reviews":[{"user":"cdaniell30","text":"I was really expecting the banana cream to take this over, but it totally didn't.
