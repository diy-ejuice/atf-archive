Balancing the 2 was a bit tricky but once I had a good ratio going I needed another element to wrap this mix up. VT banana custard gives me that final creamy fresh banana note I was looking for without having to wait for the 'runts' to steep out. Adjust to taste although I would only push 0.10 to 0.25 super sweet as this recipe carries alot of inherent sweetness. \r\n\r\nIf you mix this please rate and/or comment.","steep_days":"2 (SNV)","temperature":"","recipe_score":5,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:51:45.000-05:00","best_vg":"75%","views":"1139","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Banana Custard","vendor":"VT","millipercent":1750},{"name":"Custard","vendor":"INW","millipercent":1750},{"name":"Madagascar (Vanilla Classic)","vendor":"FA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Biscuit","vendor":"INW","millipercent":500},{"name":"Vanilla Pudding","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1250}],"reviews":[{"user":"RudeRudi","text":"Wow, just wow...
