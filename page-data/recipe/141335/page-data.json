While this is not an exact clone, to achieve a similar robust dessert vape requires a heavy hand and more than a few ingredients.\r\n\r\nTo start, I wanted a dense chess pie... and I like mine sweet. The Vanilla Custard with Sweet Cream are at the root of that, complimented by both Inw Creme Brûlée and FA Custard (Inw didn't give me enough of the caramelized top hence the brown sugar & vanilla).  \r\n\r\nYou can do with less frosting (but it levels the mix nicely) or without the Super Sweet but at 0.75% & 0.5% why... this is a zero calorie extravagance. \r\nThe Rich Cinnamon, at just one drop per 30 m, is a must... two is fine, don't cry., it won't destroy things.\r\nAnother must is the 3:1 Whipped Cream & Golden Butter which are the buttermilk of the recipe.. This key combination was uncovered in 2016 at least.\r\nFor the crust I opted for a simple 2:1 which does this recipe justice. \r\n\r\nGive it a taste before you dial it down, go back to the original and think, If you were to bake a chess pie, what would you want.","steep_days":"21","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T23:37:24.000-05:00","best_vg":"81%","views":"1342","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Apple Pie","flavor_id":"551","vendor":"FA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Brown Sugar","flavor_id":"313","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":750},{"name":"Creme Brulee (yc)","flavor_id":"894","vendor":"INW","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Custard","flavor_id":"484","vendor":"FA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Frosting","flavor_id":"4412","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":750},{"name":"Golden Butter","flavor_id":"60","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Rich Cinnamon","flavor_id":"638","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":80},{"name":"Shisha Vanilla","flavor_id":"841","vendor":"INW","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Sugar Cookie","flavor_id":"115","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Sweet Cream","flavor_id":"117","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Super Sweet","flavor_id":"7787","vendor":"PUR","millipercent":500},{"name":"Vanilla Custard","flavor_id":"131","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Whipped Cream","flavor_id":"193","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":3000}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"141335","name":"Buttermilk Pie DecaDance"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
