That recipe quickly became an ADV for me.\r\nWhen I was trying to make everyone try this recipe I showed it to @RageIsALotOfWork, I knew he doesn't like strawberry vapes, but I was still raving, he had the brilliant idea of making a PB&B, so I did. \r\n\r\nIt's an absolutely amazing vape.\r\n\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nA delicious peanut butter and banana with sweet vanilla milk and cream undertones topped with a fresh whipped cream.\r\n\r\n Banana cream gives you a nice fresh banana flavor not to ripe but just fits well into the creams.\r\n\r\n Sweet cream, Bavarian cream, cheesecake graham crust, vanilla swirl, and the vanilla custard make up that rich vanilla milky cream. Sweet cream and the cheesecake graham gives it that dairy flavor while the Bavarian cream and vanilla swirl add in the vanilla along with the vanilla custard which also adds weight and holds everything together in this recipe.\r\n\r\n Lastly the whipped cream is just used as a topping. Picture a peanut butter and banana milkshake glass with that whipped cream on top that's exactly what it is there for just to finish it off.\r\n\r\n 5 day steep \r\n Tried to keep this recipe using only tfa but capella vanilla custard v1 works better in my opinion but tfa vanilla custard will do fine.\r\n\r\n\r\n","steep_days":"5","temperature":"0","recipe_score":4,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:48:52.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"2753","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Banana Cream","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Bavarian Cream","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Cheesecake (graham Crust)","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Sweet Cream","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Vanilla Swirl","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Vanilla Custard","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Whipped Cream","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Peanut Butter","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":4000}],"reviews":[{"user":"NaCHeF","text":"I just tried this recipe and the first thing that came to my mind is what well balanced and yummy it is!! But I dont taste what you describe in the flavor description, for my it is far from being a milkshake. I don't know if it is the peanut butter that swipes out the milk and cream, but I would try to replace the Sweet Cream for Vienna Cream and probably add some Meringue to have a stronger dairy note and make the almond from the meringue play with the peanut butter. Anyway, great recipe and thank you for sharing!!!"}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"17726","name":"PB&B Milkshake"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
