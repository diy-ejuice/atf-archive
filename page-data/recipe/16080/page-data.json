I aimed to create the profile of an apple cinnamon cereal sitting in strawberry milk, and I feel that the final recipe version achieves this profile very well (not to be cocky). It doesn't taste quite like Apple Jacks, more like Cinnamon Toast Crunch with lots of green Apple Jacks (I'm pretty sure there is a difference between the orange and green AJ's...) mixed together that's been in the milk long enough to make it sugary and delicious. When vaping the first note tasted is apple that is a slightly dominant to the rough/grainy cinnamon cereal, but both battle it out for the top note. This is carried by the sugary sweet strawberry milk which becomes prominent about halfway though the exhale. To be honest, I struggle to taste strawberry and needed to have others taste test the recipe for this aspect - what I personally get is a sugary milk that has a definite fruity sweetness (I also used the Ripe Strawberry to blend the recipe together, in particular the apple and cinnamon notes, as well as making the apple have a more artificially sweet taste). Finally, the vape will finish on one of two notes - either the apple cinnamon cereal will come back and leave you with a grainy or slightly 'rough' feel, or it will end on the strawberry milk note and provide a smooth, sweet, dairy taste that lingers for a while. \r\n\r\nI hope you guys didn't want flavor notes - I just followed the instructions for the contest on DIYorDie.com. Just in case, the only flavoring I haven't mentioned that I used is AP. I needed to use AP to bring out a grainy and more dry feel from CAP Cin. Dane. Swirl. Without AP, CDS stays far too soft and fresh bakery like, no where near what a cinnamon cereal is supposed to taste like. So guys, that's it! Even if I don't make it to round 2 it was fun coming up with this recipe, and I'm thankful for this competition and the chance to compete. Hope you all enjoy!","steep_days":"5","temperature":"0","recipe_score":4,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:48:50.000-05:00","best_vg":"30%","views":"2389","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Cinnamon Danish Swirl","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":3750},{"name":"Fuji","vendor":"FA","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Strawberry (ripe)","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Meringue","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Cream Fresh","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Acetyl Pyrazine ","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":500}],"reviews":[{"user":"Crash0verride77","text":"This juice is delicious.&#xD;\nHowever I think it does not quite hit profile, missing a bit of that crunch and the milk is rather hidden.&#xD;\nBut I love it, will mix again."}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"16080","name":"A.J.S.M.
