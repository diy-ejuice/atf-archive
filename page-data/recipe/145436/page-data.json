The LB vanilla ice cream and TPA Vanilla Swirl combo is a winner. \r\nFor the Orange part I use FW Blood ORange, CAP Sweet tangerine and TPA Orange cream. I try different Orange combo, but this one is the best for this one. We have a bright, sweet and creamy orange with a touch of blood orange.\r\nFor my taste, no need to add some sweetener\r\nFeel free to add 0.25% WS23 for the cold effect.\r\nEnjoy","steep_days":"3 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":1,"updated_at":"2020-12-06T03:09:52.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"1477","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Vanilla Ice Cream","vendor":"LB","millipercent":5000},{"name":"Vanilla Swirl","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Blood Orange","vendor":"FW","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Sweet Tangerine","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Orange Cream","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":3000}],"reviews":[{"user":"SeLeV","text":"This tasted half-decent for about a day, then got worse and worse as time went on, tasting like a rotten orange in old milk."}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"145436","name":"orange sherbet #Mixin Vixens"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
