It's really cool and refreshing, could see myself vaping on this during the summer or when I'm sick especially "},{"user":"TheJuiceJackBuilt","score":"5","text":"Cold be gone! Man this is sooo yum. An icy blast on the inhale, shortly followed by a sweet creamy sensation on your tongue. I can see this being me go to when Im feeling bunged up, n I want something comforting and cold. Great recipe Foooo! "},{"user":"UnappreciatedRobot","score":"5","text":"Wintermint Dream. That’s not a typo. If you’re a fan of shamrock shakes, then you have to mix this recipe. The cream and mint are perfectly balanced, and Foment_Life was right when he said that the cream knocks the high percentage of WS-23 down to a tolerable level."},{"user":"NickG","score":"5","text":"As I was making this I was like there is no fucking way I'm putting 2% WS-23 in here, but... I've made a bunch of your recipes and they are all delicious, so I trusted you and I'm glad I did. It's quite tasty and the cold isn't really all that much, just perfectly accentuates the creams, vanilla's and wintergreen. I'm tasting this just off the shake and it's damn good, looking forward to seeing what this turns into. Thank you !"},{"user":"Ebc88","score":"5","text":"I did knock to ws-23 down to 0.75% bc i was gonna be using it on a mech mod and anything over 1% is way to cold for my likings unless it is in a pod/mtl setup, but this is a tasty recipe get a pleasant strong vanilla cream blend with some coolness and wintergreen.
