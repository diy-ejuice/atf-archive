The Caramel base with Milk is by no means my doing it is from the Remix of \"Milk Plus\" by the great mixer https://alltheflavors.com/users/ENYAWREKLAW .... I was vaping on it one day and thought man this would be awesome if it was on a sugar cookie but i could not decide if i wanted the cookie with strawberry or apple.. Im sure Apple will be great in conjunction with the caramel so im gonna sub that in on a V2.  Im still fairly new to mixing but I am getting this down pretty quick I am struggling with the cream in this so feel free to comment and input your thoughts.
