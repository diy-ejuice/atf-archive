Was going for something different but what I ended up with reminds me of the blocks of chocolate fudge that you get at the candy shop.  If you're a fan of rich chocolates, this should be pretty damn enjoyable.  No idea how long this should steep to reach its final form, I've had it sitting for 3 days and find it delicious.","steep_days":"3","temperature":"420","recipe_score":0,"total_reviews":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T02:15:05.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"2122","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Milk Chocolate","vendor":"JF","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Chocolate Fudge Brownie V2","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Vanilla Bean Ice Cream","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Vanilla Custard","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":500},{"name":"Meringue","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Marshmallow","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Sweetener","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1000}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"42028","name":"Chocolate Fudge"}}}
