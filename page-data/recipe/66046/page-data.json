It's not super prominent, but it gives a little extra to the recipe..\r\n\r\nAdd Polar Blast or Koolada @ 0.5-0.75% for that feeling of a fresh cold drink. You can ofcourse increase this as you please.\r\n\r\nGood as SnV but 3 days will do the INW raspberry wonders.","steep_days":"3 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"total_reviews":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:49:37.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"2652","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Lemonade","vendor":"LA","millipercent":6000},{"name":"Raspberry","vendor":"INW","millipercent":750},{"name":"Raspberry (sweet)","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Red Touch (strawberry)","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Strawberry (ripe)","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Lemon Sicily","vendor":"FA","millipercent":750}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"66046","name":"Pink Lemonade"}}}
