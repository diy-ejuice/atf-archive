The Vanilla Custard was an add in and works well but that isn't what really gives it that cream cheese flavor, I tested the brie and cream cheese icing because I didn't want to test brie on its own (yep weenie).  The sugar cookie, biscuit, and zeppola taste okay, but it's not a danish yet so maybe someone can come up with a better solution than I did, and I'll keep trying too.  The danish I'm after is more bready and less sweet.
