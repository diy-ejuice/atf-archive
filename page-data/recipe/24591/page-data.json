However, I got lucky with this one. This was a first attempt just based on familiarity with the flavors, and it was so unique that I felt nothing needed tweaking. \r\n\r\nThe overall profile is just a bright fruit drink mix that still retains that separation that I love; each flavor is easily recognizable without being too obvious. HS Blueberry and INW White Grapefruit at these percentages sort of \"fight\" with one another to hold the spotlight in an interesting way. HS Blueberry gives us a syrupy, artificial blueberry flavor that pairs nicely with the bright, slightly acidic INW White Grapefruit. FLV Lime is pretty much Lime Kool-Aid, and gives us a playful note to keep everything interesting.\r\n\r\nI'll admit that I mostly just wanted to squeeze in one more recipe this year so you guys don't think I'm dead.....and maybe fuck with CokeCan a bit for calling out all my friends. But this is probably one of the more unique profiles I've made. It's good as a shake and vape, but really settles in around the 2 day mark.\r\n\r\n","steep_days":"2","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:48:57.000-05:00","best_vg":"60%","views":"6330","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Blueberry","flavor_id":"2076","vendor":"HS","millipercent":3000},{"name":"White Grapefruit","flavor_id":"892","vendor":"INW","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Lime","flavor_id":"634","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":250}],"reviews":[{"user":"FizzChaser","text":"This recipe is fantastic!
