I tried it to see if it made INW Sparkling Wine work, but I’m still getting what I think is supposed to be a booze note, but instead comes across rhubarb-ish and a little camphorous (and the Cactus doesn’t seem to be helping there), and a base that’s bubble gummy. Also INW Sparkling Wine comes across fairly full flavored at just 1%, this seems like an excessive amount of it. Maybe much less of it would be effective? But I would just scrap it and use a better champagne flavor to build a bellini, FLV Brut Bubble Wine comes to mind but there are others that might work just as well, if not better.
