I created this recipe a few years back while vacationing in the Keys. I wanted to create a well-rounded sweet strawberry cocktail with hints of citrus. I started with my base. FW Pink Champagne is an amazing effervescent flavor. It definitely has that \"bubbly fizz\" to it and it works great with fruits. I paired TPA Strawberry (Ripe) with CAP Sweet Strawberry. INW Cactus definitely brings out the flavor and juiciness of the strawberry and gives it plenty of body. FA Aurora adds a citrus element to the recipe. FLV Rose Essence is a subtle earthly flavor. I used it to give the recipe a floral aspect. I love using TPA Ethyl Maltol in all my fruit-based recipes. It adds a bit of sweetness to the fruit and it gives the recipe an authentic sweet taste.\r\n\r\nI've tried this on a Shake N Vape and it comes out quite good. I prefer to give it a couple days to let all the fruits settle in.\r\n\r\nYou can add your favorite sweetener to the recipe if you choose to do so.\r\n\r\nPlease enjoy and share your feedback.","steep_days":"3 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"total_reviews":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-06T20:46:06.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"543","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Aurora","vendor":"FA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Cactus","vendor":"INW","millipercent":500},{"name":"Ethyl Maltol","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":750},{"name":"Pink Champagne","vendor":"FW","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Rose Essence","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Strawberry (ripe)","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Sweet Strawberry","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":4500}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"204098","name":"Strawberry Cotton Candy Cocktail"}}}
