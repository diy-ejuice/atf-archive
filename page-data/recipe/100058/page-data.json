Add the powdered CBD isolate first to the empty bottle, add the PG and flavorings and wait until fully dissolved. Add VG after. Steep time is 4 days due to the crunch berries flavor.\r\n\r\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/8g4z5m/may_2018_recipe_thread/","steep_days":"14","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"total_reviews":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T17:34:54.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"2054","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Vanilla Custard","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Strawberry (ripe)","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Sweet Strawberry","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":3000}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"100058","name":"CBD Strawberry Custard"}}}
