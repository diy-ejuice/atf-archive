This flavor profile was interesting to me so I wanted to give it a crack. Rose is such a delicate flavor, but very pleasant. The saffron, where to start. Used way too high, almost a burnt plastic or even gasoline aroma. Working with this was interesting. When used at the right percentage it lends a slightly floral hint, but what it does more is almost give some sort of...Umami feel. It's very hard to describe to be honest. I have tried this with and without, the change is noticeable but hard to describe. The only way I can describe it is have you go out, buy saffron, and try it for yourself.\r\n\r\nI would say let this steep about a week for the florals to fall into place and let the pistachio come out.","steep_days":"7","temperature":"400","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-05T17:43:24.000-05:00","best_vg":"65%","views":"1209","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Vanilla Bean Ice Cream","flavor_id":"186","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":4500},{"name":"Pistachio","flavor_id":"293","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Vanilla Custard","flavor_id":"131","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":500},{"name":"Saffron","flavor_id":"577","vendor":"FA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Rose","flavor_id":"511","vendor":"FA","millipercent":350}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"60134","name":"Shiva"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
