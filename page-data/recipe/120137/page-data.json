Lava Cake is a chocolate cake with a molten fudgey center...cookie is used here to help dry out that center of the cake and add more texture to the mix\r\n\r\nOOO powered sugar....used her to get that coco powder feel on the end of the exhale...i have been told that using this flavor over 1% will start to dry out the mix.\r\n\r\nFLV VANILLA BEAN..... Nice vanilla flavoring...used here because all cakes need Vanilla...\r\n\r\n","steep_days":"4 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:50:27.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"1553","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Lava Cake","flavor_id":"1493","vendor":"LB","millipercent":6000},{"name":"Pound Cake","flavor_id":"4306","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":2250},{"name":"Cookie","flavor_id":"490","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Powdered Sugar","flavor_id":"6522","vendor":"OOO","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Vanilla Bean","flavor_id":"8573","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":500}],"reviews":[{"user":"cdaniell30","text":"Really nice chocolate cake...this is the best chocolate recipe I've tried in quite a while."}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"120137","name":"COCA DE CAKE"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
