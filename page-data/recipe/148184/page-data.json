It is incredibly prominent in mixes and here it is well complemented by the addition of FW Butterscotch. The FLV Caramel (mostly a brown sugar flavor) is one of my favorite sweeteners for its granulated sweetness, doesn't present as much as I'd like. I think I'd prefer a less prominent tobacco flavor with more FW to make up for the loss of complexity in flavor that comes from Tatanka. On it's own, this could be a great base with the addition of just one of more stronger tobaccos and maybe just a hair less than 1% of Tatanka (not one of my faves) but I wouldn't lose it entirely. The Tatanka/FW Butterscotch combo is almost too good to lose, despite my lack of love for Tatanka. The whole thing just leans too far to syrup for me and I want a little less of that unless I'm planning to balance it with some drier tobaccos. &#xD;\n&#xD;\nIn all, this is a solid example of an RY4 built from the ground up with Tatanka pulling double duty as bacco and flavor. I bet if you threw 1% FLV Cured or 3% HS RY1 on top of this, it would be complete and a ridiculously satisfying RY4 blend. Thanks for sharing your work!"},{"user":"ID10-T","score":"5","text":"I haven't had a chance to use this as intended yet, I've only tried it by itself, but it certainly tastes like what I wish TFA RY4 Double tasted like and seems like it would be an excellent replacement for it. Compared it RY4 Dub, you get a buttery caramel with a prominent vanilla and just enough real tobacco, versus a dirty caramel without that buttery richness and blah vanilla. Also tastes less likely to do excessive muting of other ingredients than RY4 Dub. I don't know that it would work as a replacement for RY4 in existing recipes built around that, because it's too different, but I would certainly rather build recipes around this than around RY4. Great stuff! "}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"148184","name":"RY4 STONE (base recipe)"}}}
