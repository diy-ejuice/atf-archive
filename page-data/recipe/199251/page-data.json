Crispy wafer brings that crispy cookie aspect without bringing butter like a biscuit would. Chemnovatic cookie fills in the gaps to the cookie base, FA would be a fair replacement and ATF doesn't list chemnovatic flavors.\r\n*****Note***** I used chemnovatic cookie at 1.5%, not FA, but I do think the recipe would be nearly unchanged using FA.\r\nThe oreo filling is compromised of VT sweet cream and Tfa Bavarian cream, bringing a rich thick cream. The shisha vanilla colors the cream vanilla and creates a separation from the cookie and the cream.\r\nGlamor chocolate brings a little more chocolate to the profile and seemed to play well with everything.\r\nFA milk...is the milk, the best available milk so it makes sense to use it here.\r\n\r\n**optional..super sweet, I feel it's essential in a recipe like this, but I know a lot of folks don't like to vape sweetener.\r\n*add 1% cream cheese icing for a \"double stuf\" vibe.","steep_days":"7","temperature":"480","recipe_score":0,"total_reviews":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T14:14:41.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"658","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"O's Cookie","vendor":"OOO","millipercent":5000},{"name":"Milk","vendor":"FA","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Crispy Wafer SC","vendor":"WF","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Cookie","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Sweet Cream","vendor":"VT","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Bavarian Cream","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Glamour Chocolate","vendor":"MB","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Super Sweet","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":500},{"name":"Shisha Vanilla","vendor":"INW","millipercent":750}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"199251","name":"Oreos N Milk"}}}
