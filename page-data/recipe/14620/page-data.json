Strawberry, tangerine and a hint of mango come together to form a sweet, tangy and tropical fruit blend. This mixture sits in a light cheesecake base that balances some creaminess with the sparkle of the citrus fruits. Enhancing with a touch of super sweet and cinnamon danish swirl gives this base a uniquely sweet profile. \r\n\r\nExcellent as a shake and vape but develops nicely with a 3 day steep. The mango will be upfront to begin with and then fade into the background and let the tangerine and strawberry shine through. Creamy cheesecake becomes even more prominent with a full week steep.
