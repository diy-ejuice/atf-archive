It's bakery season!! A day off from real life work has afforded me the opportunity to drop this beauty. This is my rendition of a Crock Pot Butterscotch Apple Pudding Crisp, a favorite of mine at family holiday get togethers.\r\n\r\n**FLV Apple Filling** This ingredient provides a solid cinnamon with a light apple jelly texture.\r\n\r\n**FA Fuji** Used to boost the lack of apple brought to the party with FLV's Apple Filling.\r\n\r\n**FLV Vanilla Pudding** Accurate implementation of vanilla pudding, if but a little light in the thick department. Needs a little help in the vanilla department but it's very creamy after a good steep,\r\n\r\n**INW Custard** Included in the final version to tie in the egg to the bread and slightly enhance the vanilla note and creamy body.\r\n\r\n**FW  Butterscotch Ripple** Just a dash to contribute to the rich profile and overall sweetness.\r\n\r\n**WF Deep Fried Pastry Dough** Just a dash of breadiness to help with the \"crumb\" note.\r\n\r\n**TPA Brown Sugar** An important element to the real life recipe, I felt it's inclusion would benefit this mix. Turns out, I was right. It adds a richness to the profile.\r\n\r\n*Steep Time*: Important to note, this recipe is a steeper. Emulsification is going to be your **friend** with this mix.","steep_days":"14","temperature":"420","recipe_score":5,"updated_at":"2020-12-12T14:06:47.000-05:00","best_vg":"75%","views":"2583","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Apple Filling","flavor_id":"4376","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":400},{"name":"Vanilla Pudding","flavor_id":"4433","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Brown Sugar","flavor_id":"313","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":350},{"name":"Fuji","flavor_id":"506","vendor":"FA","millipercent":800},{"name":"Butterscotch Ripple","flavor_id":"1217","vendor":"FW","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Custard","flavor_id":"4210","vendor":"INW","millipercent":750},{"name":"Deep Fried Pastry Dough SC","flavor_id":"8367","vendor":"WF","millipercent":700},{"name":"Sweetener","flavor_id":"1432","vendor":"FW","millipercent":500}],"reviews":[{"user":"sunsetsandpalmtrees","text":"Delicious! All the flavors are balanced perfectly.  Smooth and sweet. Tastes like fall!  I wish I would have mixed up two bottles - it's so good. Definitely making more of this.","score":5},{"user":"whthek","text":"I get a nice, smooth and authentic apple throughout. For me, the 6 non apple ingredients work in concert, back stage if you will, to suspend a wonderful apple note from beginning to end. Had to come up with something, that was in my inventory, to replace (WF)DFPD and went with (TFA) Pie Crust at the same .7% Tested at 2wks. and now,at 3wks. keeps gettin' better.  I've tried and tried to develop an apple mix to come out like this...you nailed it! Thanks for sharing. ","score":5},{"user":"Ebc88","text":"Easy 5 star recipe. Apple come through beautifully. The creams blend well together.
