Apple cider provides some of the sweetness and cider taste where liquid amber just adds that \"fermented\" notes to finish it off\r\n\r\nApple Filling/Rich Cinnamon: This is some of the mulling taste. The apple filling gives a deep, cooked apple and spice, the rich cinnamon adds to the mulled notes\r\n\r\nElderflower: This is the hidden gem. It plays very well with the orange and mandarin to give a slightly floral hint. Its a hidden star for sure\r\n\r\nOrange/Mandarin: This is another depth of flavor in the mulling. It adds a nice citrusy note to the mix","steep_days":"3 (SNV)","temperature":"400","recipe_score":4,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:49:33.000-05:00","best_vg":"65%","views":"1132","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Apple Cider","flavor_id":"4368","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":600},{"name":"Apple Filling","flavor_id":"4376","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":200},{"name":"Rich Cinnamon","flavor_id":"638","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":200},{"name":"Elderflower","flavor_id":"3518","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":500},{"name":"Orange","flavor_id":"500","vendor":"FA","millipercent":650},{"name":"Tanger (mandarin)","flavor_id":"547","vendor":"FA","millipercent":250},{"name":"Liquid Amber","flavor_id":"476","vendor":"FA","millipercent":250}],"reviews":[{"user":"ID10-T","text":"I found this one to be a little harsh to the extent that it was almost hard to vape. It’s the oranges, especially FA Orange. Also, while orange belongs in a mulling with spice scenario, this seems really orange-forward to the extent that the balance is off. It’s almost like a 50/50 orange juice/cider combination, which is a bit weird. It seems like a easy fix for an otherwise nice elderflower-laced apple cider: Swap out the FA Orange and FA Mandarin for either INW Shisha Punch or FLV Back Bar Bitters for that orange-peel and spice flavor or, if those extra spice notes are unwanted (not sure why they would be in this scenario), some VT Orange Marmalade might do the trick. &#xD;\n"}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"61475","name":"Elder In Cider"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
