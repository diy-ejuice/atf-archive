This is what I came up with and I have to say it is really nice. It is a Toasted Nutty smooth Ice Cream with a soft Buttery finish. It isn't overly sweet but just sweet enough without being dry as a lot of Nut mixes can be. It blended together really nicely and the Nut doesn't overshadow the Ice Cream and the Ice Cream doesn't cover up the Nuttiness. It is worth a mix and will def be one we have in our rotation now. You can add 0.5% Sweetener if you'd like you can also use LB VIC in place of the VT VIC it will turn out just as good maybe even better.
