I just got it and thought it would  help the fruits pop a bit, but my previous versions didn't have it in at all.","steep_days":"2 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-06T20:41:58.000-05:00","best_vg":"85%","views":"1543","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Strawberry","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Strawberry (ripe)","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Razzleberry","vendor":"FW","millipercent":3500},{"name":"Mango","vendor":"INW","millipercent":1750},{"name":"Apricots","vendor":"INW","millipercent":1750},{"name":"Cactus","vendor":"INW","millipercent":500},{"name":"Guanabana","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1500}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"27317","name":"Framingo v4"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
