I just got it and thought it would  help the fruits pop a bit, but my previous versions didn't have it in at all.","steep_days":"2 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-11T19:40:30.000-05:00","best_vg":"85%","views":"1556","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Strawberry","flavor_id":"272","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Strawberry (ripe)","flavor_id":"271","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Razzleberry","flavor_id":"1393","vendor":"FW","millipercent":3500},{"name":"Mango","flavor_id":"664","vendor":"INW","millipercent":1750},{"name":"Apricots","flavor_id":"751","vendor":"INW","millipercent":1750},{"name":"Cactus","flavor_id":"647","vendor":"INW","millipercent":500},{"name":"Guanabana","flavor_id":"4427","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1500}],"reviews":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"27317","name":"Framingo v4"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
