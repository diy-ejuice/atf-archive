My only experience with the original Terkish Blend was with Tootalls remix (found at [A Terkish Remix](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/42655)) and loved it. As soon as I tried Terkish Maize though I instantly knew it was just Tootalls remix with some added Cap Cereal 27 for the corn, also I get some tobacco in it as well so added some FA Soho to get that going (This may also just not be in there). \r\n\r\nSo to sum up, this remix really belongs to him...I love standing on the shoulders of giants, and Tootall is pretty tall I reckon. Be a good cunt and give his other recipes a go, eh? \r\n\r\n[Tootall Recipes here](https://alltheflavors.com/users/Tootall)\r\n","steep_days":"4 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:49:51.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"5350","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Butterscotch Ripple","flavor_id":"1217","vendor":"FW","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Vanilla Custard","flavor_id":"131","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Toasted Marshmallow","flavor_id":"340","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Sweetness","flavor_id":"4413","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":500},{"name":"Cereal 27","flavor_id":"4163","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Soho","flavor_id":"413","vendor":"FA","millipercent":2000}],"reviews":[{"user":"finsamson","text":"Fantastic recipe. I've never had nor never will have the original, but this is great. I now do something weird with it though, I add a smidgen of FA Black Fire to this, creates a smooth and smokey butterscotch custard that I can't get enough of. Thanks so much for sharing the recipe"},{"user":"Seakow","text":"Absolutely delicious, will definitely be making more."},{"user":"MrZigglesworth","text":"Steep: 21 days. Kylin RTA w/ 36/26 dual-core fused claptons. 0.25ohms at 60 watts. If you let this sit for a bit longer than what you recommend the Soho comes out a bit more (Custard as well) and makes for an absolutely delicious recipe. CAP Cereal 27 for the corn note was a genius idea and I thoroughly enjoyed this, even if I have never had Turkish Maze myself."},{"user":"Cmnderb","text":"Mixed this on 3/11 let steep until today 3/17.  Vaping at .16ohm 44w on a Hadaly.  At first I thought what is this mix had to look up the recipe.  Continued vaping and after the third round of dripping all the flavors started coming through.  Get the corn on the inhale with the Soho marshmallow and butterscotch on the exhale.  As I am not a super taster next mix I might increase the Soho to 2.5.  All in all an enjoyable vape that I will mix again. Cudos to you and Too tall!!!"}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"83319","name":"Standing on the Shoulders of Giants (A TerkishMAIZE Remix derived from Tootalls Terkish OG Remix)"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
