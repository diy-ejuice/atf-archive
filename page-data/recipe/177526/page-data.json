It started out as a copy of a forum post from 5 years ago and slowly I have modified the ratios and flavors until I ended up here, which to my memory is the closest version I've tried to get to the \"real\" cereal killa profile.  If you want something different but still really nice try upping the Bergamot to 1-1.5%.  All the citrus together with the bite of the bergamot is really refreshing.\r\n\r\nAnyways, I love this version so I'm going to leave it now.  Hope you enjoy.","steep_days":"7","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T21:33:14.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"931","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Meringue","flavor_id":"530","vendor":"FA","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Lemon","flavor_id":"1655","vendor":"FE","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Tanger (mandarin)","flavor_id":"547","vendor":"FA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Yellow Cake","flavor_id":"4560","vendor":"JF","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Sweet Tangerine","flavor_id":"123","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Bergamot","flavor_id":"469","vendor":"FA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Acetyl Pyrazine 5%","flavor_id":"1709","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":350}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"177526","name":"Cereal Killah Clone"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
