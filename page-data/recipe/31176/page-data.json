The actual recipe I was inspired by calls for Walnuts, but I improvised and added 2 different nuts. Meringue for sweetness, and Liquid amber to bake the pears. Finished with a splash of VBIC on top. So far it's held up to a few days steep, still got that cooked pear taste on top with gingerbread adding some of that spice.","steep_days":"5 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T17:33:52.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"974","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Almond","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Brown Sugar","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Gingerbread","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":750},{"name":"Hazelnut","vendor":"FW","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Liquid Amber","vendor":"FA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Meringue","vendor":"FA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Pear","vendor":"FA","millipercent":4500},{"name":"Vanilla Bean Ice Cream","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":3000}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"31176","name":"Spiced Pear Upside Down Cake"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
