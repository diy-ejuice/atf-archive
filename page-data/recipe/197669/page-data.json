Just a hint of coffee, and no yucky coffee off notes. A little light in flavor - I mix Rin’s recipes as written and despite the low-doses of ingredients I almost always find them plenty flavorful. But this one is a little light. Notes say she likes chocolate on the lighter side and suggests bumping that up if you want more, so that’s forgiven. Next time I’ll do that, hopefully it will still be balanced enough that it doesn’t drown out the graham, marshmallow, vanilla, and coffee because those are nice little accents. But if it does a little, I’m sure it will still taste good. VT Chocolate Mousse is a really nice flavor.  &#xD;\n","score":4}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"197669","name":"Rin's Chocolate Coffee"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
