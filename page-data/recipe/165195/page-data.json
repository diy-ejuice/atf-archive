I usually think it needs some help from another tangy lemon lime flavor, but here I opted to use **FLV Lemonade** instead, to kind of sweeten it, rather than making it pop. I think it works great together with the melons, as they are so sweet, so the sweeter citruses blends great.\r\n**FLV Wild Melon** is just an incredible flavor by itself, a blend of many different melons all mashed together. I opted to make the honeydew part even more prominent by adding **FLV Honeydew**, which can be a bit thick if you use it too high, but at 1% I think it does just what it should here, add even more of that great honeydew flavor.\r\n**FLV Cucumber** was just some experiment I did, but I think it turned out great, as this flavor in particular has a quite distinct almost salty cucumber note to it, and cucumber/melons are a well known pairing. It's used relatively low here, so you have to look for it to taste it, but I think it adds a great juicyness and complexity to the whole mix.\r\n**WS-23** for cooling, as a soda should be cold! This is optional though, and use at your own prefered percentage, but I highly recommend it.","steep_days":"1 (SNV)","temperature":"420","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T17:35:54.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"1088","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Citrus Soda","flavor_id":"10083","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Lemonade","flavor_id":"636","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Wild Melon","flavor_id":"619","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Honeydew","flavor_id":"10089","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Cucumber","flavor_id":"4384","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":500},{"name":"WS-23","flavor_id":"8085","vendor":"OTHR","millipercent":500}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"165195","name":"Melon Soda"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
