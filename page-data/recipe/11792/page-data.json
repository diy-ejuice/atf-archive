This is my first recipe as a newbie DIYer. It's quite simple (as i'm just starting out) however I'm welcome to criticisms and suggestions for improvement. In V2 i've doubled to Cheesecake (Graham) Crust to 3% and instead of 8% TFA Strawberry, its now 4% TFA Strawberry and 4% Strawberry (Ripe). Tastes pretty good to me after an overnight steep, but looking forward to trying this after a week or 2.","steep_days":"0","temperature":"0","recipe_score":4.3,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:48:46.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"6020","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Banana Cream","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":8000},{"name":"Strawberry","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Cheesecake (graham Crust)","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Strawberry (ripe)","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":4000}],"reviews":[{"user":"Stephan","text":"Made this and forgot about it until a 3 week steep.  Very nice and definitely worth making again... but  I will tweak the next batch to my palate.  Thanks for the recipe!"},{"user":"HerrHut","text":"Very tasty. I like it. My favorite banana vape so far."},{"user":"TamVapes","text":"I mixed this, and let it steep over night.  I really like it.  Was wondering if the strawberry flavor will come out more in a another week.  Or should I add more strawberry.  Very good though.
