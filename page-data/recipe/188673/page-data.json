I backed it with FA Lime Tahity - Distilled for a little zest. \r\n\r\n(the whip) TFA Whipped Cream adds a decent amount of body to the vape and a nice fluffy texture that shows up just at the finish. \r\n","steep_days":"3","temperature":"0","recipe_score":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-10T16:01:46.000-05:00","best_vg":"60%","views":"626","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Yes, We Cheesecake","flavor_id":"9272","vendor":"INW","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Vanilla Custard 2","flavor_id":"10427","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Cheesecake (graham Crust)","flavor_id":"152","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Persian Lime","flavor_id":"8942","vendor":"VT","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Whipped Cream","flavor_id":"193","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Lime Tahity Cold Pressed","flavor_id":"581","vendor":"FA","millipercent":500}],"reviews":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"188673","name":"Granny's Key Lime Pie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
