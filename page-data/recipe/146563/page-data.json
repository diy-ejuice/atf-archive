I add 0.5% FA Donut Glassato Cioccolato for a cakey back note, but either version is delicious.  Hats off to Folkart for making the best chocolate vape I ever tried, thank you sir!","steep_days":"7","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"total_reviews":1,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:50:51.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"1944","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Butterscotch","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Australian Chocolate","vendor":"HS","millipercent":750},{"name":"Chocolate Milk","vendor":"VT","millipercent":1750},{"name":"Cream Fresh","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Meringue","vendor":"FA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Vanilla Ice Cream","vendor":"LB","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Super Sweet","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":750}],"reviews":[{"user":"IVELREWORB","score":"5","text":"Delicious! I subbed FA butterscotch with FW Butterscotch. I have never had a chocolate vale taste so good! Thanks to you and Folkart both! I wanted to taste it and let it steep. That plan changed. I tasted it and loved it so I made 500ml and am vaping on a 60ml I mixed up! Cant wait to try it again after a week or 2!"}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"146563","name":"Mayan Milk Remix"}}}
