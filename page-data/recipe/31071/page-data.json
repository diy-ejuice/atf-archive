The black tea is in there as a supporting flavor of the hibiscus and adds an earthy note to the whole mix. Iit can be modified up or down to your liking I Wouldn't recommend going above 2.5% due to the extremely earthy notes i get from this ( as we all know taste is subjective).   The EM is strictly to try and boost the strawberries as they tend to get lost in translation after a few days. \r\n\r\nThanks to the DOD community for pushing me to release some of my recipes and expect to see more from me in the future.
