My version uses Polar Blast as a cooling agent, instead of menthol. I believe it highlights the lemon and the blueberry better, while still giving the mix an icy profile. Perfectly fine as a shake and vape, though due to the higher amount of Lemon Sicily used, can benefit from a day or two of steeping.","steep_days":"2 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:49:34.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"2398","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Lemon Sicily","vendor":"FA","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Blueberry","vendor":"FW","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Blueberry (extra)","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Bilberry","vendor":"FA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Polar Blast","vendor":"FA","millipercent":750}],"reviews":[{"user":"xx2000xx","text":"The holy trinity :-)"},{"user":"Fiftytrent","text":"Had to use koolada instead of polar blast, but this is great even as a shake and vape."}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"61883","name":"Eclipse (Bombies Black Out City Clone)"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
