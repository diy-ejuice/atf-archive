But the unpleasantness of FA Rose even at just 0.5% comes though just a tiny bit, and the part of the rose that really tastes like rose seems like it is partially obscured by the Sugar Orchid. The Sugar Orchid isn’t helping Rose, it’s making it more of a generic floral. Underneath that there’s a lot of generic red fruitiness that doesn’t taste exactly like strawberry or cherry. It also doesn’t taste real, it’s almost a red gummy candy note. Just a sort of generic red floral and red fruit candy. I might steal that FLV Vanilla Pudding, FLV Vanilla Bean, FA Vienna Cream, and WS-23 combo for some other ice cream, but I won’t be mixing this recipe again or recommending it to anyone. Sorry Jarvis, if you’re out there, I’m sorry. I think this was probably created before FLV Rose Essence was a thing. It seems like getting rid of all that other stuff and just using a ton of FLV Rose Essence would do this much more nicely.  &#xD;\n","score":3},{"user":"Demented76","text":"I knew this was going to be good but let me say... DAMN this is good!  The steep is crucial but it was well worth the wait.  I tasted a drop on my finger the day after I mixed it and thought \"man that is a lot of rose\" which made me nervous lol.  However it has blended in very nicely after steeping.   Thank you for creating it.
