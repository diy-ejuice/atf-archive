I haven't played all that much with up and down percentages for this, but I'm pretty happy with it just where it is. :)\r\n\r\nWS-23 gives it a bit of coolness to boost that fresh sense you get from biting into a good 'ole back yard cucumber.\r\n\r\nAnyways.. Pretty fun little mix for pod devices if that's your thing..","steep_days":"1 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":4,"total_reviews":1,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:50:40.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"1327","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Honeysuckle (pg)","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Cucumber","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":7000},{"name":"Wild Melon","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":250},{"name":"WS-23","vendor":"OTHR","millipercent":200},{"name":"Cucumber","vendor":"FA","millipercent":2000}],"reviews":[{"user":"Clearkill","score":"4","text":"This recipe is tasty, it's a nice mellow juicy cucumber.
