I use FA Cappuccino instead of the Tiramisu and add TPA Meringue to give a little more sweet creaminess to the mix.  This needs a good 7 days steep to really blend the flavors but it's one of the best coffee juices I've had.  Fantastic in the morning but great as an ADV as well.","steep_days":"7","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T20:32:36.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"1408","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Italian Relax (cappuccino)","vendor":"FA","millipercent":400},{"name":"Carmel (caramel)","vendor":"FA","millipercent":300},{"name":"Cream Fresh","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Dark Bean (coffee Espresso)","vendor":"FA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Vanilla Tahity","vendor":"FA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Vienna Cream","vendor":"FA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Meringue","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1000}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"105570","name":"Smooth Morning Kick Remix"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
