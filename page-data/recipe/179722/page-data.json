This is definitely new for me. I wanted to make a mix using those specific flavors to create one profile that wasn't exactly cereal, not quite the berry forward, not too sweet, semi floral. It was more about getting these components to work in a mix that going for any specific real thing.\r\n\r\nB- For the berry i went with the daveberry trinity scaled down by a third. It sticks out distinctly as a berry here without dominating the mix.\r\nW- The wheat here is both flv wheat and jf biscuit. wheat brings an almost floral wheat note that biscuit fills in with a sweeter, lightly flaky body. I tried some RF Baked Bread sc but it was a little overpowering and i didn't feel like it was adding to the profile. I got wf frosted puff cereal and wanted to try it in here but it came too late. Im happy with where this is at anyway because I struggled to get a solid almond note I wanted.\r\nA - for the almond I used FA almond. I searched high and low in my drawer for wf almond cookie to see if i could use this in place of jf biscuit but also boost out the almond. Never did find it. I tried a little FA marzipan but it didnt make any noticable difference for me so I left it out. Just kept dialing this up until I liked where it was just under the wheat.\r\nH - I tried flv honey bee for the honey. It was too floral without enough sweet. Decided to give vt a run here. It has a bit of wiggle room between 2-3 % but I definitely wanted it to be both the bulk of the sweet and the almond wheat bowtie.\r\n\r\nI think what came out was interesting and not too bad. Hope you like it. outside my wheelhouse so any criticism, suggested flavors, just 'give up' comments are welcome. :)","steep_days":"7","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:51:18.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"686","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Honeycomb","flavor_id":"8901","vendor":"VT","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Almond","flavor_id":"528","vendor":"FA","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Biscuit","flavor_id":"4487","vendor":"JF","millipercent":200},{"name":"Wheat","flavor_id":"8574","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":800},{"name":"Shisha Strawberry","flavor_id":"1711","vendor":"INW","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Red Touch (strawberry)","flavor_id":"421","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1250},{"name":"Strawberry Sweet","flavor_id":"4745","vendor":"JF","millipercent":1000}],"reviews":[{"user":"ID10-T","text":"It’s like peanut butter and strawberry jam on thick homemade wheat, minus the peanut butter. I totally dig it. That strawberry combo can run quite candied depending on what it’s mixed with, but something about the way it works with this combo tastes like jam. Maybe it’s the way the almond and honeycomb blend in there. The thing tastes amazing but speaking of, I’m not getting any discrete almond, just a nice nuttyness like good wheat bread has. Same with the Honeycomb, it doesn’t really taste like honey to me here or on it’s own, though it does seem to be bringing a very honey-ish sweetness, like honey wheat bread. I would love to know what’s keeping it from seeming too dry. It’s like a thick hunk of fresh bread with emphasis on the fresh, not some dried out grocery store bullshit. I think this is the most interesting juice I’ve encountered so far this year.&#xD;\n&#xD;\nYou could leave this as it is because it’s already awesome, but I can see a lot of ways to play and experiment with it. Add some butter - strawberry jam on lightly toasted toast. Add some hops - strawberry wheat beer. Might as well put some PB in there and make a sandwich. Add some banana just because banana and strawberry. So many possibilities."}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"179722","name":"BWAH (Berry wheat almond honey)"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
