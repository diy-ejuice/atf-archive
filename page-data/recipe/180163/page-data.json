Add some pineapple, make a smoothie or both. As is, it reminds me of a drink you might have on the beach while on vacation, but with out the expenses or leaving the recliner. Hence the name Staycation. I hope you enjoy, as is or with your own touch.","steep_days":"0 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-05T19:51:14.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"1356","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Sweet Mango","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Sweet Guava","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Cantaloupe","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Juicy Orange","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Sweet Tangerine","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1500}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"180163","name":"Staycation"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
