Overall, I’m pretty satisfied with how it turned out. It satisfies my custard craving and I hope it does the same for you. \r\n\r\nThis definitely isn’t a shake and vape. Testing at ten days, the flavor was light. Testing again five days later and it’s starting to shine. The pralines give off a rich aroma and the custards with the sugar cookie provide a delectable, thick mouthfeel and scrumptious flavor. Enjoy!","steep_days":"21","temperature":"0","recipe_score":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-11T02:38:46.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"695","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Warm Custard","flavor_id":"8997","vendor":"VT","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Vanilla Custard","flavor_id":"131","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Sugar Cookie","flavor_id":"115","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1250},{"name":"Vanilla Butternut","flavor_id":"1452","vendor":"FW","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Pralines And Cream","flavor_id":"334","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Super Sweet","flavor_id":"2384","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":500}],"reviews":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"181578","name":"Majesty Reserve — Princely"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
