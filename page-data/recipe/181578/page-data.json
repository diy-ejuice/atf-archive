Overall, I’m pretty satisfied with how it turned out. It satisfies my custard craving and I hope it does the same for you. \r\n\r\nThis definitely isn’t a shake and vape. Testing at ten days, the flavor was light. Testing again five days later and it’s starting to shine. The pralines give off a rich aroma and the custards with the sugar cookie provide a delectable, thick mouthfeel and scrumptious flavor. Enjoy!","steep_days":"21","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"total_reviews":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T22:33:57.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"687","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Warm Custard","vendor":"VT","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Vanilla Custard","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Sugar Cookie","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1250},{"name":"Vanilla Butternut","vendor":"FW","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Pralines And Cream","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Super Sweet","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":500}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"181578","name":"Majesty Reserve — Princely"}}}
