It's just a great and versatile flavor.\r\n  \r\n**FLV COCONUT** is a potent realistic flavoring that doesn't taste like suntan lotion in this mix and at this percentage. FLV Sweet Coconut did *not* work well here. Neither did TFA Coconut Candy. \r\n  \r\n**FLV MILK CHOCOLATE**. 'nuff said. There is no better chocolate that works in this particular shitstorm of a mix.\r\n  \r\n**INW SHISHA VANILLA** and **CAP VANILLA WHIPPED CREAM** add smooth vanilla and whipped fluffiness respectively. I love the hell out of Shisha Vanilla and have been using it frequently. \r\n  \r\n**TFA GRAHAM CRACKER CLEAR** meshes so well here with FLV Coconut that it's almost as if they were made for one another. \r\n  \r\n**FLV SWEETNESS** finishes the whole thing off nicely with a sweetness that will not gunk your coils. It's wonderful stuff.\r\n  \r\n*Additional Notes:*\r\n  \r\n\r\nI usually make this 120ml at a time. That's because I highly enjoy it as a SNV. But, I also enjoy it as it changes as time goes on. Fresh, it's more butterscotch/chocolate & graham forward. At about 9 days, the vanilla is more prominent. At 14 days the Graham and vanilla are pushed forward together. And at 21 days on, it's just a bowl of swirled chocolate, butterscotch, vanilla, coconut, and crushed graham crackers. A real *shitstorm* of a mixture for the sweetest sweet tooth in DIY Land!!\r\n  \r\n\r\n**Recommended VG: 75%**\r\n  \r\n**SNV-9 DAYS**\r\n  \r\n*Please don't use this recipe for commercial gain.
