It's a delicious strawberry wafers! Thanks for sharing!"},{"user":"Mr-G","text":"This is Delicious"},{"user":"Ambedo","text":"Was unsure of this flavor for the first week and a bit, but after it had a good steep it was really nice. Was impressive how authentic the crispy wafer tastes in this recipe! Will for sure mix this again! This recipe actually inspired me to make my own cinnamon rendition of a wafer cookie. One of my favorite ATF recipes ive mixed so far. "},{"user":"SlashaLO","text":"This is spot on to the flavor. As I was mixing this I could smell everything coming together. Shisha Strawberry IS the flavoring, you can imagine it. Butter Cream is totally the frosting in the center and the slight bakery hints of Shisha vanilla help out butter cream so much. Its actually fluffy thanks to meringue. Just enough cookie to give you that flaky feel without it being too dense. I tried it in a few RDA's until I found one that worked well and I was amazed once I got the full taste. "},{"user":"jyroe","text":""},{"user":"DodgerFog33","text":"This recipe is a complete all star. This is one of the best strawberry recipes I have tasted. It tastes like an actual cookie. The biscuit at that high I was worried about it. Man was I dead wrong as it works to perfection in this recipe. This recipe is so simple yet provides a mouthful of yummy goodness. Definitely the best strawberry cookie I've ever tasted. This is an absolute must have strawberry to have in your daily rotation. The butter cream plays so well in this recipe with the meringue adding the perfect amount of sweetness without being overpowering in the recipe. The Shisha Vanilla is so good along with the perfect strawberry in the Shisha as well. Falon absolutely a home -run in this recipe. Very good. Glad I can now make this for myself. Definetely a 5/5 for me. "},{"user":"Huckabees","text":"Awesome work Falon. Tastes just like a strawberry wafer. I can't fault it. The combo of FA Meringue, CAP Butter Cream and Shisha Vanilla is perfect for what is best described as the 'icing'. I did not love it as a shake and vape. I do think it's best after 4-5 days when the biscuit settles into it's rightful place. Great for people who usually can't taste strawberry like me, but can taste Strawberry Shisha.
