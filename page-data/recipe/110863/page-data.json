Making something that revolved around just a fruit profile is something I have always wanted to put some serious effort into, so why not start now? This is the \"fruit\" of that labor. It's still a bit in the dessert department, but this is a Melon slush that I think you will really enjoy for the rest of summer.\r\n\r\nFruit Mix: When I SFT'd PUR Watermelon it was pretty dang tasty, but was more of a candied watermelon. I played with LA's as well; but I arrived at a combination of PUR Watermelon, CAP Cantaloupe, and JF Honeydew Melon for the melon mix. Honeydew helps give a sort of natural melon base, with CAP Cantaloupe bridging the gap between them.\r\n\r\nSome Slushiness: I played with VT Fizzy Sherbet in a few different recipes. For those that want a good baseline of VT Fizzy Sherbet in a recipe, check out The Spider by StarsandClouds or 7 NUP by pgl55. It really helps imply that effervescence of a soda-type drink. To add a bit more juiciness to it, I added a bit of FA pear to try and make a basic slush base. I'm sure there are better out there, but I like this one personally since Pear will accent the other fruits well anyway. WS-23 helps bring it all home with that nice and cool throat hit.\r\n\r\nYou can probably get away with a 1-day steep on this, but I like to give it 3 just to let everything settle. I hope you dig it!","steep_days":"3","temperature":"0","recipe_score":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-12T15:40:04.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"1372","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Watermelon","flavor_id":"7797","vendor":"PUR","millipercent":5000},{"name":"Honeydew Melon","flavor_id":"4577","vendor":"JF","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Cantaloupe","flavor_id":"23","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":2500},{"name":"WS-23","flavor_id":"8085","vendor":"OTHR","millipercent":500},{"name":"Fizzy Sherbet","flavor_id":"8878","vendor":"VT","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Super Sweet","flavor_id":"2384","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":250},{"name":"Pear","flavor_id":"411","vendor":"FA","millipercent":500}],"reviews":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"110863","name":"Melon Drank"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
