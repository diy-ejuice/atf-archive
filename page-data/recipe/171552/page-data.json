There police man is actually kind of weak but i believe that’s because it’s at an 80/20\r\nvg/pg and i don’t believe they use much concentrate So i did the clone at A 60/40 vg/pg , if you would like it the way they do it go ahead and do it at 80/20 vg/pg They also use Salt nic at LOW MG i use any where from 1-8 Salt nic for SUB OHM USE . They have options going any where from 3-12 mg salt nic , But i have never gone over 8 mg salts for SUB OHM use .
