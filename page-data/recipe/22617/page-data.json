Just an easy recipe that works with most any fruit flavor just swap the cherry and or adjust the amount of fruit but a great cheese cake. This juice is an amazing  shake  and vape but gets even better after a few days of steeping.  On the flavor list they didn't have plain cherry from the flavor apprentice that is what I used not cherry blossoms or cherry extract  it's just a straight  Cherry flavor  from TFA.  I just felt this recipe needed a little sweetener  I don't normally use sweetener but I think this one needed sweetener  to bring this flavor in the  game.","steep_days":"4 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T17:33:43.000-05:00","best_vg":"75%","views":"1628","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"New York Cheesecake","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":5000},{"name":"Yellow Cake","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Biscuit","vendor":"INW","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Cherry Extract","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Sweetener","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2000}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"22617","name":"Too Tall's Cherry Cheesecake"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
