Balancing 4 main flavors to create the perfect banana split. Sometimes on exhale you'll taste more strawberry, sometimes more chocolate, or even vanilla. It's a super fun recipe to vape.\r\n\r\n\r\nSome banana splits are made with pineapple, also topped with peanuts. I've had reports that .5% of INW Peanuts adds a crushed peanut topped on top of the ice cream taste. Also using CAP Golden Pineapple at 2% with everything else works well if you're more fond of the pineapple banana splits.\r\n\r\n\r\nOnly needs a few days to steep, but it's definitely delicious S&V. Also this recipe is easily sub-able, people used all types of different flavors and they reported that they were delicious.","steep_days":"3 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:48:52.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"6398","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Banana Cream","flavor_id":"916","vendor":"LA","millipercent":5000},{"name":"Double Chocolate (clear)","flavor_id":"158","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Shisha Strawberry","flavor_id":"1711","vendor":"INW","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Meringue","flavor_id":"530","vendor":"FA","millipercent":250},{"name":"Vanilla Bean Ice Cream","flavor_id":"186","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":5000},{"name":"Vanilla Swirl","flavor_id":"189","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Vienna Cream","flavor_id":"516","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000}],"reviews":[{"user":"BigFoot1","text":"I dont agree with steep time on this recipe. I did test it at 3 days and had weird off notes. I always allow Fa Vienna Cream to steep at 3 weeks. So I allowed it to steep a total of 28 days. I must say it was worth the wait. Besides from adding a caramel note that most banana splits come with. This is the most complete and enjoyable vape. I also think the sweetness needs boosted but that is a personal preference."},{"user":"Lord_of_Cinder","text":""},{"user":"lococarnage","text":"Amazing. The original is better than the one with pineapple"},{"user":"MattDGTL","text":"this recipe mind fucked me. I'm getting banana on exhale and randomly get chocolate or strawberry more mixed in. its like eating a dirty split, a random scoop almost every time. I made 10ml of this and vaped it the next day in the matter of 2 hours. thought i disliked banana vapes. i was obviously doing something wrong"},{"user":"AlexYanchunis","text":"This is a great base for a banana split I feel like after steep it could still use more chocolate for my tastes but still a great base to work upon to get what you want if you looking for a good banana split recipe. "},{"user":"Ninhalo5","text":"Not bad at all, I SnV'd this right after mixing it and I'm tasting a light banana flavor on the inhale. On the exhale, I'm getting a chocolate covered strawberry. I am one of those that has trouble tasting strawberry but, no issues here on that, this is one of the only mixes I've done where I can actually taste strawberry. I think my favorite part is actually the after taste. To me the after taste is that of the carton of Friendlys banana split minus the walnuts. I'm gonna let it sit for a couple days and see how it turns out."},{"user":"sturno","text":""}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"17646","name":"Banana Split"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
