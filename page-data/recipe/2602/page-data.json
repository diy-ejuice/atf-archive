I enjoy it and my friends enjoy it.\r\n\r\nI give you BB-8, the recipe that tries very hard to be a mango lassi and tastes like the feeling you get when you watch BB-8 roll around in The Force Awakens.\r\n\r\nCoconut/Cream/Yogurt - Lactones/cold cream/yogurt. CAP Creamy yogurt didn't have enough tang to not be Yoplait, so Greek Yogurt is there to support. It's still not very tangy but it's not supposed to be.\r\n\r\nMango/Sweet Mango/Dragon Fruit - percentages from /u/bigted209's \"The Mango!\". I lieu of INW Mango, I tried INW Dragon Fruit and that filled the top note tropical hole which TPA and CAP mangos leave behind. Nice.\r\n\r\nCardamom - Gotta have that cardamom. /u/CheebaSteeba says it's overpowering even at 0.0something. Someone somewhere said that that could be because of INW Mango. If you're scared of cardamom, omit it or try at ridiculously low percentages. You? You like it at 0.25% or lower.\r\n\r\nSweetener (Kinda optional) - TPA Sweetener is 5% sucralose, 5% maltol, and it does fit in here, because there's nothing fruity/sugary sweet in here otherwise. CAP Sweet Mango is sweet, but it's only that over-ripe thick sweetness. You need a bit of sugar. Maltol can give a bit of jammy sweetness, which doesn't bother me but I could live without it. Can be replaced with your favorite sweetener. I'm guessing CAP Super Sweet at 0.25-0.5 would be perfect.\r\n\r\nI like numbers.","steep_days":"2","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T09:43:01.000-05:00","best_vg":"75%","views":"1965","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Cardamom","vendor":"FA","millipercent":250},{"name":"Coconut","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":500},{"name":"Creamy Yogurt","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Dragon Fruit - Pitaya","vendor":"INW","millipercent":200},{"name":"Mango","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Sweet Mango","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":3500},{"name":"Sweetener","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Cream","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Greek Yogurt","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2000}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"2602","name":"BB-8"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
