It vapes a bit throaty for me. Might not be the same for everyone, but CAP Sweet Tangerine is a little rough for me by itself and there’s nothing here to mitigate it. This is my first experience with using WF Coconut Rum and I think it might even be exacerbating it. The coconut and rum flavor here is nice, very Parrot Bay-ish, but I wish it had some cream or some of a creamier coconut for more of a coconut milk flavor. I get the sweet pink of the grenadine the day after mixing it, but I know that stuff is prone to fading really badly, so I would have tried to find something else to fill that role. Finally, that wasn’t enough Polar Blast to do much of anything for me, cooling wise. Just like with Tangerine being throaty for me and not for others, people have really different perceptions and tolerance levels for cooling but I think my relationship with cooling is about average and it’s barely perceptible here, like not even worth digging out the Polar Blast.
