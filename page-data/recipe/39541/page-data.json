It's a hard profile to nail since there are so few flavors out there that don't taste like burning rubber.  FA Tiramisu, Espresso, Cappuccino, Cocoa were my favs, but are super concentrated and tend to taste burnt at higher temps. Ive since moved on to fruits and desserts and haven't touched coffees for a while until FA Up was released.  This is my take on a frilly toffee flavored coffee drink with a splash of ameretto.
