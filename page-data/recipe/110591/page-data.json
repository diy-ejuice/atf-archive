Yeah, I guess I'm bringing it back.\r\n\r\nAnyway, I'm not gonna do a super in depth breakdown of this, because it's pretty obvious how it works, but I'll do a proper flavour note documentation on reddit here in a little bit. This is just what it seems to be, a slightly tart and bright strawberry recipe. I was initially going for a candied strawberry soda profile, but it wasn't working out, so I went for a more tart strawberry, and that worked nicely. I'll post both of these, because I did a version that works really nicely in pod devices as well. Enjoy.","steep_days":"2 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"total_reviews":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T22:33:01.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"2184","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Sour Apple","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Sweet Strawberry","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":2250},{"name":"Red Touch (strawberry)","vendor":"FA","millipercent":2750},{"name":"Fizzy Sherbet","vendor":"VT","millipercent":1500}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"110591","name":"SIHTSTRII,IFIWPSTPEO"}}}
