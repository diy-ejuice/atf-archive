"},{"user":"McFly","score":"5","text":"I have to say, great simple shake n vape. The ripe strawberry hits hard right after you mix it, but eases after a few puffs. The cheesecake is perfectly balanced and the choice in using FW vbic was a smart one; doesn't weigh down your palate as much as its counterparts.  This is very close to the original and the only strawberry vape that I've ever made a second bottle of. Good job.
