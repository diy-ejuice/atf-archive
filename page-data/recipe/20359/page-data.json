I borrowed @matthewkocanda 's milkshake base, subbed in Malted Milk instead of TFA Cheesecake Graham Crust because it doesn't work for me.  But what inspired me to go through with it was FLV Strawberry.  When i first smelled and then back-of-the-hand tasted that flavor I couldn't imagine what the heck FLV was thinking.  But it turns out to be the floral, seedy note of a strawberry.  Just what you'd expect to find a bit of when you blend an entire strawberry in a milkshake.  It really gives an authenticity to this recipe that I've never experienced before.  Banana is optional, but of all the bananas I tried, I found this one to complement best.","steep_days":"1 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-02T07:30:29.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"1200","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Strawberry Sweet","flavor_id":"4745","vendor":"JF","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Strawberry","flavor_id":"626","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":750},{"name":"Strawberry","flavor_id":"272","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Vanilla Bean Ice Cream","flavor_id":"186","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Malted Milk (conc)","flavor_id":"175","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Vienna Cream","flavor_id":"516","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Vanilla Cupcake","flavor_id":"129","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Banana Cream","flavor_id":"916","vendor":"LA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Sweetener","flavor_id":"339","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":500}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"20359","name":"Charlene"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
