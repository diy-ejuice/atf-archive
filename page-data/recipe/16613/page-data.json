It's a fruity, cider type of drink. But I eventually evolved it and aimed for a creamy honeysuckle and lemon on the inhale, with a strawberry/apple back note. CDS adds some spice, which seems to play nice with the profile. \r\n\r\nIt's a very Fall type recipe, and reminds me of a creamy honey/citrus tea with fruit and spices thrown into the mix. \r\n\r\nHoneysuckle/lemon Sicily: Serving as the main note. It's an odd profile, but one that quickly grew on me. You'll get the play between these two on the inhale. Honeysuckle adds some earthiness to it. Lemon Sicily works since I didn't want a candied lemon, but more of an authentic taste. These are really strong to me, so I kept them low to account for that.\r\n\r\nVanilla Bourbon: Acting as a binding agent for the flavors, and I like its stronger vanilla flavor and very light, sweet back notes. 2 keeps it low enough as to not overwhelm the recipe.\r\n\r\nStrawberry Ripe: I kept it low for a light strawberry taste, and to pull out some sweetness. I have trouble tasting this flavor without strawberry support, so 3% doesn't overwhelm the recipe, and adds a little fruit on the exhale.\r\n\r\nFuji: Similar to the strawberry, it's serving as a background note. It shows up a bit on the inhale and exhale.\r\n\r\nCDS: I kept this at .5 to pull the cinnamon out and add a little spice to the mix. The pastry element only shows up after a week or so long steep, but is so low that it only seems to add a bit of body.
