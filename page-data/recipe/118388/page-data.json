The essence of this picture inspired me to work with earth notes and the different colors on the leaves inspired me to use FA 7Leaves and I also was inspired to used FA Glory because of it's strong nutty tobacco notes. and Native Tobacco from FLV to intensify the tobacco note. To me the fall represents a lot of fragrances and aromas that are rich and deep and earthy. In the fall we also have the harvest of pumpkins, gourds, yams, Taro and other roots.  In a sense i wanted to present to you a very nice aromatic fall fragranced tobacco. \r\nGlory and 7Leaves are my tobaccos of choice I used a small amount of FLV pumpkin bread to incorporate a tiny bit of anise and a little bit of a spice note accented the pumpkin with a little bit of Taro for its aromatic and semi dry properties. Toasted Almond is in this mix to tone down a little bit of the peanut notes in Glory and accent some of the other nuts in the tobacco. finally I added cheesecake from FA for the smooth finish and a bit of mouth feel that rounds out all the edges in the mix. This mix will surprise you. Its aromatic, Its pumpkin and its definitely a very smooth silky tobacco. Strong enough for a POd yet smooth enough for a dripper.
