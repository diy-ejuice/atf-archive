Using the three basket ingredients the Cap Cinnamon Danish Swirl with the JF Fuji and JF Yellow Cake gives you that right out of the wrapper freshness of a vending machine cake. The last Basket ingredient TPA Strawberry (Ripe) adds the sweet sugary goodness needed. I added Cap Vanilla Custard v1 to complete the JF Yellow Cake to give it that egg custard taste and lastly adding Cap Vanilla Whipped cream to give that vape the feeling of drinking a glass of milk with your cake at break! Works as a shake and vape but the flavor starts to blend better and better with time!","steep_days":"0","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"total_reviews":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-02T07:37:36.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"984","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Cinnamon Danish Swirl","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1250},{"name":"Fuji","vendor":"JF","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Strawberry (ripe)","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Vanilla Custard","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Vanilla Whipped Cream","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Yellow Cake","vendor":"JF","millipercent":5000}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"17443","name":"Vending machine cake"}}}
