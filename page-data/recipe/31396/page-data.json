I wanted to create a recipe with only flavors that most people already have, as a kind of challenge. This started a brainstorming session in which i stared at my collection on ATF, looking at the number of recipes that the flavors i had were in. I wrote a short list of flavors that were used in over 3000 recipes on ATF, the \"MVPs\", at the most commonly used percentage and narrowed it down (after a small amount of adjusting) to this final form:\r\nTFA Strawberry Ripe: 4%\r\nTFA Vanilla Bean Ice Cream: 3%\r\nCAP Vanilla Custard v1: 3%\r\nCAP Sugar Cookie: 3%\r\nFA Fresh Cream: 1%\r\nFA Meringue: 1%\r\nSo the notes on this are less of a \"what i was going for\" and more of a \"what had happened was...\" so here it goes:\r\nI mixed this at 70/30 VG(ECX)/PG(Essential Depot), with 5mg/ml nic (ECX 100% VG), and steeped it for two weeks.\r\nThis tastes like straight up delicious strawberry shortcake ice cream, with a hint of sugary milk from the bottom of a bowl of crunchberries. the Vanilla Custard gives its rich mouthfeel, the Sugar Cookie becomes shortbread chunks, the ice cream does its job as advertised, and the Ripe Strawberry works like a charm. None of that should come as much of a surprise, as you already have and use these flavors often. Fresh Cream and Meringue do an excellent job as accents here; boosting milkiness and sweetness respectively.\r\nI hope this gives other people ideas on how to \"mix outside the box.\"\r\nAt the end of the day this is just a run-of-the-mill strawberries and cream, but what surprised me most is that developing a recipe in this odd fashion actually yielded a delicious recipe! I know you all have these flavors, so mix this up and tell me what you think!","steep_days":"14","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-06T20:42:03.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"2419","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Vanilla Custard","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Vanilla Bean Ice Cream","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Sugar Cookie","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Strawberry (ripe)","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Cream Fresh","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Meringue","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"31396","name":"ATF MVP"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
