I’ve been really stuck on lemon lately. Can’t vape anything else. So I figured I’d find what can be added to it! So I decided on black berry But it didn’t blend. Blood orange being citrus yet closer to black Berry also so it is a good correlating note for this recipe which  got my top and supporting notes all the way fermented with each other. For my base I choose deep fried sweet pastry dough and biscuit finally I brought in fw yogurt to draw everything in tighter and give a smoother exhale.
