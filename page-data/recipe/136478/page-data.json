It is a coconut glutinous rice dumpling, traditionally filled with coconut and mung bean paste, wrapped into rice flour and coconut milk, and rolled into shredded coconut.\r\n\r\nFE Sweet Rice/Cap Horchata/VT Rice Base/FA Jammy/Candy Wizzard combine to form the glutinous rice made of rice flour and coconut milk. I updated the CAP Jelly Candy to FA Jammy/Candy Wizzard because the CAP flavoring has a fruity gummy taste that I don't want in my rice base.\r\n\r\nWF Coconut Custard/VT Red Bean I'm using to make the filling, I'm hoping that the texture will be authentic even if Azuki red beans taste different to mung beans. The mung bean filling is the same that you would find in moon cakes and it is made with split mung beans, coconut milk, brown sugar, and some starch. Fingers crossed.\r\n\r\nFLV Sweet Coconut/FA Coco come together for a really smooth and rounded real coconut.\r\n\r\nVT Desiccated Coconut is pretty handy for rolling my dumpling into shredded coconut as it would be at the pastry shop in Hong Kong \r\n\r\nCap Super Sweet is not an obligation, but I added it here to cut short the steeping time for WF Coconut Custard and CAP Horchata.\r\n\r\nA few notes:\r\n1) FE Sweet Rice will fade pretty quickly, but adding 1% of FA Coco to it will slow that down significantly. Whatever rice flavor profile you're after, that is a neat trick to use! (thank you @Shyndo)\r\n2) CAP Horchata has a lovely rice roughness texture, but it also has some cinnamon in it which is not part of the profile in this recipe. I decided that the texture was more important.\r\n3) This treat is supposed to be eaten warm so don't hesitate to use higher wattages.\r\n\r\nI love coconut and exotic fruits in general, and this mix turned out really nice right off the shake even if it got fairyfied!\r\n\r\nEnjoy, be queer & vape on!\r\n\r\n[Photo Credits: www.jujube-en-cuisine.fr ]","steep_days":"3 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-06T22:03:11.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"1562","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Sweet Coconut","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Coco' (coconut)","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Horchata","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Sweet Rice","vendor":"FE","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Jammy/Candy Wizard","vendor":"FA","millipercent":250},{"name":"Rice Base","vendor":"VT","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Coconut Custard SC","vendor":"WF","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Super Sweet","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":250},{"name":"Red Bean","vendor":"VT","millipercent":750},{"name":"Dessicated Coconut","vendor":"VT","millipercent":1000}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"136478","name":"Mother of Pearls (Coconut Glutinous Rice Dumpling)"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
