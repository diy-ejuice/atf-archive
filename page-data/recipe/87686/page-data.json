Shisha / Hookah lovers should definitely try this recipe. If you don't have FLV Red Burley, you can sub by FLV Kentucky or Cured Tobacco.\r\nThe FA apricot - oakwood adds warmth to the recipe and the FLV Marshmallow fluffins it all up.\r\nCAP Yellow peach is leading fruit here.\r\nSweeten to your own liking. You can S&V but waiting a good week is better.\r\n\r\nEnjoy and any comment is welcome.\r\nScrewdriver","steep_days":"10 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"total_reviews":null,"updated_at":"2020-11-26T11:55:21.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"785","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Red Burley","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Oak Wood","vendor":"FA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Armenia (apricot)","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Apple Pie","vendor":"FA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Yellow Peach","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":5000},{"name":"Marshmallow","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Super Sweet","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":500}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"87686","name":"Screwed peach smokeypie"}}}
