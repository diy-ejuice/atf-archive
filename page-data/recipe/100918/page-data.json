So way back I vaped NAKED Green Blast and all I tasted was Honeydew. Like most commercial juice it left a lot to be desired. After looking at the profile I was inspired to come up with something that I think is completely refreshing, unique, and a rad balanced green leitmotif. Some say it tastes like the Airheads Mystery flavor. I just think it's delicious.\r\n\r\nTFA Cucumber is just a fun flavor that I think doesn't get the attention it deserves.  I really haven't been much for melon vapes but I dig this flavor. I find it brings a melon like flavor that is as cucumber refreshing as it is different. This stuff is pretty strong and the front man at 2.75%. No subs are possible here.\r\n\r\nFA Kiwi at 1% and FW Kiwi at 2% was the preferred candy to realistic juicy kiwi balance I liked the best.  If you only have FA go 2%. If you only have FW go 4%. Either of these will turn out tasty without completely butchering the concoction so have at it. Although, I think they are both great concentrates and worth owning. \r\n\r\nFA Apple Fuji adds a great crisp apple to pretty much complete the main popping green fruit trifecta at 2.5%. JF and Cap probably work here at an equivalent strength but personally, I never felt the need to try them so YMMV. \r\n\r\nFA Pear at .5% is just here to add some sweet juicy love without being intrusive on the overall pop of the profile while maintaining the all green motif.\r\n\r\nAlthough I like this fruit profile alone... adding FW Yogurt just completes it and gives this an amazing finish.  At 3.75% the fruits still pop but that finish is just too lovely to go without. \r\n\r\nOptions: As always, sweeten to your liking. Cap SS is my preferred sweetener depending on the mood at .2-.3%. You can use 2x more FW Sweetener to equal it. I don't recommend TFA because of the added maltol. I add my 10% PG Erythritol solution at 1.5% because I like what it brings to the fruit and the cream.  For all you cool heads add some WS-23 if that is your gig.\r\n\r\nBuck NAKED on a Big Wheel and feel the breeze... You're buck NAKED on a Big Wheel but it's no Green Machine!\r\n","steep_days":"5 (SNV)","temperature":"420","recipe_score":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-12T00:41:19.000-05:00","best_vg":"75%","views":"998","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Cucumber","flavor_id":"225","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2750},{"name":"Kiwi","flavor_id":"522","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Kiwi","flavor_id":"1330","vendor":"FW","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Pear","flavor_id":"411","vendor":"FA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Yogurt","flavor_id":"1471","vendor":"FW","millipercent":3750},{"name":"Apple Fuji","flavor_id":"4886","vendor":"FA","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Super Sweet","flavor_id":"2384","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":250}],"reviews":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"100918","name":"Green Machine"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
