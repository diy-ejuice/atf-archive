ENJOY! \r\n\r\nPs: Super Sweet is not necessary but i like it really sweet.","steep_days":"15 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":3,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T23:38:07.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"2030","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Kentucky Bourbon","flavor_id":"361","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Toasted Marshmallow","flavor_id":"340","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Super Sweet","flavor_id":"2384","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":500}],"reviews":[{"user":"YippYo","text":"Not a bad mix but it definitely has a noticeable 'bourbon' funk to it.
