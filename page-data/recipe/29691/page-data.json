I used banana cream pie and quince for my main profile of my banana flavor. I made the pie crust with fa apple  pie and fa cookie. I made my  creaminess  with a combination I use quite a lot it's 1% of fa meringue and fa Vienna cream and cream freshh or just works. Then I added shisha vanilla because it helps out all the aspects of this recipe. Give it a try we enjoy this in my household.","steep_days":"5","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T12:45:37.000-05:00","best_vg":"75%","views":"2866","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Banana Cream","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":4500},{"name":"Quince","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Apple Pie","vendor":"FA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Cookie","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Meringue","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Vienna Cream","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Cream Fresh","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Shisha Vanilla","vendor":"INW","millipercent":1500}],"reviews":[{"user":"cxxxxp","text":"Oooh, I've got a good feeling about this one TT, I was just smelling the flavours one after the next as  I was mixing this and if Quince had no label, I'd be thinking it was banana based on smell.
