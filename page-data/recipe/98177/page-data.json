V2 is the current version. FLV Cream works very nicely along side TPA Honeysuckle & Shisha Vanilla. I wanted a strongish vanilla note so i pair INW Shisha Vanilla with INW Vanilla for PIpe. I used INW Gold Ducat for its toasty nutty tobacco (which can taste an awful lot like sun tan lotion if used to high). I used FLV Cured because it generally fits in any tobacco in my opinion.","steep_days":"7","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:50:07.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"2218","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Cured Tobacco","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":500},{"name":"Gold Ducat","vendor":"INW","millipercent":1200},{"name":"Classic For Pipe Dark","vendor":"INW","millipercent":1250},{"name":"Honeysuckle (pg)","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Vanilla For Pipe","vendor":"INW","millipercent":750},{"name":"Shisha Vanilla","vendor":"INW","millipercent":500},{"name":"Cream","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1000}],"reviews":[{"user":"Seakow","text":"I'll be honest here, I made this and forgot about it for about two months. My fianc√©e was looking for something to vape the other day and she asked about this juice. For some reason I thought it was a honeysuckle macaroon. I came back to make her another bottle and now I'm confused as hell. She really enjoyed it and the little bit I got to try before she destroyed the bottle was really good. Looking forward to trying this again, but fresh."},{"user":"ID10-T","text":"I wasn't so sure about Honeysuckle in a tobacco recipe but this is as beautiful as it is brave and unique. Probably wouldn't have been quite so skeptical if I'd given some thought to the strong vanilla in here -that seems to be what holds it all together. That Honeysuckle-Shisha Vanilla combo on top is so good and backing it up with a little Cream and Vanilla for Pipe seems genius. The intricate, deep, and a little toasty but not-too-dark pipe tobacco fits with that combo so harmoniously that nothing seems remotely out of place. It finishes smooth and creamy, not dry, but not soggy either. Like a real pipe tobacco creaminess. Just wonderfully balanced all the way around. Bottom line, it tastes like \"Longing Gets Sensuously Felt Up In Super Fancy Tobacco Store,\"  so obviously I'm totally in love with this mix,  despite (or maybe because of) the bittersweet memories it conjures. Disclaimer: I accidentally let it steep for like two months, so if you try it earlier, YMMV. But, HOT DAMN that is some good suckle-bacco!
