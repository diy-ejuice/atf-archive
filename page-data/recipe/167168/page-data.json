Do you think I could substitute (MB) Soft Banana and (FLV) Vanilla Pudding at a 2:1 ratio?  I also have (TPA) Banana Nut Bread but I think that would change the profile of the original recipe?  I'm new so don't laugh.  ðŸ˜‰. I had good results using all three in a recipe by Folkart earlier so know the Soft Banana and Vanilla Pudding will be a creamy yum note! ","score":4},{"user":"bjorama","text":"Mixed this up and tried it at the 5 day recommended steep.  Did not really care for it.  I could taste the butterscotch and banana but it wasn't doing it for me.  Came back to it after going through some of the full bottle test mixes I had laying around  and tried it again.  Absolutely delicious.  The longer this steeps the better in my book.  Everything blends so well.  Perfect at 2 months.","score":5},{"user":"UnappreciatedRobot","text":"I was never so excited to try something I never even thought I wanted. Everything came together perfectly for this mix.","score":5},{"user":"TheJuiceJackBuilt","text":"Really enjoying this. Creamy nana butterscotch. Well done lads. ","score":5},{"user":"kitu5","text":"You had me at butterscotch and ice cream. What I didn't expect was how much I'd love the banana in this. It rides the fine line between actual fruit and full blown candy banana, and does it extremely well. This is a fully flavored and utterly delicious vape. I've wrecked 30 mls of this stuff in a week, which usually only occurs when I can't wick properly. Fantastic stuff. For what was developed as a \"Beginner's Week\" flavor, just...good right out of the shake, and better after about 3 days. At a week, assuming it lives that long, it's just fantastic.&#xD;\n&#xD;\nAnother banger from the brain trust!","score":5}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"167168","name":"Butterscotch Banana Ice Cream | BMW | Developed"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
