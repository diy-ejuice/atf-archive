Garnish with a twist of INW Lemon Mix and an FLV Basil leaf. Cheers!  \r\n\r\nBig thanks to @Tamberina for encouraging words after trying an unfinished version of this, @ConcreteRiver for pointing me in the direction of FW Martini and helping to finalize the recipe, and @MattDGTL for turning Mr. Gibson into a Pickle.

Then, right as I was about to order, THIS recipe pops up. So, HAD to try it, even if it made me have to wait a month longer to be able to afford everything in one fell swoop. I figured at the worst, Hey, I'll have martini fixings.&#xD;\n&#xD;\nI'm gonna quote @ConcreteRiver here from his Pickle Rick review. \"If you would like to vape pickles, then this is about as good as it's going to get, barring a great leap forward in pickle vape technology.\"&#xD;\n&#xD;\nWe have our leap.&#xD;\n&#xD;\nThis is an excellent martini, with the just right amount of pickle to say \"Hi. I'm a pickletini\". The onion from this particular pickle makes it into a damned good Gibson. Went on a kick for those a few years back. The gin and martini flavors just add the right amount of sweetness that'd make me kiss my bartender, or at least leave one hell of a tip. The lemon on top of it makes this truly epic. The basil garnish is inspired, man.&#xD;\n &#xD;\nIs this an ADV? Hell no. Am I gonna be vaping this one all day today, if just to share with my friends? Hell yes.&#xD;\n&#xD;\nIs this a vape you absolutely owe it to yourself to try for the novelty factor, and also have the makings for a damned fine martini in and of itself?&#xD;\n&#xD;\nDamned straight.&#xD;\n&#xD;\nGood on ya, ID10-T. This is stellar. My liver is squeeing with joy here."}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"66029","name":"Pickle Gibson"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
