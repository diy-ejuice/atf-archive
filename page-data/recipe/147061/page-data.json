I didn't know any better but I loved it anyways.  Pralines and Cream and FW Butterscotch became my favorite single flavors to vape.  This mix came from the gut as most of my mixes do and I've learned to write them down. Sweet, nutty, rich , and creamy.  Takes me back to the Good O'le Vaping days of 2013.  When Provaris cost 300 bucks and you just had to have one. Just before the crazy eyed sweaty son of the Vape Shop owner was wrapping 32 gauge Kanthal free hand around some silica wick and telling me how great it was.  And sure enough I'd find myself fumbling around and having to go ask sweat kid to help me.  Trying to reach that \"perfect vape\" experience.  Anyways...  This one is really nice after the shake and I don't like most recipes off the shake.  Went back and added a bit of Super Sweet to make the creamy stand out.  Feel free to leave out or sub for your liking.","steep_days":"10 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"total_reviews":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T02:17:02.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"1160","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Pralines & Cream","vendor":"FW","millipercent":7000},{"name":"Ry4 Double","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Caramel Candy","vendor":"FW","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Cake (yellow)","vendor":"FW","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Bavarian Cream","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Super Sweet","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":500}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"147061","name":"Pretty Pralines All in a Row"}}}
