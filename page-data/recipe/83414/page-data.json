The Zen Garden is optional here, recipe works well without it, but if you like a touch of spring green to your vape, you may enjoy it. I prefer FW Sweetener if I'm using sucralose, however you can replace it with whatever else you prefer. \r\n\r\nIf you'd like to participate in the Year of Mixing find the Flavor-Pro group and join us for our weekly challenge - all mixers welcome - and there will be some prizes.
