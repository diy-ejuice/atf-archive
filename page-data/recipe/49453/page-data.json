This recipe is my take on a dessert that is decidedly Floridian, a Key Lime Pie. This is a simple recipe, one that I was working on for a friend. I think it may need a little bit more key lime, but right now it's pretty good. This is definitely one of my better recipes, in my opinion. The CAP New York Cheesecake was not my first choice for the \"filler\" of this recipe, but it provides a really nice base for the FA Florida Key Lime to sit on.
