I figured it would be fitting to name this recipe after her since well, my Nonnie is a bit nuts. This recipe is more of a whipped up creamy peanut butter pie with a thin cookie graham crust. Due to the creams, tuck it away a few weeks to \"steep\".\r\n&nbsp;\r\n**Cookie Butter (FW) 1.75% / Graham Cracker Clear (TPA) 2%:**\r\nI didn't want a generic graham cracker crust. I wanted something to compliment the peanut butter a bit more so went the cookie butter route. This cookie butter smells delicious, however its still a bit lacking so I couldn't use it outright. It needs the graham cracker to fill in a bit on the spices and crunch.\r\n&nbsp;\r\n**Peanut Butter (FW) 2% / Peanut Butter Cup (FW) 3.25%:**\r\nHave you ever had Justin's salted peanut butter or their peanut butter cups? Well that's what I am reminded of when I taste these. The Peanut Butter flavor has a nice roasted and lightly salted taste to it, where as the pb cup is sweet, creamy, and has a hint of milk chocolate to it. I would have used the PB Cup only but it was too sweet and needed a roasted nut to balance it out more and act as the grated flecks of peanut on top of the pie in the picture. \r\n&nbsp;\r\n**Italian Cream (HS) 1% / Bavarian Cream (TPA) 2% / Vanilla Custard (CAP) 2%:**\r\nSo I made several versions of this using different combinations of creams. I avoided cheesecake cause I recently made a cheesecake recipe and I want to branch out and work on improving my cream skills a bit more. I have never actually used Italian Cream in any recipes of my own before so I decided since my Nonnie is Italian, it was fitting. To be honest, I have no clue why this combo of creams is working so damn well but it is. I don't get any weird off notes even with only a week and a half of steeping but I am digging it a lot. \r\n&nbsp;\r\nAs its steeping, I am noticing the creams are taking over the mix a lot more but they are blending nicely with the PB. At shake and vape its definitely a lot more PB than I am looking for so I am happy its mellowing out as it steeps. The crust is present but not overwhelmingly so to turn this into a full on bakery flavor. I decided to not add any whipped cream  topping to this mix because when I did, it came out tasting like peanut butter lucky charms if that's even a thing. I recommend giving it at least 2 weeks to steep. To all you peanut butter fans out there, hope you enjoy!","steep_days":"21","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"total_reviews":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T19:15:29.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"1775","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Cookie Butter","vendor":"FW","millipercent":1750},{"name":"Peanut Butter","vendor":"FW","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Peanut Butter Cup","vendor":"FW","millipercent":3250},{"name":"Graham Cracker Clear","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Italian Cream","vendor":"HS","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Bavarian Cream","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Vanilla Custard","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":2000}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"94932","name":"ExclusiveGirl's Nonnie's a Nutty Pie #MixinVixens"}}}
