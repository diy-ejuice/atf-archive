An absolute banger this an has a load of potential in desserts ! \r\nNever seen it in a mix but its well worth getting in my opinion \r\nFew notes on the recipe\r\nBELGIUM WAFFLE LB- super good rich, dark almost a chocolatey note in the back ground with a hint of maple an butter! Miles better than the TPA or CAPs versions its nice an sweet an rich without being sickly or over powering !\r\nSTRAWBERRY SWEET/RIPE CAP/TPA - Straight forward enough not looking for a candy/sweety kinda strawberry so stuck with the old combo\r\n\r\nVANILLA BEAN ICE CREAM TPA AN LB - Ive been splitting up my 4% ice cream with 50/50 TPA an LB as i find LBs is super creamy an adds something more to the recipe than standalone TPA ! But add to much an it can get a bit too rich so a few % of each really plays nice i think\r\n\r\nVIENNA CREAM FA - Just adds that rich notes an brings the waffles an ice cream together for a nice silky smooth taste\r\n\r\nSucralose is optional as i dont think it needs a huge amount as its fairly sweet anyway\r\nFound its good after a few days an just gets better an better ","steep_days":"0","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"total_reviews":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-06T20:38:11.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"3044","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Belgian Waffle","vendor":"LB","millipercent":5000},{"name":"Strawberry (ripe)","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Sweet Strawberry","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Vienna Cream","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Vanilla Bean Ice Cream","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"sweetener (sucralose)","vendor":"OTHR","millipercent":750},{"name":"Vanilla Ice Cream","vendor":"LB","millipercent":2000}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"17577","name":"STRAWBERRY TOPPED WAFFLES WITH ICE CREAM "}}}
