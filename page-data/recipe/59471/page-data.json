This is a slightly spiced pipe tobacco. I get hints of cherry, and it is also slightly sweet. This used, even at .2%, gives a nice complexity and almost fills the empty spots that shade/cured needs. It also adds some complexity to the mix\r\n\r\nShade: I was turned on to shade due to the good \"cigar wrapper leaf flavor\". Thank you @fear!!!! This has a few notes to it, which don't come through in this mix as much due to the lime/coconut pairing. It gives some complexity to the mix but also helps build the cigar.\r\n\r\nCured: This is a good cigar type tobacco. A good base to build on\r\n\r\nLime Wedge: Toned down compared to lime. You get a tad more twang, more natural lime flavor with a slight bit of rind. The rind is hidden so only the natural lime flavor comes through. Pairs with coconut very well.\r\n\r\nCoconut: used over sweet coconut because I wasn't looking for a super sweet tobacco. This coconut is also a little more natural. Similar to the lightly sweetened meat in the coconut, almost slightly toasted. It pairs well with the natural lime wedge.\r\n\r\nThe lime has a tendency to fade. I recommend this to be vaped within a week. If you are gonna let it steep add another .2 or .4 of it and then let it sit for a while, as the line will be over powering in the beginning.","steep_days":"1 (SNV)","temperature":"400","recipe_score":5,"total_reviews":1,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:49:32.000-05:00","best_vg":"65%","views":"2080","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Cavendish","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":200},{"name":"Connecticut Shade","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":600},{"name":"Cured Tobacco","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1400},{"name":"Lime Wedge","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":600},{"name":"Coconut","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":800}],"reviews":[{"user":"Freshepies","score":"5","text":"The fact that I enjoyed this vape was a complete surprise.
