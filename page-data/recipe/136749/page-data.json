TFA Sweet tea is a very good tea flavor but very weak so I needed the high % to make it show. I used a combo of bumbleberry by wf and the new strawberry gummy candy for the main note. the bit of sticky texture from the strawberry gummy candy is great to give this tea a thicker, more syrupy feeling. flv lemon tea backs up the sweet tea and brings in the bit of lemon to make the berries pop.","steep_days":"3 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"total_reviews":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-06T20:51:30.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"1384","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Bumbleberry SC","vendor":"WF","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Lemon Tea","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Strawberry Gummy Candy SC","vendor":"WF","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Sweet Tea","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":11000},{"name":"Super Sweet","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":500}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"136749","name":"mlNikon's Berry Tea"}}}
