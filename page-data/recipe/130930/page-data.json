I accidentally deleted the first one trying this again. I wanted to make a liquid  that reminds me of a drink I had in Singapore. The profile I'm going for is a cold lychee coconut shake with a hint of strawberry\r\n\r\nHoneysuckle is there to support Sweet Lychee on the back end. May try a mix of other lychee concentrates.\r\n\r\nHad a tough time deciding with the coconut mix. Originally had FA Coco mixed with TPA Coconut Candy but Coco dies down on the steep. Sweet Cream's cheesy note helps prop up the coconut flavor and creaminess.\r\n\r\nPomelo is there for overall brightness. Per usual Koolada is optional\r\n\r\n","steep_days":"1 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-06T20:44:28.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"912","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Sweet Lychee","flavor_id":"119","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":6000},{"name":"Pomelo","flavor_id":"8576","vendor":"PUR","millipercent":500},{"name":"Sweet Cream","flavor_id":"117","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Sweet Strawberry Rf","flavor_id":"122","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Coconut Candy","flavor_id":"223","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Strawberry (ripe)","flavor_id":"271","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Honeysuckle (pg)","flavor_id":"306","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Koolada 10 Pg","flavor_id":"280","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":250}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"130930","name":"Winter 2016 in Singapore Redux"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
