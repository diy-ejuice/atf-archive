Caramel and butterscotch meld with the buttercream and torrone to form a warm gooey center. The joy provides a sweet sprinkled sugar coating similar to a funnel cake and combines with the cream base to replicate a fresh baked cookie.

I add 0.2% FLV Butterscotch which brings out the caramel a fraction more&#xD;\n&#xD;\nI also have a bright side of the cookie version. Subbed butterscotch ripple for 1.5% INW Shisha Strawberry, plus 0.5% VZ Gourmet Strawberry. Leave out the FLV Butterscotch this time. Try it!
