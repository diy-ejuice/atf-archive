Kind of. Ish. Sadly I was out of any lemons. It works pretty nicely, and will probably be nicer with the addition of some Koolada. It's still in testing, but have at it.\r\n\r\nGrape Juice\r\nThis is an annoyingly weak concentrate, but I fancied working with it, and trying to get to work is a nightmare. @ 5% it stands up as the main note without overshadowing any of the supporting flavourings. This is going to be substituted for INW Grape in the next batch, in the hope that that'll lend itself more to the flavour profile.\r\n\r\nCitrus Punch/Oba Oba\r\nSeeing as I was waiting on some lemon to come through the post box, I went down the citrus line. Citrus Punch also helps with drawing out, and adding a sense of fizz to the grape, and the Oba Oba was used to accentuate the tang\r\n\r\nWatermelon\r\nThis serves two purposes: I personally feel in this context it fills out the body of the grape, thanks without actually adding a huge amount of flavour, and its refreshing nature adds to the soda-y vibe, and the juice overall\r\n\r\n\r\nChanges:\r\nAs Mentioned above, INW Grape is getting subbed in in the next batch, and I'm going to try it out with a hint INW Raspberry as well in the hope that it'll feel out the body better than the watermelon and add a little more natural sweetness/tang.\r\nKoolada 10% would also make this a more enjoyable and refreshing vape as well. I'll play with some percentages and adjust the recipe accordingly.","steep_days":"5 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T12:46:16.000-05:00","best_vg":"60%","views":"1167","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Citrus Punch","flavor_id":"348","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Grape Juice","flavor_id":"231","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":5000},{"name":"Oba Oba","flavor_id":"480","vendor":"FA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Watermelon","flavor_id":"616","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Sweetener","flavor_id":"339","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1000}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"66167","name":"Gangrene "}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
