Its flat out delicious. Flavorah Grape is perfect for this recipe and I don't think you can substitute it without changing the entire dynamic of the recipe. I use 2 percent Flavorah Bubble Gum and 1 percent Inw Bubble Gum YC and it makes a less dry bubble gum than if I were to use Flavorah alone. I added half a percent of FA Marshmallow to give this some extra mouthfeel and body and .35 percent Cap Super Sweet to push teh grape and bubble gum flavors up another knotch. I didnt try it as a SnV, I let it steep 4 days before trying but it may be good off the shake as well. If you give this a try I hope you enjoy it as much as I am right now.","steep_days":"4 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":4,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:50:23.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"1871","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Grape","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Bubble Gum","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Bubble Gum (yc)","vendor":"INW","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Marshmallow","vendor":"FA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Super Sweet","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":350}],"reviews":[{"user":"SatJoe563","text":"As a S&amp;V, the grape is perfect.  I cant taste the gum portion much right now, but will definitely try this again in a few days.  I like the Flv Grape, it is nicely placed.  No throat hit is an added bonus,   Once it steeps, I will make sure to add the final notes.  Thank you for sharing this,"}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"114730","name":"Grape Gadzooka Gum"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
