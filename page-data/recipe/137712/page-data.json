I tasted it on my hand and it might be a tobacco which I think would go fine here too but it is kinda sour too so I am unclear on what it is.  I guess I should single flavor test it huh?  Anyway a bunch of strawberries with a little chocolate and whatever cam blend is and coffee is to back the chocolate as I find they make a good pairing.  Also I couldn't locate my super sweet so not a very sweet combo but i often leave out sweetener.  Not tested yet.  I will give it at least a day steep before doing so.  Then update here.  okay found out it IS a tobacco which should work fine anyway - but it needs a longer steep.  Will update in a few weeks.","steep_days":"28","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T23:37:20.000-05:00","best_vg":"71%","views":"1036","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Organic Strawberry","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Strawberry (ripe)","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2250},{"name":"Juicy Strawberry","vendor":"FA","millipercent":2750},{"name":"Milk & Honey","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Coffee Extra (clear)","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":350},{"name":"Bittersweet Chocolate","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Super Sweet","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":250},{"name":"Cam Blend","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1250}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"137712","name":"Chocolate covered strawberries with tobacco"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
