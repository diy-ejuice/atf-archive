Tasty with morning coffee. This is one of my ADV's and it's designed to be more \"commercial\" with a bold amount of flavor, sort of a similar experience as an RY4. The Red Burley fades a bit after a week or so becoming more of a \"flavoring\" than a \"tobacco flavor\" but falls inline with the dessert like profile and offers just enough of a tobacco note to satiate my love for savory vapes. The Bavarian cream and butterscotch provide a deep, sweet and creamy base which is by design (Maybe too creamy for some.) The hazelnut is not so discernible as it is used to add a bit more creamy and a bit more savory. I use this in my Berserker Mini MTL at anywhere from .4-.8ohms, twisted kanthal or Clapton wire with Cotton Bacon Prime wick and I would assume it would be great in a tank as well. May be too robust for dripping depending on how full flavor you like to vape, but tastes pretty good (to me) out of a Hadaly. This can be a SNV though it benefits greatly from a crockpot steep on warm for a few hours and is best IME 3 days after that, it really helps the Bavarian Cream/Butterscotch bloom underneath everything.
