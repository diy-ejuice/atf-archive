It’s almost Valentine’s Day and you didn’t mix anything up for that special someone. You swore that after last year and the year before that you’d be prepared. You’d have something steeping by mid-January at the latest. Fear not, Dr. Chemical Love has got your back!\r\n\r\nA pretty delicious (so far) shake and vape recipe inspired by this week’s Flavor of the Week on /r/diy_ejuice. It has not been steep tested, but I’m giving it the shake and vape approval. \r\n\r\nI really had to convince myself not to throw some INW Black for Pipe in here. \r\n\r\nThis is mostly a sweet, creamy vanilla with just a hint of some cucumber melon.

Such a delicious mix of flavors from the OG vic, I think you should start an alterego/antihero named chemicalburnperp cause this shit is perpetrating a miasma of mouth euphoria all over my gustatory cortex (and olfactory sense neurons) that can only be described as a consummation of chemical love delivered by yours truly, the Doc. On day 2.5 of vaping, will update if for some reason it really does burn me as it steeps. "}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"88246","name":"What Is Love?"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
