The green tea is a little bit overpowering if you SnV , but if you allowed 36 to 48 hours for the flavors to blend together you will get a nice vape....hope you like it as much as I do! Sweetener is a must for this recipe in my opinion, I used  flv sweetness but you can sub for your sweetener of choice.
