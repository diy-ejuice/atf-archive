It's no fuss. Easy to throw together. Tastes great immediately after making, but gets better with age. This has been a staple of mine for 6 months or so, so I thought I would finally put it up here. It's not complicated but it's incredibly delicious and worthy of being my own personal all day vape.\r\n\r\nYes, the INW Shisha Strawberry is a bit high. This works as low as 1%, but I just find I like it best when I push this flavor to it's upper limits.","steep_days":"1 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":4.8,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:49:50.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"7601","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Ice Cream","flavor_id":"4449","vendor":"HS","millipercent":250},{"name":"Vanilla Bean Ice Cream","flavor_id":"186","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Shisha Strawberry","flavor_id":"1711","vendor":"INW","millipercent":2500}],"reviews":[{"user":"Zugmaschine","text":"Simple &amp; tasty. I made it with 0.5% HS Fench Vanilla Ice Cream. Works also well with 3.5% LB Vanilla ice cream.&#xD;\nThe Strawberry is up front with the right amount of cream at the exhale."},{"user":"Thadentman","text":"When you are really bored with mixing, This is a fantastic recipe until mixers block is over."},{"user":"Jmill157","text":"First recipe Iâ€™ve had where the shisha really popped for me! I like it with .5 HS IC for a little more creamy exhale. Great easy recipe! "},{"user":"Tootall","text":"So I am not a huge fan of shisha strawberry. With that being said I had a faulty bottle of shisha strawberry were the top broke off the plastic bottle now it was close to empty so rather than re bottle it I looked for a couple recipes to mix and review that useshisha strawberry. Being I am not the biggest fan of shisha strawberry I didn't have high expectations for this mix. I mixed this up mainly for my wife and let's just say directly on a shake I mean 2 min after putting the last ingredients in the mix she loves it and I actually do to!!! It just works!! I love how much flavor this mix has yet using such a low percentage of total flavoring. If your reading these reviews to see if you want to mix this STOP READING and fucking mix it already this shit is delicious and simple!!!!!!"},{"user":"6retro6","text":"I mixed this with 0.5% (HS)French Vanilla Icecream as I don't have hs ice cream and it's delicious, better then most over complicated s&amp;c recipes I've tried with far more ingredients, it's my daily driver already.  Needs a couple days of aging with french vanilla imo but can't speek for the og recipe. Brilliant!"},{"user":"CygnusY1","text":""}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"81835","name":"Daily Driver"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
