Inw cactus pushes the wild melon to a oasis of melons. Flv cream and cotton candy give you a smooth cream exhale that is not a thick cream but just right for these hot summer days. Bump up the wild melon to 3% for that extra punch. It can tend to be a bit harsh the first few days so if you do be patient and wait about 3 days. Otherwise mix and vape!","steep_days":"3 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"updated_at":"2020-12-12T18:29:20.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"4633","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Wild Melon","flavor_id":"619","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Cream","flavor_id":"604","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Cotton Candy","flavor_id":"319","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Cactus","flavor_id":"647","vendor":"INW","millipercent":250}],"reviews":[{"user":"JustMixIt","text":"Love this recipe!

Wild Melon is full-flavored without any off notes, a mostly honeydew mix of delicious melons. FLV Cream is the one cream I wouldn't hesitate to mix with melons because it has that creamy feel without really tasting of dairy or vanilla. Fluffed up a bit and sweetened with Cotton Candy it's even better. Cactus 0.25% doesn't always work to just juice things up without making its presence known but it does here.  Altogether, a great, satisfying simple recipe. Thanks for this! I waited five days to try it and can imagine it getting even better if I'd been a little more patient and was wanting more out of the bit of cream, but this is already terrific just the way it is.

One of the few creamy flavors I find to like in this summer heat.","score":5}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"54001","name":"Wild Melon Boba "}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
