Versions included the FLV Red Burley & Kentucky Blend but it distracted form the main profile, so I omitted them for this version.\r\n\r\nThere is not much to say about the undisputed kings of caramel RY4's other than it is just superb as a preambulatory 'tobacco' for novice and veteran mixers alike.  Adding delectable, but subtle, caramel infused RY4 note, it lays the foundation masterfully. This work well with V2 at 8%.\r\n\r\nI'm using my go to caramel/toffee combo in HS Caramel Toffee & VT English Toffee.  A thick and creamy caramel toffee which adds adds oodles of sweetness & richness with no butyric vibes.\r\n\r\nMy faithful custard adds a rich & creamy custard and is fortified with a shot of vanilla, compliments of INW Shisha Vanilla. \r\n\r\nFeel free to add .75 FLV Red Burley to increase the tobacco notes.\r\n \r\nGive this baby 5 days or do to mingle & enjoy!","steep_days":"5","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:51:29.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"913","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"HOLY HOLY GRAIL RY4","vendor":"DFS","millipercent":6000},{"name":"Shisha Vanilla","vendor":"INW","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Caramel Toffee","vendor":"HS","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Custard","vendor":"INW","millipercent":2000},{"name":"English Toffee","vendor":"VT","millipercent":1500}],"reviews":[{"user":"Deftohms","text":"Mixed with .75% red burley as recommended for more of the tobacco note.
