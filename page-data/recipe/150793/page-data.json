This is a bright, citrus jam covered cookie made for the first ever Discord Mixing competition. It utilizes the jammy texture provided by CAP Hibiscus while completely obscuring the flavor. CAP Sugar Cookie is filled out with FA Pistachio and TPA Cheesecake (Graham Crust) to provide an excellent rich cookie base. We hope you enjoy it.\"\r\n\r\nCome join us on Discord! https://discord.gg/ufVTyAQ","steep_days":"1 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"total_reviews":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:50:55.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"1200","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Hibiscus","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Pistacchio (Pistachio)","vendor":"FA","millipercent":250},{"name":"Sugar Cookie","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":5000},{"name":"Sweet Tangerine","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":4500},{"name":"Cheesecake (graham Crust)","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2000}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"150793","name":"Zoe's Crazy Cookies (diy_ejuice discord RED team Mixer Showdown entry)"}}}
