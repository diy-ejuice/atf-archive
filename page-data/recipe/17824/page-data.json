And honestly french dude doesn't taste like french toast anyways lol. \r\n\r\nThe FLV cupcake batter is the key to everything.  I was single flavor testing it and after acouple weeks it started tasting just like waffles with a hint a maple already in it\r\n\r\nThe butter is pretty obvious, I initially had this at 1% and you couldn't notice it was there, at 2% its a perfect hint of butter. \r\n\r\nI added the yellow cake in a second version to give it a little more of the sugary dough flavor that I felt was missing\r\n\r\nFA Maple syrup again is pretty obvious, be warned it is extremely strong.  I had it at .25% and accidentally put an extra drop bring it up to .4 and I actually liked it better there so I kept that odd number.  You can play with this one for your taste of sweetness\r\n\r\nFLV blueberry muffin -  I added to try killing 2 birds with one stone to get more of a cake flavor and add the blueberry, however the blueberry was only a slight hint hence adding the few drops of bilberry really sent it over the top. \r\n\r\nBilberry - like I mentioned above I wasn't getting enough blueberry and added this in the 4th batch to up it just a nudge and this put the blueberry flavor right where it needed to be. \r\n\r\nBelieve it or not, this is actually damn good right away as a shake and vape however if it sits 2-3 weeks it becomes much more complex.  I usually make 2 bottles, one to sit and one to vape on.
