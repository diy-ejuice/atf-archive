The stone of banana its very good and after 1 day( cause i couldnt w8 longer) you have the creams and milky tastes of the concentrates that gives you as a result the ice cream taste. Ofc creams dont cover the banana and i think i will give it a try again in a 100ml bottle this time so i can see if something changes. I think it is what the name says and i really loved it. If you try it you gonna like it too, i am sure!","score":5}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"151496","name":"Satisfaction"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
