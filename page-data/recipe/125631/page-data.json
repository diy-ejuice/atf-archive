Its a Malaysian Lychee rebrand (me thinks) but I cant confirm what would be closest to sub with as Ive not found anything similar to this yet.\r\n** I am sure you could sub this with another Malaysian Lychee that has a fresh Lychee Beverage profile.\r\n\r\nSimply LYCHEE JUICE... Just The way I like it!! This works beautifully as a Standalone Fruit or as a Base! As a base it goes well with some Strawberry\r\n\r\nI love Lychee Juice, the Fruit Juice and have been working at getting that perfect balance between a Sweet Fruit Juice without it becoming a Candy and and at the same time standing up a sweet Realistic Fruit Juice.\r\nBeen working on a version a while now, I always find something in the Lychee profile that I dont like. Sometimes its too realistic in the sense of Eating an actual bitter Lychee Shell/skin (FA Lychee) or too florally and other times too 'Candyish' with a powder candy similar to Musk sweets (CAP Sweet Lychee) and TPA Lychee...HEll no\r\n\r\nRecently found a Local Brand (I think its an Malaysian rebrand) called Frandy Flavors Lychee that just hits the nail on the head for a Potent Fresh Sweet Lychee Juice! With this I basically used the other Lychees to Build up around the FRA Lychee the elements of a Lychee Fruit Juice that I think was missing.\r\n\r\nThe Lychee:\r\n(FRA Lychee) - This Lychee gives you that FRUIT JUICE type of Lychee and the closest I can explain this is that its Very similar if not exactly the same Lychee profile that you would get with Liqui-Fruit Lychee Juice. \r\n(CAP Sweet Lychee) - I love Cap sweet lychee as it gives that Sweetness that you would get from a Candy type of Lychee. I added this to Widen\\emulsify the lychee up a bit in terms of That sweet syrupy vibe you get from a a lychee puree (fruit but almost Candied). \r\nCAP Sweet Lychee tends to add a Bit of a 'Musky candy' note at higher % that I like it to be, thats why its added to the FRA instead of being the Main Lychee.\r\n(FA Lychee) - I felt hat the Lychee juice could be more realistic in a actual ripe fruit way so I added the FA Lychee to give you that little Touch of Authenticity, For me at higher % its tends too get Very Florally (Overpoweringly Florally, if you are not into Flora notes) and adds that Bitter as if you chew on a piece of the Lychee Skin.\r\n\r\nFA Cream Fresh:\r\nSome Like it, Some dont. It does what it needs to for me, in this case its not really meant to be 'visible' as a front profile, only to help the Fruits stand out a bit more.\r\nHeres a variation where I replaced the Cream Fresh with Oba Oba\r\nhttps://alltheflavors.com/recipes/share/73a94817-84db-43dd-b649-59d1260b31a4\r\n\r\nFA Apple Fuji:\r\nThe Mixer Upper. To do Blendy stuff \r\n\r\nLemon Sicily:\r\nAdded a touch of this to Pop the Tang of the Lychee a bit more, giving it that FRESH Ripe Fruit flavor instead of the a 'Warm Ripe' or Over ripeness.\r\n\r\nWS-23:\r\nOptional. Increase or Decrease at you desired Strength \r\nPersonally I'd recommend keeping or increasing it, Unless you like warm gross fruits, then remove it (its not supposed to be a Lychee pudding)\r\n\r\nSweetner:\r\nAdd the SS, Doooo It!!\r\n\r\nEnjoy!\r\n","steep_days":"3 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-05T00:29:05.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"1312","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Sweet Lychee","flavor_id":"119","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":3330},{"name":"Lychee","flavor_id":"582","vendor":"FA","millipercent":550},{"name":"Lychee","flavor_id":"2009","vendor":"OOO","millipercent":4440},{"name":"Cream Fresh","flavor_id":"540","vendor":"FA","millipercent":990},{"name":"Super Sweet","flavor_id":"2384","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":330},{"name":"Lemon Sicily","flavor_id":"524","vendor":"FA","millipercent":220},{"name":"Apple Fuji","flavor_id":"4886","vendor":"FA","millipercent":330},{"name":"WS-23","flavor_id":"8085","vendor":"OTHR","millipercent":330}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"125631","name":"DeeLychious"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
