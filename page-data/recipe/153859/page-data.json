The base of our corn bread. It's perfect for this recipe. Alfred convinced me to sub this in instead of HC Corn and it's a million times better. Thanks Alfred.\r\n\r\n**FLV Popcorn** brings some more corn, some insane texture, and also a dark sweetness that resonates through the vape. Its kind of like caramel corn, and it works well.\r\n\r\n**CAP Cereal 27** brings even more corn. Also it really helps in the bread/texture department. With these 3 working together we get a very believable \"corn\" flavor, and they all work to beef up and sell the bread.\r\n\r\n**JF Yellow Cake** finished the cornbread. It's sweet and thick and brings everything together nicely. Final touch, and also brings a tad of vanilla.\r\n\r\n**FA Custard Premium + INW Shisha Vanilla** come together as our pudding. If you don't have Custard Premium, get it. It's basically the bomb. It's thick, eggy and rich. It's Vanilla Custard. Very, *very* delicious. Shisha Vanilla is a nice vanilla cream that thickens up our pudding. It's bright and forgiving. *But let's be serious, this is a custard disguised as a pudding*.\r\n\r\nThat's it.","steep_days":"14","temperature":"0","recipe_score":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-12T15:40:37.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"1704","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Corn","flavor_id":"563","vendor":"FA","millipercent":750},{"name":"Popcorn","flavor_id":"8564","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":750},{"name":"Cereal 27","flavor_id":"4163","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Yellow Cake","flavor_id":"4560","vendor":"JF","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Custard Premium","flavor_id":"9118","vendor":"FA","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Shisha Vanilla","flavor_id":"841","vendor":"INW","millipercent":1000}],"reviews":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"153859","name":"Cornbread Pudding"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
