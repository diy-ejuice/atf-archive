For history white strawberry is visually a white strawberry with red saeeds, but it smells and tastes like pineapples.\r\nThis amazing cocktail based on pineberry and coconut will be achieved by a combination of pineapple and strawberry. A very nice pineberry stone is 70% pineapple (tpa), 10% shisha strawberry (INW) and 20% strawberry ripe (TPA)\r\nIn our recipe, besides pineberry, we'll use coconut, jamaican rum for alcohol and sweet straberry ans raspberry for the sweetness.\r\nHave a nice vape!","steep_days":"5","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T04:39:42.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"921","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Brown Sugar","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Coconut Extra","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1200},{"name":"Jamaican Rum","vendor":"FW","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Pineapple","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":3500},{"name":"Raspberry (sweet)","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Sweet Strawberry","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Strawberry (ripe)","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Shisha Strawberry","vendor":"INW","millipercent":500}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"55910","name":"Malibu PineBerry Cocktail"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
