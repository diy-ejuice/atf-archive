I recent tried a commercial  juice that I liked called Icing on the flake  and thought this needs some body  so here is my  twist on it  \r\nThe butterpecan pie  cereal 27 and honey comb create that flaky cereal note \r\nThe cheesecake and condensed milk give it the body I was after with a slight cheese cake back note .  You can sub out the cheese cake for a VBIC  or a gelato  if  cheesecake is not your thing\r\nit is pretty sweet as is but  feel free to add sweetener of your choice \r\nLOOKING for a group to learn about  mixing your own juice check out these groups and your tube channels  \r\nhttps://www.facebook.com/groups/diydownunder/\r\nhttps://www.diydownunder.com/ \r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/user/frank1360\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0xkeZFSG04","steep_days":"5","temperature":"","recipe_score":0,"total_reviews":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-06T20:43:52.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"1661","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Butter Pecan Pie","vendor":"WF","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Cereal 27","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Cheesecake Graham Crust","vendor":"JF","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Condensed Milk","vendor":"PUR","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Honeycomb","vendor":"VT","millipercent":2000}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"96154","name":"Just Flaking Out "}}}
