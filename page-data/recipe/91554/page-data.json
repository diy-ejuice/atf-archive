A few people have seen this before, hopefully one of them chimes in. \r\n\r\n sweet and tart, dweeb candy, and Bubblegum- la bubble gum is a delicious pink bubble gum, it becomes the canvas,on which we're going to paint this weird-ass candy. Weed candy gets the mix a hard candy shell. Sweet tart ads contrast, sweetness, and the dryness of the concentrate, pairs perfectly with Bubblegum.\r\n\r\nBeen on a bit of a Blackberry kick lately. It's like Frank's Red Hot sauce I put that shit and everything. Pairs great with the sweet strawberry, add sweetener and boom.\r\n\r\n hope you enjoy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you'd like to participate in the Year of Mixing find the Flavor-Pro group and join us for our weekly challenge - all mixers welcome - and there will be some prizes.
