It's a lot going on percentage-wise and number of concentrates.  The result is a soft, natural oatmeal cookie dotted with chewy globs of strawberry jam and slightly spiced with cinnamon.  Careful with the granola and molasses . . . a little goes a long way.\r\n\r\nEdit:  Forgot to mention, both cookies (JF and FA) were an accident in putting the recipe into ATF.  I just went with it when I mixed and am chalking it up to a happy accident.","steep_days":"21","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T12:48:25.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"568","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Granola","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":250},{"name":"Cinnamon Crunch","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Caramel","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Cookie","vendor":"JF","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Almond Cookie SC","vendor":"WF","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Molasses SC","vendor":"WF","millipercent":250},{"name":"Graham Cracker","vendor":"FW","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Cookie","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Strawberry Cheesecake SC","vendor":"WF","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Cookie Butter SC","vendor":"WF","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Strawberry Jam","vendor":"OOO","millipercent":2000}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"198027","name":"Strawberry Oatmeal Cookie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
