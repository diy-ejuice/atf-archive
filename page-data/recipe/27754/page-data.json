The Koolada has been a struggle of mine for years in how much to use to make it subtle but contributing to the experience. I've even thrown it out in other versions of this, but I am posting the mix containing it for hopeful feedback. I took the idea of using a premix (TPA Rainbow Sherbet) and enhanced all 3 separate aspects with individual concentrates of the icy treat by doubling them up. Welcome feedback and criticisms of all kinds on this recipe.","steep_days":"3 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"total_reviews":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T20:31:51.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"1721","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Lemon Lime","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Rainbow Sherbet","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":5000},{"name":"Raspberry","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Sweet Cream","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Sweet Tangerine","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Vanilla Custard V2","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Koolada 10 Pg","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Sweetener","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2000}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"27754","name":"Banebow Sherbet"}}}
