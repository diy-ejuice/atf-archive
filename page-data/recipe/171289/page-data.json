It can be described as an ashy burning campfire log - intense and pure... Here it adds a delicious & refined sweet, smokey & ashy element and lifts the RY4 base to unexplored heights\r\n\r\nOakwood adds a slight sweet woody tone to bolster the feint tobacco in the Holy Holy Grail and adds a bit of complexity and intrigue. \r\n\r\nUse Holy Holy Grail V2 at 8%. \r\nFor a touch of additional sweetness, add 1% HS Caramel Toffee...\r\n\r\nGive this 7 days to settle, 10 days best.
