Basic cherry vanilla tobacco that utilizes just a few concentrates to create a nice bold cherry vanilla tobacco.  Tpa cherry extract is  one the best cherries imo in this situation coupled with the already slight cherry note from inw marzipan finished with just straight bold vanilla which is needed to cut through flv tatanka to make it shine...

The Tatanka is there, but not overpowering. The cherry comes through cleanly without being cloying or overpowering. I don't really get the vanilla, or rather, I don't get much of the vanilla, but maybe that's the point. Will defintely be making up another 30mls of this"}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"115993","name":"Cherry Vanilla Tobacco"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
