The owner has been vaping this for years and has never divulged the recipe to a living soul. After numerous requests, he finally released a one shot called Malao for the rest of society to experience this delicious combination. This is my interpretation of a remarkable juice.\r\n\r\nTPA Papaya\r\nThe king of Papaya's at 3% is our hero in this tropical medley  and marries beautifully with the rest of the fusion. It brings a delectable creamy mouth feel with the unmistakable, slightly bitter, true papaya flavour. \r\n\r\nCap Sweet Mango\r\nAt 3%, we get none of the over-ripe mango notes often associated with Cap Sweet Mango. Used low, the inherent bitter notes compliment the Papaya perfectly and adds a credible mango profile.\r\n\r\nTPA Peach (Juicy)\r\nAs the name suggests, this ripe, succulent peach adds sweetness and juiciness to our mix and is a key component to liven up the aforementioned fruits.\r\n\r\nFW Cantaloupe\r\nThis cantaloupe completes our melange and harmonises the 3 main flavours into a complex tropical masterpiece. I fell in love with this cantaloupe the first time I mixed up Canary Coulis and find it to be more true compared to the other, more popular options.\r\n\r\nFA Marshmallow adds a touch of sweetness and amalgamates the fruits to prevent a linear taste experience.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis baby is fabulous off the shake but shines after 3 days. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n","steep_days":"3 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"total_reviews":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T07:00:57.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"3032","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Papaya","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Sweet Mango","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Cantaloupe","vendor":"FW","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Peach (juicy)","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Marshmallow","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"124899","name":"Tropicana"}}}
