I’m glad I’ve made this recipe and can vape it as every time I eat ambrosia I get the bum squirts!! 💩 😖🥴 I use 0.50% cap super sweet and vape this straight after a 2 hour run in the ultrasonic.  Bon appetit  👌🏻","steep_days":"3 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":4.6,"total_reviews":5,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:51:07.000-05:00","best_vg":"80%","views":"3046","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Vanilla Pudding","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Custard","vendor":"INW","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Madagascar (Vanilla Classic)","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000}],"reviews":[{"user":"kitu5","score":"5","text":"Is what it says on the tin. Tasty Ambrosia. Rich vanilla and custard. Light, but oh so hittable. Only quibble I have? I hit this until my wicks are black and go, \"Where the hell is my flavor?!?\"&#xD;\n&#xD;\nYeah, it's *that* good."},{"user":"chemb2","score":"5","text":"I am a big fan of INW Custard.  I will try game changer but I cannot get past the odd taste of CAP Vanilla Custard v1.  For me this brings a flavor unlike anything I have had.  I mix it again and again.  I always have some form of this in my personal stash.  Great simple recipe.  Thank you. I give it a 5 because it's unique in it's own way and is exactly what it says it is. "},{"user":"bjorama","score":"3","text":"For 6% flavor you can't go wrong with this custard.   11/22/19 Update.   I had another taste and didn't do much for me.  But that could be due to the fact that I dont' care for INW Custard.  If you like INW Custard this shit may be gold.  If you  want the real deal custard go mix up Game Changer by furiosmixer."},{"user":"Ebc88","score":"5","text":"After reading the description I almost didn't mix this lol, but i am glad i did turned out to be quite flavorful and tasty thanks for sharing."},{"user":"winder73","score":"5","text":"Simple but delicious!
