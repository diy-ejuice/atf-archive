I forgot how much I loved this treat and started thinking about how to get this in vape form and thus Great Scotch! was born. My first recipe didn't go so well, being too dry and the icing just wasn't working so shoutouts to @rageisalotofwork and @mlNikon from the DIY Discord for helping me figure out to use CAP Butter Cream and FA Cream Fresh at 1.5% both to help combat the dryness I was dealing with in my first version and help the frosting pop. Shoutouts as well to @Vurve who helped me work on the Butterscotch flavoring as I was having trouble near the end of this recipe getting the Butterscotch where I liked it.\r\n\r\nJF Yellow Cake: What cake recipe can't start with a good cake base? JF Yellow Cake at 3% gives me the cake base I need to make this treat work.\r\n\r\nFlavorah Butterscotch/Flavor West Butterscotch: It is a butterscotch krimpet so I needed a good butterscotch flavoring. Having read some of the flavor notes from DIY or DIE I settled on Flavorah's Butterscotch to give the frosting that butterscotch taste. It sits nice in the recipe at 1% but it isn't enough to fully complete the Butterscotch taste I want so we also add in some of Flavor West Butterscotch at 1% as well. Vurve really helped me out here with this recommendation as I was struggling to figure out which Butterscotch would help give me the taste I was looking for. These two Butterscotch flavorings give a nice Butterscotch flavor to the cake that you notice right after you taste the cake.\r\n\r\nCapella's Vanilla Cupcake v2: I decided to use Capella's Vanilla Cupcake v2 to supplement the cake base as well as a base for the frosting. I originally used v1 but it was much more of the bottom of a cupcake as opposed to the top where the frosting is at. v2 helps as it still has a bit of that cupcake flavor but the frosting aspect is much more present in v2 than in v1 to me. At 2% it does what I need it to do and it brings the cake and frosting together.\r\n\r\nFlavor Art Caramel: This is specifically to boost the butterscotch a little bit more and to bind everything together just a bit more. I only use it 0.5% to not get in the way of the other flavorings but to help tie things together.\r\n\r\nCapella Butter Cream and Flavor Art Cream Fresh: Originally I was going to use Capella Vanilla Cupcake as the sole flavoring for the frosting but I encountered a problem with dryness and a bit of flavor lacking in the frosting. Thankfully Rage and mlNikon recommended these two together at 1.5% each and it has helped a ton. Now the recipe is much more moist and the frosting pops more.\r\n\r\nLike my usual mixes, I mixed this at 80%VG and 20%PG. It's not bad as a S&V but it really benefits a ton from at least a week steep.","steep_days":"7 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"total_reviews":1,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:48:58.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"1987","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Yellow Cake","vendor":"JF","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Vanilla Cupcake V2","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Butter Cream","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Cream Fresh","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Butterscotch","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Butterscotch","vendor":"FW","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Carmel (caramel)","vendor":"FA","millipercent":500}],"reviews":[{"user":"MrZigglesworth","score":"5","text":"Great recipe.
