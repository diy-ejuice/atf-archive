I then used the TFA Grape Juice and Dragon fruit to give a juicy boost to the grape note.\r\n\r\nTested on Berserker 1.5 MTL with a 0.55 Ohm Nano Fused Clapton\r\nAmerican Bubblegum was an easy choice. I kept it low here as I didnt want to deal with weird notes that I get from ALL bubblegum\r\n\r\nSS, I'd say yes. But hey, take it out if you dont like the sweet stuff in life.\r\n","steep_days":"3 (SNV)","temperature":"111","recipe_score":0,"total_reviews":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:50:55.000-05:00","best_vg":"60%","views":"1367","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Grape","vendor":"FE","millipercent":4500},{"name":"American Bubble Gum","vendor":"MB","millipercent":4500},{"name":"Grape Juice","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1750},{"name":"Dragonfruit","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Super Sweet","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":700}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"150289","name":"Grubble (MTL)"}}}
