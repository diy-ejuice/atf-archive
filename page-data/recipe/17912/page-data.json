It also helps keep the pastry element \"soft\".\r\n\r\nFW Pie Crust / CAP Churro  - The pie crust gives that authentic pastry taste, 1.5% The churro is there just to grease up that pastry a little and keep the fresh bakery element.\r\n\r\nCAP Cinnamon Danish Swirl - Tried this at 2%, as I'd been playing with this ingredient a little before the comp was announced and found it to be the sweet spot in the recipe that I was developing, in this recipe it was just too much, knocked it down to 1.25% and it was just right and helps bring everything together, adds to the sweetness of the pastry and the cream and gives the apples that warmth that we love so much.\r\n","steep_days":"0","temperature":"0","recipe_score":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-12T14:04:53.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"1236","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Cinnamon Danish Swirl","flavor_id":"35","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1250},{"name":"Fuji","flavor_id":"506","vendor":"FA","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Strawberry (ripe)","flavor_id":"271","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Bavarian Cream","flavor_id":"145","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":4500},{"name":"Pie Crust","flavor_id":"1375","vendor":"FW","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Churro","flavor_id":"4168","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Super Sweet","flavor_id":"2384","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":500}],"reviews":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"17912","name":"Hans Christian Appleson"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
