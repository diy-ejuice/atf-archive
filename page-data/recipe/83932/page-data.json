It tastes damn near exactly like those.\r\n\r\nI really like the INW mints, Mix Mint was the best fit in this recipe for the potent mint flavor that you get in peppermints. The anise is what really gives it that little push into the authentic peppermint flavor though, you can omit it and the juice will be really close but not quite there. I tried increasing the anise by 0.1% as well but found that it made the juice less enjoyable though I couldn't actually notice a significant change in flavor. Pretty standard after that: marshmallow for body, cactus for juicy, menthol and WS-23 for that ice cold.","steep_days":"1 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-12T15:39:42.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"1909","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Menthol Liquid (pg)","flavor_id":"281","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":500},{"name":"WS-23","flavor_id":"8085","vendor":"OTHR","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Mix Mint","flavor_id":"797","vendor":"INW","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Marshmallow","flavor_id":"332","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Cactus","flavor_id":"647","vendor":"INW","millipercent":250},{"name":"Anise","flavor_id":"499","vendor":"FA","millipercent":150}],"reviews":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"83932","name":"Lung Coolant"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
