Credit to Silky for most of this.\r\n\r\nGood as an SnV but the mouthfeel is noticeably \"denser\" after a day's steep, almost like a blueberry donut.  Haven't been able to let it sit for longer than that so YMMV with longer steep times!","steep_days":"1 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T21:33:16.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"1234","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Berry Crunch","flavor_id":"136","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Yoghurt Drink","flavor_id":"9901","vendor":"VT","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Yogurt","flavor_id":"1471","vendor":"FW","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Blueberry","flavor_id":"1201","vendor":"FW","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Blueberry Juicy Ripe","flavor_id":"10437","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Cream Milky Undertone PG","flavor_id":"6539","vendor":"OOO","millipercent":1500}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"181220","name":"Blueberry Breakfast"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
