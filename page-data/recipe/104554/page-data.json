This lemonade base can be used with other fruits, just respect the balance and have fun playing with it. I used it here with blackberry because I like the depth a dark berry gives to something bright like a lemonade. \r\nThe FW blackberry at 1.5% is more than enough to add that sweet, mashed up blackberry flavor. This is one of my favorite blackberries. It can be a bit candied if used higher, but I used a touch of Forest Fruit here to add a bit of complexity and keep that candy note in check.\r\nThis 3 lemon combo is so good. CAP Lemon Sicily helps drive the lemon. It's not tart and whispy like FA (although I do like FA too) and it has more staying power. You could use something like FE lemon here to do the same thing. \r\nThe FLV & VT lemonade as a team make the perfect duo for a lemonade. I could have went simple and used FW lemonade at 6% or LA, or even PUR which has a solid lemonade...but none of these by themselves gives me what I wanted. This combo has a nice brightness, and the flavor is undeniably lemonade. It's not lemon juice, or lemon peel...it's lemonade with no off notes and no harshness. Also, this won't cloud up your juice. \r\n\r\n*Add 0.25-0.5% WS-23 for a nice chill.\r\n\r\nGive this a shot, and don't be afraid to try different fruits to throw in there. Have fun with it! It's good off a shake but even better the next day.","steep_days":"1 (SNV)","temperature":"425","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-06T22:02:46.000-05:00","best_vg":"60%","views":"2522","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Lemonade","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Lemonade Clear","vendor":"VT","millipercent":1250},{"name":"Sweetener","vendor":"FW","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Italian Lemon Sicily","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Forrest Mix (forest Fruit Mix)","vendor":"FA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Blackberry","vendor":"FW","millipercent":1500}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"104554","name":"Blackberry Lemonade"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
