We wanted something refreshing for a summer vape, something that could be an adv. His idea was a chocolate mint shake. There's quite a few versions of shamrock/chocolate mint ice cream, so we took a little bit of a different approach. I think we nailed it first try. The chocolate and mint are both light, but don't get lost. I think that's what makes this easily an adv. Cap Creamy Yogurt really ties everything together and really surprised the hell out of us.","steep_days":"6","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"updated_at":"2020-12-12T14:05:19.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"2263","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Double Chocolate (clear)","flavor_id":"158","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Australian Chocolate","flavor_id":"2657","vendor":"HS","millipercent":500},{"name":"Cr√àme De Menthe","flavor_id":"1266","vendor":"FW","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Cream","flavor_id":"604","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Vanilla Bean Ice Cream","flavor_id":"186","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Meringue","flavor_id":"530","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Creamy Yogurt","flavor_id":"5","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Sweetener","flavor_id":"339","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1000}],"reviews":[{"user":"MrZigglesworth","text":"A fantastic and delicious Chocolate Mint milkshake.
