I think this tastes like the flesh of the fruit. Sweet but not overpowering.\r\n\r\n - CAP Yellow Peach - I get a slight tartness from this flavor to me it's like the skin of the peach, paired with the Juicy Peach gives this recipe the full peach flavor I wanted.\r\n\r\n - CAP Apricot - The tartness from the Apricot boosts the peach flavors as well as helps with the skin portion of it.\r\n\r\n - FW Ginger - As said above paired with the CAP CDS is the perfect amount of spice to this recipe while keeping it a lighter flavor and not muddling everything.\r\n\r\n - FA Lemon Sicily - This is in to brighten the fruit flavors.\r\n\r\nI know it's a lot of flavors, and it's a bit of an odd one, but damn is it tasty.","steep_days":"7","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:48:57.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"1442","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Cookie","flavor_id":"490","vendor":"FA","millipercent":750},{"name":"Lucky Shot","flavor_id":"4349","vendor":"OSD","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Brandy","flavor_id":"345","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Shisha Vanilla","flavor_id":"841","vendor":"INW","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Vanilla Bean Ice Cream","flavor_id":"186","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Cinnamon Danish Swirl","flavor_id":"35","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":500},{"name":"Honey","flavor_id":"5571","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":200},{"name":"Peach (juicy)","flavor_id":"254","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Yellow Peach","flavor_id":"135","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Apricot","flavor_id":"10","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Ginger","flavor_id":"1293","vendor":"FW","millipercent":300},{"name":"Lemon Sicily","flavor_id":"524","vendor":"FA","millipercent":200}],"reviews":[{"user":"Joneser","text":"Perfection!!! super tasty!!!"}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"24134","name":"Ginger Peach Tart"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
