This is an incredibly versatile flavor that  just works  with so many mixes .  You can use simply to fill in the middle of  mix and add body and pull flavors together.    I would not say it emulsifies  flavors but  does seem to smooth out edges    \r\n\r\nThis mix  is a full sweet cream on the inhale that transitions to a caramel chocolate  filling  and ends with a darker chocolate crust on the finish   https://youtu.be/TAatuB5k4mw\r\nTested on a reload RDA at 65 watts with a .16 alien coil \r\n\r\n  The  WF Flapper  pie pulls this  whole mix together  by providing the primary  thick cream base  with some darker graham notes.     \r\nThe combination  of WF  Butter pecan pie and  VT  Chocolate Mousse  work really well to create the thick  sweet caramel  chocolate  center \r\nWF chocolate crust and FLV  cream cookies  create the dark Oreo like cookie crust  ( NOTE if you have real flavors cookie and cream you can sub that for FLV I actually prefer it but now that the real flavors  will only be sold in Canada I  did not want to use it )  \r\n\r\nThis is a sweet mix but if you want to add sweetener I would recommend   .5 of FLv sweetness","steep_days":"5","temperature":"0","recipe_score":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-12T15:40:51.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"1140","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Butter Pecan Pie","flavor_id":"6044","vendor":"WF","millipercent":3500},{"name":"Chocolate Cookie Crust SC","flavor_id":"10110","vendor":"WF","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Chocolate Mousse","flavor_id":"9371","vendor":"VT","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Cream and Cookies","flavor_id":"4381","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Flapper Pie SC","flavor_id":"10106","vendor":"WF","millipercent":3000}],"reviews":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"174711","name":"Mississippi MUD Pie ( cream, chocolate caramel, chocolate graham and pecans)  "}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
