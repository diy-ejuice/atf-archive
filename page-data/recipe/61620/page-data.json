(This is the one that works for me) I believe this version may have came from Reddit... ü§î It's been so long since I came across it that I forget... I've went and subbed TPA RY4D instead of FA RY4... I ran out of FA and I think that TPA overall fits the (dessert/bakery/tobacco) profile better anyhow... Its a tried and true version of Deadly Sin, I've mixed it for my wife many, many, many times! Hope you will enjoy it as well! üëäüòÅ","steep_days":"3 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:49:33.000-05:00","best_vg":"60%","views":"1641","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Butterscotch","flavor_id":"1216","vendor":"FW","millipercent":5000},{"name":"Cinnamon Danish Swirl","flavor_id":"35","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Vanilla Custard","flavor_id":"131","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Sugar Cookie","flavor_id":"115","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Ry4 Double","flavor_id":"379","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":5000},{"name":"Super Sweet","flavor_id":"2384","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":500}],"reviews":[{"user":"finsamson","text":"Scrumptious.
