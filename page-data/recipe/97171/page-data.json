Lychee's unique tropical flavour (described by some as a mix between watermelon, pear and grape) is unmistakable and magical! Cap Sweet Lychee boosts the FA Lychee with a sweet, canned lychee vibe and rounds the lychee profile off perfectly.\r\n\r\nThe pear layer is courtesy of my favoutite pear combo consisting of FA & INW. \r\nFA Pear brings the fresh, juicy pear element whereas  INW Pear provides the grittiness, crunch and texture of a pukka pear.\r\n\r\nFLV Persimmon is described by many as a peach/plum hybrid. I pick up up wonderful, deep, pear/quince nuances which intensifies the pear profile and adds that little intrigue to the mix...  \r\n\r\nThe Persimmon can be substituted for TPA Dragonfruit at the same %. The dragonfruit variation is excellent, I just prefer the persimmon version.\r\n\r\nFLV sweet coconut fulfills 3 roles  here:  it provides a touch of creaminess, a spot of sweetness and imparts that magical taste  of fresh coconut ensuring adequate depth in the mix.\r\n\r\nFeel free to add your cooling agent of choice - WS23 at 0.5% is just enough IMHO.\r\n\r\nGive this one a good night's sleep, 3 preferable for the floral notes to dissipate.\r\n\r\n\r\n","steep_days":"3 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:50:06.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"2497","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Sweet Lychee","flavor_id":"119","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Lychee","flavor_id":"582","vendor":"FA","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Pear","flavor_id":"411","vendor":"FA","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Pear","flavor_id":"665","vendor":"INW","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Persimmon","flavor_id":"4420","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":500},{"name":"Sweet Coconut","flavor_id":"605","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":500}],"reviews":[{"user":"Screwdriver","text":"This is the best pear vape on the planet IMHO, not even kidding... &#xD;\nCongratz RudeRudi"},{"user":"Marnu","text":"Oh my lord man!
