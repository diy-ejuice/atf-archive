( You can also Use the VBIC from TPA or CAP )\r\n\r\n- Result in a very nice light milky, creamy Vanilla Custard Flavour with hint of  cake. \r\n\r\n- Not to sweet, but sweet enough!\r\n\r\n- Steeping: 2-4 Weeks. Depending on your patience. \r\n  Get richer with time. A great Custard!\r\n\r\n#Update 29.05.2018:\r\nChanged the Icream from LB to TPA, to get more Vanilla from it.","steep_days":"14","temperature":"0","recipe_score":4,"total_reviews":1,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:49:37.000-05:00","best_vg":"60%","views":"3820","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Vanilla Custard","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":6000},{"name":"New York Cheesecake","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":4500},{"name":"French Vanilla","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":4500},{"name":"Ethyl Maltol","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Marshmallow","vendor":"FA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Vanilla Bean Ice Cream","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1000}],"reviews":[{"user":"Bjorncoetsee","score":"4","text":"Looks good!
