This was made for a #DIYDOWNUNDER Milk challenge in which you had to use 5 flavors using only flavors available from Flvaorworld AU\r\n\r\n*CAP horchata* is a very underrated flavor. it is sweet creamy and has just a touch of cinnamon and it perfect for this type of application, and is noted on the back end. it is close to a cinnamon type pudding and could easily be used as such with a light custard to make a nice cinnamon pudding. if you want more of a cinnamon note you can add a dash of something like bakers touch or CAP cinnamon danish, RW cinnamon roll.\r\n\r\n*WF caramel butter*is a light creamy caramel, that blends right in - which is what I need. I did not want a dark thick caramel that stands out, the sweetness is noted on the front and carries through. You can also add some FLV milk and honey at a1% to support some of these notes \r\n\r\n*FA Vanilla bourbon* holds the middle of this mix together, it does not have any boozy notes it is straight up vanilla goodness \r\n\r\n*TPA rice crunchie* adds some of that cereal texture and sweet cereal notes to the mix without adding too much dryness that you can get from some of the cereal flavors \r\n\r\n*NOTES*: recommend to Use sweetener, lets be honest here - cereal milk is SWEET, that is why we like it!! Purlium super sweet is used here as it is a Sweetner that adds sweetness without adding an overly chemical sweetner note that I despise in Cap ( would prefer FLV sweetness here but alas could not use in the contest)    This is made for an RDA  flavors may be a more subtle in a  RTA  - this is  a bit of a steeper so you need to give it 12 - 14 days  \r\n\r\n. \"Learn more about mixing here:\r\nhttps://www.facebook.com/groups/diydownunder/\r\nhttps://discord.gg/kH4Fqbc\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCTCwb7ULyfJALQlehomZZQA\r\nhttps://www.diydownunder.com/\r\n\r\nTranslate","steep_days":"12","temperature":"0","recipe_score":3,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T02:16:37.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"1568","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Bourbon (vanilla Bourbon)","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1300},{"name":"Caramel Butter","vendor":"WF","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Horchata","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":5000},{"name":"Rice Crunchies","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Super Sweet","vendor":"PUR","millipercent":500}],"reviews":[{"user":"KylezKloudz","text":"Not a bad recipe, just the rice note I get from the Horchata is not for me... Add the Rice Crunchiest to it and it's a bit overwhelming for my palette. So for me it misses the mark of what it's supposed to be... Other than that one problem it doesn't taste bad!
