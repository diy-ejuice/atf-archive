The mango and guava really create a nice sweet texture to add to the juicy ness of the recipe. The peaches coupled with apricot and nectarine give it almost a nice jammy taste. The Tangerine adds just a hint of zest to make the recipe more palatable. The cream base is a nice mix of FLV sweet Coconut, Vanilla Swirl and FA Cream Fresh. I was wanting to make a nice peaches and cream recipe but with some different elements incorporated in the mix. This needs about 3 days to come together. Mixed at 70/30. Mix it up you might just like it as much as I do.","steep_days":"3","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"total_reviews":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-01T11:49:11.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"1498","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Sweet Mango","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Sweet Guava","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Sweet Coconut","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":500},{"name":"Peach","vendor":"FW","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Nectarine","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Peach (juicy)","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Armenia (apricot)","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Vanilla Swirl","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Sweet Tangerine","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":500},{"name":"Cream Fresh","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1500}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"128875","name":"Sweet N Juicy Cream"}}}
