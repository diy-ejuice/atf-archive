I'm blown away at how good this is off the shake. I'm going to let it steep for 3 days and then taste it again after. But off the shake it is a easy 4/5 and I suspect it will get better. Hats off to you and well done!&#xD;\n&#xD;\nEDIT: I tried adding 1% Shisha Vanilla to this, as the vanilla was a bit on the weak side for me. Worked wonders and can highly recommend it if you want more vanilla.","score":4},{"user":"Zugmaschine","text":"Really nice Custard! After a long steep, also some cake ist there, from the Cheesecake.","score":4},{"user":"fieldgreens","text":"Much like everyone else, I'm amazed at how good this custard is off the shake.  Sure, it gets better after about 48 hours, but to have a custard be this good this quickly is easily worth the five star rating.  Great job Ed.","score":5},{"user":"CupcakeFetish","text":"The little bubbles are still there and it tastes fantastic, I approve 100%. If you're impatient like I am, it's only gonna get better from here, and I know that for a fact! 10/10 would mix again, and I will definitely mix again.","score":5},{"user":"Zany","text":"There's something going on here .. I can't quite describe it, but whatever it is .. it sure is delicious!&#xD;\n3 days in and it's even better - Doesn't need the steep to be good, but definitely doesn't hurt.&#xD;\nGreat Job, Ed !","score":4},{"user":"finsamson","text":"Well butter my butt and call me a biscuit, he ain't lying. Straight off the shake it's fantastic. Thank you.","score":5},{"user":"UnappreciatedRobot","text":"INW Custard really is amazing. The fact that this recipe allows you to have an amazing custard as a SNV that only gets better with a few days steep is pretty amazing.","score":5},{"user":"cincinnatiking","text":"I know it's called \"Custard Now\" but if you let it steep for 3 weeks it get's even better! A very simple but complex tasting custard. Thanks for sharing it and getting me hip to INW Custard. I mixed this a long time ago, but forgot to rate it. Excellent recipe!","score":5},{"user":"eyemakepizza","text":"An absolutely fantastic custard. Ditch the Cap VC, fuck a steep, mix this shit up and enjoy a damn good custard. ","score":5},{"user":"DumHed","text":"Brilliant, truly a masterpiece and a great discovery.","score":5},{"user":"ID10-T","text":"CAP NY Cheesecake fills out the \"Competition Custard\" and FA Madagascar hits the right vanilla note here. Best tasting recipe ever? Nah, but pretty awesome to have a shake-and-vapeable vanilla custard. The list of \"recipes inspired by this one\" should be a lot longer than the one listed at this point. My head is swimming with ideas for other S&amp;V custards using this as a base and if you give this a try, yours probably will be, too. This recipe feels like more than just a yummy and neat trick, it feels IMPORTANT.   ","score":5},{"user":"amouthforwar","text":"Yep. It's good.
