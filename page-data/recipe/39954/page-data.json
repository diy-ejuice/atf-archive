I've been messing with this profile for a while and its been difficult because a lot of tobacco flavors I've tried taste like green beans or have notes that don't pair well with my goal for this recipe. Also the majority of maple flavors I've tried taste like cardboard or are extremely harsh and unvapeable.\r\n  TPA Western is a flavor I've liked for a long time and i actually prefer it over RY4 double. it's a very hard flavor to describe, it doesn't have any real distinct characteristics but adds a mild \"tobacco\" flavor and has a bit of the same feel of RY4 without overdoing it. This flavor is best at low percentages paired with more pronounced flavors. \r\n  I just recently tried Soho and really like it as a mild tobacco that you can add pretty much any profile to and it will work. That's kinda what i like out of a tobacco flavor so it works perfectly for this recipe and my taste.\r\n  FA Maple syrup is by far the best maple flavor I've tried, and so far the only one i can stand to vape. I've tried a few others and although they all tastes great on the back of the hand, FA was the only one that doesn't tear my throat out.\r\nI added the frosting to sweeten things up and toasted marshmallow blends it all together and adds those great toasted notes.\r\nThis is one of the most mild, smoothest tobaccos I've had but it still has that satisfying tobacco feel that keeps me interested in the profile.
