Mixed this up a little over a week ago, and been knuckle tasting it every so often. Finally dripped some just now, and I’m really impressed. The knuckle taste was very strange and like floral. So I didn’t have the highest hopes. But when I vaped it, it’s amazing. A very buttery bakery type flavor. The jam is light and in the background. And I get just a touch of whipped cream. This is very different than what I’m used to in a good way. INW biscuit always has a weird off note to my palette but not in this recipe. Well done!"}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"110496","name":"Scone'd"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
