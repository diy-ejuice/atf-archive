I messed with a few different cake/cheesecake/frosting combos and settled on this one. \r\nThere’s not much point to describing every ingredient from irl carrot cake, it’s all fairly obvious. A few flavors deserve special mention, however. FLV Carrot does favorable texture things here, making the cake stand out, and was part of my personal puzzle anyway. Then I used some Liquid Amber to tweak the carrot and fruits into being softer, closer to cooked. Butter Pecan is huge, contributing to the texture of the cake and providing the pecan along with a rich, dark sweetness. The fruits, Fuji and G.Pineapple, brighten it up and give some moisture and subtle tang without becoming the main focus, just like irl. \r\nOverall I’m very pleased with how this came out and I feel I’ve solved my puzzle. \r\nA 2 week steep is in order for this one. The cake needs a while to really come together with everything.
