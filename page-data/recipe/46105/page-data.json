I spent loads of money on this juice before I started into DIY so cloning it has been a definite to do for me and now I am ready to share it with the community and just in time for diyordie remix month. \r\n\r\nMy first attempts at this recipe involved dam near every blueberry concentrate available from Flavor West to Delosi and they weren't even close. The moment I smelled Flavorah Blueberry I knew I had found the one. So the rest of the recipe was to me was straight forward and after bouncing around a few percentages I landed on this. Capella Vanilla Custard V1 at 3% with Flavorah Blueberry at 3% and Capella Super Sweet at .50%, after a 1 week steep this is the best clone. I truly believe that I could not get closer.\r\n\r\nSLIGHT RANT\r\nNow if you are like me after DIYing for a while and going back to your local B&M and picking up your old go to commercial juice for the purpose of cloning, you are no longer blown away by the flavor of that liquid. This in my opinion is because the DIY recipes that you have been creating/mixing and vaping are a lot more in depth. This in my opinion really shows that DIY recipes are more a labor of love and people who DIY really care about the flavor that they want their recipes to display. We are not worried about profit margins and deadlines and at the end of the day to us it is all about the flavor and experience.\r\nSLIGHT RANT COMPLETE\r\n\r\nSo I took the recipe that I wanted to clone, cloned that bitch and then remixed it with love. This is that recipe. I stayed with FLV Blueberry at 3% as it is the main note to build around and at that percentage it stands out of the creams wonderfully. Now for the love custard eww bahahahaha. The CAP Vanilla Custard V1 in the reference was far to sharp and almost pungent but it was the concentrate that I needed, so kept it and massaged it into the the custard that I wanted. I reduced the percentage by half and added TPA Vanilla Swirl to round off the sharp vanilla note from the CAP. Then I added the FLV Cream to bring back that custardy thickness. I still needed to sweeten the mix as a whole and CAP Super Sweet at .30% was just right. There you go people mix the clone if you want to but I suggest mixing the remix, I recommend an 80/20 mix and both will need a full week of steeping. I hope you enjoy and leave some feedback as it is always appreciated. If you have had the reference liquid I would love to hear what you think. Thanks Krucial.        \r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n","steep_days":"7","temperature":"0","recipe_score":3,"updated_at":"2020-12-12T14:05:21.000-05:00","best_vg":"80%","views":"4374","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Blueberry","flavor_id":"620","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Vanilla Custard","flavor_id":"131","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Vanilla Swirl","flavor_id":"189","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Super Sweet","flavor_id":"2384","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":300},{"name":"Cream","flavor_id":"604","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1500}],"reviews":[{"user":"Mac-n","text":"Sorry, dude but I worked here a while ago and you're not even close.
