INW Raspberry is strong and pungent. FA Blackcurrant is slightly floral and sweet. the two come together and play off each other very well. You'll see what I mean.\r\n\r\nThe rest - Pear adds a bit of juice, dragon fruit melts it all together, strawberry exists for some reason. Pink champagne gives it a slight, nearly unnoticeable bite.\r\n\r\nIt's a bit dry so INW Cactus might do some good here at .5-.75% but i'm pretty content with where it is.\r\n\r\nno picture because i'm lazy.","steep_days":"7 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-11T16:20:30.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"959","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Raspberry","flavor_id":"667","vendor":"INW","millipercent":750},{"name":"Pink Champagne","flavor_id":"1380","vendor":"FW","millipercent":500},{"name":"Red Touch (strawberry)","flavor_id":"421","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Pear","flavor_id":"411","vendor":"FA","millipercent":750},{"name":"Dragonfruit","flavor_id":"226","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":750},{"name":"Blackcurrant","flavor_id":"545","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1500}],"reviews":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"99582","name":"Raspburrant Chamtouchar"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
