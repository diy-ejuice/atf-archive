A good recipe but I felt something was missing. Obviously  with only two ingredients, there's a lot you can do with it to improve it to your personal liking.\r\n\r\nI have been going through Wayne's Water-Malone bottles at an alarming rate. So I though, why not combine it with Prickly and see what comes of it (replacing the melon flavors for Prickly Victory's flavors. Well, enjoyment came out of it, but I still felt that it needed something to push it just a bit further. So I went through my flavor stash to see what felt right. I pulled the FE Lemon from my stash and felt like this could be something. Tried it at 0.5% and immediately knew that this was just right. I personally add 0.5% WS-23 also.\r\n\r\nThe name obviously comes from Wayne Walker and Prickly Victory. I'd have chosen to make this a derivative from Water Malone also, but I don't know if you can make it derivative from two recipes. So I chose to make it as a derivative of Prickly, as it is more Prickly than Malone. If it is possible, let me know and I'll fix that.","steep_days":"1 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T17:36:22.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"1076","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Sweet Guava","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Double Apple","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Dragonfruit","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Cactus","vendor":"INW","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Lemon","vendor":"FE","millipercent":500}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"194238","name":"Prickly Wayne"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
