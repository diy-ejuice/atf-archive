Moon Sugar still isn't where I would like it but this one is in a good spot. Now is it like the original? Same profile but two different animals. I prefer my version with my unbiased opinion ;-) \r\n\r\nPretty straight forward, we know he uses CAP and FA mostly so that's how I narrowed down which concentrates I wanted to use. He also mentioned his addiction to lemon sicily and he states in the flavor description it has a citrus note which is why I chose to add a touch of it. And it really does seem to make the recipe pop and have more vividness. The sweet cream is there by my decision to soften all the rough edges or harshness some people may experience with fruits, myself included. Even though I'm 99% sure he doesn't use any creams in his recipe.\r\n\r\nMix it up if it sparks your interest. Coming from someone who almost exclusively vapes desserts, this stuff is damn good.\r\n","steep_days":"3 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"updated_at":"2020-12-12T10:34:01.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"3669","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Sweet Mango","flavor_id":"120","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Papaya","flavor_id":"252","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Melon Cantaloupe","flavor_id":"529","vendor":"FA","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Lemon Sicily","flavor_id":"524","vendor":"FA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Sweet Cream","flavor_id":"117","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Super Sweet","flavor_id":"2384","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":250}],"reviews":[{"user":"Anton_Prymak","text":"","score":5},{"user":"Screwdriver","text":"This is an awesome vape RdaJunkie, congratz! I'm mixing up big bottles of it. &#xD;\nIn the original I taste a drop of licorice from Inawera (Lukrecja), so I've added that at 0.25% to this mix and after a few days steep that little extra is there. (Might well be a flavourart licorice he uses though) &#xD;\nBut surely your recipe is the bomb as is.&#xD;\nLet me know if you've tried it ok?
