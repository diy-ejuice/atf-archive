These fruits have been coated with rich warm cinnamon and powdered sugar, then baked inside a toasted buttery pastry. I hope you enjoy it.\r\n\r\nTop: \r\nCherry Extract & Amarena Cherry combine to make a sweet, tart, and lightly blossom-esque pie filling styled cherry right up front. Followed by a flavorful, juicy, and bright cooked Pear Apple flavor; made by combining Ripe Pear and Shisha Apple. The inherent tart notes found in these fruity flavors are offset and balanced with a touch of Powdered Sugar and cooked with a coating of warm Rich Cinnamon. \r\n\r\nBase: \r\nApple Pie not only serves as a solid pastry base, it‚Äôs light fresh apple flavors helps to bridge the gap between the apple and pear top notes. Almond Cookie and Croissant help support the Apple Pie by fortifying the warm buttery bakery notes; rounding out the toasted pastry flavor.\r\n\r\nüìå Note ‚Äì FLV‚Äôs Rich Cinnamon is very potent and can easily overpower the mix. A dilution is recommended; however, I used the toothpick method. Literally ¬Ω of ¬Ω a drop is more than enough.","steep_days":"12","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-02T08:04:34.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"968","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Almond Cookie SC","flavor_id":"9013","vendor":"WF","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Amarena Cherry","flavor_id":"9968","vendor":"EUR","millipercent":750},{"name":"Apple Pie","flavor_id":"551","vendor":"FA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Shisha Apple","flavor_id":"814","vendor":"INW","millipercent":750},{"name":"Cherry Extract","flavor_id":"222","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Croissant SC","flavor_id":"9022","vendor":"WF","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Powdered Sugar","flavor_id":"6522","vendor":"OOO","millipercent":200},{"name":"Rich Cinnamon","flavor_id":"638","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":60},{"name":"Ripe Pear SC","flavor_id":"9040","vendor":"WF","millipercent":2250}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"111578","name":"Appeary Morning by Leilani"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
