I love how creamy cheeseshake this is as far as the strawberry goes I can pickup a bit on a syrupy sweet strawberry (my own doing via strawberry mute) not so much that it's like crystal clear authentic strawberry with syrup but it definitely adds an element of syrupy sweetness to that wonderfully creamy cheeseshake.&#xD;\n&#xD;\n2nd update: Circled back to this mix after about a month and oh boy is this deliciously creamy! Once finished with the remaining 20-30mls that was steeped for a month, I immediately went and mixed more to allow for an entire fully steeped batch. Excellent work!&#xD;\n&#xD;\nGreat job! Thanks guys will mix again!"},{"user":"KylezKloudz","score":"5","text":"Strawberry Cheesecake Shake? ü§§ This one caught my eye right from the start... Just got the flavorings from BCF today and after seeing how fast this recipe got so many 5 üåü reviews I went for 120ml bottle from the start... Just made another 15ml mix for my wife and she says it's good üëç gonna give mine a couple hours to meld a lil and I'll be back in a couple more days for the review... Thanks guys! This one is gonna be a banger I feel... üëä&#xD;\n5 days later this is awesome! Great job! "},{"user":"Sebastien","score":"none","text":"I've tried to mix several time with WF strawberry cheesecake and each time this flavor annihilate everything you can throw at it...and unfortunately this recipe is no different.....at least to me....if a mix 3.5% of strawberry cheesecake stand alone and vape it side by side with this recipe both taste exactly the same..... I'm done with this flavor....I had to try your mix to see if it was possible to achieve something else with WF strawberry cheesecake but unfortunately it's impossible.....for those who can mix with it and taste the difference...well... I'm happy for you! üôÉ"},{"user":"Maralie1184","score":"5","text":"This is an excellent, well balanced, strawberry cheesecake milkshake. I'm a hardcore strawberry mute, so at first, I didn't get any strawberry at all. I added a bit too much extra strawberry at first, which just made this weird. I mixed it again, boosted the strawberry gummy Candy by 1% and let it steep a couple days... Holy shit, guys! Not only is this delicious, but I'm now able to taste a profile I've chased since I started vaping. Excellent work, as always üçì"},{"user":"lionhrt9","score":"5","text":"Hey guys you really nailed this one!  I make as many of your mixes as I can with 400 flavors often adding to my shopping list but had these flavors already. I saw this recipe as i follow the YouTube show, couldn't wait to mix it up. It was one of those 60ml right off the jump mixes man am i glad i did. Seriously deep balanced flavors. Awesome cheese shake!"},{"user":"DJDmix","score":"none","text":"Excellent work guys. Well balanced. It has taken my ADV spot for now. Top 5 developed recipe, maybe even top 3.&#xD;\n&#xD;\nDescription is accurate to what you get from this recipe. Top 3 developed recipe for me.&#xD;\nCheesecake element is present but light and it kinda blends into the ice cream. The graham crust is just present enough( I thought it would be substantially more with 3 tpa gc, and 2 inw ywcc.&#xD;\nStrawberry is a light top note. Well balanced recipe, definitely worth the mix. 5 stars."},{"user":"toprod","score":"5","text":"Enjoying this one guy's it's good strait away  good work  much love"},{"user":"Untitled","score":"5","text":"The strawberry combo on this is fire and everything is well balanced. Well done guys!"},{"user":"Kurplop","score":"5","text":"This is really good! Great mix once again. Thank you."},{"user":"Deftohms","score":"5","text":"This is spot on. Off the shake its extremely cheesy, but after 3 days that cheese calms down and it turns into a perfect milkshake with strawberry cheesecake. Thanks for this one guys!"}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"204073","name":"Strawberry Cheese Shake | DEVELOPED"}}}
