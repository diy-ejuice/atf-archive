Although I haven’t tried that myself yet. I was originally going to use FLV but I’d just got the MB and wanted to play around with it as it’s such a great coconut. It’s not massively coconutty in this recipe, more like rice pudding that’s been made with a little coconut milk. I was originally trying to make a tropical rice pudding so it’s a hangover from that. I found it adds another layer to the cream and brings richness, so I left it in.\r\n\r\nI used JF Bavarian Cream as it has a really nice vanilla note. But it’s not the thick, rich cream I wanted on it’s own so I paired it with FLV Cream and TFA Vanilla Swirl. \r\n\r\nRich Cinnamon is by far my favourite cinnamon- I get a metallic taste from a lot of others. I’ve made a 10% dilution of FLV Rich Cinnamon in a 10ml tester bottle so it’s easier to add tiny % of it to a mix. \r\n\r\nI use 0.5% of CAP Super Sweet in most things, but do whatever you usually do with sweetener. I don’t think it would be bad without it.\r\n \r\nThis is a SNV recipe, but let it sit for an hour or two before vaping. It’s even better with an overnight steep.
