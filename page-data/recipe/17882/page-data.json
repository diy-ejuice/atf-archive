Its great to go as is. The flavors may meld and smooth out a bit after a day. Feel free to add a tiny bit of sweetener if you wish. I do not think the recipe requires it at all.","steep_days":"0","temperature":"0","recipe_score":4,"updated_at":"2020-12-12T15:38:54.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"21981","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Forrest Mix (forest Fruit Mix)","flavor_id":"453","vendor":"FA","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Lemon","flavor_id":"1655","vendor":"FE","millipercent":500},{"name":"Lemonade","flavor_id":"951","vendor":"LA","millipercent":6000},{"name":"WS-23","flavor_id":"8085","vendor":"OTHR","millipercent":350}],"reviews":[{"user":"Hexical","text":"Absolutely amazing mix. It's simple, straight to the point, and great for a beginners DIY juice. Forest Mix is the perfect mix of berries to nail down the mixed berry lemonade feel without feeling overwhelming, and LA lemonade really adds that extra lemon punch.&#xD;\n&#xD;\nIf you are a beginner, definitely try out this recipe. Hell, make sure to try it out even if you arent. ","score":5},{"user":"Vishousvapez","text":"the simplicity of this recipe is what got me i have been vaping it for about a month now i wrote it down when i first started mixing without a name just the % and what not but im glad its Ed's recipe cause this is straight fire ... opened my eyes because i was sleeping on forrest fruit it was with my first order ever and now i find myself experimenting with it more because of this recipe","score":5},{"user":"staybert","text":"This is as good as it gets for a simple mix, tried the previous iteration with 0.75% FA  Lemon Sicily, and it's the bomb. I'm sure it's even better now with FE Lemon.","score":5},{"user":"Slippaz","text":"The flavor combinations in this recipe are great.  Forrest Mix and lemonade are a match made in heaven. But it was definitely designed for somewhat muted atomizers.  For example, I tested it in an Elevate and it pretty solid.  That's obviously a tough balance when you're mixing for tart lemonade, but this one's just a little too harsh on good attys.","score":3},{"user":"cincinnatiking","text":"Excellent blend of flavors!","score":5},{"user":"RockyHarlow","text":"Fantastic. Shake and vape, just don't let it sit too long. After around a week the lemonade aspect starts to drop off significantly, though that is an issue with LA Lemonade more than anything. This is usually what I mix for friends when they want something \"summery.\" Outstanding simple recipe. 0.5% WS23 makes a welcome addition here as well, to make it more of a beverage vs. a candyesque flavor. Either way works well though.","score":5},{"user":"p00pb0t","text":"I had to let it steep about 5 days for the FF to start to feel more like berries than dark mustiness, however I tend to have issue with FF fresh so take that in to account. Once I let it steep the berries were the forefront of the mix with lemon/lemonade taking a seat at the back of the bus making this more of a berry mix with hints of lemonade.","score":2},{"user":"Grorco","text":"I am really starting to love what lemon Sisley does for fruits, I didn't care for the Forest mix when I sfted it, but it comes out tasting great in this simple yet delightful mix right off the shake, good job :)","score":5},{"user":"Urano_Metria","text":"The flavors are fantastic in this recipe, but for some reason I found it a bit dry/harsh to vape on more than just occasionally. If it was smoother/wetter It would easily be a 4-5 star mix for me. I guess maybe I might not be a lemonade guy?","score":4},{"user":"cdaniell30","text":"Holy balls, I'm not much of a lemonade vaper but I thought I'd give this a shot as a taster for forest fruits and this is some good stuff.

I have been doing so many creams, desserts, and bakeries, this fruity vape really hits the spot.","score":5}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"17882","name":"Backwoods Lemonade"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
