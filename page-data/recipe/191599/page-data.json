Rainbow Road which is basically Froot Loops milk without the cereal this one taste like Froot Loops milk with the cereal I love it. I definitely think you should release it as a one shot it would definitely sell"},{"user":"Dmixer256","text":"Just mixed this up and wow off the shake it's really good. I'm definitely going to let it sit for a couple of days though. Awesome recipe! "},{"user":"EyeM2sRus","text":"I fuckin love this after a few days it all comes together soooo good wayne you done did it again. I get the banana in the back i get the citrus and the cream and the cereal notes. I love when a recipe like this is soooo good."},{"user":"AyBlinken","text":"Mixed this up 3 days ago and I have to say it is spot on. That key lime pie really nails the citrus note that comes through with fruit loops. I had given up on the hope of finding a good fruit loop/fruity pebble recipe a few years ago, but this hits the mark for me. It's more lime forward rather than lemon forward that most other recipes were using, so there is no lemon pledge problem with this one. The glazed icing note on this one is really surprising, I didn't expect that would come through like it does. Great job putting this all together, especially bypassing the traditional way of using meringue and AP to get the cereal and milk notes all the other recipes use. &#xD;\n&#xD;\nI feel like this recipe has a great chance being tweaked for a vanilla ice cream kind of remix, similar to the Flint Stoned juice I used to get from vapewild. It also makes me wonder if FW fruity flakes could be used in a similar way with this recipe. I'm sure people will start playing with this and make some interesting remixes. Thanks again Wayne. "},{"user":"wadeyloops","text":"Please excuse me but I first needed to check if this was an April fools mix. Going by smell all the ingredients seemed to have a place of sorts as I mixed it. It was rough after the shake and at 24 hours the brown sugar notes were still too dark and deep for me clashing with the lemon notes. I did read your flavor notes before mixing it. I also do not get along with Frosted Donut although I could not taste the playdoh. It has steeped for 3 days and I will retest it in another week or so. I enjoyed reading your write up. I would have thought you could have approached this with many of the more suitable flavor concentrates at your disposal e.g. why not try a concentrate intended more for a sugar frosting than use frosted donut to emulate the frosting and the banana nut bread although a nice flavor did not seem to fit in here to me. You mention it being used as bakery I don't know if this profile is a bakery but I think I know what you mean. TFA Fruit Circles is not the least offensive of the cereals.  I would say CAP Silverline Fruit Circles is but that depends on if you have ever tried and also it’s suitability given it's weaker strength would not allow it to stand up to the other stronger flavors. This is a flavorful mix but the brown sugar notes are quite overpowering and dark for my personal tastes and it seems muddled and slightly confused overall at this early stage. I will need to let this sit for another 10 days before I try it again. Cereals with texture and milk are difficult to emulate in vape form. Thanks for all you do, this is a fun profile. I will try and be someone who comes back and revises their feedback at a later stage."},{"user":"Johncox245","text":"Awsome mux"}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"191599","name":"10-Loop"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
