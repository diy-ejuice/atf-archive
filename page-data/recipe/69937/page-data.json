Thanks to Steam for opening my eyes to this blueberry combination of fw blueberry and fa bilberry. I absolutely loved Steams recipe Blue Doh  its delicious. So that's where I got the blueberry now here's the pudding. The pudding is of coarse vanilla pudding flv. My new pudding secret weapon is LA cheesecake I find that I dislike this concentrate over 2% but under 2% it adds an awesome creamy thickness to your mixes. I then added flv sweet cream and vanilla bean as my vanilla cream if you will lol. The vanilla bean also helps make the LA cheesecake more creamy and less cheesy. Sweetener feel free to use or not use whatever your personal preference is my personal favorite is flv sweetness but I don't like my mixes crazy sweet I just find .25% of sweetness to be perfect for me. I found this surprisingly perfect after a shake but find it just gets richer and richer everyday you let it sit after 4 days it is more than ready but I am pretty sure it will be magical after a long steep. Give it a mix!!! Enjoy!!!!","steep_days":"4 (SNV)","temperature":"420","recipe_score":0,"total_reviews":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T12:46:20.000-05:00","best_vg":"75%","views":"2619","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Blueberry","vendor":"FW","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Bilberry","vendor":"FA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Vanilla Pudding","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Cheesecake","vendor":"LA","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Sweet Cream","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":750},{"name":"Vanilla Bean","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Sweetness","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":250}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"69937","name":"Blueberry Pudding $$ðŸ˜‡"}}}
