My humble attempt at recreating the blueberry marshmallow breakfast cereal. I think it comes pretty close.\r\nThis is my finalized version of the DIY Mixer's Crew FB Group Cereal Challenge. Few tweaks from what I posted there, it had to be finished.\r\n\r\n**Cereals:** Berry crunch main note, LL cereal for the AP & marshmallows. *see subs* WF marshmallow (candy) for a little more fake marshmallow flavor. Fw bb to turn it into a boo berry type. \r\nMy one other thought on this that I've got on paper but not mixed yet just uses tpa crunch cereal & blueberry. If you get too much mixed berry you could probably sub that at about 2%. Lmk how it is if you do, I'm cerealed out for now.\r\n\r\n**Milk:** flv smoothie base for it's lemon tint to boost the blueberry & creaminess. Fa milk because it's the shit.\r\n\r\nDash of sweetener because it is a sweet cereal.\r\n \r\n\r\n**Steep:** Give 5-7 days for milk to do it's thing & meld with Smoothie Base. Like most things a week+ will give a better representation of what I was going for. Should be a nice blueberry heavy berry cereal w\\marshmallows.\r\nEnjoy ðŸ˜ŽðŸ’¨ðŸ’¨\r\nJoin DIY Mixer's Crew on Facebook!\r\nhttps://www.facebook.com/groups/dmcdiy\r\n\r\n**Subs\\additions:** I'm sure your favorite milk combo would work in place of the smoothie base\\fa milk combo. Would advise adding a little lemon though to make up for the lack of smoothie base to stay closer to original. I highly recommend this flavor though. \r\nTpa crunch cereal @ 2% instead of berry crunch if you hate it.\r\nThe wf marshmallow candy isn't a deal breaker in my eyes for this recipe to work, just helps to sell the marshmallow. Could probably be subbed (nothing real & not tpa. Also remember what's in lucky leprechaun to start)  or omitted.","steep_days":"7","temperature":"666","recipe_score":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-10T14:53:28.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"1224","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Milk","flavor_id":"523","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Smoothie Base","flavor_id":"10153","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Blueberry","flavor_id":"1201","vendor":"FW","millipercent":1900},{"name":"Berry Crunch","flavor_id":"136","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Super Sweet","flavor_id":"2384","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":250},{"name":"Lucky Leprechaun Cereal","flavor_id":"141","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2800},{"name":"Marshmallow (Candy) SC","flavor_id":"10264","vendor":"WF","millipercent":1300}],"reviews":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"172471","name":"Boo Berry Cereal - #DMC"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
