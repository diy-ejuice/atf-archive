Plain, Simple, and tasty!\r\n\r\nI had stumbled across the DIY or DIE show where Wayne talks about Water Malone. I've always wanted a simple watermelon flavor and never found it. I was super stoked to see all the positive feedback he got on it and wanted to give it mix. \r\n\r\nHowever, I didn't have a few of the flavors so I decided to give it a shot and replace what I didn't have with what I do.  I replaced the FLV Watermelon with Cap Sweet Watermelon, the TPA Dragon Fruit with INW Dragon Fruit, and the FLV Wild Melon with TPA Honeydew (because I'm a sucker for Honeydew vapes). I was well aware that changing these flavors around would drastically alter what he intended for the recipe to taste like but I was blown away with what the mix turned out to be.\r\n\r\nI've tacked all the missing flavors onto my list to order and am looking forward to mixing up the real Water Malone and seeing how they compare side to side.","steep_days":"1 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:50:28.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"4308","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Double Apple","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Honeydew","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Dragon Fruit - Pitaya","vendor":"INW","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Super Sweet","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":500},{"name":"Sweet Watermelon","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":3000}],"reviews":[{"user":"AlfredPudding","text":"This one is easily my favorite melon recipe so far. Full disclaimer that it’s not very similar to Water Malone, but that doesn’t matter. It’s such a bright and vibrant mix of flavors. The Double Apple does a fantastic job of adding to that vibrancy, and bringing some serious texture to the profile. I ordered INW Pitaya, and I’ve been a fan since. It’s a much more authentic dragon fruit than TPA’s and does some magic here. The combination of Honeydew and Sweet Watermelon adds an amazing candy-like melon top note, and keeps me coming back."}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"121410","name":"Watered Melons (Water Malone Remix)"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
