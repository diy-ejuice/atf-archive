FLV Butterscotch along with sweetness adds a gooey effect being a soft crack butterscotch. FLV Caramel helps to boost the butterscotch note, bringing depth and more sweetness to the recipe. At the heart of the profile is the cookie. CAP Sugar Cookie makes the base and FA Cookie adds the crunchy aspect. Then the combination of TFA Marshmallow and TFA Vanilla Swirl help to authenticate and round off the cookie by adding a creamy, yet eggy mouth feel to the over all profile. So there you have it, mix it up and enjoy. Please leave your feedback and follow me for my next creation. Thanks SK    \r\n","steep_days":"3","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"total_reviews":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T11:43:27.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"1795","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Butterscotch","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Caramel","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Sugar Cookie","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":5000},{"name":"Marshmallow","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":750},{"name":"Vanilla Swirl","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Cookie","vendor":"FA","millipercent":500}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"40972","name":"Butterscotch Cookiez "}}}
