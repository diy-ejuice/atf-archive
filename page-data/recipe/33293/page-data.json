It's a more vanilla-y creamy to me. \r\nNext I really wanted it to be just super creamy, so I tried to build a good heavy cream.\r\n\r\nCap Butter Cream \r\nA very rich, creamy flavor for me. Adds some of that butter I find in the truffles.\r\n\r\nFLV Cream \r\nAnother heavy cream, with some dairy and I think a little sweetness. The truffles are very creamy, I want to get as close to that as I can.\r\n\r\nTFA Marshmallow \r\nAdds to the mouthfeel, thickens it up some and adds in a bit of sweetness.\r\n\r\nTFA Sweet Cream \r\nAgain going for that super creamy taste, also a little sweetness and a touch of dairy.\r\n\r\nTFA Dairy/Milk\r\nA nice dairy note, I also get a little coolness from it. \r\nOIf course you need vanilla to make it all come together.\r\n\r\nINW - Shisha Vanilla\r\nA very nice vanilla, seems to blend the creams together well, really kicks up the vanilla.\r\n\r\n\r\nI think i'm pretty close with this, been working on it for a few weeks now.","steep_days":"5 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:49:08.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"1247","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"White Chocolate","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Butter Cream","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Cream","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Marshmallow","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Sweet Cream","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Shisha Vanilla","vendor":"INW","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Dairy/Milk","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1000}],"reviews":[{"user":"Deftohms","text":"After a shake it's delicious, I can tell that once it's steeped in it should taste even more spot on to the profile.
