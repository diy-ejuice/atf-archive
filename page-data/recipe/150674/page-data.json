Something was mentioned about either @ID10-t or I making a recipe based on the Demigorgon from Stranger Things.\r\n\r\nI took a purely conceptual route here, which is probably best when discussing the how's and why's of making a monster into a vape. That said, it really did turn into a monster in its own right.\r\n\r\n**WF SC Starfruit** - the face of our titular demigorgon. Pretty, and tasty, fruit for the face of a hideous beast.\r\n\r\n**FA Blood Orange** - The monster is, or should be, just about consistently soaked in the blood of its various victims, so a tasty bit of citrus from blood orange made as much sense as anything to me.\r\n\r\n**INW Shisha Strawberry & FA Red Touch** - Syrupy red strawberries working in lock step with the blood orange to really sell the viscous \"blood\" aspect.\r\n\r\n**FW Waffle & LB Belgian Waffle** - I sort of struggled to give this mix a bit of body at first, thinking on it for quite a while before it dawned on me: Eleven fucking **LOVES** Eggos. While this is not exactly an eggo, what it actually ends up as is a lightly cinnamon spiced waffle strong enough to stand up to the heavy fruit syrup piled upon it.\r\n\r\nThe Candy/Jammy Wizard is really just blending the fruits together into a cohesive whole, but at the same time \"Wizard\" does fit the motif of a fantastical scenario.","steep_days":"0 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":4,"updated_at":"2020-12-12T15:40:35.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"1824","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Starfruit SC","flavor_id":"8379","vendor":"WF","millipercent":1750},{"name":"Blood Orange","flavor_id":"7698","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Belgian Waffle","flavor_id":"1478","vendor":"LB","millipercent":3500},{"name":"Waffle","flavor_id":"1457","vendor":"FW","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Shisha Strawberry","flavor_id":"1711","vendor":"INW","millipercent":2250},{"name":"Red Touch (strawberry)","flavor_id":"421","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Jammy/Candy Wizard","flavor_id":"9955","vendor":"FA","millipercent":500}],"reviews":[{"user":"nowar","text":"Never seen Stranger Things, but this is a little strange for me. Not in a bad way at all. It's like you have this clear orange flavor with a light strawberry taste in but in the thickest syrup ever. Homemade syrup that just jellied when it cooled into a delicious oopsie. I'm guessing it's that starfruit that gives it a clean fruit sweet that's just right for me. The only part that I'm less happy about is the waffle layer. I simply want more. If I were to say anything I would change if i mixed this again it would be to maybe crank up the LB a little bit to get that half or the whole portion to catch up to the rest. Some of the waffley spice notes would cut the gummy just that hair to make this perfect imo. But, hey, I love waffle so I'm partial to this profile, waffle and maybe just a little bit of a heavy hand. Clever write up, fo.","score":5},{"user":"ID10-T","text":"Fun! It really does taste otherworldly, a tart-and-sweet fruit that doesn’t exist, which I think is essential with such an inspiration. I didn’t know FA Candy/Jammy Wizard could work so effectively as a blender but now that I’ve tried it, it makes sense that it would, and seems to be doing it well here, or something is. I don’t get a waffle, though. There’s some syrupy-iness that doesn’t quite come clearly across and maple and some bakery that doesn’t really read waffle, although it does feel nice and full which is what it was picked for to begin with, apparently. Also that rumored spice note seems to have gotten obliterated by steeping for almost a month but that’s ok. I think it might be better off without it? It’s interesting enough the way it is, as it goes from bright and tart fruity juicy down to dark and sweet heavy syrupy and a little bready over the course of an exhale, all with plenty of flavor and no gaps.  ","score":4},{"user":"eyemakepizza","text":"Demigorgon&#xD;\n&#xD;\nAn enigma is “a thing that is mysterious, puzzling, or difficult to understand.” This recipe is the perfect example of an enigma. I genuinely have no clue what’s going on here. It’s fruity. It’s dark and syrupy but it’s also bright and citrusy. I fucking love it. Now I’m not gonna lie, I taste virtually no waffle here. Not even a hint. However, I don’t necessarily think that’s a bad thing. This works and it works so damn well. I’m not too sure how this would all taste on top of waffles. It very well could work but I genuinely like this the way it is. Here’s where I’m torn. Based on the intention I’d have to say 4 stars for the missing waffle. But I just can’t justify robbing this of 5 stars because it tastes amazing.","score":5}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"150674","name":"The Demigorgon"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
