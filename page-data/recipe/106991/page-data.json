I made it during the \"cold wave\" that hit Europe last February but due to the weather, I wasn't inspired to vape or publish it.  Now however, we're experiencing a \"heat wave\" and this cool refreshing mix goes down beautifully in the scorching sun.  So mix this up, get out in the sun, slap on factor 30 and chill.\r\n\r\n \r\n4% CAP Lemon Lime is livened up with  1.5% CAP Juicy Lemon and 0.5% TFA Key Lime. I needed a sweetener but it was muting the flavour somewhat. However, 0.5% TFA Honeysuckle came in handy and sweetens this up as well as blending everything. 2% VTA Fizzy Sherbet adds the fizz. \r\n\r\nUse cooling agent of your choice.  0.35% FA Polar Blast also works great. Nice as a S& V but blends better after an overnight's steep.\r\n\r\n","steep_days":"1 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":4,"updated_at":"2020-12-12T18:29:54.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"2030","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Fizzy Sherbet","flavor_id":"8878","vendor":"VT","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Lemon Lime","flavor_id":"83","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Honeysuckle (pg)","flavor_id":"306","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Juicy Lemon","flavor_id":"79","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Key Lime","flavor_id":"241","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":500},{"name":"WS-23","flavor_id":"8085","vendor":"OTHR","millipercent":500}],"reviews":[{"user":"ID10-T","text":"First of all, it’s delightful. I love this recipe. And I’m glad someone used my silly little recipe as a building block to create something they liked and thought was worth sharing. But, it’s not a Spot-On 7 Up for me. Even at just half a percent, the honeysuckle stands out. It’s like having a glass of cold 7 up with a sprig of honeysuckle with several flowers on it to make it fancy AF. Again, I love that, but it might not be for everyone. ","score":4}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"106991","name":"7 NUP"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
