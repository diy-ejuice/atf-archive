They are simple and the key thing that differentiates them from pancakes (besides being thin) is butter. Crepes use a decent amount of melted butter right in the batter. \r\nThis is a sweet and light mix. The crepe itself is light and subtle and raspberry filling is more like a compote that you added some fresh strawberries and raspberries to. It is decent as a shake n vape but for best results, give it a week to come together more.\r\n\r\nCrepe (SC) (WF) 2% / Butter Tart (SC) (WF) 0.5%:\r\nCrepe WF is an excellent flavor, its light, slighting doughy, with a hint of spices. Its lacking a bit however so the Butter Tart is there to back it up. Butter Tart smells funky out of the bottle, its not a great smell to be honest but it is a solid flavor in low dose for its use here. Since crepes are buttery, and Crepe WF isn't, the Butter Tart is used to add the butter and backup the spices a bit more. Thank you RageIsALotOfWork for turning me on to this flavor!\r\n\r\nRaspberry Shisha (INW) 1.5% / Sweet Strawberry (JF) 1% / Milk & Honey (FLV) 0.5%:\r\nI struggle to taste raspberries the same way many cant taste strawberries. Please feel free to try this with other raspberries if you have one you favor more. The combo of raspberry and strawberry here is mainly there to help my taste buds pick up the raspberry more and make it pop a bit. The Milk and Honey is being used to slightly cream up and sweeten the fruits so it is more of a compote instead of just fresh fruit. Its also being used to sweeten the crepe a bit.\r\n\r\nMix it up and let me know what you think!\r\n#mixinvixens","steep_days":"5","temperature":"0","recipe_score":4,"total_reviews":2,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:49:57.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"2484","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Butter Tart SC","vendor":"WF","millipercent":500},{"name":"Crepe SC","vendor":"WF","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Milk & Honey","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":500},{"name":"Shisha Raspberry","vendor":"INW","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Strawberry Sweet","vendor":"JF","millipercent":1000}],"reviews":[{"user":"ObiWanCannoli","score":"3","text":"Sorry but I'm just not feeling this one. There's something weird going on between the raspberry shishas sharp acetone note and the butyric funk of the butter tart was is a bit nauseating to me after a while. The recipe is not horrible by any means, and I was able to vape it a fair bit but I believe there could have been a much better choice of key flavors. The crepe isn't too bad a flavor on its own even with the somewhat out of place spices but I feel that this particular raspberry doesn't belong in this recipe. I could see just plain ol raspberry(INW) working somewhat better but I would personally be using a more spice friendly fruit such as banana, peach, apple...instead. Also, I would nix the butter tart in favor of a similar % of TFA butter or maybe 1% CAP butter cream. I should add that I tried this recipe as a snv and periodically all the way to a 2 month steep with only a slight improvement of the off notes. On the plus side,  the percentages seemed decent and the flavors were fairly defined in this recipe, just not a winner for me."},{"user":"SteamOn","score":"5","text":"When I seen crepe in the recipe, I knew I had to mix this. I'm glad I did. This is a soft and light flavor that's enjoyable through the day and especially following a heavy dinner."}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"89096","name":"ExclusiveGirl's Raspberry Crepes #mixinvixens"}}}
