Guanabana or soursop seems to have some medicinal benefits. Never actually had soursop pudding but it is a thing apparently.   \r\n**If there was a medicine that cured a spectrum of illnesses this is what I'd like it to taste like**  \r\nI am a pot user, and I strongly believe in its medical properties. I use thc and cbd to treat pain, mild insomnia and hypertension. My wife also uses CBD to treat her anxiety and I must say that it seems to have helped more then her prescription junk.  \r\nFLV Soursop very much like their guanabana but to me has an earthy muskiness to it. The way I see it is, Guanabana is like a finished commercial product of guanabana and soursop is ripping a guanabana off a tree in Puerto Rico and eating it. Guanabana is very acidic heavy which is where the \"sour\" comes from. Earthy plus acidic brings me to next ingredient.  \r\nFLV Yakima Hops, this flavor reminds me a lot of the terpenes that I come across in my THC use.  Citrusy, piney and earthy all my favorite characteristics of some medical herb. In vape form it lends a refreshing and interesting mouthfeel. This ingredient is great with tropical fruits IMO.  \r\nThe tiny amount of coconut plus custard and pudding is what makes up the cream/pudding base.  \r\nHoneysuckle was added to this recipe early on because it was the only thing i had close to floral. Turns out I dropped down the % and it instead acts as an \"enhancer\" to that tropical fruit.  \r\nIm interested to see if anyone enjoys this like I do\r\nConcrete River named me \"Lord of the Custard Apples\" thats when I realized maybe I should throw this on ATF.","steep_days":"5","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"total_reviews":3,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:49:12.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"3156","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Soursop","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":2750},{"name":"Honeysuckle (pg)","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Vanilla Pudding","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":3500},{"name":"Custard","vendor":"INW","millipercent":750},{"name":"Coconut","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":200},{"name":"Yakima Hops","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":500}],"reviews":[{"user":"jbird","score":"5","text":"This is super interesting. Sometimes the soursop very forward. Other times, the honeysuckle gets pushed to the front. The Yakima hops does a nice refreshing backnote. This pudding base is delicious. I don't really taste much coconut but it gives the pudding so much body . I'll be stealing this base and for that, you get 5 stars. Great job!"},{"user":"ConcreteRiver","score":"5","text":"ID10-T is only partly wrong.  The pudding base is indeed fantastic, but the secret sauce here is definitely that Soursop and Hops. Seriously, a pretty inspired combination and the earthiness and bitter edge makes this so much more interesting than a straight guanabana pudding would be.   Between this and Batido de Guanabana, you can just have the custard apples."},{"user":"ID10-T","score":"5","text":"I didn't dislike the hopped-up soursop here, but unlike ConcreteRiver, I didn't love it either. These five stars aren't for that part. They're for that bangin' pudding base of FLV Coconut, INW Custard, and FLV Vanilla Pudding. I can't wait to throw a bunch of different tropical fruits (separately, not at the same time) at that yummy pudding base and see which one is the most delightful.
