I made a couple of tweaks to the recipe. Did not change flavor but a little less on certain flavors and more on others. I used the RY4 Double at 3 % and the milk chocolate at 3.5% and upped the FA caramel to 1% and lowered Sweetner to .3 % The flavor so far after just 3 days of steep time is very good. It's got a perfect balance of chocolate and Carmel and the flavors really come out making this a very delicious recipe. I can see myself vaping this all morning with my coffee overall I would say recipe is a 4.5 out of 5. Thanks for this great recipe. I'm really enjoying it. ","score":4},{"user":"LocoMojo","text":"Very pleasurable variant of Cuprian, honestly I believe this recipe stands on its own and enjoy it more than Cuprian. The subtle sweetness of the chocolate, VBIC, and marshmallow on the inhale gives way to a robustly rich exhale with hints of chocolate bakery on the exhale. The RY4 double brings a slight tobacco note on the end, but as we all know even though RY4 isn't a powerfully strong tobacco it is extremely flexable and easy to work with. The meringue does a good job at general sweetness in the recipe and adding a little extra creaminess. The hint of FA Caramel pairs very nice with the RY4, being most noticeable on the end of the exhale mixing in well with the slight smokiness of the tobacco. Im usually not a fan of sweetener, but in this mix I find it really compliments the recipe well and is by no means overwhelming. If you want to opt out of the sweetener, I would maybe up the TPA Meringue to 1-1.5%. The only con about this mix is that I only mixed 30ml and after the 8 day steep I pretty much polished the bottle off within a day and a half. Since then I have mixed up another 60ml and am currently waiting until I can put it back into my ADV rotation.&#xD;\n&#xD;\nFor steeping I would definitely let this one sit AT LEAST 5 days, preferably 7-10 days. I don't think this is a SnV by any means mainly because of the almost alcoholic nature of unsteeped RY4 Double and FA Caramel. Mix this baby up and let it sit in a cabinet somewhere for a week, you will not regret it. Awesome Mix.","score":5}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"16375","name":"Choco-Chip RY4"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
