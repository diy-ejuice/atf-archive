I wanted to create a light chocolate chip flavor with a peanut side note. \r\nFW sugar cookie 1%. Used as the cookie base and adds a slight sugary note\r\nFA cookie 1%. Used also as cookie base and to add texture\r\nCAP vanilla whipped cream 2%. Used to balance out the chocolates and adds a creaminess to the profile.\r\nCAP vanilla custard 2%. Used to make the recipe a little denser and to add an eggyness to the profile.\r\nTPA pie crust 1%. This was the first time using this flavoring but hoping it will add to simulating the \"cookie dough\" .\r\nTPA Brown sugar 0.5%. Used to add a dark sugar for the chocolate.\r\nFLV peanut butter 1%. Just a bit of peanut. It seems to be a little dry but at 1% it seems balanced with the CAP golden butter at 1%.\r\nTPA sweetener 1.5%. Well who don't like sugar.\r\nCAP Golden butter 1%. This seems to give the FLV peanut butter the creaminess it requires.\r\nTPA bittersweet chocolate 0.5%. I like to use this flavoring at a low % to give it a chocolate chip feel.\r\nTPA double chocolate (clear) 1%. This pairs well with the TPA bittersweet chocolate to give the chocolate a more balanced flavor.\r\n\r\nI may not have nailed the cookie dough base in this recipe, however, it has a great flavor with hints of chocolate and peanut butter on the exhale. Can be a Shake n Vape but I would suggest a 3 day steep. This is a first version. I normally post my first versions of recipes and keep 2nd or 3rd versions private for commercial purposes. MaxVG ....Enjoy :)\r\n","steep_days":"3 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T11:43:28.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"2248","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Sugar Cookie","flavor_id":"1426","vendor":"FW","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Cookie","flavor_id":"490","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Vanilla Whipped Cream","flavor_id":"1","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Vanilla Custard","flavor_id":"131","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Pie Crust","flavor_id":"179","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Brown Sugar","flavor_id":"313","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Peanut Butter","flavor_id":"607","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Sweetener","flavor_id":"339","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Golden Butter","flavor_id":"60","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Bittersweet Chocolate","flavor_id":"146","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Double Chocolate (clear)","flavor_id":"158","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1000}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"42681","name":"Dough Me "}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
