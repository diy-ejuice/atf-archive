In your face banana off the shake, but no complaints outta me. Really creamy exhale.  I tested again after 10 days and the cheese cake showed up and adds another layer.  Personally this reminds me of the Huntz or Heinz Banana puddings that would come in the 4 pack for a buck.  Very good overall, very sweet. Next mix I will drop the super sweet a bit.  Nice recipe."}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"107251","name":"Monkey Ballz"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
