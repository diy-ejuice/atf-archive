I started researching culinary recipes that used it, and I came across a AF & Peach Rice Pudding. So I figured I would take a stab a creating an ejuice using that profile. Though i have never taste a feijoa in real life. I think i did a pretty good job in creating a great tasting ejuice out of it.\r\n\r\nVTA Apollo Feijoa: This stuff wasn't as potent as I hoped I single flavor tested this at 6% and didn't get any weird off notes. The recommended single flavor range according to vta is 5%-9%. Range for mixing is 1%-5%. So I went with AF at 3% that way I could still taste. Through the vanilla cream, rice, and peach.\r\n\r\nFA Peach: it is one my favorite peachs i own. I used it at 1.5% so it would push through the rice and pudding.\r\n\r\nFE Sweet Rice: I stole this from @Shyndo. I had a problem with losing this in the steep & to the other ingredients . Shyndo uses it at 5% in his Mango Sticky Rice to ensure that doesn't happen. I tried it in here at it worked out great and solved my rice problem.\r\n\r\nFLV Vanilla Pudding: This is my best pudding option I own & I believe it works great in here at 2%","steep_days":"7 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-10T17:57:22.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"848","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Sweet Rice","flavor_id":"7727","vendor":"FE","millipercent":5000},{"name":"Apollo Feijoa","flavor_id":"8820","vendor":"VT","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Vanilla Pudding","flavor_id":"4433","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Peach","flavor_id":"542","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1500}],"reviews":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"92518","name":"APRP (Apollo Peach Rice Pudding)"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
