Similar to Banana Laffy Taffy. This was inspired by Wayne's Ice cream base.\r\nFlavor notes:\r\nVBIC & Vanilla Custard make for a great creamy ice cream like base.\r\nI add LA Carmel to my ice cream base to give it a deeper richness.\r\nThe amount of banana I use is minimal because it is so strong. It has a candy-like taste unlike a banana cream. Paired with the ice cream base it gives it a Laffy-Taffy candy perception.\r\nSteep time is around 1 week but can be vaped as a shake and vape\r\nThis is a maxvg recipe\r\n\r\n\r\nEnjoy\r\n\r\n","steep_days":"7","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-05T18:47:05.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"2120","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Vanilla Bean Ice Cream","flavor_id":"186","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Caramel","flavor_id":"929","vendor":"LA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Vanilla Custard","flavor_id":"131","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":500},{"name":"Ripe Banana","flavor_id":"269","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1000}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"29420","name":"Banana Balls"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
