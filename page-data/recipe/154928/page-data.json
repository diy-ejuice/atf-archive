I figured it must be ALRIGHT, so I decided to stick an edgy band name on it and publish it for the community that I'm honestly not really active in anymore in case any one wanted to give it a shot and also enjoyed it.\r\n\r\nThis is just a \"prickly peach\" type recipe that is an extremely easy vape in the summer due to the light fruity taste and WS-23 (I think this shit is literal crack and literally every single mixers \"secret weapon\" when mixing for non-mixers)\r\n\r\nPrickly Peach - FA Peach White, FA Fuji, and INW Cactus\r\n\r\nI think we all can agree (or at least we did a year ago when I was current on all the flavors out there) that FA Peach White is probably the most throat friendly peach out there, its definitely the go-to peach, and the primary note in this recipe at 2%. \r\nINW Cactus brings the staple \"prickly\" aspect. At 0.75% you are getting the density, the juice, and a slight aloe note; all of these also help to further cut the \"harshness\" of the peach. \r\nWho doesn't fucking love FA Fuji in any fruit mix? If you raise your hand I'll call you a fucking liar to your face.  At 1% this is going to help hold all the fruit notes together and also add a slight indication of \"tartness\" (you know, that note that we can't actually simulate but try desperately to)\r\n\r\nThe Nonsense - TPA Dragonfruit \r\n\r\nI mean its TPA Dragonfruit, you know the business. This is just there as an emulsifier that at 3% adds a little extra \"umph\" and pineapple notes. You could likely sub this out for INW Pineapple at 2% if you are feeling boujie, I personally used TPA Dragonfruit because it was cheaper and I had it in more abundance. I think both flavorings are great at doing the same thing, if you want a stronger pineapple note go with INW Pineapple.\r\n\r\nThe Aesthetic - TPA Sweetener & WS-23\r\n\r\nThis is all up to you baby. I prefer TPA Sweetener because its not as sickly sweet as CAP SS. I also think that it goes better with fruits than CAP SS. \r\nThe percentage of WS-23 is actually toned down in this compared to what I actually make for my psychotic friends. Some of them request that shit to be like legit ice cubes. I have gone upwards of 1.5% for these people before and they love it...that being said I think if you go over 0.75% you are going to be crushing a lot of your fruit notes and at that point you might as well be mixing WS-23, Sweetener, and Nicotine for this recipe because there is no way in hell you are tasting anything in that glacial cavity you call a throat.\r\n\r\nShake and Vape ready, probably best after 1-3 days, last forever and doesn't get too wacky after a few weeks. Enjoy it....or not \r\n","steep_days":"3 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T15:21:44.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"1201","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"WS-23 Cooling Agent 10%","vendor":"VT","millipercent":500},{"name":"Peach White","vendor":"FA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Cactus","vendor":"INW","millipercent":750},{"name":"Apple Fuji","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Dragonfruit","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Sweetener","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1000}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"154928","name":"Young And In The Way"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
