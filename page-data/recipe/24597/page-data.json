Milk and honey and Bavarian cream come together to sweeten and give a little body to the rest of the recipe. \r\n\r\nSoho and tobacco come together for a fantastic cigar flavor. The addition of FLV peanut butter gives this recipe and almost cigarette flavor.\r\n\r\nThat little bit of whiskey finishes off the profile what is New Year's Eve without a little alcohol. \r\n\r\nParty hard my friends hope you enjoy.","steep_days":"1 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"total_reviews":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-02T09:25:28.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"3315","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Soho","vendor":"FA","millipercent":6000},{"name":"Bavarian Cream","vendor":"JF","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Cured Tobacco","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Peanut Butter","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Milk & Honey","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Whiskey","vendor":"FW","millipercent":250}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"24597","name":"Party ho "}}}
