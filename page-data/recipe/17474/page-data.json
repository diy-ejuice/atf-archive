I lowered the CDS down to meld together with the apple and create a \"baked cinnamon apple\" and the strawberry ripe is there to round it out and be just a bright fruit to and I bent the apple with the cinnamon to make the cinnamon play with the strawberry. \r\nMy \"pantry\" ingredients: \r\nI used Liquid amber to create the \"jam\" consistency it helps bend the cinnamon to work with the strawberry. I used Sugar Cookie to give the Sweet bakery taste that jam has. I am not sure how to describe that. And FA Meringue is to add just a hint of sugar to the whole thing  ","steep_days":"0","temperature":"0","recipe_score":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-11T14:15:40.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"1735","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Cinnamon Danish Swirl","flavor_id":"35","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Strawberry (ripe)","flavor_id":"271","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Fuji","flavor_id":"506","vendor":"FA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Liquid Amber","flavor_id":"476","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Sugar Cookie","flavor_id":"115","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Meringue","flavor_id":"530","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000}],"reviews":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"17474","name":"Baked Apple Strawberry Jam"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
