We played manhunt, freeze tag, suicide, handball, stickball, football, hockey, basketball , riding bikes and other games we made up. \r\n\r\nThe Mr Softee knew when we were finished with dinner and came through like clockwork. We could hear that jingle blocks away.\r\nhttps://m.youtube.com/watch?v=zzodaDCD798\r\n As we got older the mister softee dude started selling us more then just ice cream. Alcoholic slushies and weed. \r\n\r\nMy go- to off that menu was vanilla ice cream in a cone with rainbow sprinkles for $1.25. \r\n\r\nMY CONE\r\nMy cone consists of OOO sugar cone and jf biscuit. Standalone sugar cone is spot on to those cheap cones you can get in a box, in a mix its pretty are to get that flavor to shine through. I believe a small amount of jf biscuit helps see it through the mix without turning it TOO buttery.\r\nICE CREAM \r\nTfa vbic pur condensed milk and flv van bean do a great job of making a thick, rich, and sweet ice cream. Such a good combo that i recommend ppl try out. Flv vanilla bean works alot like vanillin. You cant taste it alone it doesnt have a base but can really enhance other vanillas that might already be in the recipe.\r\nSprinkles\r\nFw sprinkles is great if you are tryin to add a funfetti element to your cakes. Here there is nothing off about it.. added sweetness a bit of chalkyness. Another light flavor thts why i had to crank it up to achieve the results i wanted. It kinda reminds me of cake too much but its still delicious.\r\nGive this a try and id live any feedback..my wife says she even feels like a coolant going on here..but she be buggin.

Very accurate and subtle enough to be an ADV. FW Sprinkles is a pretty realistic flavour that adds a nice waxy candy sprinkle to the mix. Well done DeeJayMills!"},{"user":"mlNikon","text":"Ok, so I waited for a month before I wrote this review to see how it steeps out and I am really impressed! This is a very tasty mix and that sugar cone is still very present which I am really happy about.
