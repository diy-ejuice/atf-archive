What a time to be alive! It seems like a perfect combination of flavors to be exactly that. It’s one of those things you didn’t know you needed until you had it. Also fits the bill for a brighter than average, warmer weather worthy cigar vape. I only like Abuela a little more because I like mango and vanilla more than blood orange and elderflower; this recipe is every bit as good and I can’t believe I’m the first person to give it these well-deserved 5 stars.
