I made this based on the profile before the commercial liquid was released so it isn't exactly as the original. However after getting a bottle of the original I think I prefer this mix.\r\n\r\nFlavour Notes:\r\n\r\nThe Crumble Base\r\n\r\nFa Pandoro, Cap sugar cookie, Cap golden butter, Cap Cereal 27 and Cap graham Cracker V1\r\n\r\nThis base has been a work in progress for a good six months and is good to use as a base to layer other flavours in for your preferred Crumble recipe. (try it with 1.5% Flv apple filling) \r\n\r\nThe Pandoro and golden butter give the light cake / buttery element of the Crumble with the sugar cookie and graham cracker giving the biscuit notes. \r\n\r\nCereal 27 really helps to create the authentic Crumble flavour and also helps to meld the buttery and biscuit elements together.\r\n\r\nThe Blackberry Filling\r\n\r\nTPA - blackberry works well on top of the Crumble base and give a vibrant jammy type of blackberry which sits nicely as the top note in this recipe. I find tpa's blackberry as three best choice for this recipe even though I don't think Dinner Lady are using it in their recipe. Fa blackcurrant is used just to add further jam like feel and texture to bend the blackberry into a cooked blackberry. \r\n\r\nAdditives\r\n\r\nSuper Sweet adds some sweetness and helps to add vibrancy to the mix\r\n\r\nAP is not essential as there is a fair bit in the cereal 27 but this helps the texture of the mix and to help keep the layers separate.\r\n\r\nHope you guys enjoy and if you mix it up please let me know your thoughts","steep_days":"3 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:49:47.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"6647","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Blackberry","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Cereal 27","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Acetyl Pyrazine 5%","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Pandoro","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Sugar Cookie","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Golden Butter","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Blackcurrant","vendor":"FA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Graham Cracker","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Super Sweet","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":600}],"reviews":[{"user":"lolneur0","text":"Man i love this, great job with this one!"},{"user":"whthek","text":"I’ve had this in my ‘favorites’ since I first mixed it in July ‘18. I had already been buying it online and crossed my fingers that this recipe would be ‘close enough’ to the branded liquid. Never had Pandoro so I sub’d CAP Funnel Cake and it’s been great(all 7 bottles). I finally got my paws on the Pandoro and wish I’d done it sooner. All the pieces of the puzzle fit now and it’s simply a fantastic clone! Thanks so much for sharing and sorry it took so long to write about it."},{"user":"cdaniell30","text":"I wanted to hate this because of my general disdain for tfa blackberry, but I can't.  Something between the blackcurrant and the citrus of the pandoro bend it into something I can enjoy, and enjoy it I did.  The bakery layer is excellent as well.  Truthfully, to me this is overall a 4-star recipe, but I gotta throw the extra star for the excellent bakery layer and for making an awful blackberry palatable.  Unless this was a happy accident, I can only imagine the amount of work this took."}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"79142","name":"#REMIXMONTH - Dinner Lady - Blackberry Crumble "}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
