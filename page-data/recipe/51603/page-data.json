If you really like this ingredient (I wouldn't blame you) you can bump this one up.\r\n\r\n**FW Hazelnut**\r\nUsed as a texture base note for the creams.\r\n\r\n**TFA Cheesecake Graham Crust**\r\nInherently contains a touch of coconut (which isn't present via taste) that adds to the body of the mix. Softens sharp notes, rich, thick, and creamy\r\n\r\n**FA Cookie**\r\nDeep, Warm, Butter cookie notes.\r\n\r\n**FA Meringue**\r\nUsed as a minor sweetener to FA Cookie and the other bakery notes, At 0.5% we avoid the meringue flavor.\r\n\r\n**FA Cream Fresh**\r\nThe last revision of this mix lacked a bit of body, Cream Fresh helps fluff it up without deterring from the profile.\r\n\r\n**FA Vanilla Tahity**\r\nVanilla body, Nearly undetectable notes of almond and marzipan to add intrigue to the recipe.\r\n\r\n**CAP Super Sweet**\r\nOptional, But I like this mix better with a sweeter tone.\r\n\r\n**Edited 6/20**\r\nAccidentally made a previous version live, Now updated to the final version. Sorry for the confusion.","steep_days":"7","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:49:24.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"2969","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Cream Fresh","flavor_id":"540","vendor":"FA","millipercent":750},{"name":"Vienna Cream","flavor_id":"516","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Pistachio","flavor_id":"293","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":3250},{"name":"Hazelnut","flavor_id":"1312","vendor":"FW","millipercent":500},{"name":"Cheesecake (graham Crust)","flavor_id":"152","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Cookie","flavor_id":"490","vendor":"FA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Meringue","flavor_id":"530","vendor":"FA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Super Sweet","flavor_id":"2384","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":500},{"name":"Vanilla Tahity","flavor_id":"555","vendor":"FA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Butterscotch (natural)","flavor_id":"1219","vendor":"FW","millipercent":1500}],"reviews":[{"user":"Billywilly","text":"I made a couple tweaks, but this is an amazing profile.
