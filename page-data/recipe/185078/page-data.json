Dry enough to define the cookie but wet enough with the butter in there to keep you coming back for more. Definitely a lip licker. Cookies are so hard to nail down but this exceeds the mark. Perfect off a shake, steep time isn’t needed but doesn’t hurt either.","steep_days":"0 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:51:23.000-05:00","best_vg":"%","views":"677","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Butter","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Cheesecake (graham Crust)","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Cinnamon Crunch","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Cinnamon Spice","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":750},{"name":"Cookie","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Super Sweet","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":500}],"reviews":[{"user":"Jonnycoldcutz","text":"Wow I can not put this one down! I made your dutch apple pie recipe as well and it was great. I'm definitely following for more recipes. But this snickerdoodle one is probably the best thing I ever vaped! The cookie butter taste and cinnamon really knock it out of the park. I need to order more flv cinnamon crunch and make a 100ml of this asap. Almost vaped 40mls of this stuff since yesterday. First the 10ml tester than a 30ml bottle. When I stock up I'll definitely be making 2 bottles. 1 to steep and 1 to vape right away. But this time around I couldn't resist after the shake, it is that good"}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"185078","name":"Snickerdoodle "}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
