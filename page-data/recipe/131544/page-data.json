I came up with this last autumn, when I wanted summer back in my life, but itâ€™s taken a fair few iterations to get it balanced. \r\n\r\nThe Aurora is here to add a little carbonated zing to the profile. You could alternatively sub in FW Pink Champagne around 1% for a similar effect, but I like the brightness that Aurora brings here. \r\n\r\nEverything else should be self-explanatory. The pineapples offer the main base, playing off the tart grapefruit from Inawera. \r\n\r\nItâ€™s good off the shake, but I recommend giving it 4 days for everything to settle together.
