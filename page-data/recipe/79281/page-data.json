Simple and easy so I made one of my own.  \r\nCreamy and thick vanilla pudding type of recipe wit darker and forward vanilla notes.  Has a few spicy and nutty notes as well.  Simple recipe, but it meets my vanilla needs.

The vanilla has smoky spicy top-notes and the body fills out nicely. P.S. Sometimes I add 1.5% WF Crispy wafer to give it a bite.  Great work mate! "},{"user":"tw2k","score":"5","text":"Delicious.
