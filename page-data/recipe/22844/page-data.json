Harvest Berry and Forest Fruit don't fit together very well in my palate. This also didn't taste anything like Gatorade."},{"user":"TheJuiceJackBuilt","score":"5","text":"Fantasticly well balanced recipe. If berries are your jam, this is without doubt worth a mix. I added 1% of ws23 to it and its been my adv for a couple weeks now. Delicious, vibrant well crafted combination of fruits. Thank you.
