How about a prickly strap on? Sounds painful? Well, i'ts actually pretty tasty. \r\n\r\nSince I've received Inawera's Prickly Pear in my last order, I've been tinkering around with it a fair bit. Searching for a nice fit for a great flavor. And this is what I came up with. Many iterations later, this is my (for the foreseeable future) final version of the Prickly Strap On!\r\n\r\nINW Prickly Pear: \r\nThe main flavor. It's a bit like INW Cactus, but sweeter and more fruity. Just a great single flavor that, as it turns out, mixes really well with other ingredients.\r\n\r\nFA Red Summer & CAP Sweet Watermelon:\r\nThe first versions of this recipe only had Capella's Sweet Watermelon, and tough being pretty good on it's own, it really drowned in the other flavors. This is where FA's Red Summer comes in. Those two combined give the recipe a very nice watermelon base.\r\n\r\nCAP Sweet Strawberry & INW Shisha Strawberry:\r\nA similar story as mentioned with the watermelon, but this time I felt like the INW's Shisha Strawberry needed a little boost, and CAP's Sweet Strawberry really helps. I've also tried TPA's Strawberry and Strawberry (Ripe) in previous batches, but didn't liked it at all.\r\n\r\nFA Fuji:\r\nMy apple of choice. As many of you probably know, this flavor can be very overpowering. This is why there are no other apple flavors in here. In my opinion, this suffices to get the apple across in the recipe.\r\n\r\nI usually mix it with 0.5% WS-23 (10% dilution in PG). It's very sweet on it's own, so I don't recommend using any sweeteners. \r\nBut I'm not your dad, so make your own decision on that.\r\n\r\nIt's nice right off the shake, but for the full flavor experience I would recommend a 3 day steep at least.\r\n\r\nI hope you find as much enjoyment with this recipe as I have, and have a nice vape!","steep_days":"3 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"total_reviews":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T23:38:54.000-05:00","best_vg":"50%","views":"653","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Sweet Watermelon","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Shisha Strawberry","vendor":"INW","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Prickly Pear","vendor":"INW","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Fuji","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Red Summer (watermelon)","vendor":"FA","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Sweet Strawberry","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":2000}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"193779","name":"Prickly Strap On"}}}
