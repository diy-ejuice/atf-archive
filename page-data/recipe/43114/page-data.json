I fell in love with making something Oatmeal-flavored when I first tried Foo's Gold from the Plumes of Hazard. My first attempt was with TFA Oatmeal cookie and it was just awful, it tasted like burnt brown sugar and nothing else. I tried saving it by masking it with other flavors but that burnt taste stayed the same. I gave up on it for a long while, but after seeing a post on reddit of a guy making an inspired clone for foo's gold which used RF's Oatmeal Cookie I gave it a crack. The result was a great full-bodied Oatmeal flavor with some brown sugar as well. Single flavor tests were really promising but I made the mistake of getting the VG flavor. If you only have the VG flavor, you will need to use at least 8% and, at minimum, double the steep time of this (3-4 weeks total). The Super Concentrate was a life saver by having the same great flavor  but cutting the steep time in half. On to the notes!\r\n\r\nThe Cookie - JF Bicuit and RF Oatmeal Cookie make up the biscuit/cookie part of the recipe. RF Oatmeal cookie is a great standalone but it lacks the full cookie flavor I was going for, JF Biscuit brings out more of the baked cookie with a hint of biscuit and backs up RF Oatmeal Cookie well. Keep in mind this is the super concentrate, not the VG-based flavor. If you use the VG-based flavor, you will need to use 8% to replace it.\r\n\r\nRaspberry for the frosting - I've tried so many raspberries for this recipe. TFA Raspberry Sweet, INW Raspberry, and many others. All of them would start tasting like cough syrup after a while. So I sought inspiration from Real Flavors SC's again since I had good luck with them so far. RF's Black Raspberry Super Concentrate turned out to be a great choice as it's less tart then a normal raspberry.\r\n\r\nFrosting - Though I do like LA Cream Cheese Icing, I wanted to find an icing that I knew I already enjoyed and I felt was a more full-bodied, almost store bought frosting. I had been mixing Goldfish18's Dunkaroos for a while and knew his frosting base would be a great for this (Meringue, Holy Vanilla, and Vanilla Custard V1). I slightly boosted it to help it keep up with the Oatmeal Cookie. If you haven't given Dunkaroos a try here's the link below for proper credit to his frosting greatness. \r\n\r\nLink to Dunkaroos: https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/11276#dunkaroos_by_goldfish18\r\nUPDATE: Goldfish' frosting base also uses 1% FW Hazelnut. I've done some test batches with it and the malt note it adds is nice but overwhelms it a little. I would suggest starting at 0.5% and working your way up til you dig it. After personal testing 0.75% Hazelnut works for me, so I'm updating the recipe as such.\r\n\r\nEnjoy some Ruby's Oatz with a cup of coffee in the morning and you can't go wrong! I hope you all enjoy this as much as I have.","steep_days":"10","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"total_reviews":2,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:49:17.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"1996","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Vanilla Custard","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1750},{"name":"Meringue","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1250},{"name":"Holy Vanilla","vendor":"DFS","millipercent":1750},{"name":"Biscuit","vendor":"JF","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Black Raspberry – SC","vendor":"RF","millipercent":650},{"name":"Oatmeal Cookie – SC","vendor":"RF","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Hazelnut","vendor":"FW","millipercent":750}],"reviews":[{"user":"CygnusY1","score":"5","text":"This recipe got me on to usefulness of oatmeal cookie and is by far the best oatmeal cookie recipe out there..
