I could write a bunch of ballshit about how this compliments that and how this flavour bends this one. But honestly this was a mistake. One that I didn't much enjoy when I first vape it. BUT....... Couldn't stop vaping it. It's become a replacement for a real cigarette. She doesn't taste like one but hits the spot like a smoke dose. There is something about the wild/ outdoorsy/ ruggedness of it. The taste is.... Well enjoyable once you aquire a taste for it. But I cant be without it now. \r\n\r\nYou will see what I mean.
