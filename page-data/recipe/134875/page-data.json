Thanks for the updoots everyone!\r\n\r\nI asked AlfredPudding to help me make a juice for my sister, who has very different tastes from my own. He put together this nutty, robust and full-bodied unsweetened tobacco blend that turned out so great that I made a second large batch for myself. \r\n\r\nHere's Alfred on the details:\r\n\r\n\"Connecticut Shade is a darker, coffee-like and syrupy tobacco flavor. That pairs really well with Red Burley which is a more robust and dry nutty tobacco flavor that works into the Almond. RY4 Double adds a hint of dirty caramel without making the entire profile too sweet or cloying. Finally, Rice Crunchies is used as a modifier to make the whole thing seem more dry and nutty.\"\r\n\r\nWhenever I get burnt out on the sweet, fruity/dessert-oriented flavors that I typically vape, I load this into my tank.\r\n\r\nVariations I've tried and enjoyed: FA Hazelnut can replace the Almond. If you'd like to add a vanilla accent, 2% FA Vanilla Bourbon works well, either in place of or addition to Almond or Hazelnut.\r\n\r\nThanks for the recipe Alfred, your talent is matched only by your generosity!","steep_days":"7","temperature":"0","recipe_score":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-12T14:06:58.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"2747","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Ry4 Double","flavor_id":"379","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":750},{"name":"Rice Crunchies","flavor_id":"142","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Connecticut Shade","flavor_id":"4365","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":250},{"name":"Red Burley","flavor_id":"4355","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1250},{"name":"Almond","flavor_id":"528","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1750}],"reviews":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"134875","name":"Jo's Juice"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
