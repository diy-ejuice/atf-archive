A well rounded strawberry that stays bright and sweet that is great balance between an authentic and candy strawberry. Initially it is very strawberry forward but after a week or two the creams start to tone down the strawberry. \r\n\r\nCheesecakes used to add thickness and mouth feel and further emphasize the other creams. I made the decision to use creams rather than vbic for the cream note as I wanted to not add vanilla which for my pallete can further mute strawberry as it steeps. \r\n\r\nI suppose my creams could also be considered a stone as well. \r\n\r\n","steep_days":"0","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-05T04:15:36.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"2051","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Sweet Strawberry","flavor_id":"3073","vendor":"JF","millipercent":5000},{"name":"Sweet Strawberry","flavor_id":"121","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":5000},{"name":"Strawberry","flavor_id":"272","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Strawberry (ripe)","flavor_id":"271","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Strawberry","flavor_id":"668","vendor":"INW","millipercent":500},{"name":"Dragon Fruit - Pitaya","flavor_id":"652","vendor":"INW","millipercent":330},{"name":"Cream Whipped","flavor_id":"541","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Vienna Cream","flavor_id":"516","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Bavarian Cream","flavor_id":"1187","vendor":"FW","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Cheesecake","flavor_id":"1236","vendor":"FW","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Cheesecake (graham Crust)","flavor_id":"152","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":4000}],"reviews":[{"user":"Mr-G","text":"its ok"}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"8825","name":"Cream covered strawberry cheesecake"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
