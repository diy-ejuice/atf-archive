It is surrounded by a coconut layer. \r\n\r\nOk so this is one i havent seen around so far, so i wanted to take a (noobie) shot at recreating it in a vape. Raffaello's are probably one of my all time favorite confection, they are just so damn perfect. The thin wafer shell coated in a sweet milk kind of cream with little flakes of sugary coconut, on the inside of the wafer shell there is a buttery, smooth, light but rich cream that is just unreal. Buried in the creamy center lies a full almond, which just works perfectly! If you havent tried one in real life yet i highly recommend it, they are just perfect! I bought some for a reference while blueprinting this recipe, the main notes i was after was the nice crunchy wafer spehere, the buttery, smooth and delicious cream inside, the coconut outside and the almond inside. \r\n\r\n##### Flavor Notes:\r\n\r\n+  FA ALMOND - Used as the main almond flavoring in the mix. Trying to use it to emulate the almond in the core of the Raffaello\r\n+ INW BISCUIT -  This is being used in conjuntion with FA cookie to create the night light crunchy wafer sphere, also brings some nice butter notes to the recipe\r\n+ FA Coco (coconut) - the coconut note of the recipe, this one is a bit more realistic and more along the lines of what im going for in this mix. This will be trying to emulate the flakes of coconut that are covering the outside of the Rafaello. \r\n+ FA Cream Fresh - This one is being used to help back up the creamy notes and prevent the mix from becoming tooo dry. Help contribute to the creamy whipped cream kind of core. \r\n+ FA Meringue - Used to sweeten up the recipe, bring some dairy notes, and make the whipped cream center a nice fluffy sweet vanilla cream. \r\n+ INW Shisha Vanilla - Using as the main vanilla note, its a bright delicious vanilla which is exactly what im after in this recipe. \r\n\r\n##### Tasting Notes: \r\n###### First batch mixed on: \r\n###### Tasting notes Dec 6th - \r\nWow, this is actually starting to get really really tasty. Seems like i got lucky with the cream side of things, because it is tasting very similar to a real Raffaello. the bakery/wafer notes seem like they need to be more prominent, or maybe just need some more time to settle in with the creams. I get a nice smooth coconut texture, but i think this recipe could use a bit more actual coconut notes... gonna play around and see what i can do. Same goes for the almond, which i am considering adding some marzipan or maybe just subbing alltogether with something like toasted almond by TFA. Any suggestions are more than welcome!
