The Apple really shined through all the creams. The marshmallow, custard and creamy yogurt. Paired well together to make a really tasty cream base. I did sub some FLV sweetness @ 0.5% instead of the TPA Sweetener ","score":5},{"user":"Seef","text":"Simple and to the point. Nice mix of the sweet, acidity and yogurt. Although I personally have toned down the sweetener a bit. ","score":5},{"user":"cdaniell30","text":"This is perfect.  I was expecting a little more sour from the yogurt, but what I got was like biting into a fuji apple...except instead of a juicy, acidic bite I got a sweet, smooth cream.  This is definitely going into my list of bangers.","score":5}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"36304","name":"Apple Yogurt"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
