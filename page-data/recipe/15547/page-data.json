Now I used cantaloupe instead of mango because mango just hits me hard. This can work as a shake and vape if your in a hurry bit it hits maximum potential at 1 week. The capella and TFA cantaloupe work really well together so that it's not to bitter or overpowering. The Bavarian Cream and VBIC really give it that creamy chewy flavor and mouth feel like a Starburst has, and the marshmallow helps so that you don't have to use too much sweetener and if preferred you can even cut down on the sweetener.
