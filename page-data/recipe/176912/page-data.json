I find it humbling when I receive personal messages requesting a recipe due to that particular person enjoying my work so much. He‚Äôs a fan of custards so I wanted to make something a little different that‚Äôs definitely not your run of the mill custard profile but IMO tastes great. I like to think of this as a wintertime Creme Brulee  that kinda has some Christmas influences but not enough to put this recipe in a ‚ÄúChristmas time only‚Äù  category. I‚Äôm really enjoying this one it‚Äôs packed full of flavour without being to much for an ADV.  you can S&V this one however 3 days and up is where it‚Äôs at! Give it a mix and leave your rating and review for all to see. Merry Christmas bjorama and everyone else in our awesome DIY community and best wishes for 2020!!! üíô\r\n***SUBS***\r\nINW CREME BRULEE for VT CREME BRULEE @ 2.5%\r\nJF DULCE DE LECHE for TPA DULCE DE LECHE @ 1.5%\r\nCAP VC V2 for CAP VC V1 @ 3%","steep_days":"3 (SNV)","temperature":"","recipe_score":5,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:51:15.000-05:00","best_vg":"75%","views":"1245","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Corn Bread","vendor":"OOO","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Carmel (caramel)","vendor":"FA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Creme Brulee","vendor":"VT","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Vanilla Custard","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Dulce De Leche","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Graham Cracker","vendor":"FW","millipercent":1750},{"name":"Gingerbread","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Super Sweet","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":650}],"reviews":[{"user":"bjorama","text":"I could tell this one had some potential off the shake, but after a few days this one really turns into a winner.  Gingerbread mellows out and blends really well with the  cornbread and graham cracker.  Being a custard fan this one has a few curve balls thrown in that ended up  creating something really delicious.   It's almost like a spiced cake custard hard to describe.  I had to look up the definition of masala and that is a much better word to describe this tasty juice.  This is definately a FuriousMix top 3 juice.  I recommend mixing this one up and if you haven't already, mix up \"Game  Changer\" and \"Benito Del Custardo\".  Thanks for juice Furious, Xmas is a go now and New Years still on schedule!  LOL&#xD;\nI also forced one of my good friends who is partial to fruit and iced mixes to try this.  He told me it was the best \"custard\" I've forced upon him.  A bit backhanded but still a compliment."}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"176912","name":"Bjorama‚Äôs Masala "}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
