The chocolate mousse VT is excellent and can be vaped after a few days!  I added some marshmallow flavor for some wonderful fluffyness and that yummy marshmallow flavor.  The cream is there to add an additional milky creamy flavor to the mousse.  To get the wonderful mousse that's delicious and chocolately let it steep at least 2 weeks.  Very yummy!!  The FLV marshmallow can be subbed for FA Marshmallow at the same %","steep_days":"14","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-05T14:26:46.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"897","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Chocolate Mousse","vendor":"VT","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Cream Milky Undertone PG","vendor":"OOO","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Marshmallow","vendor":"OOO","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Marshmallow","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Shisha Vanilla","vendor":"INW","millipercent":1500}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"102010","name":"Marshmallow Moose "}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
