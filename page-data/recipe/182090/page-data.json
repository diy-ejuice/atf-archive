I'm going to keep this one short and sweet so we can get back to mixin'. This is hands down my favorite Vanilla Custard I've been vaping as of late, and if you know me, I mix my fair share of custards. This one is simple, uses fairly common and accessable ingredients (maybe not VT Vanilla Buttercream Frosting and FA Custard Premium, but if you don't have them you should), and packs a whole lot of flavor. I've approached this recipe as kind of a throwback, or an updated version of classic combinations. FA Custard Premium instead of CAP Vanilla Custard V1, INW Yes, We Cheesecake instead of TFA Cheesecake (Graham Crust)...you get the picture. It's about upgrades. At the end of the day it's super smooth and the thick vanilla cream takes center stage. Anyway, let's get to the recipe.\r\n\r\n*10% total, 2 week steep, and I add CAP Super Sweet because I want to. Add sweetener of your choice if that's your thing.*\r\n\r\nCustard base boys, and this one slaps. **FA Custard Premium** and **INW Custard** deliver a symphony of flavor, harmonious like Jordan and Pippen. These two were built for each other and brilliantly lay the groundwork for a dense, buttery and eggy cream. The decadent vanilla  starts to develop in this layer, which we will bolster with a few other choice concentrates. It's quite the canvas to work with.\r\n\r\n**VT Vanilla Buttercream Frosting** is without a doubt a serious banger. The bright vanilla is complex and rich in this frosting offering, and it plays wonderfully into our already developed base. Butter, creaminess, vanilla and sweetness. This one is a keeper, pick it up if you don't have it.\r\n\r\n**FA Vienna Cream** the mf'in OG. A classic concentrate when you want your cream silky smooth. It brings more vanilla and a velvety creaminess to our recipe that really helps our custard sing. I constantly find myself turning to this concentrate when I'm making cream recipes because it's so delicious. Downside? It brings the recipe to a two week steep. Worth it.\r\n\r\n**FLV Milk & Honey** can be tricky. For this recipe it adds depth, and brings our bright, in your face vanillas into balance. Lingering dark sweetness galavants throughout the vape that is a welcome addition and adds intrigue. It's a great flavor if you want to add a little mystery and sophistaction to your recipes.\r\n\r\n**INW Yes, We Cheesecake** brethren. Graham cracker and cookie notes. Graininess. Creaminess and body. This is a one stop shop of deliciousness and I'm hoping that most of you mixers have had the opportunity to play with this workhorse. Bakeries almost always work well in custards to solidify an awesome creamy body, and it shines here.\r\n\r\nAnd that's that. My newest Custard in 2020. It's simple enough, and packs a ton of flavor. I hope you all enjoy. Cheers.\r\n\r\n---SILKY---\r\n\r\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/etuik6/king_bling_a_vanilla_custard_for_2020","steep_days":"14","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"total_reviews":2,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:51:21.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"3842","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Custard Premium","vendor":"FA","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Custard","vendor":"INW","millipercent":1750},{"name":"Vanilla Buttercream Frosting","vendor":"VT","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Yes, We Cheesecake","vendor":"INW","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Milk & Honey","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":500},{"name":"Vienna Cream","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1250}],"reviews":[{"user":"cxxxxp","score":"none","text":"Agreed, old skool flavoured custard that is dark and syrupy sweet but thick and rich too. Very enjoyable, great flavour. I am a cream whore, I admit it, and I'm tempted to add some FLV cream or something to thicken this up a little but that's just me and this is a beautiful Custard. Great Job Silky I can't wait to mix up your other recipes, I think our tastebuds are related and Ive starred basically 3/4 of your recipes üòÇ keep it up!"},{"user":"KylezKloudz","score":"5","text":"Great job! Nice bold vanilla custard, kinda old skool in taste with the flavor combination but with a newer take... Not too eggy, just a great thick vanilla. üëç Another winner! üòÅ"}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"182090","name":"King Bling (Vanilla Custard)"}}}
