I can vape that stuff all day. If you don't like anise, don't even think of mixing this up.\r\nWith that out of the way: I've tried many commercial anise apple juices. But they were all lacking that certain \"something\" or were loaded to the brim with sweeteners. So I've decided to make my own anise apple recipe. And let's just say, after testing many apple flavors I think I nailed it with this mix. So let's get started:\r\n\r\nFA Anise: Just straight up the best anise flavoring on the market imo. Nothing more to say, i'ts mandatory for this mix and not replaceable.\r\n\r\nFA Fuji: As many of you know, it's the of the best apples on the market. It fits perfectly here at 2% to be present in the mix.\r\n\r\nINW Shisha Golden Apple: The secret weapon of the recipe. It's just an awesome apple and gives the recipe that little special something.\r\n\r\nCAP Double Apple: This is used here as the apple base and is a great flavor all around.\r\n\r\nI like to add 1% WS-23 (10% dilution in PG). You can decrease the amount or leave it out completely, you call.\r\n\r\nIf you love anise as much as me than this can easily be SNV. If not I would suggest a 5-7 Day steep to let the anise calm down a bit.\r\n\r\nHappy vaping and all hail to king anise!","steep_days":"5","temperature":"0","recipe_score":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-10T16:01:41.000-05:00","best_vg":"50%","views":"898","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Anise","flavor_id":"499","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Fuji","flavor_id":"506","vendor":"FA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Shisha Golden Apple","flavor_id":"827","vendor":"INW","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Double Apple","flavor_id":"45","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":4000}],"reviews":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"182632","name":"1 2 3 4 Anise Apples"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
