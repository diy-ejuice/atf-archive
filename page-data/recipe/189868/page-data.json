May need to work on percentages. \r\nProbably adding some Banana Nut Bread when I find it. \r\nPlenty of orange flavor. Banana is kinda light.\r\nTested with a Hadley with fused clapton at 45-50 watts. \r\nNice creamy body. Not harsh at all so far.\r\nI'll be updating in a few days.\r\nSo, wow. This is as good as I thought it should be,\r\nIt keeps getting brighter and the orange mellows out a little bit but doesn't really fade much.\r\nI like it quite a bit or a simple mix. Maybe drop down the creamsicle a bit.
