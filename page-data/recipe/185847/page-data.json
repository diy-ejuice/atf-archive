It was one of my favourite commercial juices before I went to DIY. At first I wanted to accomplish a 1:1 copy, but after a few people have said it tastes quite better. I decided to go ahead and run with that and make it even better.\r\n\r\nShoutout to @Foment_Life for giving the a tip on using CAP, it saved me a bunch of time. \r\n\r\nI've tested this on both DL and MTL and it works surprisingly well for both, tho it is a bit light in MTL devices. \r\n\r\n#####**Notes**\r\n\r\n**CAP Bubblegum** - This is actually one of my favourite bubblegums. I find it really nice in flavour and it does give a nice chalky mouthfeel like a cheap gum would. This does lack a bubblegum mouthfeel in chewiness, but thats not really important in this clone. This isn't really meant to be a main flavour of the recipe, it all more tumbles together into one weird flavour mix.\r\n\r\n**CAP Sweet Strawberry** - This strawberry is the perfect strawberry in this application. It sits on the lower end of the vape and is very light, but adds a nice undescript red sweetness that really just mingles in amazingly with the kiwi and bubblegum. \r\n\r\n**CAP Kiwi** - I personally haven't SFT'd this, but it's a pretty good kiwi for this recipe also, pretty sweet and almost candied kiwi flavour. It doesn't really bring in a natural kiwi at all, especailly with all the other sweetness going on, but it sits right in with CAP Sweet Strawberry and blends very well together as a very sweet strawberry kiwi mixture.\r\n\r\n**CAP Super Sweet** - Completely optional, but it won't *truly* be a commercial juice without a good amount of sweetener. I wouldn't doubt theres even more in the commercial juice. Feel free to use more, less, or none at all depending on your preferences. \r\n\r\nHope you enjoy this remix!
