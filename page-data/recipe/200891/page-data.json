If you've never had one you are truly missing out on one of the finest culinary inventions of the last decade. A cronut is a like a croissant and a donut had a baby. It's rich buttery layered pastry dough that's fried and filled with vanilla cream. read more about it here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cronut\r\n\r\nI have long dreamed about being able to vape this flavor and now you can too. \r\n\r\nThere are 3 main notes here.\r\n\r\nThe Buttery Flaky Pastry. VTA Croissant is exactly that.\r\n\r\nThe Crispy Fried Texture. FA Zeppola a fried cake donut does exactly what it needs to here. At 2% gives you a nice fried dough flavor without turning caky or muddling the recipe. \r\n\r\nThe Vanilla Cream. FLV Vanilla Pudding is so good. It's a dark dark vanilla. It's incredibly creamy and perfectly smooth at just 1%. It holds up well against all that butter and dough. \r\n\r\nI sweeten this recipe with 0.5% FW Sweetener. \r\n\r\nWatch the Video Here:\r\n\r\nhttps://youtu.be/2Eq_WF01gKI","steep_days":"7","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"total_reviews":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T17:36:28.000-05:00","best_vg":"80%","views":"790","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Zeppola","vendor":"FA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Croissant","vendor":"VT","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Vanilla Pudding","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1000}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"200891","name":"3-2-1 Cronut"}}}
