Saw this pic as posted on the mixenvixens fb page by a member and just had to have a crack at it. Also perfect for the Developed challenge ;)\r\n\r\nI love ID10Ts GTKK2019 and took some notes from him here but wanted it to be different enough to be my own thing. \r\n\r\nFlavor notes:\r\nI discovered the wf combo of sugar cone and crispy wafer awhile ago and its so damn good i had to try it in my version of a kitkat. Its crispy and sweet and perfect for this.\r\n\r\nWf white fudge and mb white chocolate paired together makes for a phenomenal WC note comparable or better than the fw/flv combo in my honest, humble opinion lol. Its my latest favorite go to. Discovered it while playing around with a WC snickers recipe I'm stuck on. \r\n\r\nApple filling is an OBVIOUS choice here. I'm sure the real chocolate bar has this sort of a vibe vs. fresh apples lol\r\n\r\nWF caramel rice crispy treats here is my secret weapon. This is my version of what i think this could taste like, not a spot on representation of the actuality of what the professional chocolateeres do.....so here, this adds to the overall experience. Caramel hides well behind WC so i used this higher at 2% but it should build right into the mix and just boost things up another level.\r\n\r\nI kept the sweetener low at first because of some of these flavors being sweet on their own.\r\n\r\nGonna let this sit a week before i even touch it. Edit* i lied I tried it lol apple pie was toooo overbearing at 1.25% so i realized quickly it needs to be way more in the back and balanced better. .75% hit much closer to the mark for me, I'm gonna let this one sit now,  im very hopeful.","steep_days":"7","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T17:36:25.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"608","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Apple Filling","flavor_id":"4376","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":250},{"name":"White Fudge SC","flavor_id":"8383","vendor":"WF","millipercent":2000},{"name":"White Chocolate","flavor_id":"10416","vendor":"MB","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Sugar Cone SC","flavor_id":"9050","vendor":"WF","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Crispy Wafer SC","flavor_id":"8366","vendor":"WF","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Sweetener","flavor_id":"1432","vendor":"FW","millipercent":500},{"name":"Caramel Rice Crispy Treats","flavor_id":"6047","vendor":"WF","millipercent":1500},{"name":"White Chocolate","flavor_id":"1462","vendor":"FW","millipercent":1500}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"197752","name":"WC Apple Pie KK #developedpie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
