Sometimes when striving for perfection or trying to recreate the wheel...we forget the pleasure of the simple things in life, like how good a glass of water tastes after going for a jog on a hot day. Well this is that glass of water (or cucumber water if you're a fancy rich person). It's mainly kiwi with the honeydew singing backup, not overly sweet or tart, and it's light, crisp and refreshing. While working outside yesterday in 95 degree weather, this was a simple pleasure to have on hand. "},{"user":"shyndo","text":"Cold, Sweet, Tart, Juicy, and refreshing. This hits every note you want in a summer recipe and it does it with nuance and transformative properties. Easily a 5 star recipe by an excellent mixer. I can already tell I'm going to be mixing up a 120 as soon as i polish off this 30."},{"user":"G-pots","text":"Great refreshing"},{"user":"ID10-T","text":"I had the pleasure of previewing this recipe before it was released and found it to be incredible. It starts with that tart crispness like biting into a skin-on kiwi but without the fur, followed by a satisfying deluge of sweet juicy goodness with an icy finish.  Great work, Apex!"}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"60351","name":"Sweet Summer Chilled"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
