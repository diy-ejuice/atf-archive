These quality beans  are then mixed with sugar cane rum, vanilla bean, and notes of caramel.\r\nThey combine perfectly to make an easy-sipping liqueur.\r\n\r\nDelicious description so i decided to serve it over a sweet melted vanilla ice cream. Enjoy!\r\n\r\nTook VTA Coffee Liqueur up to 8% to make it as thick as possible and added 2% VTA Light Rum to give an extra kick of booziness and rum flavour.\r\nLight rum also has a nice caramelic note that plays wonderfully in the mix.","steep_days":"3","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:51:07.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"725","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Coffee Liqueur","flavor_id":"8857","vendor":"VT","millipercent":8000},{"name":"Vanilla Ice Cream","flavor_id":"1511","vendor":"LB","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Super Sweet","flavor_id":"2384","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":500},{"name":"Vanilla Swirl","flavor_id":"189","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Light Rum","flavor_id":"8918","vendor":"VT","millipercent":2000}],"reviews":[{"user":"LB","text":"Really digging this recipe.  I originally mixed this with what I thought was VT Light Rum and it was fucking terrible... like scorched cotton terrible.  Then I realized my bottle labeled \"VT Rum\" was actually \"Golden Rum.\"  Eventually I ordered the correct one and remade it and its great. Especially after a steep, gets better and better.  I haven't played with Coffee Liquor enough but this tastes like the dominant flavor by far.  Interested to try different variations on this but this is a great recipe for this type of profile."}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"164547","name":"Kahlua & Cream"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
