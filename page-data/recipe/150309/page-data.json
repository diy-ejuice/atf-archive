Steep 3-5 days\r\n\r\nEnjoy!","steep_days":"5","temperature":"111","recipe_score":5,"updated_at":"2020-12-12T15:40:35.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"1266","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Banana Cream","flavor_id":"210","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Banana Purée","flavor_id":"6042","vendor":"WF","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Yes, We Cheesecake","flavor_id":"9272","vendor":"INW","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Custard","flavor_id":"4210","vendor":"INW","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Super Sweet","flavor_id":"2384","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":350}],"reviews":[{"user":"Skywxp3d","text":"Had to review this to let people know how dang good this recipe is!
