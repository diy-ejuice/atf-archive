Everyone has defining moments in their lives: learning to ride a bike without training wheels, a first love, a first heartbreak, graduating from college, a first child, experimenting with hallucinogenic drugs, etc. I would like to take this opportunity to share one of my defining moments as a mixer with ATF. One night, early December 2015, I was laying in bed and thinking about my concentrates (as is good and proper) and an idea to introduce INW Cactus to INW Grapefruit emerged out of wherever-the-fuck-ideas-come-from. I desired to push Cactus, so I chose 2% and a host of complimentary citrus flavors stepped forward and offered themselves to the cause. I was impelled to get immediately out of bed and rush to the kitchen so that I could put it together. After careful mixing, I anxiously shook what could be a dream or a nightmare come true. I stood, I dripped, I inhaled, I exhaled, and I just about died in ecstasy. After coming to the realization that I had truly connected with the most magical concentrate on the planet, I labeled the bottle 'Cactus Coitus.'  \r\n\r\nBroken down: \r\n\r\n[INW Cactus/Grapefruit] - Main events. You won't get aloe or soap because of how Grapefruit asserts itself.\r\n[Pineapple/Lemon Sicily/ Lime Tahity CP/ Mad Mix/ Tangerine] - Citrus mix to compliment the main pairing. I'm sure there is wiggle room for some substitutions here, but I have never desired to try. Mess with these and let me know how it works! Balance is key.\r\n[CAP Sweet Mango/Sweet Strawberry] - These are flavors acting as sweeteners and serve to round the out some of the sharper elements that can show up in a citrus mix.  \r\nShake and vape? Hell yeah.","steep_days":"3 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:48:47.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"4105","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Cactus","flavor_id":"647","vendor":"INW","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Golden Pineapple","flavor_id":"61","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":500},{"name":"Grapefruit","flavor_id":"785","vendor":"INW","millipercent":500},{"name":"Lemon Sicily","flavor_id":"524","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Lime Tahity Cold Pressed","flavor_id":"581","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Mad-mix (mad Fruit)","flavor_id":"423","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Sweet Mango","flavor_id":"120","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Sweet Strawberry","flavor_id":"121","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Sweet Tangerine","flavor_id":"123","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1000}],"reviews":[{"user":"LocoMojo","text":"A really fresh fruit/juicy wet vape. I find that a lot of the other fruits in this mix are mainly backing the cactus. Boosting the cactus properties while subduing some of the downsides of using cactus at high percentages. Tasty as hell as a shake and vape and improves upon further steeping. The juice eventually melds together into what is truly a juicy wet cactus extravaganza."}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"12816","name":"Cactus Coitus"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
