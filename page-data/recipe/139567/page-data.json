I chose FW Vbic because I like the bright vanilla and good but not overbearing cream flavor. And used HS cream just to add a touch of heavy cream, I suppose FLV cream would work also.

Everything is well balanced. FW VBIC is a good choice because it's not too eggy and rich. Keeping HS Cream low gave this a very nice mouthfeel, while not getting too buttery. Not overly complicating the creams let the pistachio shine and be the main focus. Great job!!","score":5}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"139567","name":"Creemy pistachio"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
