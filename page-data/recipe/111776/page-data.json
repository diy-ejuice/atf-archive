I have discovered that this and TFA Dragonfruit are a perfect match. The Nectarine feels like the perfect finish to the tropical beginning of the Dragonfruit inhale, and with the body and warmth of INW Shisha Vanilla added it makes for a delicious warm fruity vape. Hope you enjoy.\r\n\r\nI recommend at least 48 hours steep.\r\n\r\n","steep_days":"2","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T23:36:47.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"1648","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Dragonfruit","flavor_id":"226","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Nectarine","flavor_id":"249","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Shisha Vanilla","flavor_id":"841","vendor":"INW","millipercent":500}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"111776","name":"Dragon Nectar"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
