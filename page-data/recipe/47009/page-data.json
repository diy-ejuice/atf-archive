Shake and Vape it's amazing and a week later it's amazing. Im glad I made a 100ml before trying it because a week later and the bottle is empty. This is a great example of what cap cereal 27 can do a recipe adding corn flake flavor and crunch. Great job, thank you. ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️"},{"user":"ActionRalf","score":"5","text":"I made this yesterday, even without a steep it is tremendous.
