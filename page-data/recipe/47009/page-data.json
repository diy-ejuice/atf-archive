Shake and Vape it's amazing and a week later it's amazing. Im glad I made a 100ml before trying it because a week later and the bottle is empty. This is a great example of what cap cereal 27 can do a recipe adding corn flake flavor and crunch. Great job, thank you. ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️","score":5},{"user":"ActionRalf","text":"I made this yesterday, even without a steep it is tremendous.
