I feel like a cream or perhaps a custard at a low level would thicken it and make it smoother. I need to make another batch and try it in my RDA but my RTA is good for flavour so I don’t expect it to hugely different.

I can't wait to give it a full week because I can't imagine the bottle will last long."},{"user":"super8line","score":"5","text":"Found this in the monthly thread on reddit and after reading @ID10-T comments about it I ordered the FW Pralines and Cream to make it.  Let it steep for 5 days and holy shit this is delicious!! Awesome stuff, great work!"},{"user":"MrZigglesworth","score":"5","text":"I can completely agree with ID10-T's review here, this is a simple and very delicious recipe. All of his notes are completely accurate."},{"user":"ID10-T","score":"5","text":"\"Salted\" is a misnomer; don't try this expecting salt and be disappointed. But it is tasty, simple caramel pecan praline mix. That FW \"Salted\" Caramel and FW Pralines &amp; Cream makes a terrific pairing and Holy Vanilla fits in perfectly here and finishes that pairing off. I can imagine it being a bit dry and unsatisfying without it. The result is a little vanilla forward for an actual, authentic praline but makes for a great vape if you love vanilla. You get the drier pecan notes on top, followed by a rich caramel-cream body, and then a sweet dark and slightly malty smooth vanilla finish. And yes, I'm already playing with adding tobaccos to this and to the FLV Milk Chocolate version, which makes for a super yummy simple turtle at just 0.25% added to the recipe. Once again Coop proves you don't need a handful of ingredients to make a great juice, just an inspired pairing and a little finishing touch or two.
