He also made wondrous strides in number theory, such as Euclid's Theorem that states, \"There exists infinitely man prime numbers\".  Euclid is debatably  the most influential mathematician of all time and continues to be so to this day.\r\n\r\nThis is a blueberry cheesecake recipe.  I wanted to create more of a cheesecake with a blueberry syrup, rather than a blueberry infused cheesecake that is often what I've seen.  This is done by using CAP blueberry jam and Quince.  Both have a \"wetness\" to them that creates the effect of a liquid blueberry.  The cheesecake is comprised of NY Cheesecake and Cream Cheese Icing.  For the crust I went with a combination of FW Graham Cracker and INW Biscuit to keep it from being too bitter.","steep_days":"14","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-06T20:40:25.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"2249","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Blueberry Jam","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Blueberry","vendor":"FW","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Cream Cheese Icing","vendor":"LA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"New York Cheesecake","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Biscuit","vendor":"INW","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Graham Cracker","vendor":"FW","millipercent":750},{"name":"Quince","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":250}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"55581","name":"Euclid"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
