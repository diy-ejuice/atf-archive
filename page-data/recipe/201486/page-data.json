(this is my first mix with VT SC in there and I can definitely say I like it more than FW's version) This tastes really balanced right off the bat, and its a nice simple recipe to try out these new WF extracts, thank you for this! Dessert lovers, don't even question it, just mix it"}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"201486","name":"3 2 1  Salted Caramel Butter Cake"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
