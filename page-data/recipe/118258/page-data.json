VT Banana Custard is by far the best banana cream flavor I have tried. Flv Cream and WF Vanilla Cream Extra make the perfect cream that is spiced with Flv Egg Nog. I added Flv Butterscotch and FW Butterscotch Ripple because I like butterscotch with banana flavors and I stole this butterscotch combo from Cheeba Steeba's butterscotch banana frozen custard. Its delicious, give it a mix.","steep_days":"5","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"total_reviews":1,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:50:26.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"2637","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Banana Custard","vendor":"VT","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Butterscotch","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Butterscotch Ripple","vendor":"FW","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Cream","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Eggnog","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Vanilla Cream Extra SC","vendor":"WF","millipercent":1500}],"reviews":[{"user":"ID10-T","score":"5","text":"OMG that’s Delicious! What a lovely combination for flavors. Doesn’t really taste like banana eggnog - more like a silky smooth banana pudding mixed with vanilla pudding and then topped with nutmeg and butterscotch. I love that dark sticky sweetness of butterscotch with the banana and the rich milky body, and the spice is just icing on the cake. "}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"118258","name":"MlNikon's Nanner Nog"}}}
