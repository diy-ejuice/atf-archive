I have not, but it sure sounds like an awesome profile to tackle. \r\nThe very first version I created was really good. I just knew I could make it better. After playing with percentages, as well as adding in Cap butter cream and TPA Brown sugar, I felt it was complete.\r\n\r\nCap NY Cheesecake with FW Vanilla bean ice cream are a match made in heaven in this mix. Along with TPA Graham cracker clear for a delicious creamy cheesecake base. \r\nThe Obvious Flv Cookie dough with some help from TPA Double chocolate clear, FA Vanilla bourbon, CAP Butter cream and TPA brown sugar for the tasty cookie dough flavor and texture\r\nCAP Super sweet is of course optional if your not into sweet vapes, although I feel it fits the profile well. I also used super sweet at .25 on previous versions which worked quite well.\r\nThis recipe to me was very good immediately, but as always, the creams and the awesome NY Cheesecake comes out after a few days to a week.\r\n\r\nI hope this recipe gets mixed up in the community. Please leave any feedback you may have if you choose to mix my recipe. Thank you in advance!\r\nMixed recipe at 70VG/30PG\r\n\r\nV1 Used Inw chocolate.Very tasty off the shake, Taste and texture is there, V2 will play with %s for more flavor\r\nV2 Used Cap double chocolate clear and upped the cookie dough .5% upped the graham cracker clear .50\r\nV3 reduced vbic to 1.5% and included cap butter cream at .50 and TPA Brown sugar at .50","steep_days":"7","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:49:38.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"3140","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"New York Cheesecake","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Graham Cracker Clear","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Cookie Dough","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Vanilla Bean Ice Cream","vendor":"FW","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Double Chocolate (clear)","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Super Sweet","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":500},{"name":"Bourbon (vanilla Bourbon)","vendor":"FA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Butter Cream","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":500},{"name":"Brown Sugar","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":500}],"reviews":[{"user":"cxxxxp","text":"Oh my god this is good... I am determined to make a real-life version of this some day soon. Just so yummy, great mixing was done on this day, thank you for sharing it! One of my new favourites and the best cookie dough vape I've tried!"},{"user":"bjorama","text":"Another certified banger off the shake.  Never had the food, but the vape hits the profle of what I imagine it would taste like.  Nice blending  the TPA Double Chocolate into the mix.  Thanks for postiing this .  Corvape putting on a mixing clinic.   2 for 2 from what I've mixed up  and not just 5 stars, Delivering Bangers off the shake!!!"},{"user":"KylezKloudz","text":"Very interesting flavor profile... Great off the shake and I'm assuming it'll only get better! Nice job!"},{"user":"cdaniell30","text":"I had to make this without the bourbon, but it still holds up as a delicious chocolate chip cookie dough.  I always keep at least 6 flavors going simultaneously, and I still went through my 10ml sample of this in one day.  They usually last 3 if they're good, lol."}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"67162","name":"Cookie Dough Cheesecake "}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
