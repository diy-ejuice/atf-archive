I can easily vape this all day since, as concrete said, the rhubarb keeps it from being cloyingly sweet.  Was really hard to find a nice light &amp; fruity recipe that used rhubarb, everyone always says how hard it is to work with and yet, here, its seems philosaphucker has made light work out of it, making it seem so effortless to work with.  I love it when mixers can do that with a flavor!  Tested this after the recommended 3 days &amp; then again after 3 months since I stashed it away and forgot about it &amp; is bright &amp; enjoyable still."},{"user":"Deweysuds","text":"3 Week steep.  Bright rhubarb Berry candy.  Tart, bright, and sour.  Simple recipe, but really tasty.  The rhubarb, raspberry, and strawberry pair together perfectly.  Nice sweetness without sweetener.  I love this one"},{"user":"Pilgrim","text":"This is a fantastic recipe. All the ingredients blend wonderfully to make something really special. INW shisha is the only strawberry I can reliably taste but unfortunately I usually get some plastic tasting off flavours from it, but I am happy to say I can detect none in this recipe."},{"user":"crisk","text":""},{"user":"ConcreteRiver","text":"This is so ridiculously up my alley, so YMMV.  Really great use of jelly candy, rhubarb, and FA Raspberry.  Sweet, fluffy, and sticky, but the rhubarb keeps it from getting cloying.  I personally don't get a lot of strawberry, but it does a good job adding sweetness and backing up the raspberry.  If you like INW Rhubarb, mix this."}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"21296","name":"RU Berry Jelly"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
