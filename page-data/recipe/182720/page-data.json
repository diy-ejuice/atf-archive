Nice job with this one ! ","score":5},{"user":"MCrane81","text":"Amazing. I use this as a base to add 3% FE lemon and 1.5% FA lemon Sicily, then leave it for a week or 2. Absolutely delicious lemon cheesecake ðŸ˜‹","score":5},{"user":"Deftohms","text":"Like the title says, its a perfect cheesecake. I tried adding some stuff, didn't have too much luck. I tried with VT chocolate mousse at 2%, it was aight. I probably just suck. But this stuff is amazing as is. No off notes, and the flavor/texture is spot on.","score":5},{"user":"bjorama","text":"I dunno if I was high when I mixed it but this one didn't do it for me.  I've had much better cheesecakes from this site.  It's probably just me.","score":3},{"user":"Gordo","text":"Spot on Cheesecake. I love it.  When I took my first pull, adozen toppings came to mind. Thanks for your work.","score":5},{"user":"SeanVapes","text":"Not much to say except that this is another great recipe from you guys . Definitely one of the best cheesecake mixes i've tried . I need to do another mix with some fruit added . Not sure what yet , but possibly Blackcurrant or Raspberry .","score":5},{"user":"McFly","text":"Been renovating my house for six months and my girl gave birth to our daughter on New Yearâ€™s Day. Been so busy I havenâ€™t mixed anything in quite a while. Decided I needed to get back on the saddle and spotted this gem. Inawera Yes, we cheesecake is a great flavor, but the FW Yogurt is that indulgence flavor that works so well in these types of profiles. Really sets this off. Tried a second batch with WF Lemon squares and a touch of FE Lemon.  Lemon cheesecake from the Real was always my favorite industry liquid and I was pissed they moved on to the NKTR line and discontinued it. I feel Iâ€™m close enough to scratch that itch with this recipe. Great job guys. ","score":5},{"user":"AAP-DAAP-DERP","text":"Realistic, simple yet deep and cheesy cheesecake! As Max said it's becomes more interesting with FA Bourbon Vanilla @ 1.5%. Nothing more to say here - the best Cheesecake base I have tried. Well done!","score":5},{"user":"corvape","text":"Just mixed this base up and added 2.5% VT Lemon Meringue Tart..reduced TPA Graham crust to 1%. Its delicious off the shake. Great job guys!&#xD;\nWill follow up after a steep","score":5}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"182720","name":"Perfect Cheesecake | DEVELOPED"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
