If you don't have this flavor and you want to create a chocolate candy bar, pick it up, it's a great flavor to build around.    We wanted to create a caramel filled, crunchy, chocolate covered bar, and after a week or 2 steep, we think this comes pretty damn close.

I get a little bit of coconut from the nanaimo bar, but it seems like that's what's helping it taste more like a chocolate bar. I love what the butter pecan is doing here too."}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"202998","name":"Candy Bar | DEVELOPED"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
