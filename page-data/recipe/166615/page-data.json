I use the base from that, is it is simple and and amazing sugar cookie base in my opinion. \r\n\r\nBase\r\n\r\nButter, Biscuit and Sugar cookie\r\nThese three ingredients come together in a fantastic sugar cookie base.\r\n\r\nCap sugar cookie has a nice moistness to it, and inw biscuit combines with the sugar cookie to dry it out just slightly, giving you the perception of a nicely baked outer crust.\r\n\r\nThrow in some butter to add weight and let's face it deliciousness, who doesn't like butter!!!\r\n\r\nSecondary Note\r\n\r\nAn easy secondary note of caramel. The butterscotch is added to add some depth to the caramel as well. \r\n\r\nSweeten to taste!","steep_days":"14","temperature":"400","recipe_score":5,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:51:09.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"1930","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Sugar Cookie","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Biscuit","vendor":"INW","millipercent":750},{"name":"Butter","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Caramel (salted)","vendor":"FW","millipercent":2250},{"name":"Butterscotch","vendor":"FW","millipercent":1500}],"reviews":[{"user":"KylezKloudz","text":"It's seems like it's definitely a longer steep than the recommended 14 days but it you wait for it, it's Goooood! ü§§üëäüëç"}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"166615","name":"THICC sugar cookie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
