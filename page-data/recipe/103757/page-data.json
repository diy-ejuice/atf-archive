Who knows you may too!!! Oh and i think i nailed the profile. Let me know whether you think i did??  I took my Rubble Rock and some of id10ts lucky charms marshmallows and here it is a fruity pebbles with marshmallows in milk. It doesnt get much better than that.. I am sharing this recipe  after a 1 week steep but i haven't been able to put it down since day 3 i really like it. You may want to boost the fruits depending on how long you want to steep this recipe. By boost i mean .25% for lemon meringue pie, blueberry, and mandarin  but i havent needed to boost them myself but i do know from mixing rubble rock that you can do it if you need to. Other than that it is what it is a cereal vape enjoy!!!\r\n\r\nThanks to id10t for making his lucky charms recipe i thoroughly enjoyed using your marshmallow lol.\r\n\r\n\r\nI used .35% Flavorah sweetness . Use whatever sweetener you prefer. Or dont use any at all your call.","steep_days":"4","temperature":"420","recipe_score":5,"updated_at":"2020-12-12T17:11:45.000-05:00","best_vg":"75%","views":"3669","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Lemon Meringue Pie","flavor_id":"1335","vendor":"FW","millipercent":1750},{"name":"Blueberry","flavor_id":"1201","vendor":"FW","millipercent":1750},{"name":"Tanger (mandarin)","flavor_id":"547","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Cream Milky Undertone PG","flavor_id":"6539","vendor":"OOO","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Sweet Cream","flavor_id":"4402","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Rice Crunchies","flavor_id":"142","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1250},{"name":"Lucky Leprechaun Cereal","flavor_id":"141","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Whipped Cream","flavor_id":"4440","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":500},{"name":"Marshmallow","flavor_id":"3521","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":500}],"reviews":[{"user":"MrZigglesworth","text":"I have really liked Tootall's use of TPA Rice Crunchies as part of a cereal base, it really helps give that slightly starchy note that you would get from this fruity pebble type of cereal. I loved Rubble Rock and this one was really great too.
