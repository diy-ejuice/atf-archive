Remember those days when you were 15 years old with no cigarette and no money? Well let's bring back that nostalgic feeling of hitting the Wal-Mart ashtrays for the half smoked cigs, and bringing those suckers back home and rolling them up in a zigzag with no filter! Additionally you could add some FLV Spearmint to emulate those prison-style re-rolls that consisted of Grizzly wintergreen spit out on the ground by the Correctional Officers. If you want that taste of people stepping on the ABC (Already Been Chewed) baccy, add some TFA Dairy Milk!","steep_days":"1 (SNV)","temperature":"850","recipe_score":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-10T16:00:25.000-05:00","best_vg":"5%","views":"1846","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Black Fire","flavor_id":"458","vendor":"FA","millipercent":10250},{"name":"Ry4 Double","flavor_id":"379","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":10750}],"reviews":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"78152","name":"Re-rolled Cigarette."}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
