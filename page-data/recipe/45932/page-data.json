I remember these costing a penny way back and they might still be that even today granted they're probably smaller but I still reach for them if I see them. \r\nYou lot on the other side of the pond may think what the hell is he talking about but trust me these little sweets are king in the UK definitely a child's staple. Think chewits that's how they're best described and the flavour well they're pineapple and raspberry that's it.\r\nI was pleasantly surprised when I wanted to create these in vape form how well they turned out they're bang on the profile. Very sweet and tangy with that chewy thick mouthfeel you get with a chew or candy.\r\n\r\nSome quick notes.......\r\n\r\nI won't go into great detail this is a quick simple recipe but at the same time fulfills its profile. I chose FW saltwater Taffy as it fits the profile perfectly it's a great flavour kind of a nougat without any flavour but with some sweetness. CAP Marshmallow thickens it all up giving it that thick sticky mouthfeel you expect with a chew. For the fruits TFA sweet raspberry seemed perfect to add some candied raspberry that's tart and sweet. CAP golden pineapple is definitely one of the best pineapples and it works wonders in all aspects you through at it. It's not to powerful and doesn't swamp other flavours. The CAP Sweet mango was a lucky accident I didn't think this would work but a small amount sweetens the recipe,adds tartness and boosts the pineapple and raspberry and bridges the gap and keeps the pineapple moist.\r\n\r\nI'm really enjoying this it's definitely a fun vape especially with its tartness it really kicks your tongue into life.\r\n\r\nEnjoy xx","steep_days":"2 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:49:18.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"8436","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Golden Pineapple","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Raspberry (sweet)","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Salt Water Taffy","vendor":"FW","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Marshmallow","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Sweet Mango","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":500}],"reviews":[{"user":"redomegaz","text":"Another amazing recipe by dazcole, it tastes just like the sweets."}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"45932","name":"Fruit salad chews"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
