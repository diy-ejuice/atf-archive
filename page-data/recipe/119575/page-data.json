They are a vanilla cookie with red & blue icing, & has a dinosaur of the packaging for the new Jurassic Park movie (that’s all he really cared about was the dinosaur on the packaging). I didn’t want to just make a plain vanilla cookie with plain icing. So I made a vanilla cookie with strawberry & blueberry striped icing. Happy with how this turned out. It is good of the shake but around day 10 is when I would say it is fully steeped. \r\n\r\nFor the cookie itself it when with a combo of Cap sugar cookie & FA cookie. I like both so I not gonna get in the argument between I-d10t & Mr. ConcreteRiver on which one is better. The sugar cookie brings a sweet chewy sugar cookie, & the FA brings a more firm harder cookie.\r\n\r\nFA Meringue i added it for some sweet creaminess to help turn the fruits into more of an icing.\r\n\r\nINW Shisha Strawberry: Its my favorite strawberry it stands alone by itself and doesn’t fade like other strawberries, and it has a slight syrup/jam quality to it.\r\n\r\nFW Blueberry: A few months back I mixed up DentMans https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/46737  which really showcases FW Blueberry as a frosting/icing so I stole it from him and used it in my mix and it worked beautifully  \r\n\r\nHoly Vanilla: is the perfect vanilla for bakeries it is a really rich & creamy vanilla.\r\n\r\nIf you haven’t mixed up Dentman Angel Food Cake W/ Blueberry Frosting I would suggest giving that a try as well.\r\n\r\nIf you take the time to mix Please rate & review \r\n\r\n","steep_days":"10","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T17:35:13.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"1009","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Cookie","flavor_id":"490","vendor":"FA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Sugar Cookie","flavor_id":"115","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Shisha Strawberry","flavor_id":"1711","vendor":"INW","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Blueberry","flavor_id":"1201","vendor":"FW","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Meringue","flavor_id":"530","vendor":"FA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Holy Vanilla","flavor_id":"2385","vendor":"DFS","millipercent":1500}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"119575","name":"Vanilladon"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
