These two combo-ed together has been my go to ever sense if I feel a juice needs a wetness/juicyness factor added in.\r\n\r\nSuper Sweet CAP - The usual sweetener to give a juice that commercial e liquid kick.\r\n\r\nShisha INW & Ripe Strawberry TFA/TPA - Shisha has that nice sweet strawberry-ness while Ripe Strawberry has that almost natrual yet candyness that I enjoy. BUT Ripe strawberry tends to fade rather quickly so I used some shisha to help the strawberry flavor stick around a bit longer.\r\n\r\nPink Lemonade LB - This is my go to for a lemonade base. Usage I've found is between 1% and 2% for a base. anything higher than that and the juice will become far to harsh.\r\n\r\nBlood Orange FW - What can I say, I like this orange flavoring. Probably one of the most common that new mixers buy when they build their first carts. Really has that nice orangey kick people want.","steep_days":"3 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-11T06:44:54.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"1399","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Cactus","flavor_id":"647","vendor":"INW","millipercent":500},{"name":"Shisha Strawberry","flavor_id":"1711","vendor":"INW","millipercent":750},{"name":"Blood Orange","flavor_id":"1197","vendor":"FW","millipercent":750},{"name":"Strawberry (ripe)","flavor_id":"271","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Super Sweet","flavor_id":"2384","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":750},{"name":"Cucumber","flavor_id":"43","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":500},{"name":"Pink Lemonade","flavor_id":"1500","vendor":"LB","millipercent":1000}],"reviews":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"162543","name":"Godfrey's Blood Orange Strawberry Lemonade"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
