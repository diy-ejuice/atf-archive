Not that it's a bad recipe, but I get a lot of harshness from TFA Swedish Fish (not everyone does) and nothing in here mitigated that. But when I pushed through the pain, I noticed two really intriguing things about this recipe. For one, 1% FA Bilberry is terrifying. If you've ever single-flavor tested FA Bilberry too high or tried a recipe with too much Bilberry in it, you're dripping that into the bottle just knowing this whole thing is gonna taste like sweatsocks. Nope. It does not taste like sweatsocks or anything off at all, it just turns the candy berry from a red Swedish Fish (artificial lingonberry?) flavor to something indistinct to as far as actual fruit is concerned but very distinctly blue as a candy. Very interesting. Is it the CAP Lemon Lime cleaning it up? The Swedish Gummy? Or some synergy between them both and the Bilberry? This warrants further investigation. I might try throwing an abnormal amount of Bilberry at some different candy flavors and see what happens. The other intriguing thing is that the, Koolada doesn’t hurt the gummy body at all, it just comes it after it. That stuff destroys creams but the fact that it doesn’t hurt the candy texture is really interesting and promising. I don't know why you'd want cold candy, but if you do, it's nice to know that can be done with a tail-end cooling that doesn't interfere with top notes rather than only relying on WS-23 for that.","score":3},{"user":"Smoky","text":"Pretty good with 2% flv blueberry","score":5}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"11887","name":"Arctic Gummy Bear"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
