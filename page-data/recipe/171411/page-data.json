One night whilst getting rather merry and knocking back the drinks I thought I was being all creative when I decided to add a decent sized glug of Baileys to my Starbucks (shop brought) cold frappe-chino! I was immediately transported to heaven as this shit was off the chain!!! I mean,it was pretty dam sweet so could only have one of them but nonetheless it was a delicious little cocktail. I honesty thought I had created something new but as it goes these things have been going for years!! ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ oh well, I thought Iâ€™d take it one step further and re create this delicious  concoction in vape form and boy oh boy have I nailed it! This recipe took some work but the end result is near on identical apart from the coldness. If you want to add WS-23 @ 0.50% then go for it! I however canâ€™t tolerate the stuff so I left it out. The sweetener is a must in this recipe,it helps the chocolate out and also takes any bitterness away from the coffee. It also makes our cream sweet and silky. This is definitely a steeper, donâ€™t be tempted to go in on it straight away as youâ€™ll be disappointed, 5 days is spot on guys. I hope you enjoy this one and please be so kind to leave a rating and review if you do so choose to mix this up. Happy mixing ðŸ’™ðŸ˜Ž","steep_days":"5","temperature":"0","recipe_score":4,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:51:11.000-05:00","best_vg":"80%","views":"1313","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Coffee Milk Froth","vendor":"VT","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Cream","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1250},{"name":"Cream Milky Undertone PG","vendor":"OOO","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Hazel Grove (hazelnut)","vendor":"FA","millipercent":250},{"name":"Australian Chocolate","vendor":"HS","millipercent":200},{"name":"Super Sweet","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":500},{"name":"Irish Cream","vendor":"VT","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Arabica Coffee","vendor":"VT","millipercent":750}],"reviews":[{"user":"ID10-T","text":"This uses FLV Irish Cream the only way I think it can be used, in a coffee vape that also incorporates chocolate. In a Starbucked Up thing. Between the FLV Irish Cream and WF Brazilian Coffee in there I get just a wee bit too much of a burnt, stale-ish coffee taste - like coffee that was made just a little too long ago - but overall itâ€™s definitely a coffee vape Iâ€™ve enjoyed more than other coffee vapes Iâ€™ve tried. It doesnâ€™t have any of the skunk spray or burned microwave popcorn taste that some of the other ones have, and might not even taste a little burnt to everyone, I think thereâ€™s something in these flavors that Iâ€™m just really sensitive to. Itâ€™s sweet and chocolately and has a very thick, velvety smooth feel to it. Really rich and creamy. If I was going to try to improve on it, Iâ€™d definitely bring in some VT Irish Cream to really get that booze in there. I might also try bringing down the FLV Irish Cream and WF Brazilian Coffee, but itâ€™s likely that VT Irish Cream could cover that slight edge of excess gas station-y coffee.
