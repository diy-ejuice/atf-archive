The spice-note from the INW Custard, and that more \"natural\" flavor from VT Banana Custard really calms down the candiness of the TFA Banana Cream. &#xD;\n4 days steep yields a much better result than the recommended 3 days imo - It was \"Ok banana-yay\" yesterday, today it is \"Damn bae, I'm Banana-gay\""},{"user":"Foment_life","score":"4","text":"Tested on:    &#xD;\nVandy Vape Paradox    &#xD;\nSingle 6 wrap 2x26/36 3mm ID fused clapton    &#xD;\n65w    &#xD;\n&#xD;\nThere’s a bit of runts here, but not in a *bad* way. It’s definitely creamy, and it’s definitely a banana, but it’s not quite a natural banana. It is at the same time really enjoyable. It’s sort of like you took a ton of those fake banana candies and blended them into a DQ blizzard or equivalent milkshake kind of thing. I don’t really get anything super eggy here, but it is a weighty cream with some very sweet banana candy hanging out as well. All in all it’s enjoyable if not the very most accurate banana recipe I’ve ever tried.    &#xD;\n&#xD;\nI believe the culprit here is the TFA banana cream, which I say having also pushed it fairly high in recipe. I still dig it, and I totally get why the INW custard is here, but I feel like you could probably adjust the recipe to live more on something like the VT banana custard and perhaps SA banana flambe with a more complex custard-y base to really get to a fully authentic banana pudding/banana custard type recipe. All in all for 3 ingredients meant to steep basically 0 days this accomplishes the job and it is enjoyable. This feels near what I’d expect a commercial banana custard to be, just short on a lot of sweetener. I dig it and I could see throwing it together again in a pinch if I wanted something for a day or two with no steep. For the stated purpose of bananas, heavy custard/cream and no waiting, it’s very good, but I think a bit of patience and a little more work could really elevate this into an absolute “nana cream” killer."},{"user":"ID10-T","score":"5","text":"That's an ingenious use of the 1-2-3 format. This is what VT Banana Custard should taste like. For one thing, VT Banana Custard has no custard. Also, it's a nice clean natural banana, but there's no punch to it, it's not bold enough to really carry a banana recipe by itself. This tastes like it fixes both of those problems without introducing any new ones, which is just terrific. That bright banana top note still has an artificial ring to it, but it's not full-on candy, it's like the banana flavoring in banana pudding, plus real bananas, and it's plenty flavorful. Then you have that thick rich custard and full, creamy mouthfeel, but without anything obtrusive getting in the banana's way.  Other than adding some bakery if you wanted some Nilla Wafers with your Nana Custard, I don't think this could be any better."}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"164454","name":"1-2-3 Banana Custard"}}}
