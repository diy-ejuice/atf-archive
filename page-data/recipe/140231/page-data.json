VT creme brulee is a really nice flavor it has less  burnt dark brown sugar than other brulees and leans more toward a caramel the creme is also less eggy.  FW butterscotch ripple is more of an ice cream  and works well  here \r\n\r\n**kettle corn***  **AP** and **caramel popcorn**  create that cracker jack type of popcorn I wanted here .  caramel popcorn is really bringing the nut notes with some darker sweetness and is light on the popcorn.  The kettle corn brings more of a buttery caramel note.  AP is used for more of that popcorn texture and supports the kettle corn \r\n\r\n**toffee**  is needed to add some depth and supports the finish in this mix along with graham cracker \r\n","steep_days":"5 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"total_reviews":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T17:35:30.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"1317","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Acetyl Pyrazine 5%","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":250},{"name":"Butterscotch Ripple","vendor":"FW","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Caramel Popcorn and Peanuts","vendor":"WF","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Creme Brulee","vendor":"VT","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Graham Cracker","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Hard Crack Toffee","vendor":"VT","millipercent":900},{"name":"Kettle Corn","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2500}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"140231","name":"What the MESS!!
