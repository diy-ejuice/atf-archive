The addition of whipped cream in this remix is just perfect. It's not to rich and fits perfectly within the added pineapple and coconut.  Mix it up, sit back and enjoy. Absolutely delicious!"},{"user":"ID10-T","text":"This is a delicious strawberry watermelon colada with extra cream that does indeed go down smooth! At first I thought it was good, but could have been better if it used INW Pineapple instead of that tinny CAP Golden. But after a vaping on it a bit, it grew on me more and more just the way it is. I definitely recommend giving it a decent steep. I'm sure it's fine S&amp;V but that whipped cream gets thicker and sweeter if you give it some time, yum yum yum.
