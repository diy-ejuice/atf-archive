I steeped for a week. Smells great &amp; on  knuckle test it taste great but when I first started vaping it the only flavor I was getting was the cinnamon spice. Then as the day went on i started to notice the donut and the creams. Once I run out going to mix again and sub in rich cinnamon for the cinnamon spice and leave out the sweetner"}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"74970","name":"Flaming Donuts (DMC Cinnamon Challenge).
