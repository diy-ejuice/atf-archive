Mouth-watering good!\r\nSteep: 1 week minimum.  Some prefer shake and vape, but typical custard and tobaccos take time to develop.\r\nMix: 70/30\r\nThe Base: \r\nVanilla Custard (CAP) - This is the obvious base note for the flavor profile. Creating a thick velvety layer of Vanilla for the rest of the flavors to mingle with was the objective here. \r\n\r\nFrench Vanilla Creme (TPA) - This flavor was used as an accent to the Vanilla Custard to boost the creaminess as well as the Vanilla profiles. This gives the custard another layer of complexity while not overpowering the staple custard notes. \r\n\r\nCinnamon Danish Swirl (CAP) - Another accent to the base. Giving this a low percentage allows for a present cinnamon note with just a touch extra to the cream. A little goes a long way within this recipe. \r\n\r\nEthyl Maltol (TPA) *optional* - Once again - Just a touch of sweetness to brighten the cream layers as well as boosting the overall appeal of the vape. \r\n\r\nThe Main Notes: \r\nRY4 Double (TPA) - This tobacco is such a versatile RY4. It's tobacco notes add a nice earthy tone as well as provides a delicious caramelized brown sugar sweetness that sits so well on top of the Vanilla Custard base. Using this at 3% allows it to shine but not overpower any other ingredient. \r\n\r\nTorrone (FA) - This flavor is used more of an enhancer to the RY4. Finding the perfect percentage was key, but it was absolutely a must for this recipe. It offers a nice honey sweetness as well as a nice nut profile that (to me) is a match made in heaven for the RY4. \r\n\r\nTwo Apples (INW) - This is where this recipe shines for the fall season. To me, this gives off a nice Apple Cider kick. The CDS in the base notes sets this profile off. It also gives high notes of Sweet Red apple sweetness as well as a nice tang from the green apple.

Well done!

I did sub CAP french vanilla, but even so the whole recipe is nicely balanced. Perfect amount of RY4D."},{"user":"Ninhalo5","score":"5","text":"This is the perfect fall vape, I absolutely love it!!! I ended up using CAP vanilla custard v2 at the same ratio because that's all I had on hand, and added 1 drop of FLV rich cinnamon to my 15ml mix but everything else stayed the same. The sweetness, spice, and creaminess are all on point. I vape this right after mixing as I usually do and the flavor was totally there. the only real difference I've found after a 1 week steep was the level of creaminess increased, no change in the flavor for all of you that want to snv. I see a 120ml batch of this in the near future, and I hardly ever make a 120ml. This is in my top 5 hands down."},{"user":"Thadentman","score":"5","text":"This is a very nice autumn mix, Ry-4 and custard are not too heavy because of the two apples the vanilla creme and cds is a nice touch to this as well. Great job and as cold as it is getting so quickly this is a nice vape for this time of year!"}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"13279","name":"Autumn's Custard"}}}
