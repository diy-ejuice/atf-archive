The percentages have been worked on over and over for the last couple of weeks and I think I have nailed it down just right.. The Butter Pecan and Peanut Butter play well together as well as the Melty Caramel to add a slight caramel tone.. You do not get a huge chocolate tone on the vape but it is there melding with the other flavors..\r\n\r\nI was playing with the name I had something that was funny to me and to some others but in general I was a little immature so I edited the name and some wording in the description..","steep_days":"14","temperature":"0","recipe_score":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-11T14:03:43.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"1396","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Chocolate Deutsch","flavor_id":"2151","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Cake (yellow)","flavor_id":"1222","vendor":"FW","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Peanut Butter","flavor_id":"962","vendor":"LA","millipercent":2250},{"name":"Butter Pecan","flavor_id":"1212","vendor":"FW","millipercent":750},{"name":"Melty Caramel","flavor_id":"1553","vendor":"MB","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Cream Fresh","flavor_id":"540","vendor":"FA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Cream Cheese Icing","flavor_id":"2380","vendor":"LA","millipercent":1750},{"name":"Australian Chocolate","flavor_id":"2657","vendor":"HS","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Saline (0.9%)","flavor_id":"5960","vendor":"OTHR","millipercent":150},{"name":"Golden Butter","flavor_id":"60","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":300}],"reviews":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"91884","name":"Choco-Peanut Pie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
