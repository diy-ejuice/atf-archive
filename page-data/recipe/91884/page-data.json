The percentages have been worked on over and over for the last couple of weeks and I think I have nailed it down just right.. The Butter Pecan and Peanut Butter play well together as well as the Melty Caramel to add a slight caramel tone.. You do not get a huge chocolate tone on the vape but it is there melding with the other flavors..\r\n\r\nI was playing with the name I had something that was funny to me and to some others but in general I was a little immature so I edited the name and some wording in the description..","steep_days":"14","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"total_reviews":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-05T08:05:46.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"1387","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Chocolate Deutsch","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Cake (yellow)","vendor":"FW","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Peanut Butter","vendor":"LA","millipercent":2250},{"name":"Butter Pecan","vendor":"FW","millipercent":750},{"name":"Melty Caramel","vendor":"MB","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Cream Fresh","vendor":"FA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Cream Cheese Icing","vendor":"LA","millipercent":1750},{"name":"Australian Chocolate","vendor":"HS","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Saline (0.9%)","vendor":"OTHR","millipercent":150},{"name":"Golden Butter","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":300}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"91884","name":"Choco-Peanut Pie"}}}
