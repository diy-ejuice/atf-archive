I had been wanting to mix Yakima Hops with FLV Mango but wasn't sure in which way.  I had completely forgotten that I owned FE Mango.  So, I slapped those three together and began thinking what else would go with it.  A mix of TFA Vanilla Swirl and VT Yoghurt Drink to mix it into a smoothie type situation.  CAP Golden Pineapple and FLV Sweet Coconut seemed like perfect complements, as well.  Finally, a heaping dose of WS-23 to cool it all down.  This is smooth as hell and vapable right off the shake.  Hope this scratches an itch for somebody . . . enjoy!","steep_days":"1 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"total_reviews":2,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:50:19.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"1881","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Mango","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Mango","vendor":"FE","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Yakima Hops","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Yoghurt Drink","vendor":"VT","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Vanilla Swirl","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Sweet Coconut","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1500},{"name":"WS-23","vendor":"OTHR","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Golden Pineapple","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":2500}],"reviews":[{"user":"rougeislander401","score":"5","text":"This was my first recipe in which I elected to try Yakima Hops as everything else in it are things I love. This is an excellent mix and makes for a great all day vape, I leave the ws23 out as the yakima hops adds all the refreshment I need. Just mixed this up a 2nd time which is rare for me but speaks to how much I enjoy this recipe, thanks bro!"},{"user":"ID10-T","score":"5","text":"This recipe has all of my favorite things in it so of course I had to try it and of course I was going to love it. What I didn't expect was to be able to taste all the notes rather than just a beautiful mess of hopped up tropical yum. Mango, hops, pineapple, a touch of coconut, and a silky smooth smoothie base. Superb!  "}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"110698","name":"Hype (Mango, Hops, Yogurt, and Pineapple Smoothie)"}}}
