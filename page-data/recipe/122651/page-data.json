The shift to fall weather, the Halloween season, and the arrival of FLV Smoked Butterscotch necessitated the creation of this remix. \r\n\r\nThis is a smoky, fall custard.  In place of FA Black Fire, I used the much more forgiving FLV Smoked Butterscotch.  The result is a butterscotch custard kissed by tobacco and smoke.  Works as a SNV, but give it a few days and the flavors really come together.  Enjoy.","steep_days":"4 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"total_reviews":2,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:50:29.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"1739","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Red Oak","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Smoked Butterscotch","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Custard Premium","vendor":"FA","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Butterscotch Ripple","vendor":"FW","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Classic For Pipe Black","vendor":"INW","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Vanilla Ruyan Custard","vendor":"WF","millipercent":2000},{"name":"RY4 Double","vendor":"JF","millipercent":3000}],"reviews":[{"user":"OldMan","score":"5","text":"Mixed up a 15ml test, immediately wish it had been at least 30. I get a sweet creamy pipe tobacco up front with the custard notes on the exhale. Excellent evening vape imo. Thank you sir"},{"user":"priest2705","score":"5","text":"Lovely custard. Let steep for several weeks, and loved it. The butterscotch was definitely the upfront flavor, with the tobacco coming into play on the tail end of the inhale, with the custards making their presence known throughout. Will definitely be making again"}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"122651","name":"Phil Noir"}}}
