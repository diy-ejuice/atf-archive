I wanted to try to marry my macaron base from my [Mango Blossom Macaron](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/46330#mango_blossom_macaron_by_id10_t) to the best recipe to come out of last year's DIYorDIE world mixing competition, the heavenly three-ingredient \"In a Godda Da Vida\" by the incomparable @mlNikon. The earliest versions were disastrous. TFA Papaya and FA Pomegranate and not to be trifled with. It took turning them down further and further and even adjusting the ratio a bit to get Godda to fit into a light and airy meringue and almond flour cookie with an ingratiating touch of forbidden fruit flavor.

Pomegranate is a bit of a bully, but the rest of the flavors balance it out nicely.  I can even still pick out the tangerine, and for my palate that's usually the first thing to disappear when I start layering heavier flavors on top of it.  This is very nicely done, and exactly what I was hoping I'd get from the blending of these two awesome recipes.","score":5}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"95356","name":"Goddaron"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
