I am!! This is my rendition of a southern classic. The Nog Buttercream Cake. Throughout my formulation process I got completely nogged out, but that doesn't make this recipe any less delectable.\r\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n**CAP Sweet Cream / FW Butter Cream**\r\nThese two append the icing/moistness to the cake. Butter Cream from FW does an awesome job of thickening bakeries with dense mouthfeel.  The two together do a wonderful job of fattening up that unfortunate and slightly thin back-note of FLV Eggnog.\r\n\r\n**WF Princess Cake / JF Yellow Cake**\r\nThese two obviously both have the word cake in their titles, so one could reasonably assume it makes up the cake. I went with Princess Cake based on a recommendation from @Shyndo so credit goes to him for that. JF Yellow Cake helps to supply a bit more cake note as I found Princess Cake to be a little on the airy side.\r\n\r\n**FLV Eggnog**\r\nBy far the best eggnog concentrate I've dealt with hands down. It's a tad spice forward so we'll need to lift the thin back-note a tad with other contributors.\r\n\r\n**Add Complexity w/ an Accent**\r\nI like to add in right around .5% FW Maple Pecan. At a low % it contributes a light but noticeable nut to the cake, which is of course depicted in the thumbnail. If you're into bakeries with a light nut accent and have it on hand I recommend it's inclusion. Omitted in the main recipe as to be more available.\r\n\r\n*side note* This is a STEEPER. It needs proper time to meld the flavoring, so aging is required. It's actually better after the 21 day mark though I am hesitant to call for a 3 week steep. As with any cream heavy recipe, keep in mind that it's better the longer it has to emulsify.\r\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nHave a wicked set of holidays! If you mix this up set it aside for Xmas and enjoy it as it melds together into a beautiful orgy of holiday themed flavors. ðŸ’¦\r\n\r\nFollow me on YouTube for future DIY Eliquid creations and topic videos:\r\nHttp://www.youtube.com/c/SteamCraft ðŸ¤˜","steep_days":"14","temperature":"420","recipe_score":5,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:50:33.000-05:00","best_vg":"75%","views":"2025","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Eggnog","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Princess Cake SC","vendor":"WF","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Super Sweet","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":250},{"name":"Yellow Cake","vendor":"JF","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Sweet Cream","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Butter Cream","vendor":"FW","millipercent":1250}],"reviews":[{"user":"gravi-tea","text":"the cake is nice I was hoping on that :) flv did a wonderful job with their eggnog really enjoyed this and now I don't regret ordering flv lol"}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"127270","name":"Nog | Eggnog Buttercream Cake"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
