Otherwise we could take a simple mustard milk approach to this whole shebang and throw together 5% TPA Vanilla Bean Ice Cream and 5% CAP Golden Pineapple and be absolutely fine with the outcome. If you don't get pepper and enjoy TPA VBIC, you should definitely give the two flavor approach a shot. \r\n\r\nAnyways, rant over, onto the recipe notes.\r\n\r\nLB Vanilla Ice Cream is rich, creamy, goodness in a bottle. It has come to a nearly celebrity status in our community as of the last year or so for good reason. It plays well with others, it has a decent mouthfeel, and though respectably flavorful in under 5% concentrations, will not be pushed away by many stronger flavors. To me, there is a distinct eggy note to this concentrate as well, similar to a very faint dairy/butter note in TPA Vanilla Swirl. For these reasons we use this flavor for the base of our Ice Cream role.\r\n\r\nThat little part about 'decent mouthfeel' may just be me, but LB VIC does seem to be a touch thin. We remedy this by throwing in 2% TPA Vanilla Swirl in to the arena. This bumps texture considerably without taking over and adding too much of a flavor. We get almost a 'chew' from this one, reminding me of a vanilla tootsie-roll-esque type vibe. All Hail The Swirl™ ▲\r\n\r\nOur Pineapple is simple. 5% CAP Golden Pineapple is the perfect ratio to balance in the mix, neither taking the wheel nor falling behind. At this percentage we definitely don't find the need to search for the fruit in this mix, nor do we exclusively taste pineapple. The dried fruit vibe off of Golden Pineapple is absolutely killer and the whole inspiration for this triple recipe tie in with Pineapple Cookie, Pineapple Cheesecake, and Pineapple Ice Cream. If for some reason you don't already have this one in your arsenal and it even remotely sounds appetizing to you, do yourself a favor and nab at least a 30ml bottle from your preferred website and get to mixing.\r\n\r\nThat's it. Thanks for tuning in to this 3 parter.","steep_days":"2","temperature":"0","recipe_score":4,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:50:45.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"3224","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Vanilla Ice Cream","vendor":"LB","millipercent":5000},{"name":"Golden Pineapple","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":5000},{"name":"Vanilla Swirl","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2000}],"reviews":[{"user":"elsignor","text":"pretty good one, I would love to have a brighter pineapple (adding 1% TFA pineapple is what I need) but as it is, it is a great pineapple ice cream.
