It has a nice sugary glazey type of note and used FA maple to just boost the maple goodness up a bit. WF Glazed Donut was used as the only donut note here, it is very sugary and glazey as well but it does have a nice yeasty donut note that fits in great here. WF Vanilla Cream Extra is just here for some depth and richness I felt the mix needed. Sorry to disappoint, but I could not add the bacon. :(\r\n\r\n\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s7V0JcOhbB0&feature=youtu.be","steep_days":"5","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T20:33:10.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"855","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Glazed Donut SC","vendor":"WF","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Maple Syrup","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Maple Bar","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Vanilla Cream Extra SC","vendor":"WF","millipercent":1000}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"164417","name":"mlNikon's Maple Bar"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
