I think it tastes pretty good. Doesn't taste like fruit circles i would say it's just a cereal vape. This is pretty damn good after 3 day steep.

If you try it let me know what you think please.","steep_days":"2 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-11T03:37:43.000-05:00","best_vg":"60%","views":"1167","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Vanilla Swirl","flavor_id":"189","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Forrest Mix (forest Fruit Mix)","flavor_id":"453","vendor":"FA","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Cereal 27","flavor_id":"4163","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Juicy Strawberry","flavor_id":"8779","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Dx Sweet Cream","flavor_id":"165","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1750},{"name":"Fruit Circles","flavor_id":"8742","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":7000}],"reviews":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"98268","name":"Cereal mixed with berries"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
