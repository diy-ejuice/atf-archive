Blackberry cigar with a hint of milk chocolate. I bumped into AlfredPudding in the MC server and asked him if he wanted to add a submission and I would graciously mix it up for him. He ended up jumping in as a collaboration on the concept and swapped out some flavors for others, suggested some percents and this mix was born. I got pretty busy, so i didnt get a chance to really mess with percents. I really didnt need to. After about two weeks, I felt the tobaccos were still a bit soft and wanted to bump them up. Never got to trying it, and glad I didn't. At about three weeks, they all slide together to make something that is just really interesting to vape. So, i don't know, make of it what you will.\r\n\r\nIt's nicely balanced, with the tobaccos just laying in the cut providing a base for the rest of the flavorful components. Blackberry at 1.25 blends harmoniously with the berry-like components of Black Cat for Pipe, Dates adds the depth to the dark fruity undertones in Dark for Pipe, and lavender all but dissolves into the mix lightening it up in a strangely delightful way; it's nearly impossible for me to discern it individually.  It turned out to be very interesting to me and I hope you like it.\r\n\r\nEdit: I kinda threw up the notes quick for MC but wanted to make it clear, Alfred steered me away from the chocolate and brought in the lavender and red dates which make this a unique mix. It's more his than mine and now it's yours. If you try it, I can guarantee it will be worth the wait. And please do wait. The tobaccos end up being very delicate in the mix and need time to level out. Definitely a steeper.","steep_days":"21","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:51:26.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"813","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Classic For Pipe Dark","vendor":"INW","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Classic For Pipe Black Cat","vendor":"INW","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Lavender","vendor":"FA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Blackberry","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1250},{"name":"Red Dates","vendor":"VT","millipercent":2750}],"reviews":[{"user":"UnappreciatedRobot","text":"I have no idea how to begin describing this mix. To quote the “great” Guy Fieri, “We’re takin’ you on a road rockin’ trip down to Flavortown, where the gravitational force of bacon warps the laws of space and time.” Except you can take out bacon and replace it with this mix. I get a little bit of tobacco, a good amount of floral, and a hint of sweetness. All I know at this point is that it is delicious and I can’t put it down.&#xD;\n&#xD;\nNothing in this mix makes sense. Why does it work? Blackberry tobacco? Sure, that sounds good. Lavender tobacco? I don’t see why not. Even red dates tobacco could probably work. But the 3 together? You are a mastermind. I have no idea how you chose these flavors, or how you made them work, but it really does. If I really try, I can now pick out each flavor, but if you aren’t really concentrating, they all meld together into a delicious, yet confusing, vape. &#xD;\n&#xD;\nI really don’t have any critics for this mix. It is awesome."},{"user":"ID10-T","text":"I get a just robust enough dark fruity tobacco with a floral dark berry accent that also has some musky sweetness to it. I love it. The floral aspect isn’t perfumy, but like dried berry blossoms were scattered in the tobacco. Muskyness reads like dried fruit, but not raisins. More like black plum, and less of a distinct thing than a fantastic characteristic of some exotic tobacco. I don’t know if the room note matches the vape but if it does I wouldn’t mind smelling like this. I imagine it’s kind of sexy, in a masculine way.&#xD;\n&#xD;\nRecipe says blackberry cigar with a hint of chocolate? I’m missing the blackberry as a blatantly clear blackberry although when I think about it, it’s closer to blackberry than any other berry.  No chocolate, but maybe that was just part of the original idea and not meant to be in the final product? Whatever, doesn’t need it. Or anything really. This is a delightful mix just the way it is."}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"187944","name":"Classic Blavendish for Pipe"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
