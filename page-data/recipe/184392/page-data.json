Yes. The assignment was to take one of two colors - pink or blue - and add them to milk. \r\n\r\nLove that Pink Guava, especially that bit of tropical funk on it. Pink plus stank = Pank. With some Hibiscus - which also tastes pink to me - to bridge the wide gap between grapefruity pank and thick moo juice. None of the usual recipe development here. The first version tasted exactly the way I wanted it to and I couldn't think of a way to improvement. Maybe you can?

It's like eating a piece of chocolate wrapped in crispy bacon- you know it's weird, you know you shouldn't, but you just can't stop doing it. I couldn't stop vaping this- it was sweet and tangy and sour and perfectly pink. But still, just so wrong it redefined what \"right\" is. Amazing. ","score":5},{"user":"AutomaticFailure","text":"What damn abomination is this? Why do I like it so much? I don't know what it is with pink guava lately, but there is something to be had here. You and Kocanda with his Dream Haze are making me look at pink guava in a different light. There is a sharpness yet... cream? It's bright yet mellow? You are brain fucking me right now!?!? ","score":5},{"user":"nowar","text":"It’s amazing. Plain and simple. It’s that kind of mix that makes me think I should try harder instead of waiting to get luckier. What is this? (1) It is so  pink and it sells milkiness in a unique way. (2) It is a truly lovely vape.&#xD;\n&#xD;\nI’ll try to explain: It’s as close to a ‘sour’ taste as I’ve had up front. There’s a floral element to the pank that comes in strong with a solid fruit base rounding out the body and it’s followed by a light creamy milky undertone that washes the palate clean after. It makes for endless pulls. It’s crazy because it comes across as a strongly floral vape, with sharp high notes in the nose and a really light body, but it is both insanely satisfying and intriguing. Pink guava is in here, but if I hadn’t known, I never would have guessed. It’s a far cry from the fruity mixes I have used it for.&#xD;\n&#xD;\nI suspect hibiscus is pulling the PG into that floral realm and tying the whole thing together into this one wildly pink ride. I think it’s remarkable how softly the creams show up here as I would have expected them to present more like the HS or even as a more distinct milk. They dont overpower or overcrowd, it’s more the lingering palate cleansing sensation that makes the exhale end so softly. But what’s happened to the PG is really the surprise of the show. It’s like it became a new flavor entirely. You took the pink and mingled the grapefruit into a sour milky tartness that pours down the gullet with a hella strong nose flavor and a slightly candyish sweet not sweet pinky thing going on. Remarkable.","score":5},{"user":"Foment_life","text":"It’s definitely pink, it’s definitely funky. The guava here is sharp, and I think that’s really what the milk is bringing to the table. Tempering that sharpness is the majority of how I know it’s there. I like this, I can’t exactly pin down much about it other than the guava though. The mouthfeel is very much sharper on the inhale than the exhale, which is really where the taste of the milk is coming through more than anything.&#xD;\n&#xD;\nTaking a peek at the recipe, either there’s room to push the creams up a bit for balance’s sake, or my tongue is broken from the sheer amount of creams I’ve vaped over the past 6 weeks.In either case, it makes sense. I might like to see how much that French vanilla ice cream can be pushed to give it something of a malted milk feel if I were to really try to change something here. I like the way this kind of comes at you in two phases, with the fruit predominant up front and the cream sort of pushing it aside on the exhale. I sort of see this as a jumping off point. One more component to bridge the gap one way or the other could push this into something I could vape all day.","score":5}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"184392","name":"Pank Milk"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
