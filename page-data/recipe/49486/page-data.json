The description on their website sounded good, so I made something with that as inspiration. I have a friend that vapes retail, and has had Yig, who will be my test subject.

Having RF stuff and Cap V1, I plan at least a week long steep before I try it. \r\n\r\n","steep_days":"7","temperature":"0","recipe_score":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-11T13:43:53.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"1866","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Oatmeal Cookie â€“ SC","flavor_id":"7522","vendor":"RF","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Oatmeal Cookie","flavor_id":"178","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Cookie","flavor_id":"490","vendor":"FA","millipercent":250},{"name":"Biscuit","flavor_id":"642","vendor":"INW","millipercent":500},{"name":"Brown Sugar","flavor_id":"313","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Vanilla (bourbon)","flavor_id":"184","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":250},{"name":"Vanillin 10% (pg)","flavor_id":"190","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":250},{"name":"Vanilla Custard","flavor_id":"131","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Sweetener","flavor_id":"339","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Ethyl Maltol","flavor_id":"1710","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Blackcurrant","flavor_id":"545","vendor":"FA","millipercent":5000}],"reviews":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"49486","name":"1 Yig Remix"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
