Terk's Butterscotch custard. It is also a very easy recipe to make along with being three ingredients almost every mixer has. This version has a lot of sweetener because M. Terk's Butterscotch custard is very sweet. Feel free to use any sweetener you want and or none any way you shake it its gonna be good. As far as steeping goes it is a custard me personally I like them almost immediately but they get better and better the older they get. In my opinion it has settled down enough to be very enjoyable after 4 days but obviously it just gets better and better every day after that. This was an easy clone to do because its so very close to one of my personal all day vapes krucial's butter almond custard. The second I tasted it I said it is definetly butterscotch ripple and vanilla custard v1. Anyway this is a simple basically three ingredient recipe that is great for beginners because they can't go wrong buying these three ingredients. If you want to add a little complexity to the custard add 1% inawera custard but in terms of the clone at hand it wasn't necessary. If you like this then definetly check out Krucial's Butter Almond Custard being they are very similar.","steep_days":"4","temperature":"0","recipe_score":4.4,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:49:16.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"11902","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Butterscotch Ripple","vendor":"FW","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Vanilla Custard","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Toasted Marshmallow","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Sweetness","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":500}],"reviews":[{"user":"MikeRaf23","text":"mixed this up 5 days ago and to be honest, I don't really get much of anything. its not bad but for what it is, its easy to make and I had the mix.

So when i saw this recipe i thought WOW this might be exactly the recipe... and if not it is super close. Great job man.üëçüèª"},{"user":"finsamson","text":"Very nice, I've never had the original but this is a tasty easy mix. I only steeped over night but I presume it can only get better. Thanks so much for sharing this one! Love it"},{"user":"Frin","text":"Very nice, even after just a week of steeping, good job Tootall.&#xD;\nJust an FYI: I never had the original"},{"user":"KylezKloudz","text":"To be honest, I don't really get much of nothing... Not really custardy, not really butterscotch, maybe I messed something up or maybe it's just me... I know your an accomplished mixer and there are other reviews on this recipe to prove it, I enjoy some of your other recipes and I enjoy butterscotch custard, unfortunately this one didn't work for me... If I try to mix it again I'll update my review."},{"user":"Pricey666","text":"Decided to make 120ml of this right away and boy am I glad I did! It's only aged like 5 hours and it is extremely tasty! It's a nice thick, but not too thick creamy custard. Butterscotch is sweet but subtle right after mixing. I will update after a proper steep"},{"user":"mk0","text":"This is delicious!
