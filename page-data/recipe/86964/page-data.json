May make some tweaks to this after a steep. \r\n\r\nJamie Lannister is a great anti villian.  He is loyal, strong, and layered.  I decided to make a golden (the lannister color) incest pudding cake.  I wanted it to be a heavy cake due to his strong personality.  Golden due to the Lannister color.  Creamy in the middle due to his odd love for his sister and family.  He is bold and arrogant, stong and loyal, and mushy when it comes to his love for his family.
