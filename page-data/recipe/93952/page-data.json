This combination of fluffy white and custard creates a thick dense cake with a slight citrus note from the nonna's cake\r\n\r\nRum - There is a about a cup of rum in these cakes it is very prominent... so i need a rum that would stand up in this mix - VTA light rum is more like a golden medium bodied boozie rum that is probably the best rum I have tried \r\n\r\nThe patisserie filling - . I used the Bavarian cream - which is a vanilla egg based pastry cream, and lava cake and hangsen which will create the chocolate ganache layer . The custard will also help out here with some eggy notes \r\n\r\nThe frosting - is an Italian whipped butter cream which is traditional for this cake not a thick sugary butter cream - so vanilla whipped cream was perfect and the cake is covered by almonds\r\n\r\nvanilla is a very prominent flavor profile in this cake so wanted to enhance that a bit with shisha vanilla ","steep_days":"5","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"total_reviews":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T15:21:08.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"1667","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Bavarian Cream","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Almond","vendor":"FA","millipercent":750},{"name":"Australian Chocolate","vendor":"HS","millipercent":500},{"name":"Custard Premium","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Fluffy White Cake SC","vendor":"WF","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Lava Cake","vendor":"LB","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Light Rum","vendor":"VT","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Nonna's Cake","vendor":"FA","millipercent":750},{"name":"Shisha Vanilla","vendor":"INW","millipercent":300},{"name":"Vanilla Whipped Cream","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Sweetness","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":300}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"93952","name":"MBs Italian Rum Cake"}}}
