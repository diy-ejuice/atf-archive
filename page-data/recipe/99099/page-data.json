Not enough of em that work. \r\n\r\nJF Yellow Cake + INW Biscuit:\r\nCake base, needed help with texture, so biscuit. \r\n\r\nWF Buttercream Frosting + FW Hazelnut:\r\nButtercream frosting is delicious on its own, but a little bit of hazelnut makes it that much better. Delicious. \r\n\r\nYou can vape it the next day and you’ll be really happy. Wait 5 days and you’ll be even happier. After that I haven’t noticed much of a change. \r\n\r\nAdd .25% FLV Sweetness if desired, it’s pretty sweet on its own.
