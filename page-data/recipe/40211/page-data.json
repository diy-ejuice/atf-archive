It's weaker for FLV, so at 4% it's just enough to give a full bodied fruit punch juice type flavor, but the \"fruit\" is a little vague so we're adding some friends to help it stand out a bit.\r\n\r\nLA Watermelon Clear comes next, adding some sweet, semi candied back notes to the juice, helping both the mixed fruit profile and giving some life to the nectar/syrup body of the juice.\r\n\r\nINW Cherries boosts the cherry ntoes I get from FLV Tropical Punch. Any higher than .5 results in instant robotussin flavor, but it balances nicely.\r\n\r\nFLV Blueberry is the last fruit additive, giving some depth the the watermelon and mixed fruit.\r\n\r\nINW Cactus is here at .25% to stay hidden while still adding some juicy mouthfeel\r\n\r\nFLV Guava adds a nice tart finishing note to offer balance to the ultra sweet and syrupy juice.","steep_days":"1 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":4,"total_reviews":1,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:49:15.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"3642","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Blueberry","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":500},{"name":"Cactus","vendor":"INW","millipercent":250},{"name":"Cherries","vendor":"INW","millipercent":500},{"name":"Pink Guava","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":500},{"name":"Tropical Punch","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Watermelon","vendor":"LA","millipercent":2500}],"reviews":[{"user":"Deweysuds","score":"4","text":"One month steep.  Needed the longer steep for the pink guava to settle down.  A nice punch blend with melon accents.  Everything plays well together.  The guava is the note that is the most distinct to me.  The cactus makes this nice and juicy.  The tropical punch gives a nice base for all the other flavors to blend in.  The only reason it’s not regular vape for me is I’m not a big fan of the pink guava.  It tends to take over recipes too much for me.  Great summer vape over all.
