The full name is above, but the user friendly version is simply Tesseract. This is a triple trinity mix, inspired by none other than Graham aka DigitalDrops aka ThatVegasManiac. He suggested a trinity trinity once, and I loved the idea. So here we have all three trinities, all using the same percentage in each. So the bourbon trinity is all at 3%, the Apricot/Peach trinity is all at 1%, and the cake trinity all at 2%. Jerry's psychotic ass decided to add 1% VT Golden Syrup in the final seconds of the timeline, but it adds some wicked sweetness/juiciness to the mix. Good on him for being a fucking idiot. There isn't enough time to dive deeper into this.\r\n\r\nThree trinities, you can't fuck with us. This whole competition was making three become one, well, we made nine become three become one, so fuck you. CokeCan and DrunkLordGG out here.\r\n\r\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/bz644h/mixer_showdown_5_the_heavyweights/\r\n\r\nCome join us on Discord! https://discord.gg/ufVTyAQ","steep_days":"0 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"total_reviews":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T17:35:46.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"1209","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Armenia (apricot)","vendor":"FA","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Bourbon","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Kentucky Bourbon","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Honey Peach","vendor":"JF","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Peach White","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Back Bar Bitters","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Angel Cake SC","vendor":"WF","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Vanilla Custard","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Devon Cream","vendor":"VT","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Golden Syrup","vendor":"VT","millipercent":1000}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"155222","name":"Jerry Opened the Tesseract at 420 Because We're Green Team, But Kocanda Got Too Drunk and Missed the Deadline"}}}
