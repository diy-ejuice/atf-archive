I’d say it’s a cross between a shortbread and a digestive biscuit. Has a light coconut taste to it. \r\nButter Pecan I can only say wow. I’m not a nut flavor vaper, but this changed my mind. It’s sweet and buttery and decadent \r\nCinnamon Sugar It reminds me of that premix blend you can get from your local supermarket. A lovely blend not too sweet and not too much cinnamon bite. \r\nI’ve been pleased thus far by the first flavors released in this line. \r\nCan’t wait to see what’s next! \r\n","steep_days":"1 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":3.5,"total_reviews":2,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:49:36.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"2233","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Biscuit","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Butter Pecan","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Cinnamon Sugar","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":500}],"reviews":[{"user":"JB_S","score":"4","text":""},{"user":"cdaniell30","score":"3","text":"Light on flavor after a steep, but really gets close to that Pecan Sandy profile"}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"65420","name":"Butter Pecan Biscuit"}}}
