Great balance between the caramel and the cinnamon. The only thing for me that didn't make it a 5 star (perfect) mix is I think the butter pecan could be a bit higher. Well done though, it is a pleasure to vape this, very tasty. I think the sugar cone is a perfect addition to this mix."}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"23230","name":"Rollin "}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
