The OOO Strawberry apple was a good start and gave a good base to the whole mix, but it needed help in every aspect. The Strawberry, apple and gummy aspects all needed a little boost. \r\n\r\nI like my juices sweet. If you want you could hold off on the sweetener or use your preferred sweetener but I highly recommend you don't pass up on this and give it a try.\r\n\r\nAny thoughts on making the recipe even better are greatly appreciated.
