The vanilla swirl brings the recipe together and give it a good amount of body and slightly creamy texture. It's great for an all day vape or use it as a pallet cleanser. It's great off the shake and even better after a 48 hour steep.","steep_days":"2 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"total_reviews":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-06T23:08:41.000-05:00","best_vg":"60%","views":"643","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Blueberry Gummy Candy SC","vendor":"WF","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Swedish Gummy","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Sugarloaf Pineapple","vendor":"VT","millipercent":500},{"name":"Vanilla Swirl","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Marshmallow (Vanilla)","vendor":"OOO","millipercent":1000}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"191771","name":"Sour Blue & White Gummy Ring"}}}
