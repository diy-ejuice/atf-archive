Well not just my own but pretty much all vanilla profiles I have tried. I have used LA buttered popcorn and some biscuit bases with some success and that has driven me to start playing with some other angles. This time I went to the dough side adding zeppola and a couple other things to help it along. To me it’s “ok” but not amazing although his may be due to my issue. TPA vanilla custard is sort of helping with the sense blindness to Capella Vanilla Custard V1 and most French vanilla profiles. \r\n\r\nI hope this is enjoyed and improved upon since I’m certain it can be made better or even just give some inspiration to somebody. And if you do enjoy it please let me know. Alternatively if it gives you inspiration go ahead and link me up since you may also help me once again enjoy my Custard addiction haha.
