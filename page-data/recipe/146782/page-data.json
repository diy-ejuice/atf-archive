Yes. And I love how sweet and juicy it is. But, I do get a little tiny bit of raspberry floral that throws it off Swedish Fish just a hair. I heard it might steep out if left longer than the 3 days recommended here, so maybe it just needs a longer steep time. Also heard replacing 1% of the Gushy Candy with 1% FW Razzleberry might fix it. Haven't tried either of those things yet.","score":4},{"user":"Slushy","text":"ðŸ˜† That's a clever name....","score":0}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"146782","name":"Tigers Ex"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
