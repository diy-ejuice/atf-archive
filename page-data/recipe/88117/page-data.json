Obviously not enough tobacco, top heavy, and just kind of flat. I was working on another variation with DFS Holy Holy Grail, but that needs to be something else completely. I tried a few existing recipes that were using additional tobacco to bolster RY4Ds, but they were still lacking in my opinion. INW Dark for Pipe was an obvious choice, and is a perfect match with RY4D. I really like this stuff fresh just because of how potent Dark for Pipe is, but after 3 weeks everything has come together and blended wonderfully. If you want an RY4 that has some serious punch this is what you are looking for. \r\n\r\nINW Classic for pipe Dark:\r\n\r\nThis stuff I awesome. Dark, earthy, skunky tobacco with some dark fruit and a little cacao. It's an absolutely perfect match with RY4D, and the cigar / fruit / cacao make this a perfect base for a stanky RY4. \r\n\r\nINW Classic for pipe Black:\r\n\r\nA legit full bodied, smoky tobacco to add a bit more depth and authenticity to the Dark. \r\n\r\nTPA RY4 Double:\r\n\r\nNot much that needs to be said about this. A really fantastic RY4, I get loads of smooth caramel, and almost no vanilla or tobacco. Which is great because I really don't like vanilla. This started high, but after a couple variations it ended up at 4%. At first it really stands out, but after some time it comes together with Dark and they blend perfectly. \r\n\r\nFA Oak Wood:\r\n\r\nThis was the perfect way to add a little more body while also adding some wood and a little more sweetness that I wanted but wasn't quite getting after dropping the RY4D to where it is. Also doesn't add any additional gunkyness while bringing a little more authenticity to the tobacco base. \r\n\r\nEnjoy!","steep_days":"21","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"total_reviews":1,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T22:32:43.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"2952","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Ry4 Double","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Classic For Pipe Dark","vendor":"INW","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Oak Wood","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Classic For Pipe Black","vendor":"INW","millipercent":500}],"reviews":[{"user":"Mr-G","score":"none","text":"any good"}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"88117","name":"RYDark"}}}
