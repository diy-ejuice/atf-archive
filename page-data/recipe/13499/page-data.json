This puts the Albatross Nighthammer debate to rest once and for all."},{"user":"kindground","text":"My favorite grapefruit recipe. Hands down. The trinity of grapefruit here with the Jasmine is a great realistic grapefruit base. Then you throw that vanilla at and it goes all grapefruit cream soda-ish. Fantastic recipe and a classic for the ages. "},{"user":"Slippaz","text":"This is all I could ever ask for in a grapefruit vape.  I don't even want to give flavor notes.  Just mix it up.  It's amazing."},{"user":"Philosaphucker","text":"I blew through this pretty quickly. Making grapefruit an enjoyable vape for all day use is no small task. Thosr vanilla notes are a nice, rewarding contrast to the accurate representation of grapefruit. Very well done."},{"user":"ENYAWREKLAW","text":"If you want to, you can swallow this recipe bones and all"},{"user":"Bogey_Again","text":""},{"user":"ID10-T","text":"Like shoving whole segments of Rio Star grapefruit into my face and washing it down with vanilla cream soda.
