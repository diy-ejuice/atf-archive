This is a 5 star recipe without any doubt, and I'd hate to see new mixers pass over this due to its arbitrary four star rating as a result of a single troll rating without any comment. This recipe has seen me through many good &amp; bad times. Its existence has helped turn what could have been tough times into pleasurable experiences. I use it much like I would a detox smoothie; it's always good to have some on hand. The banana combo is straight up perfect. The pineapple is subtle, but perfectly blended &amp; balanced to pair up with the bananas. Cactus works so well to moisten things up and add a little intrigue to each pull, and the orange cream is a master touch, pairing up with the LA Banana Cream to add that luxurious mouth feel of a perfect smoothie. I cannot, for the life of me, understand why anyone in their right mind would not enjoy this recipe. This is master level mixing.

Got around to my mix after about 5 weeks. Yes, the banana is just where I like it - there all the time, but not overpowering. Silky fruity smooth and perfectly balanced juice. Brilliant work, thank you Sir. I can now forgive you for Grack!"},{"user":"BradH","text":"This is really good, I let mine sit for like two months on accident. The banana almost holds the backseat at this point. It's very good. The cactus is fantastic in this recipe. Very happy with this mix. "},{"user":"LocoMojo","text":"This is a very realistic banana-pineapple smoothie. The cactus does a lot of work here for the amount that is in the mix. The aloe taste thickens and wets the mix, makes up the bulk of the \"green\" taste of the smoothie, and boosts the banana's freshness. I really liked this after about a 15 day steep per ID10-T's recommendation. This vape is definitely a lot denser than the ingredients would suggest as well. "},{"user":"Pilgrim","text":"I have been desperate to find a find a recipe that can give me some relief from my addiction to citrus or bakery profiles. Funny that when I finally found one I could vape all day it would be called Detox. Really happy that you shared this with us."},{"user":"ConcreteRiver","text":"All of the fruit flavors in here work really well together.  It's definitely one of those most realistic-tasting uses of pineapple that I've had.  The banana is also excellent.  Smooth texture, great flavor.  The orange cream scared me a bit at first, but it definitely mellows into a team player with steep time.  It's a nice example of a cohesive blend of flavors as opposed to the thinking that everything has to be sprinkled or drizzled with something else."},{"user":"ID10-T","text":"The flavors are nice and melt together smoothly into a sweet fruity treat after steeping for 9 or 10 days. But what really made an impression on me is the mouth-feel, which is nothing short of luxurious. I could not have guessed this juice would be so thick and creamy from just looking at the ingredients."}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"15465","name":"Detox"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
