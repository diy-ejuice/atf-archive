This mix has a wonderful tropical \"Neon\" sherbet feel to it. It's creamy, bright, tropical, and delicious. There is a slight floral note and I normally don't like floral notes, but in this mix it's very well balanced and I think it adds to the over-all mix and makes it better. Nice work here Imagineight!"}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"112942","name":"Neon Cream Clone"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
