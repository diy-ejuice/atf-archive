I wanted a blended minty, creamy, tobacco mix.  The creme de menth is the main note and the vanilla bourbon and fresh cream support that and add some extra cream.  I did some digging and decided to combine the burley, native, and cured for the tobaaco.  The torrone is to add some sweetness to the tobaccos and blend it all together.  I'm digging it off the shake, but we will see how it steeps.
