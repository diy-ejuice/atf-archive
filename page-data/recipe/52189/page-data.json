To me the first version measured next to real thing had more of that Graham cracker flavor and just a hint of Peanutbutter. So I switched from Graham cracker Clear TFA to FW Graham cracker @8% which seems high but works really well in this recipe and lowered the TFA Peanut butter to .5%. This recipe taste almost 1:1 of the original MH after a 7 day Steep. \r\nIf you want it sweeter and .25 cap super sweet.","steep_days":"7","temperature":"0","recipe_score":3,"total_reviews":1,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T17:34:09.000-05:00","best_vg":"60%","views":"2006","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Graham Cracker","vendor":"FW","millipercent":8000},{"name":"Marshmallow","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Peanut Butter","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Vanilla Swirl","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Vanilla Custard","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":2000}],"reviews":[{"user":"reasonably_dan","score":"3","text":"good recipe. tested side by side to the original. however its  a bit muted and the color alone says there is too much of one of the dark ingredients. &#xD;\n&#xD;\nwould you be interested in helping me perfect milk and honey? i am damn close and have found that 3% FW bananas foster is the honey they are using, it also adds the caramel notes everyone always gets. 4% TFA vannila bean ice cream, some TFA peanut butter, and 1% FW sweetener get you 90% of the way there. i would love the help of a mixing partner to figure out which of the many cookies/AP they are using. message me on ATF :)&#xD;\n-reasonably dan"}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"52189","name":"Milk and Honey Remix V2"}}}
