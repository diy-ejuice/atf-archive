Who doesn't love that thick, sugary, syrup-like center of a freshly baked, toasted pecan pie with a moist sugary crust? Well, that's what I've tried to recreate. \r\nINW Biscuit and CAP Sugar Cookie. These percentages are my goto for a dense sugary, almost, graham cracker-like crust without using graham cracker.\r\nFW Butter Pecan and FLV Milk & Honey pair well together as the silky sweet center of the pecan pie. FW Butter Pecan has a slight nut shell bitterness and the FLV Milk & Honey tones this down a bit and adds a touch of balance to the mix.\r\nCAP Super Sweet is there to give it an extra boost of sweetness. You can mix this without it but,  I have a massive sweet tooth and I enjoy it this way.\r\nThis recipe represents the type of recipes I enjoy. I love creating recipes that simulate real-life recipes we all enjoy. I also try to use as few flavorings as I can. I've learned the more flavorings you use, the more muted the recipe becomes. And also, I try to use flavorings that most mixers have in their inventories so they don't have to purchase more flavorings they may not use very much; \"Recipes for the Masses\". \r\nSteep time is around 5 days but can be a shake and vape if you just can't wait.

Enjoy :)\r\n","steep_days":"5","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:49:29.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"7361","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Biscuit","vendor":"INW","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Sugar Cookie","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Butter Pecan","vendor":"FW","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Milk & Honey","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Super Sweet","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":250}],"reviews":[{"user":"RockyHarlow","text":"Absolute banger. Smooth, rich, thick, milky dark sweetness that just absolutely coats your tastebuds in happy. 3 day steep is okay for me but 5 is even better. You'll know it's ready when the bottle goes dark golden brown. Mix this one in large batches so you don't run out."},{"user":"MotherPunker","text":"simple yet brilliantly concocted.  2nd time around, I actually added .75%  VT golden syrup &amp; .50% TPA butter to it just to fill in some more of that sticky gooeyness that's in pecan pie along with some buttery diketone goodness.  For my palate, that made a great recipe even more mouth watering.  much thanks folkart, Id not have thought about the addition of milk &amp; honey"},{"user":"cdaniell30","text":"Big shoutout to a butter pecan recipe where the pecan isn't overpowering the rest of the mix.  Bravo, sir...it's delicious"},{"user":"TamVapes","text":"Delicious Folkart!!!  You hit the profile.  Love the butter Pecan and Milk and Honey together.  Great recipe!"}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"55591","name":"Peek-in Pie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
