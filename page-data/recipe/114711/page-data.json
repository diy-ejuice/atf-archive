Very tasty but needs a steep due to the vienna cream. HC Eggroll is a delicious crispy fried pastry with powdered sugar. I used Flv Sweet dough to make it a bit puffier tasting.","steep_days":"5","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:50:23.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"1582","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"sweetener (sucralose)","vendor":"OTHR","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Egg Roll","vendor":"HC","millipercent":500},{"name":"Sweet Dough","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":500},{"name":"Vanilla Cream Extra SC","vendor":"WF","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Vienna Cream","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1500}],"reviews":[{"user":"Aritria","text":"This is truly my kind of simple, fried doughy, vanilla creamy recipe.  Nice intro to the HC Eggroll for me.  As a SNV reminds me a bit of a funnel cake but with a better sweet note.  After 4 days I felt it was great! Thanks!"},{"user":"Ebc88","text":"Steeped for a week and tried &amp; was alittle disappointed. Tasted oily &amp; i was pretty bummed. Had some recipes in my head to use the HC Eggroll in, but I didnâ€™t give up on it let it sit a few more days. And the oiliness has seemed to have steeped out, &amp; i can taste those delicious creams you used. Nice work and thanks for sharing "}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"114711","name":"mlNikon's Cream Puff"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
