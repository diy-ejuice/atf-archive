Very tasty but needs a steep due to the vienna cream. HC Eggroll is a delicious crispy fried pastry with powdered sugar.

Nice intro to the HC Eggroll for me.  As a SNV reminds me a bit of a funnel cake but with a better sweet note.  After 4 days I felt it was great! Thanks!","score":5},{"user":"Ebc88","text":"Steeped for a week and tried &amp; was alittle disappointed. Tasted oily &amp; i was pretty bummed. Had some recipes in my head to use the HC Eggroll in, but I didnâ€™t give up on it let it sit a few more days. And the oiliness has seemed to have steeped out, &amp; i can taste those delicious creams you used. Nice work and thanks for sharing ","score":5}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"114711","name":"mlNikon's Cream Puff"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
