Luckily /u/ID10-T suggested this one, and it's a spot on banana nut bread. It's great after 3 days but gets even better after a week. The only thing I may add in the future is some meringue for a light sugar icing on the top but otherwise it's amazing!","steep_days":"7","temperature":"0","recipe_score":4,"total_reviews":1,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:49:27.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"1319","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Banana Nut Bread","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":7000},{"name":"Sugar Cookie","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Vanilla Bean Ice Cream","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Cupcake batter","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1500}],"reviews":[{"user":"cdaniell30","score":"4","text":"I still haven't met a banana nut bread recipe I didn't like, and this one just creamy enough without dulling the BNB spice."}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"54375","name":"'Nana Nead"}}}
