The recipes are a little different from each state but most of them share the raspberry, lemon, and vanilla combo and of course tons of blue food coloring. This is my take on the my favorite version that contains little tiny pieces of pineapple. I used this recipe as a reference:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.food.com/recipe/blue-moon-ice-cream-123818\r\n\r\nI'll add some notes and may make a few adjustments but I made 2 different variations last night. The first one I tried to cheat and use vanilla bean ice cream as the base and it was good but didn't seem as accurate as this one where I made the ice cream from scratch using the recipe above. The flavors I used are decent as a shake and vape but the creams should develop a bit after a week or so. \r\n\r\nIf you are from the Northeast or Midwest and remember this delicious treat mix this up and let me know what you think! I got a craving for it after reading about the RF SC reviews and this definitely is hitting the spot.","steep_days":"7 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-06T20:49:45.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"1464","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Cream Fresh","flavor_id":"540","vendor":"FA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Berryl (raspberry)","flavor_id":"412","vendor":"FA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Raspberry","flavor_id":"667","vendor":"INW","millipercent":500},{"name":"Lemon Sicily","flavor_id":"524","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Cream","flavor_id":"604","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":500},{"name":"Shisha Vanilla","flavor_id":"841","vendor":"INW","millipercent":500},{"name":"Vanilla Custard","flavor_id":"633","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Vanilla Whipped Cream","flavor_id":"1","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Golden Pineapple","flavor_id":"61","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1000}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"47756","name":"Erie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
