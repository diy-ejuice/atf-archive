I've never had Donut Pounder, but that was my inspiration. It's a bit neutral, but also good enough that I vape it almost ever day. It's got enough layers to it to be interesting, but it's not so overpowering that I get worn out by it. It also makes a nice base for other donut(y) creations. It's pretty good right out of the gate, but the cinnamon calms down best after about a week.","steep_days":"7","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T03:30:44.000-05:00","best_vg":"80%","views":"1673","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Cake (yellow)","vendor":"FW","millipercent":500},{"name":"Cinnamon Danish Swirl","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":250},{"name":"Ethyl Maltol","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Frosted Donut","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Glazed Doughnut","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":5000},{"name":"Joy","vendor":"FA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Sweetener","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Whipped Cream","vendor":"FW","millipercent":2000}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"39027","name":"Deez Donuts"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
