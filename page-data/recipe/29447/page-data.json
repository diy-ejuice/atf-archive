It is a staple of most of our youths. I present to you Bubbilicious Grape. \r\n\r\nThe goal was a well known candy using Cap & TPA ingredients. I feel that this delivers on the demands while being a superb bubblegum. It did not come easy there were many, many tests of this rounds recipe. It is with confidence I can say this is as most realistic to grape bubblicious has I would ever be able to get. So if by some chance you have not had this candy it has the following characteristics: fluffy, almost creamy but not dairy, grape that is smooth not sour, sweet, gum notes, powdery marshmallow chew vs. a traditional crisp bite. The ingredients were replaced with different ideas including EM at high doses, Sweetener ranges of 0-1.5%, Grape going from 3-6%, Cap Jelly Candy from 1-3%, etc. It took a number of tries to reach what I feel will hit all the right spots for any grape gum addict out there. \r\n\r\nThere are two parts to this delicious gum:\r\nThe grape side which is made with a combination of the grape juice, sweetener and vanilla swirl\r\nThe gum side which is made with the bubble gum, marshmallow, as well as sweetener and vanilla swirl.  \r\n\r\nBubble Gum CAP \r\nTo me this is the best starting point for a good store gum, but as you work with it you find it has some limitations. I did have tpa gum but it just was nasty to me. \r\nSo I chose Capella because it gives that perfect whipped gum smell and taste but it is missing the fluff experience from those square gum clouds. Alone it fades quick and can't hang, with a few layering ingredients it turns more into the gum we are seeking. It was put at this range to stay in the mix while not ruining the mix. I feel it hits the mark at this %\r\n\r\nGrape Juice TPA\r\nThis is the only gum grape, period. The rest are not the same as that fake grape that we love from the grape gum. Mixing this and bubble gum just give off two notes that don't work as a finished recipe. Over 4% and it was all grape, under 3% and bubblegum took over in testing. This range gives it that pop at first of grape but then lets it slide into the middle just like actual gum would. \r\n\r\nMarshmallow TPA\r\nThis was selected for mouthfeel and gum layering. The Cap Bubblegum needed multiple layers to make it. It was necessary for the gummy mouth effect and the marshmallow adds a few layers of sweet to the mix. This marshmallow is far better than Capella which has a syrupy note that wouldn't help our gum stay on track for the targeted flavor. \r\n\r\nSweetener TPA\r\nI dialed the sweet back multiple times to hit the gum sweet but then stop. This was very difficult in hitting a gum sweet while not being unbearable for an adv. \r\n\r\nVanilla Swirl TPA\r\nThis finally tied it together. It was the secret magic ingredient to give that full flavor grape it needed. I would have not felt so good about this mix if this beautiful idea hadn't come along. It doesn't even add the vanilla as much as fix the one noted grape and bring the whole thing together. \r\n\r\nThis has been an amazing round and thanks for the chance to play. I hope you feel that this hits the mark for a perfect bubblegum like the days of baseball in the dugout eating the whole pack of this stuff. \r\n","steep_days":"0 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"updated_at":"2020-12-12T20:28:51.000-05:00","best_vg":"80%","views":"10146","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Bubble Gum","flavor_id":"21","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":4500},{"name":"Vanilla Swirl","flavor_id":"189","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Sweetener","flavor_id":"339","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":250},{"name":"Marshmallow","flavor_id":"332","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Grape Juice","flavor_id":"231","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":3250}],"reviews":[{"user":"Dobry83","text":"Used Flv bubblegum at 2% ,only one I had, and it'sy adv for past week!!
