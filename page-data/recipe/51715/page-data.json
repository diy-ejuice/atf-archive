CAP Honeydew Melon contains the right acidity and juiciness of a real melon chewing gum. At 3% does the job. It's a strong flavor and above 3% can give a subtle throat hit.\r\n\r\nINW Shisha Strawberry fits well with the Honeydew Melon from CAP. 0.5% is enough to sweetening and to give the candy note to the Strawberry itself.\r\n\r\nTFA Strawberry Ripe / JF Strawberry Sweet complements the rest of the Strawberry, giving authenticity. JF Strawberry Sweet can be replaced for CAP Sweet Strawberry by the same percentage.\r\n\r\nTFA Dragonfruit - to enhance the strawberry notes slightly. 0.5% is enough for this function in this recipe.\r\n\r\nSweetener - I already find the recipe sweet enough but if you choose to use it, use CAP Super Sweet up to 0.25%, TFA Sweetener up to 0.5% or other sweetener type you prefer.\r\n\r\nThe recipe is Shake & Vape but 1 day of steeping is what I would advise for this recipe.","steep_days":"2 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-10T17:56:45.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"1279","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Honeydew Melon","flavor_id":"73","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Strawberry Sweet","flavor_id":"4745","vendor":"JF","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Strawberry (ripe)","flavor_id":"271","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Shisha Strawberry","flavor_id":"1711","vendor":"INW","millipercent":500},{"name":"Dragonfruit","flavor_id":"226","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Super Sweet","flavor_id":"2384","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":250}],"reviews":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"51715","name":"Melon & Strawberry Gum"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
