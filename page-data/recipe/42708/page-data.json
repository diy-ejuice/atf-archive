All year long, we would have a stock of approximately 1 gallon of sweet, SWEET, southern iced tea. As my brother and I got older, we became interested in learning how to make \"the best tea in the world\". We were shocked to find that my mother put 2 cups of sugar/gallon of boiling water. \r\n\r\nFast forward to being an adult, living in Northeast Ohio, I find myself craving sweet tea as soon as winter breaks and I trade in my winter coat for a light jacket. My brother, living in TX now, has adapted my mom's old recipe, cutting the sugar by 2/3. This Recipe is inspired by my brother's adaptation: Louisiana Sweet Tea\r\n\r\nCAP Juicy Lemon/FA Lime Tahity: These two flavors, at this percentage give you a lovely lemon-citrus blend. It's a light counter-balance to the earthy depth of the teas.\r\n\r\nCAP Super Sweet/TPA Marshmallow: The Super sweet gives you that sugary sweetness that comes with sweet tea. The TPA Marshmallow gives a little more sweetness, plus a tiny bit of vanilla/marshmallow. Honestly, at 0.25, the marshmallow can likely be dropped as it's just a mild flavor enhancer.\r\n\r\nFA Black Tea and Green Tea. These two teas combined give you the earthiness of the black tea with the floral high notes of the green tea. I love these two flavors combined.","steep_days":"3 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-06T01:07:39.000-05:00","best_vg":"65%","views":"3595","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Juicy Lemon","flavor_id":"79","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Super Sweet","flavor_id":"2384","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":500},{"name":"Lime Tahity Cold Pressed","flavor_id":"581","vendor":"FA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Marshmallow","flavor_id":"332","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Tea Black Water Soluble","flavor_id":"548","vendor":"FA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Tea Green","flavor_id":"549","vendor":"FA","millipercent":2000}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"42708","name":"Louisiana Sweet Tea"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
