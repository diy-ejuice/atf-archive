It's clean with a tart bite that doesn't linger..It is higher %'s than I normally go but works great in this recipe without being overly sweet at .3-.4%; although you can take the sweetener in any direction if you so desire. It's great as a shake and vape but a couple days steep really brings out the complexity; I hope you enjoy it..I appreciate any feedback.\r\n\r\nOn 10/23/2020 I bumped LB Blue raspberry from 4.65 to 5.65 and tweaked a couple background notes which added a slightly deeper blu razz taste and helps the lemonade pop a bit more. As of 10/23 this is my favorite blue razz vape and is the only thing I've been vaping lately..","steep_days":"2 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T14:14:12.000-05:00","best_vg":"72%","views":"930","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Blue Raspberry","vendor":"LB","millipercent":5650},{"name":"Boysenberry","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":3670},{"name":"Lemonade","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":2200},{"name":"Lemonade","vendor":"LA","millipercent":3250},{"name":"Razzleberry","vendor":"FW","millipercent":3250},{"name":"Sweetness","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":300},{"name":"Fizzy Sherbet","vendor":"VT","millipercent":1200},{"name":"Raspberry","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Candy Roll","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":650}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"171244","name":"Static Blue"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
