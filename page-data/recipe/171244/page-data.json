It's clean with a tart bite that doesn't linger..It is higher %'s than I normally go but works great in this recipe without being overly sweet at .3-.4%; although you can take the sweetener in any direction if you so desire. It's great as a shake and vape but a couple days steep really brings out the complexity; I hope you enjoy it..I appreciate any feedback.\r\n\r\nOn 10/23/2020 I bumped LB Blue raspberry from 4.65 to 5.65 and tweaked a couple background notes which added a slightly deeper blu razz taste and helps the lemonade pop a bit more. As of 10/23 this is my favorite blue razz vape and is the only thing I've been vaping lately..","steep_days":"2 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-12T06:59:46.000-05:00","best_vg":"72%","views":"939","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Blue Raspberry","flavor_id":"1479","vendor":"LB","millipercent":5650},{"name":"Boysenberry","flavor_id":"614","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":3670},{"name":"Lemonade","flavor_id":"636","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":2200},{"name":"Lemonade","flavor_id":"951","vendor":"LA","millipercent":3250},{"name":"Razzleberry","flavor_id":"1393","vendor":"FW","millipercent":3250},{"name":"Sweetness","flavor_id":"4413","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":300},{"name":"Fizzy Sherbet","flavor_id":"8878","vendor":"VT","millipercent":1200},{"name":"Raspberry","flavor_id":"606","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Candy Roll","flavor_id":"2153","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":650}],"reviews":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"171244","name":"Static Blue"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
