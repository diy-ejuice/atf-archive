Part 3 in my Seven Of Nine/Borg Trilogy.*\r\n  \r\n\r\n**Description:**\r\n  \r\n*This recipe is an assimilation of really oddball & unique flavors. I mean, who the hell would make a Maryjane-Pistachio Custard? Good fresh out of the gate, but of course it begins to shine after a week or more. Personally, I prefer it fresh(weird, I know!)!*\r\n  \r\n**Data:**\r\n  \r\n*My choice of TFA Mary Jane is obvious, and a mere 2% plays very well with the other ingredients. Any more than 2% and I'm feeling like I'm vaping Scotch TapeÂ® flavored eliquid.*\r\n  \r\n*I still felt as though the Mary Jane needed a counter-balance in order to become 'fuller'/more authentic tasting. And TFA RY4 Double performed the task perfectly. This is not an RY4 mix by any means, so I kept the percentage at 2.5%.*\r\n  \r\n*Again, another obvious player here is TFA Pistachio. In combination with the RY4 & Mary Jane it brings out an almost \"ashy\" though nutty flavor. And I just love TFAs version of pistachio above all others.*\r\n  \r\n*JF Dulce De Leche & CAP Vanilla Custard v1 obviously provide a nice thick custard base. At 5%, the custard's egginess is restrained somewhat and doesn't \"bogart\" the entire mix!*\r\n  \r\n*CAP Cinnamon Danish Swirl at 0.5% adds a bit of depth to TFA's Mary Jane. It's a clever magician that can perform a pretty cool disappearing act at wattages around 45-55. Increase wattage to 63 or higher and the cinnamon comes out more, but only as a supporting flavoring.*\r\n  \r\n*Armpit steeped for 1 hour for perfection hehe*\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n  \r\n**Star Trek: Voyager & all its' characters are the sole property of Paramount.

This is not a bad vape, and I think you are working this flavor well.  I had to substitute the dulce de leche for tfa's.   This is a pretty decent vape, thank you for sharing...i had given up trying to make something decent out of the MJ, but you have made a decent recipe here.  I am going to also get back to working on this flavor, and I will report back with my findings!  A while ago I was reccomended by another person to use Yakima hops. So I'm going to give that a shot in here.  And also have you ever used reggae Night? I believe it's an FA flavor.  I'm going to try that also. I'm going to give this 5 stars, because it's the best recipe I've tasted with MJ in it, if we could bend those pine needles out of the vape, it would be amazing! Good job!!"}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"37472","name":"\"The Collective\"(Pistachio Maryjane Custard)"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
