A true master of florals. This is no exception. This one of the mixes I wanted to try but doubted if it would agree with my palate as I'm not a huge fan of florals most of the time. I was wrong. This is a truly incredible mix. It's a lot less in your face floral and has a calming, soothing flavor. Purple Rain takes the front stage and it tastes beautiful. A light lavender flavor carried by a smooth vanilla. With backing from Elderflower to carry the floral flavor. Pink Guava's citrus top notes take a step right behind the florals and bring an interesting contrast. Thai Chai is a dark flavor that gives a wonderful body along with the Soursop. Yakima Hops provides the earthy flavor for a extra special touch and melds perfectly with the Pink Guava.&#xD;\n&#xD;\nI recommend this to anyone looking for something different. This a gem that I really enjoy."}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"55181","name":"Summer Swallow"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
