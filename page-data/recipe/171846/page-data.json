However, he insisted that it's more my recipe than his and that I should share it. My only contribution was letting him know of a flavour order I made for a bunch of Mango concentrates we were discussing, along with FLV Cranberry and CAP Lemon Lime to try out his 1-2-3 Cranberry Sprite recipe. By doing so, it gave the Mango Man himself an idea - swapping out the FLV Cranberry with FLV Mango, to create 1-2-3 Mango Sprite...and it didn't disappoint. The Mango/Lemon/Lime combo works wonders.\r\n\r\nAnother great example of simple, yet effective! Definitely something that can be tweaked/built upon to make it even more amazing e.g. INW Cactus/FA Pear to add some juiciness and WS-23 and/or Polar Blast because fizzy drinks should be enjoyed cold. Perhaps some sweetener, if desired.","steep_days":"1 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:51:11.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"6068","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Fizzy Sherbet","flavor_id":"8878","vendor":"VT","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Lemon Lime","flavor_id":"83","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Mango","flavor_id":"3516","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1000}],"reviews":[{"user":"CriticalVape","text":"Great recipe. Simple and satisfying. Well done to all who participated. This is the kind of recipe that should be highlighted for new mixers. Set apart from the rest as a guaranteed winner with commercial viability so they can jump right into DIY. This js a great blank canvas. I added super sweet but definitely not necessary. Part of me wants to add FLV Citrus Soda or some MB Red Cherry and WS-23, perhaps. Possibilities.....a great vape with endless customizable options to suit any taste."},{"user":"Illegal_Immigrant","text":"No, this does not disappoint. Just off the shake, it's delicious. I was tempted to add a bit more Mango, but I'm afraid it would ruin the balance between the Lemon Lime and Mango. I see the other two reviewers added sweetener to it. I may try that, but I'm not sure it even needs it, it's pretty sweet as is. This is really tasty! Thanks!"},{"user":"toprod","text":"This is very nice simple recipe i added 0.5% super sweet and 0.5% WS23 overnight steep delicious .&#xD;\nThanks for sharing 5 stars from me."},{"user":"Kittybit","text":"This is actually pretty neat! FLV Mango and CAP Lemon Lime does go very well together. There's no BS with this recipe and I love it. You get what's on the label. For a 30ML I added 2 drops of CAP Super Sweet to make it just a little bit more poppin'. easy simpel delicious recipe. Oh and if Mr. Bellows says it's yours, then it's yours."}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"171846","name":"1-2-3 Mango Sprite"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
