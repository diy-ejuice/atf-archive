I thought it would be nice to share it since they enjoy it so much. To me it's a cross between the orange powder fun dip and the cheap little orange gumball that you get at Halloween( with a touch of lychee of course but it's tastyðŸ˜‹). It's ok S&V but a little bit harsh for me, give it 3 days to calm down.
