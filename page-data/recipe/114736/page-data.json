This needs a 2 weeks steep for everything to come fully together \r\n\r\nUnfortunately INW discontinued Waffle, Which is really sad because out the the 6 waffles I own this is the best one & it is pretty potent. 0.5 is more than enough to give a crispy waffle flavor that stands up to the creams and tobacco.\r\n\r\nFor my custard base I used FRESH03's S&V Custard. It is really good custard of the shake but it gets even richer with a steep. \r\n\r\nI know some people don't care for TPA RY4 Double, but used low it is really good in my opinion, and you can easily sub it for your favorite RY4. \r\n\r\nHS NO5 reminds me of a nutty RY4 without the creaminess.\r\n\r\nHS Red USA is Marlboro Red style tobacco, has some cocoa notes & some maple like sweetness. The tobacco itself is smooth & mellow. \r\n\r\n","steep_days":"12","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T19:15:42.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"1335","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Waffle (yc)","flavor_id":"744","vendor":"INW","millipercent":500},{"name":"No. 5","flavor_id":"2019","vendor":"HS","millipercent":1250},{"name":"Red USA Mix","flavor_id":"2013","vendor":"HS","millipercent":1250},{"name":"Vanilla Ice Cream","flavor_id":"1511","vendor":"LB","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Vanilla Pudding","flavor_id":"4433","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Ry4 Double","flavor_id":"379","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1250}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"114736","name":"Wafflers Breakfast Tobacco"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
