Purplesaurus Rex didn't show you he loved you with a great big hug; he crashed through your wall with his pal Koolaid Man in a face-melting blast of super fruity flavor.  This was one of my favorite summertime drinks as a kid, second only to Hi-C Ecto Cooler.  This mix hits the flavor profile perfectly.  \r\n\r\nFLV Grape has an artificial/candy grape flavor, like grape bubblegum or grape Kool-Aid.  An obvious choice here.\r\n\r\nThanks to Botboy's original INW Lemonade combo (and to ID10-T for pointing it out in the r/DIY_eJuice FOTW Lemonade thread), I used INW Lemon Concentrate and INW Lemon Mix at a 3:1 ratio for a great lemonade base. The Lemon Concentrate is a sweet candy lemon flavor, and the Lemon Mix adds a touch of tart lemon zest. This is actually a more authentic lemonade than is probably called for in a Koolaid flavor profile, but with the FLV Grape on top, I think it still works best here.  If it's too lemony for you, try leaving out the Lemon Mix.\r\n\r\nYou can adapt the recipe for sub-ohm vaping by reducing the fruit flavors by 30% and the coolant by 50% (FLV Grape 1%, INW Lemon Concentrate 2%, INW Lemon Mix 0.7%, Cap Super Sweet 0.25%, WS-23 1%).","steep_days":"1 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":4,"updated_at":"2020-12-12T18:29:54.000-05:00","best_vg":"60%","views":"2235","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Grape","flavor_id":"2593","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Lemon","flavor_id":"660","vendor":"INW","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Lemon Mix","flavor_id":"698","vendor":"INW","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Super Sweet","flavor_id":"2384","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":250},{"name":"WS-23","flavor_id":"8085","vendor":"OTHR","millipercent":2000}],"reviews":[{"user":"gravi-tea","text":"this was a good interpretation that we enjoyed. the contrast between the grape and lemon isn't one I would have had at the top of my list but it's definitely enjoyable.","score":4},{"user":"kindground","text":"This is so delicious, and simple, and unique.
