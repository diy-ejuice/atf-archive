I thought this is 1/3 of a banana split. So I  created Part 2, which had the chocolate and  strawberries and Part 3 was the banana and caramel. I let those steep, then tested each by themselves. Next I combine all 3 parts and vaped that, in doing so I found where i needed to make changes. Part 4 didn't pass, that is why the final version is Part 5","steep_days":"14","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T10:44:06.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"2780","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Golden Pineapple","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1250},{"name":"Vanilla Ice Cream","vendor":"LB","millipercent":5000},{"name":"Vanilla Bean Ice Cream","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Australian Chocolate","vendor":"HS","millipercent":1750},{"name":"Strawberry (ripe)","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Sweet Strawberry","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Banana Pur√©e","vendor":"WF","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Super Sweet","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":660},{"name":"Caramel Candy","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1250},{"name":"Lemon","vendor":"INW","millipercent":330},{"name":"Ripe Banana","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":330}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"114595","name":"Part 5: Deconstructed Banana Split "}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
