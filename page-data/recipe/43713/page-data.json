Sweet, Full Bodied, and Succulent.  Creams work wonderful together, with a little sweetness from the Marshmallow and Whipped Cream, especially on the exhale.  Just the slightest touch of grain from the graham for texture.  Sweetener is optional, but it rounds out the Strawberry bite and leaves that luscious sweet strawberry taste on the lips..  Excellent as a shake and vape, even better after a steep.  Easily an all day vape.  Mix this up, you won't be disappointed.  Look forward to everyone's feedback!","steep_days":"5 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-06T20:49:39.000-05:00","best_vg":"80%","views":"1122","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Bavarian Cream","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Cheesecake (graham Crust)","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Vanilla Bean Ice Cream","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Strawberry (ripe)","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":7000},{"name":"Sweet Cream","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Marshmallow","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Whipped Cream","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Sweetener","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Vienna Cream","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"43713","name":"Straw-Blurry Creme'"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
