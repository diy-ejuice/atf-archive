If you don't have JF Yellow Cake, FW can be used instead, even tho I wouldn't recommend using that flavor at all.\r\nDFS Holy Vanilla can be subbed for FA Custard Premium at 1%, it will be slightly different but not much really, it's just as good imo.\r\n\r\nTo get the real \"fika\" experience, this is best vaped together with a cup of coffee.","steep_days":"5","temperature":"420","recipe_score":5,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:50:55.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"1615","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Apple Fuji","vendor":"FA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Cinnamon Danish Swirl","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Yellow Cake","vendor":"JF","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Holy Vanilla","vendor":"DFS","millipercent":1000}],"reviews":[{"user":"TheJuiceJackBuilt","text":"Damn! This recipe is delicious. The way you managed to bend the fuji into a cooking apple is very impressive. Perfectly blended for my taste. Although you can taste the cinnamon, its not overpowering in the slightest and snuggles into this lovely appley cakey mix with ease. It tastes just like the apple cake my Mum made me for my birthday, so you scored maximum nostalgia points. Well done Bertie, smashed it again!"}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"150552","name":"Swedish Cinnamon Apple Cake"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
