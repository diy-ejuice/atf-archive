The flavors are pretty sweet on their own but feel free to add to your liking.\r\n\r\nAfter a shake it is, for me, a funky, cartoonish and candy-like sweet guava. With a little cactus tingle on the exhale. After a day or two the flavors blend together to a more cohesive guava candy. I can only describe it as a Funky Guava. \r\n\r\nPersonally, I did't notice a difference between 2-3 days and a 1,5 week steep. Curious how it wil fade/evolve after a longer steep though.\r\n\r\nInspiration from ENYAWREKLAW's Sweet Guava Flavorbook entry recipe & RockeyHarlow's Burst Duo Guava Dragonfruit (Somewhat Close) Clone.\r\nIf requested by ENYAWREKLAW of RockeyHarlow I will take the recipe down. Because I am not sure if I posted the recipe correctly","steep_days":"1 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:50:43.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"1880","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Sweet Guava","flavor_id":"118","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":5000},{"name":"Dragonfruit","flavor_id":"226","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":3500},{"name":"Pear","flavor_id":"665","vendor":"INW","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Cactus","flavor_id":"647","vendor":"INW","millipercent":350}],"reviews":[{"user":"xoxmx","text":"Thank you for this recipe, it is in my daily rotation.
