Maybe but, heres my version.  I have spent a very long time messing with strawberrys and creams trying to find the perfect mix without success.  Until now!\r\n\r\nI already new the strawberries to use together to get the job done.  FA Red Touch/JF Sweet Strawberry/INW Shisha Strawberry.  There isnt a better combo out there for the best strawberry flavor.\r\n\r\nThe problem I had was with the creams.  I already new that LB Vienna cream was going to be the main cream, I could tell just by the smell of it.  Being mainly a fruity flavor ejuice lover I was at a loss as to what would work well together with it.  I ended up with the choices I made based on a cooking show I was watching.  It was a baking show and these kids were baking cakes and one was using fresh cream and buttercream frosting and I thought, bingo!!  I added Sweet Cream to lighten it up with some sweetness and the Buttercream Frosting to add some smoothness to the mix.\r\n\r\nAt this point I liked the mix but, felt it was missing some texture and body.  I wanted a slightly thick bodied cheesecake flavor to it so, in went the Yes, We Cheescake and bang!!  Creme De Strawberry was born.\r\n\r\nHope you enjoy.  Please leave a review if you decide to mix this up.","steep_days":"0 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-06T20:52:30.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"529","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Vienna Cream","flavor_id":"1474","vendor":"LB","millipercent":5000},{"name":"Sweet Cream","flavor_id":"183","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Buttercream Frosting SC","flavor_id":"8361","vendor":"WF","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Yes, We Cheesecake","flavor_id":"9272","vendor":"INW","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Strawberry Sweet","flavor_id":"4745","vendor":"JF","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Red Touch (strawberry)","flavor_id":"421","vendor":"FA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Shisha Strawberry","flavor_id":"1711","vendor":"INW","millipercent":500},{"name":"Super Sweet","flavor_id":"2384","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1000}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"189794","name":"Creme de Strawberry"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
