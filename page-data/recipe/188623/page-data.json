I love sour gummy candy and after being inspired by Noted's \"Gummy Candy\" and \"2019 Flavors of the Year\" episodes I decided I wanted to mix up some thing that was fruity, sour and sweet.\r\n\r\nI used the MB Big Watermelon to back up the WF Sour Watermelon Candy.  I didn't want it over powered by the FLV Peach Gummy.  Adding the candylike WF Strawberry(Juicy) gave me the mixed fruit combination.  It's a relatively simple recipe, but I enjoy it.","steep_days":"0 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"total_reviews":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T19:16:26.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"766","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Strawberry (Juicy) SC","vendor":"WF","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Sour Gummy Candy SC","vendor":"WF","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Big Watermelon","vendor":"MB","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Peach Gummy","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Sour Wizard","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Super Sweet","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":200}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"188623","name":"Candy Sh!t"}}}
