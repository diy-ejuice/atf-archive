Wattage, airflow, and hardware will dictate the specific nuances of this recipe that will be apparent.\r\n\r\nFW BEETLE JUICE / VT FIZZY SHERBET - Holy shit, what a combination. If you want something strange, balanced, and indescribable, this mix of flavors creates something beautiful. The Beetle Juice at 2% is giving just the right amount of \"fuck everything, throw all the fruits in the bottle\" base. There's enough body for this to work on it's own. Adding Fizzy Sherbet at 3% gives us added candy, added brightness, and the right amount of fizzy suggestion to make something awesome. Removing TPA Dragonfruit helps let these two flavors shine, without muting any of those \"tip of the tongue\" flavors that you know exist, but can't quite define.\r\n\r\nTPA GRAPE JUICE / CAP HIBISCUS - I knew I still wanted that back end exhale of grape candy, and letting these two flavors play together gives us just that. The hibiscus is working nicely to add a blend of red sweetness to the mix overall, while preventing the grape from overpowering that exhale. Here, we get the suggestion of a grape exhale, but the candies from the body and inhale still dance on the tongue, only giving the grape enough spotlight for you to know it's there. TPA Grape Juice is a great flavor, but it's finicky. Be careful, high percentages are great to create a strong grape profile from the jump, but when you go low with it, you can truly force it into the background. 0.75% is perfect in this application, but I'd suggest going to 0.5% or lower if you are playing with some more subtle flavors.\r\n\r\nFA OBA OBA - While removing all dragonfruits from the mix, we now allow Oba Oba to truly do it's thing. The citrus notes from this flavor play nicely with the tropical parts of Fizzy Sherbet, while adding some brightness and punch to the Beetle Juice. Also, that suggestion of chewy candy that Oba Oba has really helps prevent this mix from being a beverage, but doesn't stand out enough to TRULY be a chewy candy profile. More ambiguity, more success.\r\n\r\nFA LIME TAHITY COLD PRESS / FLV PINK GUAVA - If you haven't tried pushing FA LTCP to higher percentages, please give it a try sometime. You get some nice lime flavor, but it doesn't assault your tastebuds like using a few drops of INW Lime. There is some great suggestions of bitter lime zest, but overall, you're getting a sweet lime candy. Finally, I thought that adding a small amount of FLV Pink Guava would just really awaken this mix, and it does. I've had trouble using this flavor in the past, it tends to just make everything muted and you only get this smack to the face of guava. But here, in low percentages, you know it's there without only tasting it. I've noted it's more potent in the beginning of the experience, but steps down as soon as you get a full inhale. So it's brightening up all those ambiguous fruit notes quite nicely, while also creating a subtle bitterness on the exhale to reset your palate on long sessions with this recipe.\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\n\r\nVaping this mix at lower wattage gives the Beetle Juice a lot more room to shine, where the overall profile feels more like a rainbow sherbet mix, sans the true ice cream mouthfeel. It's fruity and sweet, with just the right amount of brightness. Vaping it higher accentuates the Pink Guava, bringing out more tropical notes from the Fizzy Sherbet and LTCP. When you close off the airflow a bit, you pick up more of the berry nuances, pink guava on the back of the tongue, and grape exhale. Wide open airflow is like a tropical fruit juice with pop rocks hidden in the mix.\r\n\r\nI think this was a success. Now, I'm very fucking tired. But here we are. Hopefully, my insanity will bring you some benefit. I hope you enjoy this mix, but if you don't that's cool too. This is Amorphous, an attempt at my more recent \"white whale\" of creating a strange mix that changes as you vape, and never truly gives up it's identity. For me, it feels like a 90% success. If I go back to this, I will try to add a bit more potency to the flavor, as a whole. But for now, it's quite strong, changes like I want based on vaping specifications, and is one of my favorite mixes of 2019.","steep_days":"1 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:50:57.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"4924","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Oba Oba","vendor":"FA","millipercent":2250},{"name":"Fizzy Sherbet","vendor":"VT","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Lime Tahity Cold Pressed","vendor":"FA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Hibiscus","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1750},{"name":"Beetle Juice","vendor":"FW","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Grape Juice","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":750},{"name":"Pink Guava","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":500},{"name":"Super Sweet","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":500}],"reviews":[{"user":"Sartzy","text":"This is amazing, an ADV for me.&#xD;\nIf youâ€™re a fruit lover who is looking for something complex but simply delicious you have to try this."},{"user":"NickG","text":"As I go to make this for my third time I feel it's only fair to leave a review. It's an interesting recipe and changes quite a bit as it steeps. There's an inherent berriness to it, taste like a mixture of delicious dark berries and while it's sweet, I wouldn't quite call it candy sweet, just delicious fruit sweet. The oba oba does interesting things to it as well, imparts some fizziness without it being much like a soda. pop rocks really is an apt description. I do prefer this after a solid three day steep, but it's delicious day one. Thanks for all your efforts in making it, was fun to read through your process. &#xD;\n&#xD;\nEdit - Just made it and it's even better than I remember. The lime seems to really be coming through this go around and that fizziness I noted last time is all but gone. It's almost more tangy this go around and I think that might be because I'm using a different set-up, which is what I think this amorphous business is all about. Well done !"},{"user":"winder73","text":"Shit, guess I'm picking up some hibiscus....this looks delicious"}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"152612","name":"AMORPHOUS"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
