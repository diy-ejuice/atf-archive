Butter! To me it has a strong golden butter taste that is absolutely delicious. I then thought of the funny meme of people putting butter in their coffee.\r\n\r\nFA Dark Bean (Coffee Espresso): Extremely strong and a solid coffee flavor. I find it off-putting in this mix until it settles down and the Gold Ducat starts to really pop. The AP in Dark Bean adds deliciousness and may accentuate nuttiness in the tobacco depending on your taste buds.\r\n\r\nFA Vanilla Bourbon: A luxurious, mature vanilla that lingers in the background and gives a comfortable mouthfeel to the recipe.","steep_days":"10","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:49:33.000-05:00","best_vg":"50%","views":"4446","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Gold Ducat","flavor_id":"783","vendor":"INW","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Dark Bean (coffee Espresso)","flavor_id":"504","vendor":"FA","millipercent":200},{"name":"Bourbon (vanilla Bourbon)","flavor_id":"420","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1500}],"reviews":[{"user":"ChemicalBurnVictim","text":"I’ve only ever tried a couple coffee flavors, and I’ve only bought one coffee juice. Maybe it’s my limited experience in the coffee vape world, but to me this tasted a whole lot like the one coffee juice I bought (Indigo Five Bucks, if anyone is curious.) I can’t say that I get the Butter in Gold Ducat, but I really like what it’s doing with the Dark Bean here. It’s like a strong coffee with a sweet honey tobacco sweetness under it. Good way to start the morning. Also, I’ve done the Butter and coconut oil in coffee before. Ruined my day. Much better to vape it.
