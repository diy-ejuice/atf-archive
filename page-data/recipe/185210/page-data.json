The ice cream man @eyemakepizza is about to be a father. To toast this, I've mixed a green \"milk\".\r\n\r\nIt's a monster alright? Neither a blue or a pink recipe. The pun wrote itself (okay, that's a lie. @nowar wrote it), and the cream base is ripped right out of DAAPled pears.\r\n\r\nTFA honeydew is delightful if a bit pervasive, it's almost hard to keep this fruit down to a manageable level to let anything else shine through.\r\n\r\nTFA key lime is basically candy lime, green jello type flavor. Distinctly green but different enough that it sweetens the mix and stands outside of the shadow of the honeydew.\r\n\r\nFA Aurora is sharp, like lime zest sharp. In this instance something that can really make itself known and fight that bully honeydew to a stalemate was necessary. It was important for the sake of contrast to find something that would stand side by side with the honeydew without clashing.\r\n\r\nSpecial shout out to @rainbowdragon for helping with the art(okay, that's selling her efforts short, she did all the work) in this month's series of MC recipes","steep_days":"0 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":4,"updated_at":"2020-12-12T08:14:43.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"1206","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Custard","flavor_id":"4210","vendor":"INW","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Bavarian Cream","flavor_id":"145","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Vanilla Ice Cream","flavor_id":"1511","vendor":"LB","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Honeydew","flavor_id":"238","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Aurora","flavor_id":"399","vendor":"FA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Shisha Vanilla","flavor_id":"841","vendor":"INW","millipercent":500},{"name":"Key Lime","flavor_id":"241","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2000}],"reviews":[{"user":"SeLeV","text":"Wouldn't go for it again.

Just based off smell, I can’t quite figure out what was thrown at the cream base this time. It smells fruity and maybe like kiwi?&#xD;\n&#xD;\nWell, kiwi is definitely not in this mix. I’m almost positive it is honeydew, but I am not sure what else is in it. It is bright, full of flavor, and absolutely delicious. I really hope I have all the flavors to mix more of this, because I am already about half way through the bottle and I really don’t want it to be gone.&#xD;\n&#xD;\nThis is probably the hardest review I’ve had to write for MC just because it is so good. I don’t really have anything to complain about. Looking at the recipe, I’m surprised I couldn’t pick up on the lime. It does a brilliant job, paired with FA Aurora, of really boosting the flavor of the honeydew. Sorry this review is so short Fo, brilliant job.&#xD;\n","score":5},{"user":"nowar","text":"I liken this to one of my first real juice loves, The Milkman Delights: Melon Milk. Except this one maybe even does a better job of separating the HD flavor from the cream, yet somehow making it come across as damn close to a honeydew bubble tea (sans bubbles) that I've ever had. While the existing recipe is pretty delicate as is, I can even see building off this to add a variety of accents to play off that bubble tea vibe: a little black tea, a little green tea, a little spice? For anyone who loves honey dew and cream, you'll like this. If you like honey dew but it's a little too 'in your face' you may like this even more since the creams spedanked the HD into settling down and behaving like a real fruit should.","score":5}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"185210","name":"DAAPy's little monster"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
