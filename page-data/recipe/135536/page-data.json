But I tried using Sour Blue Razz(which also helped in making the Sour Watermelon seem \"fuller\" in flavor), Pink Lemonade and Fuji Apple(which also adds juiciness) in combination.\r\n\r\nWell? It's a little bit sour \"ish\". But still not where I would like it. I tried using CAP's new Powerful Sour. but found it pretty useless. That said, I enjoy the HELL out of this recipe.\r\n\r\nRecommended VG 65%.\r\nRecommended steep: 6 days.\r\n\r\n**E-Juice Makers Oneshots**\r\n  \r\nPlease dont use this recipe for commercial gain...","steep_days":"6","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-06T12:55:57.000-05:00","best_vg":"65%","views":"1534","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Sour Watermelon Candy","flavor_id":"6062","vendor":"WF","millipercent":8000},{"name":"Apple Fuji","flavor_id":"4886","vendor":"FA","millipercent":750},{"name":"Sour Blue Raspberry Candy","flavor_id":"6061","vendor":"WF","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Pink Lemonade","flavor_id":"3535","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Super Sweet","flavor_id":"2384","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":500},{"name":"Vanilla Swirl","flavor_id":"189","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":500}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"135536","name":"Power Snatch "}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
