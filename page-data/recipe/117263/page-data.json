That when I had a peanutiphany. We have a chocolate Cardinal thanks to ID10-T. There needed to be a PB Cardinal.\r\n\r\nThe obvious choice is TFA DX Peanut Butter, but I give it a helping hand (to not fade so much) with a touch of FLV Peanut Butter. The FW Hazelnut adds a little creaminess and complexity to the PB part.\r\n\r\nI vape Cardinal right away even through the fade and reappear dance of the FLV tobaccos. I enjoy that red burley so much fresh. Then after a week I'll let it sit for a week until they get over their shyness.

But I reordered dx pb to not only mix this but also because dx works significantly better in many situation imo especially tobacco. So I mixed this as posted and yes, this is exactly what I’ve been looking for in a pb tobacco. The balance is perfect between the pb and tobaccos, and I LOVE the way dx pb tastes with hhgry4. Thanks for this!"},{"user":"cultureviolet","text":"I love this recipe. The FLV tobaccos do their delightful dance of the undead, reanimating throughout with such incredible nuance and style. Here they bring their PB dancin shoes and it's time to rock baby! I always love an opportunity to work with peanut butter and you nailed a great one here, DX PB/FLV pb/FW Hazelnut is a worthy combo. I enjoy this at multiple intervals throughout the steep,. I honestly just pick it up whenever and it almost always delivers. Inspiring stuff here."}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"117263","name":"PB Cardinal"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
