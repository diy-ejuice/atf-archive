Definitely for banana - this is top of the line. First it has none of that under-ripe banana runts flavor that normally comes with a banana vape. This is my first time using Banana Custard (won't be the last). Next was the best surprise, the bakery. This bakery note is spot on fried banana bread - super clean and very prominent in the flavor. The maple syrup finish with a touch of cinnamon is divine. Seriously one of the best Developed recipes to date. Mix this - you will not regret it.","score":5},{"user":"lionhrt9","text":"Finally got all the flavors (see how I did that?) for this mix!  Watched it come together on the show and couldn't wait to try it as it's right in my wheel house.  This is 5 star for what it is, well balanced and great separation.  Each component builds this fantastic juice.  We've been vaping it after a 10 day steep, its awesome in the morning with our coffee.  Great Job Guys!!!!

Good off the shake but after an overnight steep all the notes come out. Well balanced and just good!
