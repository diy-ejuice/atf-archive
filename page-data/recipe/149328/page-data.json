Definitely for banana - this is top of the line. First it has none of that under-ripe banana runts flavor that normally comes with a banana vape. This is my first time using Banana Custard (won't be the last). Next was the best surprise, the bakery. This bakery note is spot on fried banana bread - super clean and very prominent in the flavor. The maple syrup finish with a touch of cinnamon is divine. Seriously one of the best Developed recipes to date. Mix this - you will not regret it."},{"user":"lionhrt9","text":"Finally got all the flavors (see how I did that?) for this mix!  Watched it come together on the show and couldn't wait to try it as it's right in my wheel house.  This is 5 star for what it is, well balanced and great separation.  Each component builds this fantastic juice.  We've been vaping it after a 10 day steep, its awesome in the morning with our coffee.  Great Job Guys!!!! "},{"user":"Deftohms","text":"Yeah I REALLY donâ€™t regret purchasing all the missing flavors to make every one of the Developed recipes. Always authentic and extremely satisfying. "},{"user":"Collectron","text":"Really love this one, great job you guys nailed it!"},{"user":"Daytimefrank1","text":"You guys nailed this one! Good off the shake but after an overnight steep all the notes come out. Well balanced and just good!
