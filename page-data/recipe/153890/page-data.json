I gave it a bit of a punch, so it is not overly sweet. \r\nINW Am4a - the base of the sweet tobacco for the recipe, wich calls for apples naturally\r\nFA Apple Fuji - a great apple, but can be too noticeable or evident\r\nFLV Sour Apple - another good apple, drier and green\r\nFA Pear - gives the apples some juice\r\nINW Absolute Virginia - Was afraid it might be really strong, but as it is an extract I find it really subtle (needs steeping!)\r\nFA Black Fire - gives the spice, some great smoke (non ashy) without dominating all\r\nNeeds to steep 4 days (a week better) so it all comes together!\r\n","steep_days":"7","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:50:59.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"1397","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Am4a By Inwera","vendor":"INW","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Apple Fuji","vendor":"FA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Pear","vendor":"FA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Sour Apple","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1700},{"name":"Tobacco Absolute Virginia","vendor":"INW","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Black Fire","vendor":"FA","millipercent":500}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"153890","name":" Driven By Fear (Sweet Apple Tobacco)"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
