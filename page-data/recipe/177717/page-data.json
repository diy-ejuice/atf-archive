Personally, I would like the banana flavour a tad stronger, and I hope to learn how to get an ice cold milk feel to a cream. Great use of LB VIC. You really can S+V this, but it really starts to shine at 4-5 days. Spot on @mightyshill! I may play with this in the future! It's very close to Banana Ice Cream by Sticky Fingers (AU) which I want to clone ðŸ¤“","score":5},{"user":"Brewdog_Kilo","text":"Great recipe after a few days steep.
