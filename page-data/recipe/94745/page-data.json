Tastes like black licorice to me. When i first got this flavor from BCF a week or so ago. I looked up Vape Trains recommended percentages. They suggested 2-5% in a mix and 5-9% solo. So I tried using it with burley and cured with FIG at 2%, and the licorice was all I got. So the challenge to myself was to keep it at 2% and push the licorice out of the mix & to get it to compliment the other ingredients. I believe I accomplished that.\r\nThe Conn Shade was used for a smokey ashy note. The burley & virginia are the main tobacco notes. With the Cured being in here to add to the tobacco notes and to help the other tobaccos survive a steep. The Milk & Honey adds some honey like sweetness which really helped with my Fig problem, also adds a little creaminess ","steep_days":"3 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":3,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T20:32:30.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"1560","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Connecticut Shade","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":250},{"name":"Cured Tobacco","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1200},{"name":"Fig","vendor":"VT","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Milk & Honey","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":750},{"name":"Red Burley","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Virginia Tobacco","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1500}],"reviews":[{"user":"ID10-T","text":"I was excited about this one because Honey + Fig + Bacco sounds terrific to me. I tried it without looking at the recipe first and thought, well, would be great, if it weren't for that hint of licorice. Someone who likes that black licorice flavor might be a fan, as I can't find any other reason not to like it, but that licorice is not for me. When I went back to look at the recipe, I expected to find some INW tobacco that I've never tried before, because that seems like a likely source of a licorice off note to me. Nope, VT Fig. It does taste like fig, not just black licorice, but enough black licorice for me to nope out. The licorice wasn't pushed far enough out of the mix, for me. I don't think I'll be using VT Fig anytime soon. I don't really get real honey but it does have a honey-like sweetness. It looks like a lot of different FLV tobaccos, which can result in a muddled and kind of soapy taste, but they work here. The addition of Shade here really seems to be working especially well. More tobacco recipes should make use of that, I think. Overall I think this has the makings of a great recipe, if only VT Fig didn't taste like licorice. I think this would be perfect for me with the VT Fig replaced with CAP Fig. As best I can tell from only trying VT Fig in this mix, CAP's version is the most comparable. FLV would be too dark and musty for this and FA too bright and juicy."}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"94745","name":"Honey, I Figged Up the Bacco"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
