I would go as far to say that itâ€™s my ALL TIME favourite and every time I have a bowl it just takes me back to being a youngster and spooning out a huge hole into the centre of the tub where all that ripple goodness just sat waiting for my fat young ass to scoff it all up! ðŸ¤¤ðŸ¤¤ðŸ¤¤ so when I saw what @eyemakepizza had magically created for his vanilla trinity,I new exactly what I was going to do with it. Make no mistake about it,this trinity is no fucking joke and so god dam good even on its own however, throw in their my personal raspberry trinity and what you have is a raspberry ripple ice cream so real to life youâ€™ll piss your pants with excitement!! This can also be a S&V if your impatient like me,I would suggest mixing up a 120 (Atleast) and just see how it materialises over the next few days. From start to finish itâ€™s just delicious. Happy mixing fuckerz ðŸ’™","steep_days":"2 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"updated_at":"2020-12-12T14:07:13.000-05:00","best_vg":"80%","views":"2551","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Raspberry","flavor_id":"606","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Raspberry (sweet)","flavor_id":"267","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1250},{"name":"Shisha Raspberry","flavor_id":"836","vendor":"INW","millipercent":800},{"name":"French Vanilla Icecream","flavor_id":"2129","vendor":"HS","millipercent":750},{"name":"Vanilla Swirl","flavor_id":"189","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Vanilla Ice Cream","flavor_id":"1511","vendor":"LB","millipercent":5000},{"name":"Sweetener","flavor_id":"1432","vendor":"FW","millipercent":1000}],"reviews":[{"user":"JustMixIt","text":"Really loving this mix!
