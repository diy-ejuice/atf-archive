I am not a tropical fruit vape fan, but throw some peach in it for this GA Peach, and I might just like it.  So this did just hit my fancy.  \r\n##3%  \r\n**VT Peach Yogurt**  This is a yummy fresh peach followed by a creamy yogurt.  The peach blends in to give a nice accent and the yogurt helps to create the frozen cocktail feel.\r\n\r\n##2%\r\n**VT Island Dream**  This is a island inspired cocktail, with hints of tropical fruits, cream, rum & coconut.  \r\n\r\n##1%\r\n**VT Light Rum**  This helps to add an authentic boozy taste to the vape.  \r\n\r\nI like it as is; however, if you have a sweet tooth, feel free to sweeten to your palate.  Also, to create a more authentic Frozen Daiquiri, add some WS-23 at the desired percentage you like.  \r\nI myself don't add it to recipes, because I only use about .10% if I use it.  This needs to steep for 24 to 48 hours, so the Rum isn't too strong.  \r\nAt the moment, if you are in the states, the VT Peach Yogurt and VT Island Dream are only available at Chefs or from Vape Train directly.  \r\n**Island Dream**  \r\nhttps://www.chefsflavours.co.uk/vape-train-australia/6607-island-dream.html?search_query=island+dream&results=1\r\n\r\n**Peach Yogurt**\r\nhttps://www.chefsflavours.co.uk/vape-train-australia/6596-peach-yoghurt.html?search_query=peach+yogurt&results=2\r\n\r\n","steep_days":"2","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T02:16:40.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"1313","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Island Dream","flavor_id":"9370","vendor":"VT","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Light Rum","flavor_id":"8918","vendor":"VT","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Peach Yogurt","flavor_id":"8937","vendor":"VT","millipercent":3000}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"126707","name":"1 2 3 Island Peach Daiquiri"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
