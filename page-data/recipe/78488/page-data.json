Made this and subbed the key lime with FW key lime. Made some adjustments and now I have a pretty decent mix with a good refreshing lemon lime mix that is in my rotation. Yes, I made some changes, so its not the same, i guess, but this still gave me the base and inspiration","score":4},{"user":"Opdee","text":"the One is my all day vape, this is no where near what I get from the juice. There is no lemon taste, apart from the lemon meringue slight hint, more of lime... no punch, not enough lemon and missing the main elements in my opinion..","score":1},{"user":"gravi-tea","text":"I can't call this a 1:1 but it was decent. lacking on the crumble note. the sweetness is certainly there but I feel the lime note is also different.","score":3},{"user":"letitsteep","text":"Never had the original, I used LMP v1 as well. 1 day steep, is very good, probably the best lemon type vape I've had, will be mixing more for sure. ","score":4},{"user":"Mr-G","text":"i never had the original either but will deff.make another batch","score":5},{"user":"chief63","text":"Never had the original, but this is a nice &amp; easy lemon recipe.  I used LMP V1 of course and tried it with TPA Key Lime, FA Florida Key Lime and CAP Lemon LIme.  Lime is a tough one for me and I think I like it best with just a touch of the FA Florida Key Lime.
