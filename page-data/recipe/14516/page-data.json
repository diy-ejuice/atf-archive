And another use for that FW Hard Candy! Credit goes to SadPandaVapes for posting the recipe that gave me the base profile here: https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/547quj/weekly_recipe_pomcitrus_lolipop/  \r\n\r\nI tweaked this based on my stash and the idea to come up with an apricot one. The result is akin to what an apricot creamsaver could taste like. Delicious right away. The Hard Candy should settle down a bit and the custard should thicken some more after a steep. The apricot should become more assertive as well. The 'cream' element is mainly incorporated for mouth feel. Feel free to play with it if you would like it to actually be creamy. \r\n","steep_days":"4","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:48:48.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"2243","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Custard","flavor_id":"484","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Toasted Marshmallow","flavor_id":"340","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Hard Candy","flavor_id":"1308","vendor":"FW","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Apricot","flavor_id":"209","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1750},{"name":"Orange Cream","flavor_id":"250","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":750},{"name":"Aurora","flavor_id":"399","vendor":"FA","millipercent":200}],"reviews":[{"user":"ID10-T","text":"This is alchemy. Not the fact that nails what I imagine an apricot version of one of those creamy-ish hard candy dollar apiece gourmet suckers, which doesn’t seem like an impossible feat, but the way it uses such an assortment of difficult flavors to do it. I was scared the result would be a disaster when I was mixing 3% FW Hard Candy, which should give off some gnarly hairspray-like off notes, with Toasted Marshmallow, as it seems the part of that that makes it “toasty” would be weird and probably kind of gross here. But my fear was unfounded. I can’t figure out how this works, but it does, beautifully. Sweet and mouthwatering, with a thicker creamier mouthfeel than a typical hard candy, contrasted with a more tart and citric candy-type apricot that still tastes definitively apricotty. Freakin alchemy.  "}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"14516","name":"Apri-Props"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
