Same great flavors, I just tweaked the %'s a bit.  \r\nThis is a delicious**Eggnog Cranberry Cheesecake**. Perfect for the holidays.\r\nCheesecake is created using**INW Yes We Cheesecake & WF SC Mascarpone Cheese** to create that authentic cheesecake base.** FLV Eggnog** is used to give that holiday spice to it.\r\nThe Cheesecake is sitting on a Graham crust, using **FA Graham Crust** and **CAP Cereal 27**. The Cap 27 darkens the graham crust for more authenticity.\r\nTopping the cheesecake is Cranberries. I am using**FLV Cranberry** and accenting this flavor with **FA Pomegranate** to help with fading.\r\nGive at least 7 to 14 days for steep.  I am finding this quite tasty prior to steep, but for best results with the mascarpone and cheesecake 7 days at least.  \r\nEnjoy.","steep_days":"7","temperature":"0","recipe_score":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-10T19:01:25.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"2158","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Cereal 27","flavor_id":"4163","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":750},{"name":"Cranberry","flavor_id":"2493","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1250},{"name":"Eggnog","flavor_id":"4396","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":750},{"name":"Graham Crust","flavor_id":"9950","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Mascarpone Cream Cheese","flavor_id":"10055","vendor":"WF","millipercent":250},{"name":"Pomegranate","flavor_id":"418","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1250},{"name":"Yes, We Cheesecake","flavor_id":"9272","vendor":"INW","millipercent":2000}],"reviews":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"170794","name":"Holiday Cheesecake"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
