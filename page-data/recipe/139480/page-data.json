I start with a 500 ML batch of 12.5 ML Nic, 467.5 ML VG and 20 ML distilled water.  I love sour apple belts so this is my attempt at a similar flavor and I've found it very enjoyable.  Its a sweet fruity flavor.  Note the Apple(tart Granny Smith) by TFA is actually Apple(Tart Green Apple) by TFA.","steep_days":"1 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"total_reviews":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-06T23:08:11.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"2081","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Fuji Apple","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Double Apple","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Apple (tart Granny Smith)","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Apple Candy","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Juicy Lemon","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Sour Wizard","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Dragon Fruit","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":250},{"name":"Sour Blue Raspberry Candy","vendor":"WF","millipercent":250}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"139480","name":"Sour Apple Belts"}}}
