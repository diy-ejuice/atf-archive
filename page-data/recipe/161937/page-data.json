From the minute I tried his mix,  I wanted to try and make a Dr Pepper styled mix -   \r\nwhile Dr Pepper  may have 23 flavors  there are several flavors that I think make it signature :  birch/ sarsaparilla,  almond/ amaretto/Cherry, cardamon and molasses   are the key flavors I wanted to try and pull out \r\n\r\nFLv root beer   to me is one of the best  root beers around and will provide that birch note  I am after \r\nFA almond  provides that sweet almond extract  / amaretto   sweetness  \r\nWF molasiess is a dark syrup sweetness  that works really well with the WF blackcherry jelly bean   together I get  almost a licorice type cherry note \r\nFA cardamon is  not something that you can  notice unless you are really looking for it  but I do find it adds \"something\"   and you notice it when is it not there  on the finish  for sure  \r\nWhile this may not be spot on Dr peper   for some - I think   it is close  and am really enjoying it  \r\n\r\n\r\n","steep_days":"3 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-11T06:44:53.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"2074","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Rich Cinnamon","flavor_id":"638","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":70},{"name":"Fizzy Sherbet","flavor_id":"8878","vendor":"VT","millipercent":3500},{"name":"Bourbon (vanilla Bourbon)","flavor_id":"420","vendor":"FA","millipercent":400},{"name":"Blood Orange","flavor_id":"1197","vendor":"FW","millipercent":400},{"name":"Super Sweet","flavor_id":"2384","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":300},{"name":"WS-23","flavor_id":"8085","vendor":"OTHR","millipercent":500},{"name":"Root Beer","flavor_id":"8567","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":400},{"name":"Blackcherry Jelly Bean SC","flavor_id":"8359","vendor":"WF","millipercent":500},{"name":"Almond","flavor_id":"528","vendor":"FA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Cardamom","flavor_id":"498","vendor":"FA","millipercent":300},{"name":"Molasses SC","flavor_id":"8374","vendor":"WF","millipercent":500}],"reviews":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"161937","name":"If .007 was a Pepper  (Dr. Pepper styled soda) "}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
