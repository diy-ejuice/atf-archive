Nope. I get some plastic off-note and it’s very, very licorice-y, to the point that licorice overwhelms the vanilla swirl and ice cream and even, to an extent, the super sweet, so I’m left with this fairly intense sugar-free black jelly bean lingering finish. Sugar-free black jelly bean sugar lips. Ugh. The rest of this looks great for a simple root beer float, but it just really needs a different Root Beer flavor - FLV, FW, LB - all great options for root beer.
