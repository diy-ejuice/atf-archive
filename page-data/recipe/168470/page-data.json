The milkshake base worked perfectly.\r\n\r\nFor the peanut butter part i used TPA Peanut Butter Dx, and FlV peanut butter at just 0.25% as everything higher added too much dry peanut top notes.\r\n\r\nFA Cookie gives the crunchy notes and adds to the milkshake base.\r\n\r\nObviously JF Milk Chocolate as the chocolate syrupy flvour that blends with the milk.\r\n\r\nAt least a week of steep for everything to blend together and from 2-4 weeks and on it only gets better.\r\n","steep_days":"7","temperature":"0","recipe_score":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-12T00:42:16.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"1333","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Dx Peanut Butter","flavor_id":"288","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":6500},{"name":"Milk Chocolate","flavor_id":"7685","vendor":"JF","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Cookie","flavor_id":"490","vendor":"FA","millipercent":750},{"name":"Super Sweet","flavor_id":"2384","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":500},{"name":"Bavarian Cream","flavor_id":"145","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Vanilla Swirl","flavor_id":"189","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Peanut Butter","flavor_id":"607","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":250},{"name":"Vanilla Custard","flavor_id":"131","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Cream Fresh","flavor_id":"540","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000}],"reviews":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"168470","name":"Chocolate Peanut Butter Swirl Milkshake"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
