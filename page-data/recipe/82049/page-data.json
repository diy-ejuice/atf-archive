The recipe is based on a classic French apricot tart, Tarte Aux Abricots, but without the pastry base.\r\n\r\nI have stuck to my tried and trusted brulee combo of Inw Creme Brulee and Inw Custard. At these %'s,  this just works beautifully to create a stunning thick and luscious custard base.\r\n\r\nFA Armenia Apricot  and INW Apricots does a fantastic job in creating a full, ripe apricot with a perfect balance of tart and sweet. FA Apricot at 1% is more than enough to bring this alive with the INW boosting it just so. I find that INW Apricots gets a little floral over 1%, so I kept it quite low and just enough to linger in the background.\r\n\r\nFA Tanger adds that little tartness and intrigue to break the monotony of the Apricot. \r\n\r\nCap Toasted Almond and TPA Brown Sugar was the obvious choice to top off this brulee and marries perfectly with the apricot to create a sophisticated, yet familiar taste sensation.\r\n\r\nLet this sit for at least a week for the strong Apricot flavours to meld with the custard. Do not rush this baby...\r\n","steep_days":"7","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-06T08:37:04.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"1720","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Creme Brulee (yc)","flavor_id":"894","vendor":"INW","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Custard","flavor_id":"4210","vendor":"INW","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Armenia (apricot)","flavor_id":"507","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Tanger (mandarin)","flavor_id":"547","vendor":"FA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Apricots","flavor_id":"751","vendor":"INW","millipercent":500},{"name":"Brown Sugar","flavor_id":"313","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Toasted Almond","flavor_id":"128","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":2000}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"82049","name":"Apricot Creme"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
