Sweet, citrusy and well balanced, the grapefruit notes are excellent and work well with the candy/gummy vibe. It has a nice texture to it, almost chalky, but in a super delicious and enjoyable way. Thank you for sharing !"},{"user":"DumHed","score":"5","text":"Brilliant. WF sour gummy candy is amazing, there is so much you can do with it and it needs to be used much more."},{"user":"groceryboy_jr","score":"5","text":"The flavor I get off this recipe is bright and vibrant.
