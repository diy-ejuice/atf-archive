What a wonderful tart that was. So good, that I had to go home and see if I could make something like it.\r\nThis is it.\r\n\r\nVT Lemon Meringue Tart does most of the work here, but it is helped along with FA Meringue, to make the meringue in it a tad stronger.\r\nTFA Cheesecake (graham crust) is to help the cake filling it self and add a little to the crust, along with CAP Graham Cracker.\r\nFE Lemon at 1.75% helps with the lemony filling boosting the VT Lemon Meringue Tart in flavor adding in both a little sweet and a little zest.\r\nSweet cream for a slight bit of body.\r\n\r\nI was planning on letting it steep for 7 days, but when I tried it on day 4 it was explosively good, so I suggest 4-5 day steep.\r\n\r\nEnjoy!
