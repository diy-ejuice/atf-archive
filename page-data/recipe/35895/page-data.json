The FLV Poundcake and FW Yellow Cake combine to bring that dense cake note and the FA Lemon Sicily pops out and lays right on top. I know you will enjoy this simple and delicious vape.","steep_days":"10","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:49:11.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"4672","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Cake (yellow)","vendor":"FW","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Pound Cake","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":9000},{"name":"Lemon Sicily","vendor":"FA","millipercent":2000}],"reviews":[{"user":"Gordo","text":"Nailed it !!  Tastes awesome right off the shake. "},{"user":"tw2k","text":"Lemon Sicily is a delectable flavor. I made several recipe attempts to keep it on top, sometimes with over a dozen flavors. This recipe achieves it with only 3, and it's still a full lemon pound cake. The cake notes are just right, and don't mute the glorious lemon. Great recipe, thanks."},{"user":"KRUCIAL","text":"This recipe is a profile nailer. Needs a solid week steep after that it is delicious. The FLV Poundcake percentage seems a little high but totally works here. If your just starting diy this would be a great recipe to get you in the groove. So yummy great job.
