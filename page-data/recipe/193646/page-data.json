DEF a key lime pie but made with a fruit loop crust!!! Def needs a chill down on the harsh citrus tones....will reevaluate tomorrow and the next day but my only current thought on any adjustments is mayyybe upping key lime to 3.5% just a smidgent more. But i wanna see how the creams come out first and how the harshness tones down.\r\n\r\nThis is a good start!!\r\n\r\n**V2 i bumped key lime to 3.5 and dropped fruit circles to 3.5 for more balance.
