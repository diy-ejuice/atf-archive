It's pretty amazing how much the Salted Caramel stands out against the rest of the flavors.\r\n\r\nVT Pudding Base brings more of a spongey cake type of pudding note (typical of what the Brits refer to as a pudding).  This is made more creamy and luscious by the pairing with FLV Vanilla Pudding, which is what is more commonly considered pudding in the States.  The addition of DIYFS Holy Vanilla boosts the FLV Vanilla Pudding's smooth, creamy pudding.  \r\n\r\nI was not a fan of this as a SNV, but, after letting it sit for 5 days, I came back to it and found it to be quite tasty.  As per usual, mixed it 60vg/40pg.
