This is my second recipe ever, so it would be really cool if you guys could help me with some feedback. \r\n\r\nSo what I was intending on this recipe was to build something around the deliciousness that is Liquid Barn Belgian Waffle. So when I single flavor tested the Belgian Waffle, I found that it really wasn't lacking in anything. I think it's a pretty good all around flavor. It has the the butter, the syrup and the eggo waffle, but that kinda gets boring after a day or so. \r\n\r\nThe CAP Butter Cream was to add to the rich buttery notes that are already in the Belgian Waffle and make it more butter forward because I feel butter is a crucial ingredient to the perfect waffle. I feel like 2% when combined with the buttery notes of Belgian Waffle was the perfect amount to make this happen.\r\n\r\nNow the CAP Vanilla Custard came in because I really enjoy the richness and the vanilla notes that are in that flavor. I feel like it really plays well with other flavors especially the richer flavors like the ones in this recipe. I found at 2% it adds to the Belgian Waffle and kind of makes itself a part of the waffle rather than a separate flavor. I was kind of worried coming into it that it would make itself more a part of the strawberry topping, but luckily that didn't happen.\r\n\r\nThe CAP Sugar Cookie came in because I really wanted to give that super sweetness that you would think of when I describe the profile, but in a lighter way than Brown Sugar could. Like the juice that Ruthless manufactures called \"Hotcakes\". It's a really good budget juice, that pairs perfectly with the morning cup of coffee and in the end that's exactly what I was going for.\r\n\r\nTPA Strawbery (Ripe): I really needed this because without some type of topping the profile really just isn't complete. I have tinkered with tossing a little bit of CAP Sweet Strawberry because I usually throw 1:1 CAP and TPA strawberry into my custard mixes and they really play well together. When I did that in this mix however, I found that it took from the authentic taste that I was going for. It added a little bit of \"artificialness\" that I didn't think really went with it. I really wanted the only \"artificial\" taste in there to be that of the eggo waffle. So 3% Strawberry (Ripe) I found worked perfectly. \r\n\r\nThe TPA Brown Sugar is in there to make everything a little more sugary in a darker way, and although I really wanted to use some woodsy type of flavors to get that, I didn't have any so I used Brown Sugar. I know 2% is a lot but, in this profile, I find that it works pretty well. \r\n\r\nSo there you have it guys, this is only the second recipe that I feel is good enough to actually share on here and I would really like to know what everyone thinks. If there's anything you guys think would work better (or anything you think I should have added or left out) please let me know. I'm a beginner mixer and I really need some feedback positive or negative. If you don't want to say what you think via a comment, at least shoot me a message with some pointers. Hope y'all enjoy it as much as I have!\r\n\r\nP.S. to get the full effect of it make sure to try it first thing in the morning with a fresh cup of coffee!","steep_days":"5","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-04T21:23:58.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"1387","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Belgian Waffle","flavor_id":"1478","vendor":"LB","millipercent":5000},{"name":"Brown Sugar","flavor_id":"313","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Butter Cream","flavor_id":"3","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Strawberry (ripe)","flavor_id":"271","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Sugar Cookie","flavor_id":"115","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Vanilla Custard","flavor_id":"131","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":2000}],"reviews":[{"user":"Jerikorayne","text":"This recipe is good you have done a nice job &#xD;\nI would only say to bring down the tpa.
