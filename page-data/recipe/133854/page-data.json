A creamy desert. Lemon ice cream like but not custard. I invisioned milk and heavy whipping cream based home made lemon ice cream with a little blueberry drizzle. To me the blueberry would only be a slight taste because it’s only a slight drizzle and mostly a semi sweet heavy whipped lemon ice cream base. I used black currant to keep the blueberries bright and the combination of blueberry extra and blueberry wild is a light blueberry combination that isn’t too much on the candy side I added a LA Lemonade because it’s a candy lemon flavor. I used tfa custard because it isn’t as vanilla heavy or as eggy as the other options. I enhanced it with cheesecake graham crust for texture and FA Custard for the Creamy lemon zest notes I added Vanilla Gelato because it has a real good ice cream type cream notes. A touch of yogurt brings a thickness to the ice cream without adding egg notes that heavy custard would bring. I have no idea what brought a buttery note to the table but there is definitely a buttermilk flavor in this mix. \r\nSweeten to taste. I personally think it would be good anywhere between 0.50% to 1.0% depending on your sweet tooth. (I used 0.5% FW sweetener)\r\nEnjoy.","steep_days":"3","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-06T20:44:31.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"1806","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Blackcurrant","flavor_id":"545","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Blueberry (extra)","flavor_id":"218","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":750},{"name":"Blueberry (wild)","flavor_id":"215","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":3500},{"name":"Cheesecake (graham Crust)","flavor_id":"152","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Custard","flavor_id":"484","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Lemonade","flavor_id":"951","vendor":"LA","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Vanilla Custard","flavor_id":"188","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Vanilla Ice Cream","flavor_id":"9957","vendor":"FA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Yogurt","flavor_id":"1471","vendor":"FW","millipercent":100}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"133854","name":"Blueberry Lemon Creme "}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
