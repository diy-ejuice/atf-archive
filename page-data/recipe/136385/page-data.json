It was really a dark place to be because I spent so much time trying to clone a juice I didn’t even like. So to get me out of that insane hole, I decided to take that profile, and do it how I would do it. And, more importantly, make something that I would actually like. That’s what this is. \r\n\r\nIt’s a very middle of the road recipe. No real top notes to wear down your tongue. Not too sweet. Very full flavor. There’s a dessert/bakery aspect, obviously, but there’s also some decent smoky tobacco notes. It walks the line between several different things. It has been a bit of a challenge for me to let it steep long enough to see the places it goes. Right after mixing, the Gold Ducat was pretty apparent. It had a stronger smoky vibe. After about a week the graham cracker, Butter Pecan, and Red Dates started to take over a bit more. It’s been a while since I’ve been excited about a recipe, and this one has me pretty excited. \r\n\r\nI think these people will enjoy this recipe:\r\n\r\n* Those that like Boba’s Bounty\r\n* Those that don’t\r\n* Those that like RY4s\r\n* Those that don’t \r\n* Those that like tobaccos\r\n* Those that don’t (maybe)\r\n\r\nDon’t let the name fool you, it’s not a super smoky mix. I just like naming recipes after Iron and Wine songs.
