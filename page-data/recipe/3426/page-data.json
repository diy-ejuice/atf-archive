I’ve become a pepper taster overnight. Or maybe not overnight, but at some point since the last time I had some TFA VBIC, which couldn’t have been that long ago. As best I can tell when I try my best to ignore the pepper and not hold it against the recipe, there seems to be a terrific thick, sweet ice cream base here. I don’t taste much chocolate, certainly not enough for chocolate almond ice cream. That is probably not a bad thing because what chocolate is there tastes like tootsie roll and I really don’t want more of that. However, the snap of clear but complex and sweet almond on the end is just absolutely perfect for this. I’d to love to see this one redesigned with a pepper-free ice cream and a more authentic and stronger chocolate, but keeping that same perfect almond finish.

Im more of a fruit vapor, but i saw this recipe &amp; had to try it because Ive been looking for a vape to pair with my coffee in the morning. Although Im not sure if its the vape Im looking for to pair with my coffee it is a really tasty vape. thumbs up","score":5},{"user":"AwsumPawsm","text":"Vurve: Nice job with this one....It tastes pretty good as an SNV but I will let it marinate for a few days as well... I am sure the creams just pop within a week or so...","score":5},{"user":"CheebaSteeba","text":"So true to the reference it's scary!
