I started working on this on the Mixing with me Mates episode #25 on Bakery.  I wanted to use my Pretzel Dough, and I thought LB Bakers Touch may give it that special touch along with Salted Caramel VT  It was yummy, but not quite a soft pretzel.  The next episode of Mixing with me Mates, #26, we talked about additives.  My mate, The @VapinTrucker talked about how Cereal 27 was great to add texture to pretzel.  Ahhh, so let me go back to my recipe and try this.  So, here is what I have, and shows why mixing together, we **discover**.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Have you tried this recipe?!**\r\n**Please rate this recipe and comment below! I would LOVE to hear your experience.**","steep_days":"3","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T07:00:50.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"2844","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Apple Filling","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Bakers Touch","vendor":"LB","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Cereal 27","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Pretzel Dough SC","vendor":"WF","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Salted Caramel","vendor":"VT","millipercent":1500}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"114124","name":"Carnival"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
