This $$ juice has an excessively sweet vanilla profile (saturates on my Entheon clone!) but is not too bad on an RDA, the tobacco is hidden in the back but is regrettably enjoyable. This recipe being far away, but IMHO much better! SNV okay, but vanilla rises in 4-7 days.\r\nINW Biscuit - an amazing sweet, full, delicate vanilla biscuit which holds nicely with the tobacco\r\nDFS Holy Vanilla - I'm afraid for a slightly vanilla-impaired like myself it is amazing, as hyped!\r\nThe rest is a classic Flavorah tobacco, which comes alive after 1 week steeping. I went with:\r\nFLV Kentucky Blend - the ash profile, wich needs a little help from its colleagues\r\nFLV Native Tobacco - probably my favorite from Flavorah, spicy bright (I vape it at 4% with no shame!)\r\nFLV Red Burley - gives it the dark, chocolaty profile and connects with the heavy vanilla\r\n\r\n","steep_days":"7 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"total_reviews":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-02T08:15:50.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"1185","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Biscuit","vendor":"INW","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Holy Vanilla","vendor":"DFS","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Kentucky Blend","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1750},{"name":"Native Tobacco","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Red Burley","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1000}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"149996","name":"Biscuit Bacco - Wee God Way"}}}
