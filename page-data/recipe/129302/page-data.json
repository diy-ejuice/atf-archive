Loved it as a kid and still enjoy it every now and then. This brought back memories. It's not spot on but it's real close. The mouth feel is spot on to the drink. This makes the cut and will go in my rotation.  "},{"user":"Untitled","score":"2","text":"i totaly agree with Gordo! I couldnt taste any chocolate.
