This is a first strike recipe and I don't really see any need to do more work on it. I really enjoy it and it hit the spot for me.\r\n\r\nCream layer\r\nThe top layer is going to be very light so i have a rare opportunity to really play with a good cream layer. \r\n\r\nTFA Sweet cream - sweet and velvety\r\nTFA Vanilla swirl - this will take away some of the weight but has the exact vanilla tone I am looking for\r\nFA fresh cream - nondescript and used to undo the lightening effect of the swirl\r\n\r\nTea layer\r\nFA black tea - strong and dark, exactly right for the profile although a tad bit earthy. I really love how the black tea lingers on your pallette, that is a quality I deem desirable for this specific profile. \r\n\r\nTFA Green tea - breaks that earthyness and just give body and depth to the tea layer. While i wasnt specifically going for a matcha profile, I think it did a wonderful job and compliment the profile beautifully. \r\n\r\nTFA Cherry blossom - bubble teas are ofter made with aromatic teas and i didnt feel the standard ceylon or bergamot or would go too well with the honeydew... So I chose cherry blossom, I felt that with the vanilla will help push the tea into the aromatic territory and I am very pleased with the result. \r\n\r\nDewwy layer\r\nThe top layer is very light so we are going in low and linear.\r\n\r\nRAW Honeydew - light, authentic and creamy, simple and effective. \r\n\r\nYou can play around with this, chocolate, mango, peach, berries, coconut, hazelnut, almonds.. Even citrus... The possibilities are endless! stay low and you will get great results. \r\n\r\nCAP Super sweet - helps mask some of the astringent top notes in the black tea but also helps in carrying the creams and vanilla.\r\n\r\nSo thats it. I'd love to get feedback on my attempt!
