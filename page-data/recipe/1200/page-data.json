I steeped it over a month, hoping that it would mellow out, but it is still too harsh for me."},{"user":"KaptinKaos","text":"Peachy, but not the right peachy. 3% FA White Peach is almost the roof for that flavor and dousing it with TPA JP is like adding gas to a fire, lol! 2% FA white peach with 1% Cap yellow peach is much nicer. Add a dash of FA Pear and now it's delicious! The custard in this was also the wrong creaminess... Van whipped, sweet cream, LB Van ice cream, basically anything else works better. As is this mix is harsh and sharp. The meringue doesn't lend much sweetness either and I think could just be muting some of the creaminess."},{"user":"MediocreVibes","text":"Too many off flavors. I get a waxy note, probably from the White Peach. The throat hit is a bit unpleasant. Also, I feel that Vanilla Custard gives it to much of an egg (custard) flavor for a Peaches and Cream vape."},{"user":"HerrHut","text":"I want to like it, but the throat hit (from the peach I guess?) is just to unpleasant for me.  I may try it again with the peaches halved."},{"user":"TogiraIkonoka0618","text":"Very nice and creamy peaches and cream here. Well blended and not harsh at all. Great for a change from all the heavier recipes I normally do"},{"user":"DaddyKane91","text":"Okay Vurve,, I mixed this up and after i subbed a couple things.. i went with Cap Juicy Peach at 3% and Cap Apricot @ 1.5% , i didn't have the cap Van Custard so isubbed it with Delosi Van custard at same % ,, not to bad mixing this fo rPops for a Xmas Gift "},{"user":"Thadentman","text":"At 2 weeks age this recipe is on point. It does change it a bit obviously but to get rid of the throat hit I added 4 drops MF strawberry. I also have issues with tpa juicy peach. Thanks Vurve"},{"user":"TheGrouch","text":"Mixed this up for my wife and she's lovin it! Thanks Vurve! Keep the recipes comin!
