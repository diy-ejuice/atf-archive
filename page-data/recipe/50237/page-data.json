This is a fantastic concentrate, totally worth having, but it is spendy thus not a lot of people are going to have it on hand.\r\n\r\nThe TLDR; A Perique tobacco blend, or as close as I could get in this effort. It is also a tobacco vape, very much a tobacco vape. (for that one person who is going to mix it expecting it to be something else.) ENJOY!\r\n\r\nFLV Heat, it can get away from you, it will become too hot to vape unless you are dead inside. A drop too much in a 50 is no big deal, a drop too much in a 10mL might be a big deal for you. This concentrate will stay on the tongue and lips. It does work higher in other profiles. Just beware.\r\n\r\nVariations: if you are wanting a less ashy version drop Kentucky Blend to .5 and increase Native Tobacco what you dropped it by. For a more \"pipey\" mustier version add 0.2% or so Lovage Root.\r\n\r\nThis was a long chase for me. I loved Perique Tobacco. I liked pipe blends with it, I loved St James Perique and I really liked Acadian Perique. Read the below for the difference. One of the things that hampered my chase of this is that I have to go off the foggy remembrance of perique. It has been some years, a bit more than half a decade since I have smoked any and I am not smoking to find how close I am. This is as close to memory as I care to get.\r\n\r\nAnyways... There is no true way to replicate the actual tobacco or the blends of them. FLV got freakishly close to uncured St. James tobacco with their Red Burley concentrate. However, replicating that intense highly complex profile of Perique is nigh on impossible. You could just as easily recreate Tahitian vanilla without using vanilla or vanillin, impossibruh... It is hard to explain the need for these specific concentrates and what they do in the profile. To be honest I have been swapping and tweaking percentages on this with the idea of ordering FLV Heat when I got close enough to make that final effort. I will say that I had gotten as close as I could and had a talk with HIS BEARDED HOLYNESS AKA Kopel, AKA HOCUSKROCUS and we batted a Kopel of ideas around... Mainly wanted to tell him how hard doing an Homage to Perique is without looking like I ripped Hinterland off. :)\r\n\r\nI am sticking with the recipe that I ended on but adding the optional FLV Arabian. I feel it adds a good bit to the recipe and gets a good bit closer with it's spice and other notes. Specifically those darker fruit/raisin notes. I also know that it is expensive as heck and most people are not going to have it.... If you do it is great, if you don't and will not use it for other mixes don't bother. It is wonderful, but expensive. :)\r\n\r\nPerique, traditionally small leaf Red Burley tobacco grown in the small area of St James Parish. The soil and climate there along with this old heirloom tobacco make a wonderful leaf. The Choctaw Indians of the area took this tobacco and pressed it in old hollowed out tree trunks, \"turning\" the leaves every few months for a year. Settlers in the area took to cultivating this tobacco and following the millennia old method of curing made their own. They used jack screw presses and oak barrels instead of hollowed out tree trunks.... Cut leaves, hang to dry, remove all stem from the leaf leaving the leaf intact leaves are then formed into torquettes and placed in a barrel. The barrel has a lid placed on and the jack screws are turned. Each day the pressure on the jack screws is checked and kept tight. At least three times during the process the leaves are removed from the barrel with top going to bottom and bottom going to top...\r\n\r\nWhat ends up happening here is a multilevel fermentation process. You get the initial aerobic fermentation follow by an intense and deeper anaerobic (malolactic) fermentation. This brings out that deep dark complex profile. Dark, spicy, nutty, slight hints of fruit.\r\nPerique is a blenders tobacco, not used 100%, those few nutcases that claim they smoke 100% perique are either pulling one over or they are using the tamer Acadian Perique. This is a blend that is done for high volume buyers, processed the same way as St James Perqiue but using tobacco from all over the country.\r\n\r\nObligatory: Best at 50% to 60% VG, this is good as a shake and vape, it gets way better and more complex as it steeps. This is also a tobacco lovers vape. It is tobacco.","steep_days":"7 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"total_reviews":4,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:49:23.000-05:00","best_vg":"60%","views":"5576","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Red Burley","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Kentucky Blend","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Oriental Tobacco","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":750},{"name":"Heat","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":100},{"name":"Wood Spice","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":500},{"name":"Native Tobacco","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":700}],"reviews":[{"user":"HerrHut","score":"none","text":"Sometimes I just hate rating recipes.  This is a very unique and interesting tobacco.  It's not at all what I expected after Abuela and Buffalo Burlington.  Butâ€¦  I just can't drip this more then once and don't really enjoy it.  I can't put my finger on what's not agreeing with me here.  Is it Heat or Wood Spice.  Not sure."},{"user":"OldAgeVaper","score":"5","text":"A recipe with a few options you gotta love that, Im scoring 5 on the version i mixed up which i added the 0.4% FLV Arabian Tobacco, i drop Kentucky Blend to .5 and increase Native Tobacco by .5 and for the more \"pipey\" mustier version i added 0.2%  Lovage Root  on which i might drop on the next batch i mix just to see what its like without.&#xD;\nThis is a very complex flavor and very hard to explain haha im getting that lovage root and wood spice off the bat along with one of the tobaccos giving it a very slight fruit note but then fades and im left with the dark deep cigar flavor but still with the slight notes of the inhale around. This is very flavorful and tastey liquid and for sure something different. How you got to this one i mixed FEAR god knows lol. Cant wait to do the other options to this mix. vaping in the hadaly after a 10 day steep.&#xD;\nGreat job 5 star."},{"user":"SlashaLO","score":"5","text":"This was just great. Very deep, complex, and full of flavor. The heat does magic in this mix also. I was pleasantly surprised. I tried as is, and then for my taste I actually doubled the heat. Just a little more noticeable but no super burn. Awesome job!&#xD;\n&#xD;\nSide note, I added the optional Arabian, it really does an amazing job in this as well."},{"user":"Preacher143","score":"5","text":"Just awesome, great job Fear. I'm not great on describing flavor notes but I can definitely say I love this recipe."}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"50237","name":"Acadian Black Label"}}}
