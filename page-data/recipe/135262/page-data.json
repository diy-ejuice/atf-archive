Flavorah Cream and Butterscotch toghether create a rich caramel cream full of body and texture, and a bit of FLV Milk Chocolate adds warmness and a sutil dark note. FLV Vanilla Bean is an idea I took from @Thadentman and @Kopel and it works great to add a very natural vanilla and also boost the vanilla from other flavors.\r\n\r\nSalud!","steep_days":"3 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"total_reviews":2,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:50:40.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"1454","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Root Beer","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Milk Chocolate","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":200},{"name":"Cream","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Vanilla Bean","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":750},{"name":"Butterscotch","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1000}],"reviews":[{"user":"ID10-T","score":"5","text":"I really get a full spectrum of flavor.
