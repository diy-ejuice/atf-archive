Also, my first shared recipe!\r\n\r\nBlue Slushie is by far the most popular liquid at all 5 shops that I manage. It's easy on the coils, tasty, and tends to keep its flavor throughout the whole 100ml bottle. It's not an overly complicated recipe by any means. Bright and straightforward blue raspberry with a hint of strawberry. \r\n\r\nRight off the shake, it was fairly close. Not quite as sweet, which I don't mind. \r\nAfter sitting over night, it brightens up a bit, a little more authentic to the original. \r\nAfter a full day, the strawberry starts to pull through, raspberry tones don't. It loses some of the \"blue\" that I'm looking for.\r\n\r\nLiquid Barn - Blue Raspberry\r\nThis flavor by itself is fairly close to the smell and taste of Blue Slushie. Mixed at Liquid Barn's recommendation of 8%.\r\n\r\nCapella - Sweet Strawberry\r\nAdded to give a light strawberry taste on the exhale. Not meant to be a main note as most customers at the shop I manage don't even notice there is strawberry. \r\n\r\nCapella - Super Sweet\r\nI added 1 drop per 10ml. I have only made one batch so far. Going to tweak this as I go.\r\n\r\n\r\nUPDATE: Have changed the recipe to brighten/extend the \"blue\" flavor after a few days. \r\nTPA Raspberry Sweet @ 2.5% \r\nDropped LB Blue Raspberry to 6%\r\n","steep_days":"0 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:50:28.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"9721","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Blue Raspberry","vendor":"LB","millipercent":6000},{"name":"Sweet Strawberry","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Raspberry (sweet)","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Super Sweet","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":400}],"reviews":[{"user":"tw2k","text":""},{"user":"Sublimeice","text":"Nice lightly tart blue razz with some strawberry on the exhale. pretty good!"},{"user":"RushG93","text":"I haven't tried the original, but since this is a remix, I guess it doesn't matter!

Already halfway through my 10mL batch, gonna have to make a huge batch of this. ADV Worthy :)"},{"user":"diesel223","text":"I have tried the original and this recipe comes quite close to it. Really refreshing sweet blue slush vape. Great job sir."},{"user":"praiseme","text":"I have not tried the original but this is great after an hour. Depending on what happens in the next couple days I'll probably drop the sweetener. It's amazing what the sweet strawberry does to lb's blue raspberry. Glad I tried this one."}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"121491","name":"Keep It 100 - Blue Slush Remix"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
