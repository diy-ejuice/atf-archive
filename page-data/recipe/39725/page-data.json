I was sniffing through my concentrates and noticed the TFA Elderberry smelt very similar to blueberry but a little richer, so I added 1% to add a little extra depth. FA Caramel helps 'jam' it up a little.\r\n\r\nIn all honesty though not much thought went into this, but it tastes pretty damn nice and it will be a new favourite in my \"Shit I need some juice, better bust out a Shake 'N' Vape\" pile and maybe you will enjoy it too.","steep_days":"3 (SNV)","temperature":"450","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-02T08:04:05.000-05:00","best_vg":"75%","views":"3048","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Blueberry (wild)","flavor_id":"215","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":5000},{"name":"Carmel (caramel)","flavor_id":"503","vendor":"FA","millipercent":750},{"name":"Elderberry","flavor_id":"230","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Graham Cracker Clear","flavor_id":"325","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":500},{"name":"New York Cheesecake","flavor_id":"90","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Vanilla Bean Ice Cream","flavor_id":"186","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Vanilla Whipped Cream","flavor_id":"1","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Super Sweet","flavor_id":"2384","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":500}],"reviews":[{"user":"cincinnatiking","text":"Been looking for a good cheesecake with a slight cheese note.
