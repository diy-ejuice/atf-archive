Everywhere from FA Cookie, to WF Deep Fried Pastry Dough, CAP Sugar Cookie etc. But every time, I found myself getting further and further away from the simplicity that I really wanted from a sesame ball. So in the end, I had to come to realize, that WF Sesame Dough on its own actually worked perfectly fine.\r\nIt has a sharpness of toasted sesame, but keeps the warmth and don't overdo the sharpness at all. It's nice and round in flavor and a little sticky in texture.\r\nTo help the stickiness be more upfront, I added a pinch of FA Meringue.\r\n\r\nConcerning the pudding, I went though time and time again to figure out exactly what I wanted. I knew FLV Vanilla Pudding needed to be in this, as it has the great ability to be thick, almost borderline disgusting, but handled correctly you can get some really nice results with it.\r\nTo add a sort of eggy note to the filling, I danced around a few custards such as FA Custard Premium, FA Custard, but I always landed right back on INW Custard, as it brings those exact eggy notes I was after and doesn't add any taste that I didn't really need there.\r\nTo bridge the INW Custard and FLV Vanilla pudding, I'm using TFA Vanilla Swirl and its ability to smoothen everything out.\r\nFA Meringue again brings a little sweetness and stickiness to the filling.\r\n\r\nThe contrast here is, that you'll start with the toasted sesame and a hint of dough. Before you know it, you're hit with the vanilla filling. Exactly as if you were actually eating a sesame ball with a vanilla filling.\r\n\r\nThis recipe is inspired by the vietnamese dessert \"BÃ¡hn Cam\", which usually consist of a mung bean filling, but despite me lacking any sort of bean flavor, it works perfectly fine with a vanilla filling instead.\r\n\r\nLet it steep at least the recommended 5 days for the best result.\r\n\r\nEnjoy!\r\n\r\nThumbnail design by @Zany","steep_days":"5","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"updated_at":"2020-12-12T15:41:11.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"541","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Sesame Dough SC","flavor_id":"8378","vendor":"WF","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Vanilla Pudding","flavor_id":"4433","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Custard","flavor_id":"4210","vendor":"INW","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Vanilla Swirl","flavor_id":"189","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Meringue","flavor_id":"530","vendor":"FA","millipercent":750}],"reviews":[{"user":"failyx","text":"Great stuff! I bought Sesame Dough and Vanilla Pudding to mix this up. Definitely gonna use them in my own recipes too!&#xD;\nThis is a really well balanced recipe, subtle, nothing crazy in your face. Due to this I can see myself vaping this the whole day without getting sick of it. Thanks for sharing kitty. Also I think you could use this as a base to add some jam or syrupy fruits. Gonna try that someday.","score":5}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"198529","name":"Sesame Vanilla Cream Balls"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
