Only in at 0.01% (0.10% of a 10% dilution to make it more manageable).\r\n\r\nThe pudding comes from using FA premium as a base and filled out with Vanilla swirl.\r\n\r\nAs always sweetener is subjective but you may want to take the super sweet up to as high as 0.75 to get that “premium” taste.\r\n\r\nThis will be my final version of Cornbread puddin’ as I feel this interpretation beats the original and also beats my earlier attempts in the way of coil life and stodginess.\r\n\r\nIf you like what I do and this recipe then please rate and review accordingly.\r\n","steep_days":"5","temperature":"0","recipe_score":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-12T06:59:37.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"1504","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Popcorn","flavor_id":"8564","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":650},{"name":"Cereal 27","flavor_id":"4163","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Corn","flavor_id":"563","vendor":"FA","millipercent":10},{"name":"Corn Bread","flavor_id":"2007","vendor":"OOO","millipercent":6500},{"name":"Super Sweet","flavor_id":"2384","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":250},{"name":"Custard Premium","flavor_id":"9118","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Vanilla Swirl","flavor_id":"189","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2500}],"reviews":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"156839","name":"Another variation of a fiend"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
