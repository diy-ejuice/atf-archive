I got into mixing my own juices pretty soon after starting vaping so never really tried that many \"premium\" juices but this was one of the first I tried and it was a vice of mine for a long time. Mangabeys is a lovely rich sweet tropical mango and pineapple profile but when I say sweet its really sweet its a coil killer and I eventually got tired of having to rewick my coils everyday so I set about recreating my own version and here it is I hope you enjoy it as much as do.\r\nCap Sweet Guava -  it took my quite a while to realise that guava was such a key part of this recipe, I knew it was there but wasn't until I bumped it up did it really bring the recipe together.\r\nFlv Mango/Cap Sweet Mango - This is a great pairing of mangos together they give you everything you could possible want in a mango flavour. Rich, sweet, juicy and body its almost like actually biting into a really ripe mango. These are not the mangos that 12 Monkeys used in their Mangabeys but I love this combination.\r\nTfa Pineapple/Tfa dragonfruit - Tfa pineapple is rich, sharp and very strong and if its not well balanced it can take over a recipe very easily and become harsh which is why I used Tfa dragonfruit. The dragon fruit has many uses here its used vey low so it dosnt impart a lot of flavour but it does help round out the top notes of Tfa pineapple and calm it down so it dosnt bully the other flavours in the recipe. It also gives the whole recipe a bit of extra juciness.\r\nCap Super Sweet - Well this is a remix of a \"premium\" juice and to give it a little more of a \"premium\" taste it needs sweetener. At 0.5% I think it gives the profile all the sweetness it need to emulate the original but not gunk your coils too much it also helps lift all those flavours to the next level.\r\nI hope you mix and enjoy this recipe and as always I'm happy to hear any feedback you might have good or bad\r\n ","steep_days":"3 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":4.9,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:49:47.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"10852","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Sweet Guava","flavor_id":"118","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Mango","flavor_id":"3516","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Sweet Mango","flavor_id":"120","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Dragonfruit","flavor_id":"226","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Pineapple","flavor_id":"259","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Super Sweet","flavor_id":"2384","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":500}],"reviews":[{"user":"Pipper-Dipper","text":"I rarely, if ever, mix the same recipe twice. I jist finished my bottle, and I think I will have to mix this again. I subbed out FLV Mango with FA Mango Indian Special at the same percentage.&#xD;\n&#xD;\nThe guava is doing magic. Every now and then i pick up on it. Vaping this while typing.&#xD;\n&#xD;\nAlso, never had the original. Started doing DIY shortly after I started vaping, so never really bought a lot of juices."},{"user":"konvul","text":""},{"user":"horrend","text":"I've not tried the 12 Monkeys juice so can't comment on how close this remix is to the original but I can say it is a very tasty, tropical fruity vape. I'm mainly picking up the pineapple, with a nice background mix of mango and guava. It's a little sweet for my tastes though, I'm definitely going to be mixing more but I'll drop the sweetener entirely, the sweet guava and mango will give plenty of sweetness themselves. "},{"user":"vagdal","text":"Great mango juice! thanks for sharing!!"},{"user":"BigCloud","text":"It's not mangabeys at all, but hey that's no problem at all. This is a great juice, my second batch I cut the sweet mango down to 1% and added 3% VTA Shisha Mango and for me personally it was even better. I just don't like Cap Sweet mango that much. Although I got to say this was the first time I mixed it this high and it didn't f**k up the mix. Well done, great 5* recipe.

Perfect!!! Better than the original for sure.... "},{"user":"FruitsAD","text":"DIY newb here. This is only the fifth recipe that I've mixed but it's my favorite so far. Delicious and very well balanced without a doubt! It reminds me of Alpha Vapes \"The Dude\" but better imo. A great ADV. Thanks for sharing this @mansser80!"},{"user":"lococarnage","text":"Never had the 12 Monkeys version but I hope it's like this."},{"user":"Wiingy","text":"Very good!  I didnâ€™t have tpa pineapple so I subbed. 2%INW and 0.75 cap golden. It worked out well. Thanks!"},{"user":"Screwdriver","text":"This is my absolute favorite mango juice and my wife (who's very demanding) and friends are over the moon for this vape also.&#xD;\nIt is really nicely balanced and perfectly sweet. I can only highly recommend to all into mango juices. Job well done, many thx."}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"78780","name":"12 Monkeys - Mangabeys remix #remixmonth"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
