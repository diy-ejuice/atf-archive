The requisites of this were 1) Simple 2) SNV and 3) common ingredients. Just the fruits alone I found lacked body and didn't really work for what I wanted to create. The FA Fuji Apple creates a really good flavor when combined with TPA Honeydew, I tinkered with the percentages with both of these and even went as high as 5% Honeydew and found that anything over 4% created a really weird chemical like off note. So at 4% and 3% I found made a perfect happy medium. The Jelly Candy I found created a really nice body without battling to come to the front.
