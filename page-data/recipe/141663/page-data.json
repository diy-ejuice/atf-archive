This is a sweet tobacco with some ashy notes. I paired it with fLV Tatanka which is a dark sweet cheeing tobacco. Butterscotch is used to make it more desserty, and pairs perfectly with Smoked Butterscotch. To enhance a bit of nuttiness from the tobacco i used Kinako Soy, and this needed a fruit to bring in some sweeter notes, so Fig was used as an accent. Of course FLV Cream is perfect to blend together and smooth any off notes. So take a ride with me and try this delicious tobacco. And if it was meant to be, leave your thoughts. ðŸ’œðŸ’œðŸ’œ. \r\nhttps://youtu.be/zDo0H8Fm7d0\r\nMusic to listen to.

Off the shake this mix checks all the boxes. Very smooth with zero throat hit. Running this on an Addy Tuney Kayfun with his patented flavor build. .3 ohm coil at 45 watts and itâ€™s the perfect vape for me with this mix. Thank you Tam for all you do!
