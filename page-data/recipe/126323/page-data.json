I'm enjoying my MTL setup during the day, I get through the day with less vape breaks - and extremely satisfying vape sessions. \r\n\r\nWe did a review show on Vurve, and RudeRudi spoke about Sweet Leaf. Following that I got in my concentrates, and mixed it up - I found the recipe to be really authentic, with a touch of dryness - like any cigar would. But because I have been vaping sweet fruits and desserts, my palate wasn't ready for it.  So I smashed in some of my favorite dark cream, and caramel - to help add more body to this delicious cigar flavor.  TFA Bavarian cream has a way for filling in all the dead spots in the mix, giving you a all round fuller body experience. \r\n\r\nThis is a Creamy Caramel Cuban, made for the squad that is tobacco curious, the perfect gateway to tobacco's. I would recommend this in a MTL setup - as this is how I tested this specific recipe. \r\n\r\nOnly add the super sweet if you want serious dessert style sweetness - because the TFA Bavarian Cream & FA Caramel is inherently sweet. This is not everyone's cup of tea, because it actually goes really well with a strong cup of coffee in the morning. Absolute bliss.\r\n\r\nIf you like sweet stuff, and also hit some tobacco recipes from time to time. Give this one a Smasheroo!","steep_days":"1 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"updated_at":"2020-12-12T15:40:16.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"4129","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Cured Tobacco","flavor_id":"630","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Shisha Vanilla","flavor_id":"841","vendor":"INW","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Carmel (caramel)","flavor_id":"503","vendor":"FA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Bavarian Cream","flavor_id":"145","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Super Sweet","flavor_id":"2384","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":150}],"reviews":[{"user":"cdaniell30","text":"Exactly as described...a kinda dry but creamy caramelly intro into good tobacco mixes.
