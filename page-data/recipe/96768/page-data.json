Works great as a the main profile for a lime slushy.  NOTE it does fade over time - so you may want to add another   more authentic lime \r\n \r\nGalla Melon  is  a honeydew  /cantaloupe profile and provides the fleshy body middle note  for the lime to sit on top of \r\n\r\nThe cucumber adds a wetness and  juiciness to this that is noticeable on the back end.  it does have a bit of a sweetness  that almost seems like  a  banana note to me   which I am noticing in several of the VT flavors, but I like it in this mix . This is another flavor that tends to fade and change over time.  ( Note if you use FA cucumber it  will add a more  savory  note that will stand out much more on the exhale  then VTA  in this mix ) \r\n\r\nArtic mint   I just love this  flavor for this type of application.   it is  the prefect combination of coolness / menthol and mint  with out being  over the top.    there is some room for this to go up to  higher if you want to really  have that cooling mint effect  stand out.    This  does come through at the back end with the  cucumber .\r\n\r\nSweetner once again   that is your taste, the lime cordial and cucumber have some sweetness -   but I really liked  the additional  sweetner for MTL/PODs\r\n\r\nThis mix can also be used in a MTL   or low wattage tank \r\n\r\n","steep_days":"3 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"total_reviews":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-05T06:48:06.000-05:00","best_vg":"60%","views":"1697","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Arctic Mint","vendor":"PUR","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Cucumber","vendor":"VT","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Lime Cordial","vendor":"VT","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Ripe Galia Melon SC","vendor":"WF","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Super Sweet","vendor":"PUR","millipercent":500}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"96768","name":"County Fair Lime Mint Slushie  (for POD or MTL)"}}}
