The stone is sometimes called the seed, but that is a mistake, as the seed is inside the stone. The stones can also be called a pit. Examples of stone fruits are peaches, nectarines, apricots, plums, and cherries.\"\r\n\r\nFA Peach white and INW Peach blends perfectly to provide our peach layer. Combined, they provide an authentic, juicy, drip-down-your-chin peach - skin, stone and flesh all in one!\r\n\r\nTPA Nectarine is a fabulous, true, nectarine flavor and, if used correctly, translates nectarine in vape form perfectly. Just a touch is necessary to compliment the peach layer = any more and it becomes florally. \r\n\r\nINW Smoked plum brings an intriguing sweet and sour element with a touch of smokiness to keep the juice interesting and balanced.\r\n\r\nFA Apricot provides the fresh, juicy and ripe apricot flavor with that slight tang to balance the overall sweetness. Be careful with this one as it can overpower a mix in an instant.\r\n\r\nFA Cherryl imparts the cherry stone fruit layer and boosts the sweetness of the mix with it's inherent natural sweetness. Again, just a tad is all it takes...\r\n\r\nFA Cream provides a bit of mouthfeel to the overall mix and blends all the fruits together wonderfully!\r\n\r\nFeel free to add a touch of WS-23, etc if you prefer a chilled version.\r\n\r\nThis baby needs at least 5 days (7 days better) for the fruits to meld together and smooth the floral edges.\r\n","steep_days":"5","temperature":"0","recipe_score":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-11T20:41:40.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"1874","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Smoked Plum","flavor_id":"842","vendor":"INW","millipercent":500},{"name":"Armenia (apricot)","flavor_id":"507","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Peach White","flavor_id":"543","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Peach","flavor_id":"804","vendor":"INW","millipercent":500},{"name":"Cherryl (cherry, Black)","flavor_id":"468","vendor":"FA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Nectarine","flavor_id":"249","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Cream Fresh","flavor_id":"540","vendor":"FA","millipercent":500}],"reviews":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"104807","name":"Stoned"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
