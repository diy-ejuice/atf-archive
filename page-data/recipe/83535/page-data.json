The first thing I had written down was \"very nice tropical blend of pineapple and coconut, reminiscent of a Pina Colada.\" Then right below that I had notes on INW Cherimoya which is a lovely flavor that screams tropical so I figured this was a perfect fit for what I was shooting for. There's notes of banana and pineapple in this, with a creamy richness most fruits just don't have.\r\nFor me, a mix has to be more than just a good flavor. It needs to match that profile when you actually vape it. Something like this I picture it as being thickened up from the banana, so I needed to build the body up a little more. Plus I like a dense satisfying vape!\r\nTPA Banana Cream actually does a good job of this, and at 2.5% it gives this a nice richness and helps accent the banana notes I get in Cherimoya already. \r\nNow, the only thing left to do is to sweeten up the coconut note and find a contrasting pineapple so it can stand out a bit more. I used TFA coconut candy only because it was a sweeter type coconut. That candied coconut helps it show up better in this mix. I tried a couple versions with FLV coconut and sweet coconut, but TFA just worked better for what I was going for.\r\nFLV pineapple here was a pretty simple call. At 1% there's zero throat hit, and it adds a hint of tartness that helps stand up against the thicker banana. CAP golden pineapple is too sweet and it lacks bright top notes. When the majority of the fruits are base notes, I needed that pineapple to be bright so I didn't get buried. \r\nThis mix came out beautifully! It checked all my mandatory boxes to qualify as an ADV. From flavor to mouth feel this has it all. \r\nYou could add 1% of VT Light Rum if you want to give it a banana kissed pina colada vibe which is what I'm vaping right now and it's damn good. Or you could try adding your preferred coolant if you want to chill it, this works well there too. \r\nThis wasn't an overly complicated profile, but to get the body I wanted as well as getting certain notes to contrast one another was a bit tricky. It was fun to do though and all the testers were good.\r\nI hope you enjoy this as much as I have been, I'm due to mix another bottle now.\r\nYou can S&V this, there's no harshness or anything but I find it hits the best balance after about 3 days. Banana Cream usually needs a few days to settle down for me and get in it's position","steep_days":"3 (SNV)","temperature":"450","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-06T12:55:09.000-05:00","best_vg":"65%","views":"2236","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Cherimoya (yc)","flavor_id":"738","vendor":"INW","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Cocopilada","flavor_id":"770","vendor":"INW","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Banana Cream","flavor_id":"210","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Coconut Candy","flavor_id":"223","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Sweetener","flavor_id":"1432","vendor":"FW","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Pineapple","flavor_id":"4428","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1000}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"83535","name":"Tropical Summer"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
