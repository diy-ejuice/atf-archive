Using this base you can be creative and add dark fruits like blueberry, yumberry, stawberry. For me I added some Tpa coconut candy at .75%  and subbed out tpa sweeter for cappella super sweet at .25.

Both the wife and I enjoy it! 🙂 There's not a long steep time it seems... I'm only on day 3 or 4 maybe it has to do with the Holy Vanilla but whatever the reason this is simple and easy and delicious! Keep up the great work with the simple recipes! I've been mixing for quite some time now (3+) and it's always nice to see an enjoyable simple recipe... Even for us older mixers! Nice work! 👍👍"}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"138277","name":"Recipes Made Simple: Vanilla Custard "}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
