Let me prove them wrong.\r\nFinally added some sweetness and topped the mix with my all-time favourite honey, FLV Honey Bee, a very versatile honey with many faces.\r\n\r\nEnjoy this fine and delicate tasting vape.\r\n\r\nBeen on the shelf for awhile, no degradation in taste.\r\nSteep at least 5 days, gets better with time.","steep_days":"5","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:50:58.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"3417","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Greek Yogurt","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Honey Bee","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":300},{"name":"Marshmallow Vanilla","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Smooth Vanilla","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":200},{"name":"Sweetness","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":500},{"name":"Vanilla Pudding","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":750}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"152723","name":"Creamy Greek Vanilla Yogurt"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
