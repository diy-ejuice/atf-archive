I must admit that I din't mix it according to the recipe, since I am missing a few flavors. I replaced the CAP French Vanilla with TFA at same percentage, and didn't add the TPA Cotton Candy. Mixed it up last night, and I really love it. The Cheesecake (Graham Crust) is a wonderful addition to this. The lingering Graham taste on the exhale is delightful. Thank you for sharing this, I will definitely be adding this to my normal rotation! :D"}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"3698","name":"Strawberry Madness"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
