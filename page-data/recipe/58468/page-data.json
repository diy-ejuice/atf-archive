A coffee vape was one of my first profiles I mixed when I began mixing. One of my first few flavors I purchased was LA coffee. And let me tell you, it was horrible! After a few attempts to make it better I abandoned the profile. Now with more experience, the right percentages, and a \"Wonder\"ful new flavor to work with, I think this recipe has satisfied my profile desires. Crispy Crème Coffee is a combination of 2 of my favorite things, coffee and doughnuts! The WF Smooth cappuccino cream is a sweet and creamy coffee. And when paired with FA UP at 1%, and WF Hazelnuts & Cream at only .5%, it has a bold yet creamy flavor with hints of hazelnut. The WF Vanilla Ruyan Custard has an almost caramel-custard note that bolsters the coffee and when combined with the WF Deep Fried Pastry Dough SC, and 1% of Zeppola, it shines as a hot and fresh doughnut, slightly coated with powdered sugar. \r\nI would normally say this recipe would be great in the mornings with your coffee and a doughnut, but with this recipe, just skip breakfast and vape it on it's own. Tastes just like you dunked a fresh hot doughnut into you favorite coffee.\r\nCan be a shake and vape but is best after a 3 day steep.\r\nVisit Freedom To Mix on Discord https://discord.gg/SmSc8Ef\r\nVisit Freedom To Mix on FaceBook https://www.facebook.com/groups/415341418920740/ \r\n\r\nPlease comment, mix, and or rate,....it makes us all better mixers.

I have to admit I was skeptical... but the combination of donut and coffee works perfectly here. The coffee base is outstanding and is complimented by the bakery. The typical darker notes that go with coffee are softened by the donut and that roasted nutty note becomes an enhancer to the donut. Great work - this will be one of my regular mixes from now on.
