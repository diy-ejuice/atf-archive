INW Biscuit adds a hint of body and INW Vanilla Shisha adds an authentic luxurious true vanilla hit. I know FLV's Milk & Honey is a love or loathe kinda concentrate but I find it adds depth and an almost boozy creaminess to the mix without overpowering the silkiness of the ice cream.\r\n\r\nSubs: Liquid Barn's Vanilla Ice Cream is a great sub for those people who get a pepper note with TPA's VBIC\r\n","steep_days":"14","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"updated_at":"2020-12-12T18:29:01.000-05:00","best_vg":"80%","views":"8329","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Biscuit","flavor_id":"642","vendor":"INW","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Milk & Honey","flavor_id":"609","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Shisha Vanilla","flavor_id":"841","vendor":"INW","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Vanilla Bean Ice Cream","flavor_id":"186","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":8000}],"reviews":[{"user":"BadaG","text":"Really delicious, Super creamy in a very ice cream kind of way and a great depth to the vanilla.

I was hesitant to even mix this cuz of that but was looking for ways to play around with the milk and honey which Id just gotten in.  Boy am I glad I did.  I mixed up a sample test tube and tossed it in the rack to steep the 2 wks, now my only regret is only making the 10 ml sample tube.  On first draw, my mouth filled with flavor, not something you usually get from anything vanilla.  Its rich, sweet, full of body and has almost a sticky mouthfeel.  I definitely suggest trying it out even if you're not the type to like vanilla recipes as this is much more than just vanilla......that and mixing up a lager batch so you don't have to wait 2 wks for more! :p  much thanks betamax!","score":5},{"user":"CkoAU","text":"Love this, going to be making a heap.","score":5},{"user":"cdaniell30","text":"When people make milkshake recipes, they usually overcomplicate the fuck out of it with a bunch of creams that cancel each other out and you end up with a vaguely dairy munge of randomness, or they just throw bvic at a fruit and call it a milkshake.  This does neither of those things.  Every ingredient here contributes to the overall flavor and feel of the recipe, and there's nothing added that isn't necessary to get this result.  It tastes pretty good, too.","score":5},{"user":"Deejay_mills","text":"Solid simple recipe. I like the addition of inw biscuit and feel it does add a nice bidy to the vape..great job","score":5},{"user":"LLcoolwhip","text":"Amazing recipe this is awesome!","score":5},{"user":"esco","text":"Its amazing after a 2 week steep!!!","score":5}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"25771","name":"Vanilla Milkshake"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
