The next layer is a typical Strawberry profile comprised of Ripe Strawberry (TPA) supported by Sweet Strawberry (Cap). Then we have the Kiwi (FA) that ties everything together while adding a lot of depth. The overall mix is finished with a few supports, Cactus (INW) (I use a 10% dilution in PG @ .5%) makes it wonderfully juicy, Pear (FA) sweetens and cuts some of the bitter finish of the lemon, and just a little Super Sweet (Cap) takes away the bitter aftertaste that can build when chain vaping. Some vaping styles can probably get away without the Super Sweet.\r\n\r\nSteeping: This is certainly SnV viable but I recommend a couple days for the Cactus to settle down and for everything to meld nicely.","steep_days":"2 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:49:42.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"1826","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Lemonade","flavor_id":"951","vendor":"LA","millipercent":6000},{"name":"Lemon Sicily","flavor_id":"524","vendor":"FA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Strawberry (ripe)","flavor_id":"271","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":6000},{"name":"Sweet Strawberry","flavor_id":"121","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Cactus","flavor_id":"647","vendor":"INW","millipercent":50},{"name":"Pear","flavor_id":"411","vendor":"FA","millipercent":250},{"name":"Kiwi","flavor_id":"522","vendor":"FA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Super Sweet","flavor_id":"2384","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":250}],"reviews":[{"user":"cdaniell30","text":"This is the most complicated lemonade recipe I've ever mixed, but it's also the smoothest.
