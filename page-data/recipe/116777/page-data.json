I was considering HS Arabic but didn't want the fruity notes so much as just a camel-ish tobacco blend.\r\n\r\n Opted for HS Turkish combined with a bit of FLV Oriental for a decently dynamic, leafy/spicy base to build around. FLV CC is bringing some of that ash note and adding a touch of a burley note to liven up the tobacco mix. A dash of menthol arctic and ws-23 for that nice mentholated effect. S'camel is simply an additive that brings some Ethyl Maltol and Acetyl Pyrazine here to subtly sweeten, soften, and add a touch of nutty/graininess to the recipe.","steep_days":"7 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-12T02:45:24.000-05:00","best_vg":"50%","views":"1358","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Classic Cigarette","flavor_id":"4358","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Turkish Blended","flavor_id":"2029","vendor":"HS","millipercent":4500},{"name":"S'camel","flavor_id":"694","vendor":"INW","millipercent":750},{"name":"Aroma Arctic Winter (menthol Artic)","flavor_id":"514","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1250},{"name":"WS-23","flavor_id":"8085","vendor":"OTHR","millipercent":250},{"name":"Oriental Tobacco","flavor_id":"4401","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1500}],"reviews":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"116777","name":"Turkish Jade"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
