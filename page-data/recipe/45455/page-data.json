Super duper nice when you need something different. A nice milky base with a sweet touch of honey. This one is a steeper, 3 weeks minimum, a month is best! \r\n\r\nFull notes on reddit:  https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/6hft40/recipe_time_a_steeper_but_a_keeper_the_real_milk/","steep_days":"21","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"updated_at":"2020-12-12T14:05:21.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"7703","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Vanilla Swirl","flavor_id":"189","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Vanilla Custard","flavor_id":"633","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Vienna Cream","flavor_id":"516","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Cream Fresh","flavor_id":"540","vendor":"FA","millipercent":600},{"name":"Meringue","flavor_id":"530","vendor":"FA","millipercent":600},{"name":"Milk & Honey","flavor_id":"609","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":500},{"name":"Honey","flavor_id":"531","vendor":"FA","millipercent":220},{"name":"Hazelnut","flavor_id":"1312","vendor":"FW","millipercent":300}],"reviews":[{"user":"ObiWanCannoli","text":"Pretty much perfect as it was. My expectation was something similar to Dr.Fogs Milk &amp; Honey(commercial juice), and while it wasn't quite there, it was a tasty vape. For some reason this baby wasn't silky smooth for me as I experienced a bit of throat harshness but otherwise, a great recipe. I would probably bump up the honey a bit next time and drop the fresh cream as I can't stand it in most situations.","score":5},{"user":"HerrHut","text":"Delicious honey milk.  Love it!","score":5},{"user":"MrZigglesworth","text":"Well worth the wait! I wish I had made more than 60ml. ","score":5},{"user":"sampleit","text":"Well the month wait was up today!! Filled the tank and hesitantly took my 1st vape (not had any joy with fa honey so was hesitant) and bang!! What a nice vape!! &#xD;\nOnly problem I only mixed 50mls but thanx for this fa honey was getting cosy next to condensed milk for months!! :-)","score":5},{"user":"Trevorxgage","text":"When you dropped this recipe I was already on the fence about buying FLV milk &amp; honey so this pushed me over the edge, grabbing FA honey on my way and man I'm glad I did.&#xD;\n&#xD;\nRight away I mixed up 120ml's because if I was gonna steep it for 3 weeks I didn't want to blow through a 30ml right away then have to steep more so I was counting on you for a banger, and you didn't let me down. This is a perfect summer time vape. It's creamy and milky with just enough sweetness. It doesn't get cloying or sickeningly sweet if you toss it in a tank and spend your day in the summer heat like a lot of heavy cream recipes can get. The honey is just enough to sweeten everything without taking away from the smooth dairy and vanilla. &#xD;\n&#xD;\nTotally worth the steep time and ordering flavors just to mix this up, way to go man!","score":5}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"45455","name":"The Real Milk and Honey"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
