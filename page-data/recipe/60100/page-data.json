I am a fan of the each of three flavors you used and that's why this recipe caught my attention. I personally found the blackberry to be a little over powering the peach, which I barely taste and I think the lemon needs to pop just a hair. This isn't a bad start, but I believe you can take this to the next level with a couple tweeks. I would like to remake this turning down the blackberry down to 4%, adding 1% cap lemon sicily, turn down the tfa peach down to 4% and adding INW peach at 2%.  Don't ever get discouraged, this is my personal opinion."}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"60100","name":"Simple Black and Peach"}}}
