I used Flv Creme de menthe because it has a chocolate note to it that can work for the chocolate chips in the cookie and it gives LB white chocolate peppermint a little more of a minty edge. My cookie is a combo of fa cookie for its drier crunch and wf cookie butter for its butter goodness it adds to bakeries. \r\n\r\n","steep_days":"5 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-11T14:17:39.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"701","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Cookie","flavor_id":"490","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Cookie Butter SC","flavor_id":"10406","vendor":"WF","millipercent":750},{"name":"Creme De Menthe","flavor_id":"631","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":750},{"name":"White Chocolate Peppermint","flavor_id":"6795","vendor":"LB","millipercent":6000}],"reviews":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"177811","name":"mlNikon's Peppermint Cookie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
