I'm surprised at how damned tasty this is! Working from the assumption that this is what the idiot spawn eating these think it tastes like, this is spot on. There's this inhale of orange blueberry jam, but juicier. The liquid amber, marshmallow, and super sweet make for a creamy, juicy exhale that's very sweet, kinda like if they made a creamy gushers candy. There's the tiniest sting of extra citrus that tells me the lime's in there, but the flavor is mostly absorbed into the blueberry orange. The whole thing has that weird waxy but still kinda yummy taste that can only be jelly candy. It totally works on every level. Only real gripe is that I get that weird feeling on my tongue I get after too many Swedish Fish. It totally works, but is the one thing keeping this from being a true ADV. Seriously, I'm having no problem hitting the hell outta this, but that one detail keeps this from that prized territory.&#xD;\n&#xD;\nThis one's for fans of Swedish Fish but not the normal flavor,  candy fiends, blueberry junkies, and anyone going \"What the hell were those idiots thinking?!?\", without, yanno, actually eating a Tide Pod.&#xD;\n&#xD;\nFor something that I'm sure started as a mental exercise and a joke, you really found something special. Nicely done, man!"}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"84522","name":"Tide Pod Challenge"}}}
