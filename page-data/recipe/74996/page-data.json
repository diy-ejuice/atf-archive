I'm getting mostly the watermelon with the strawberries coming in later. The only thing that doesn't totally appeal to me is the sweetener, which is leaving na aftertaste in my mouth. I'll try making the next batch with a little less of it. Very good fruity adv overall, though."},{"user":"Jbirdy34","text":"Pretty tasty! Starting to mend a little more on a shake I got almost all tangerine now the other flavors are mixing in well and the tangerine is mellowing out. Nice recipe I enjoy it."}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"74996","name":"MonKanzi"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
