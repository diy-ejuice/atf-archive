FA Pear brings the juicy, run down your chin pear, whilst INW Pear adds the gritty texture, crunch and mouth feel. \r\n\r\nVT Honeycomb is a fantastic revelation by providing a rich honey flavour without overpowering the mix. Itâ€™s slight crunch augments the biscuit layer and adds just the right amount of sweetness to the mix without defeating the delicate pear layer.\r\n\r\nThe crunchy cluster is meant to sit in the background and provide a subtle textural role. I used OG INW Biscuit and do not recommend using the reformulated version. A suitable sub is JF Biscuit at the same %. \r\n\r\nGive this baby 3 days or so and she is ready to pop!","steep_days":"3","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:50:53.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"1456","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Pear","flavor_id":"665","vendor":"INW","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Pear","flavor_id":"411","vendor":"FA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Honeycomb","flavor_id":"8901","vendor":"VT","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Acetyl Pyrazine 5%","flavor_id":"1709","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":750},{"name":"Biscuit","flavor_id":"642","vendor":"INW","millipercent":500}],"reviews":[{"user":"Gordo","text":"Been working on something similar, when I saw this.
