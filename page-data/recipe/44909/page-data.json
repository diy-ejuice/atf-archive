Apple seems to steal the show here. The honey dew gets pushed to the back but is present enough to add a lil something. The kiwi adds to the bite of the fuji apple nicely and it all comes together to create a light spring time juice. Could maybe benefit from a few drops of super sweet but that's just me. Thanks for the recipe"}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"44909","name":"GREEN BREEZE"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
