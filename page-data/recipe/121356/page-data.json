After a few days steep I started vaping it and I have been enjoying it quite a bit. \r\n\r\nI am using fresh03s custard base as the custard note (lb Vic and flv van pudding). \r\n\r\nThe sugar cookie and flv graham cracker make up the \"bar\" part of the recipe. Sugar cookie is an obvious choice, and the flv graham cracker is being used to kind of add a bit more dryness to the bakery texture/notes and just give it a bit more uniqueness vs just using sugar cookie solo. \r\n\r\nThe strawberry notes are pretty good, the shisha strawberry is used to give more of a sweet strawberry syrup and the straw ripe is used to bring more of the authentic strawberry. If I'm gonna change anynting about this recipe it will prob be the strawberry notes though, I'm thinking a different combo might work better. Any suggestions are welcome :) ","steep_days":"5","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T23:37:00.000-05:00","best_vg":"75%","views":"1435","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Graham Cracker","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Shisha Strawberry","vendor":"INW","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Strawberry (ripe)","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":3500},{"name":"Sugar Cookie","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Sweetener","vendor":"FW","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Vanilla Ice Cream","vendor":"LB","millipercent":5000},{"name":"Vanilla Pudding","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1000}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"121356","name":"Strawberry Custard Bar "}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
