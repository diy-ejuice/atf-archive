It's not overly sweet, and I like the creaminess with the buttery pastry.  I vape this as a S&amp;V and 60ml. disappears in two days.  I've mixed it many times in the past few months.  I do add a little \"Joy\" to boost the pastry note. "}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"153315","name":"CHUNK | DEVELOPED"}}}
