Iâ€™ve vaped the original like itâ€™s going out of fashion and can honestly say this ejuice is the absolute bombdiggly. Iâ€™m proud to share this with you guys, mix it up,give it a few days and prepare yourself for some delicious flavours. Please leave your feedback and be so kind to rate my recipe.
