I had always tried making it with TFA Fruit Circles because that's what I had on hand. The boys over at Developed have sparked my interest again and I popped for some FW Fruity Flakes.\r\n\r\nFind the inspiration here:\r\nhttps://alltheflavors.com/recipes/145443#teleos_the_milk_remix_by_developed\r\n\r\nMy original version I used 1.75% of FW Fruity Flakes because it's definitely in there, barely lurking behind the sweet milky goodness. 1.75% is too much though...1% feels much better.\r\n\r\nFor my tastes this is pretty close to the original.  The milk needs a little more work.  OOO Cream (milky undertones) might be the trick.","steep_days":"7 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:50:53.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"1449","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Fruity Flakes","vendor":"FW","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Yogurt","vendor":"FW","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Bavarian Cream","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":750},{"name":"Brown Sugar","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Milk","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":250},{"name":"Cream","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":750},{"name":"Vanilla Custard","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Super Sweet","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":500}],"reviews":[{"user":"fergie716","text":"Really been enjoying this recipe. Definitely strong hints to the original Teleos blend. Very tasteful fruity flakes and milk. I did sub out FLV Milk for OOO Cream (Milky Undertones) at 1% and have been thoroughly enjoying it!
