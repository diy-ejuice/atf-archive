I usually get a stem-like note from the INW cherries, but I'm guessing that the Golden Pineapple helps cover that up.  This flavor pairing was used in ID10-T/Alfred Pudding's Counter Punch recipe with the same result.  Requires a small amount of patience because it's not so great off the shake, but after a few day it gets much better.  The WS-23 is perfectly balanced and makes it just cold enough to give you the cold drink feeling, yet not distract from the Vape.  Added .25% Super sweet.  Thanks for the recipe. Oh yeah! (Sorry, the kool-aid man forced me to do it.)"}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"160144","name":"eJuice Fairy - Red Punch "}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
