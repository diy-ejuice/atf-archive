So dont be harsh at me :D\r\n\r\nThe main idea behind this recipe, is a pie which has strawberries as the main note, a crusty base with a hint of buttery biscuits (thats why I prefer INW Biscuit). Also there is a tone of caramel between the delicious Cream mixed with the Strawberries and the base of the Pie.\r\n\r\nMaybe for some people this Recipe seems a little wrong, but its taste is realy good and realy close to what I wanted to be.\r\n\r\nI will publish also a v2 of this recipe, where short of I keep the flavour result and I improve the using of the concentrates.","steep_days":"15","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"total_reviews":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-05T15:42:57.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"1055","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Biscuit","vendor":"INW","millipercent":800},{"name":"Caramel (original)","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Cheesecake (graham Crust)","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Double Chocolate (clear)","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Strawberry","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":5000},{"name":"Sweet Strawberry","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Sweetener","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Vanilla Custard","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Whipped Cream","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1000}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"49954","name":"StrawCo Pie"}}}
