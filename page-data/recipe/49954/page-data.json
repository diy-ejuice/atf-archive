So dont be harsh at me :D\r\n\r\nThe main idea behind this recipe, is a pie which has strawberries as the main note, a crusty base with a hint of buttery biscuits (thats why I prefer INW Biscuit). Also there is a tone of caramel between the delicious Cream mixed with the Strawberries and the base of the Pie.\r\n\r\nMaybe for some people this Recipe seems a little wrong, but its taste is realy good and realy close to what I wanted to be.\r\n\r\nI will publish also a v2 of this recipe, where short of I keep the flavour result and I improve the using of the concentrates.","steep_days":"15","temperature":"0","recipe_score":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-12T06:58:01.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"1061","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Biscuit","flavor_id":"642","vendor":"INW","millipercent":800},{"name":"Caramel (original)","flavor_id":"149","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Cheesecake (graham Crust)","flavor_id":"152","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Double Chocolate (clear)","flavor_id":"158","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Strawberry","flavor_id":"272","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":5000},{"name":"Sweet Strawberry","flavor_id":"121","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Sweetener","flavor_id":"339","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Vanilla Custard","flavor_id":"188","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Whipped Cream","flavor_id":"193","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1000}],"reviews":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"49954","name":"StrawCo Pie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
