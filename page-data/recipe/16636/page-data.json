It's one of my favorite flavors and this is what I'm sticking with.  Fresh berries drenched in rich sweet ice cream with a light coating of powdered sugar.   Feel free to use TFA Strawberry Ripe, I just can't taste it.  % May need to be higher, based only on what I've read.  It's fine without sweetener but I find just a tad balances the cream/fruit sweetnesses that I coudln't get by increasing my fruit %s.  Pretty good shake and vape, but the harvest berry is too dominant until about 2-3 days in, and all is right with the world.","steep_days":"0","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T17:33:38.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"2115","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Harvest Berry","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Red Touch (strawberry)","vendor":"FA","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Vanilla Bean Ice Cream","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Marshmallow","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":750},{"name":"Fuji","vendor":"FA","millipercent":750},{"name":"Meringue","vendor":"FA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Sweetener","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":500}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"16636","name":"Harvest Cream"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
