Overall, Im very pleased with the results.\r\n\r\nDulce de Leche (JF) - Dense, creamy, sweet, sticky caramel. I could have used a traditional caramel flavoring here, but DdL has a creaminess to it that would be missing had I gone that route. I find TPA Caramel(original) and FA's Caramel a little dry, helped by a steep, but still astringent. This DdL adds a lot of density to the mix and really helps to round off any sharper edges the other flavors may have\r\n\r\nButterscotch (FA)- Thick and sticky butterscotch. Paired with Dulce de Leche, this tastes just like the shell of a candy apple. I know a lot are on the Butterscotch Ripple hype train right now, but i dont think it would be right for this mix. I get way more 'cream' from that flavor than butterscotch. It has a butterscotch kind of flavor, but it tastes a little \"off\" to me. I want creaminess, but i'll add it somehow else\r\n\r\nVBiC (TFA) - And here's that creaminess i wanted to add, but accompanied by vanilla. It get it done at this percentage and shouldnt be high enough to add pepperiness some get, not for me at least.\r\n\r\nRY4 Double (TFA) - Never got tobacco from this. Always more caramel, a woodiness almost nut but not quite flavor, and vanilla undertones. Im using this to tie everything together\r\n\r\nHazelnut (FW)/Soho (FA) - The whole mix by this point is approaching sugar-lips level of sweetness. Time to muddy things up and add some nuttiness and a little darkness. Such low percentages aren't majorly changing the overall profile, but you'd be able to tell the difference in the mix without them if tasted side by side \r\n\r\nFuji (FA)- With all the sweetness and thickness from the other flavors, this apple is very bright. It stands out in the mix at 2% but doesnt drown out the other flavors. They exist together. The apple ends up wrapping around the other flavors like an inside out candy apple.","steep_days":"7 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-12T10:14:22.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"2201","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Ry4 Double","flavor_id":"379","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":3500},{"name":"Dulce De Leche","flavor_id":"4575","vendor":"JF","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Butterscotch","flavor_id":"495","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Hazelnut","flavor_id":"1312","vendor":"FW","millipercent":500},{"name":"Soho","flavor_id":"413","vendor":"FA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Vanilla Bean Ice Cream","flavor_id":"186","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Fuji","flavor_id":"506","vendor":"FA","millipercent":2000}],"reviews":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"36725","name":"Applescotch"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
