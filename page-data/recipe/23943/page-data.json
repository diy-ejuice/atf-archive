I wanted a little more Nilla wafer than his original recipe tasted to me. This is a very flavorful mix with loads of banana pudding taste.

Nice and full mouth feel but at the same time light enough on the palette that I didn't even realise I kept vaping this and only this for 3 days since I mixed it. Definitely a regular mix for me now. Thanks a million for sharing this one. ","score":5},{"user":"bjorama","text":"Nice and tasty","score":4},{"user":"ObiWanCannoli","text":"Finally decided to bite the bullet and give this a try. Banana is far from my first choice of fruit but the pudding/wafer intrigued me so I figured what the hell. Turned out very nice actually. I actually love eating banana pudding and was hoping for that obvious pudding flavor but it's more like a rich banana cream. The wafer part worked out very nicely, and is well balanced with the banana cream. I may have to try this again but will add 1-2% of vanilla pudding(flv) in hopes of achieving that authentic banana pudding flavor. All in all this is a great recipe and worth a mix whether you love banana vapes or not.","score":5},{"user":"bhamcatmaybe","text":"i love this recipe. i chose to split the banana cream percentage with half banana nut bread because i feel like those two tpa flavors work well together to create a less runty version of banana for me. either way, i opted to use this recipe instead of vurve's because i liked the heavier emphasis on the nilla wafer- it hits the profile for sure, like the sort of soggy (in a lovely way) nilla wafers at the bottom of casserole dish layered style banana pudding that's been sitting in the fridge over night. delicious.
