Paw paw is said to share similarities so I chose to use that instead. \r\nMB Pineapple Lassi is an amazing yoghurt with a fairly good pineapple but it needed some help, so I used the VT and INW. \r\nThe VT Paw Paw is quite high at 3.75%. But I needed to push it that high to get it to come through over everything else. \r\nVT Yoghurt Drink adds to the yoghurt as well as having a citrus note which brightens the fruit. It also sweetens the mix. \r\nCAP Creamy Yogurt gives the yoghurt more creaminess and yoghurty tang. \r\nCan definitely SNV- maybe give it a few hours minimum though. Improves with a few days steep.","steep_days":"3 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T00:08:38.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"990","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Pineapple Lassi","flavor_id":"10397","vendor":"MB","millipercent":4750},{"name":"Paw Paw","flavor_id":"8936","vendor":"VT","millipercent":3750},{"name":"Pineapple","flavor_id":"809","vendor":"INW","millipercent":1750},{"name":"Sugarloaf Pineapple","flavor_id":"8978","vendor":"VT","millipercent":1750},{"name":"Yoghurt Drink","flavor_id":"9901","vendor":"VT","millipercent":700},{"name":"Creamy Yogurt","flavor_id":"5","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1000}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"184123","name":"Pineapple and Paw Paw Yoghurt #mixinvixens"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
