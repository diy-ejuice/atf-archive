The Bubblegum one. \r\n\r\nPLEASE NOTE! \r\nThe Bubblegum is not TPA, its Clyrolinx, a South African concentrate. \r\n\r\n\r\nClyrolinx Bubblegum is the secret ingredient here. Unfortunately its an South African concentrate. But im sure they'll ship outside SA.\r\nIf u ever had an Wicks Chappie/Bubblegum, that's exactly what Clyrolinx Bubblegum taste like. \r\n\r\nLet it steep for 10 days so the bubblegum calms down and the creams kick in\r\n","steep_days":"14","temperature":"0","recipe_score":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-12T10:14:56.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"3575","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Cream Milky Undertone PG","flavor_id":"6539","vendor":"OOO","millipercent":500},{"name":"Dairy/Milk","flavor_id":"2164","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Malted Milk (conc)","flavor_id":"175","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":750},{"name":"Meringue","flavor_id":"530","vendor":"FA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Vanilla Bean Ice Cream","flavor_id":"4","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":500},{"name":"Bubblegum","flavor_id":"315","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1900},{"name":"Super Sweet","flavor_id":"2384","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":500},{"name":"WS-23","flavor_id":"8085","vendor":"OTHR","millipercent":500}],"reviews":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"80969","name":"Milky Blue Way"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
