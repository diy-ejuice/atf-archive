This pairing is more cigarette-ish than cigar-ish.\r\n\r\nINW Natural Miint @ 1.25% I did not want to use menthol. I just cannot stand it anymore. But at the same time I wanted some flavor other than \"cold\"\r\nWS-23 because it is cold AF and boosts natural mint.\r\n\r\nI am releasing this now and will update on the steep. Honestly I can see maybe manipulating the tobaccos a little bit but I really like the cold/mint aspect of this.\r\n\r\nP.S. Dont be scared of the ash statement. I love tobaccos and hate ash, if that makes sense, and this is great.\r\n\r\nP.S.S Drop the Natural Mint by half or down to your liking if you are scared.\r\n\r\nP.S.S.S. Drop the Natural mint to .25 and add 1.25 of INW Shisha Vanilla. \r\n\r\nUpdate! I am a maniac and love INW Natural Mint at 2.5% as a vape. Not everyone will, this recipe is high on mint. If you are not a serious mint lover you probs want to drop the natural mint AND the Kentucky blend to a level you think is sane. Dropping the natural mint alone will leave it too ashy. This is realy good woth both of those halved but I still like this version more.","steep_days":"1 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:49:33.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"3316","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Cured Tobacco","flavor_id":"630","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Kentucky Blend","flavor_id":"4362","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Natural Mint","flavor_id":"856","vendor":"INW","millipercent":1250},{"name":"WS-23","flavor_id":"8085","vendor":"OTHR","millipercent":500}],"reviews":[{"user":"Slushy","text":"A fucking coincidence or did you peek in my steep cabinet  I have been chasing this flavor for some time my first commercial juice I purchased was by Indigo vapes \"Anolog Ice\" a perfect tobacco minty menthol juice.
