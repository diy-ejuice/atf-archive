It’s too bad us menthol users are in the minority because this should have more ratings. I was worried at first the spearmint would be too forward as I’m not a huge spearmint fan. It’s not. This balances perfectly. Mixed up at 80/20 it’s nice and smooth has a nice mouth feel. I thought it was going to need marshmallow or something and it just doesn’t. I may try a drop of shisha vanilla next time for fun"}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"143350","name":"Leaf Candy "}}}
