It hits more of the sweet boozy cream notes and less of the nutty ones yet still has the bite from the RY4.\r\n\r\nCreamy, thick, eggy, with a subtle boozy and nutty back note. I mixed this up as kind of a play off of PRY4U and Castle Long Reserve but it is really it's own animal entirely. \r\n\r\nLet me say this... I feel this is my best work to date. I really hope some of you mix it up!!!! \r\nENJOY... I have missed being an active part of the community. Much Love\r\n \r\nVCV1- Obviously the backbone of this operation offering thickness and vanilla to the body.\r\n\r\nRY4D- This blends in with the VCV1 adding caramel and earthiness.\r\n\r\nKentucky Bourbon- This one spices up the joint and adds complexity to the cream.\r\n\r\nCreamy Hazelnut- This adds the nuttiness which lends itself well to the RY4D.\r\n\r\nGraham Cracker Clear- I scrapped the CAP Graham Cracker V2 because there was too much cinnamon still. 2% graham clear to me, adds the perfect amount of bakery to balance within this recipe.\r\n\r\nSuper sweet- I feel it needed a touch of sweetness to pull out the caramel but, by all means, adjust according to taste. i dont like many sweet liquids but i like this one very sweet.\r\n\r\nFor me this is vapable after a day because i like the taste of the Bourbon and I always have a VCV1 bas premixed and steeped but everything seems to settle at the week point. The custard pops, the RY4 caramel shines, the bourbon settles, and the bakery note climbs in. You can try it after a few days but give it at least 7-10 before really giving it a go. Thanks Guys!\r\n\r\nI have been working on a version with a tiny coconut note as well but haven't gotten it sorted yet. I may ned to order a few new flavorings as my FLV Coconut/FA Coconut combo didn't impress me.","steep_days":"10","temperature":"0","recipe_score":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-11T14:16:18.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"2401","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Vanilla Custard","flavor_id":"131","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":6000},{"name":"Ry4 Double","flavor_id":"379","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Kentucky Bourbon","flavor_id":"361","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Creamy Hazelnut","flavor_id":"1265","vendor":"FW","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Super Sweet","flavor_id":"2384","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":750},{"name":"Graham Cracker Clear","flavor_id":"325","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2000}],"reviews":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"64606","name":"HADOUKEN MASTER"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
