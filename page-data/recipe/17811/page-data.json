It's something different that I haven't come across and encompasses the feeling of fall. \r\n\r\nThe Cheesecake base here is taken directly from ENYAWREKLAW's \"The Real\" recipe because he nailed that, so why reinvent? So that's where the NY Cheesecake, and Sweet Cream come in along with the Super Sweet (If using TFA Sweetener double the amount). \r\n\r\nMixed in this base I layered in the Pumpkin Spice and Cinnamon Danish Swirl. The Cinnamon adds just a dash of extra spice to help that Pumpkin Spice come out ever so slightly. I did not want to overpower the Cheesecake. \r\n\r\nThe Milk Chocolate and Graham Cracker Clear are used to replicate a somewhat chocolate cookie crumb layer underneath that Cheesecake and works really well. \r\n\r\nTo top it off, the Cream Whipped, just a touch. \r\n\r\nMixed at 70/30.","steep_days":"3 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T11:43:12.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"1309","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Pumpkin Spice","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":750},{"name":"Milk Chocolate","vendor":"INW","millipercent":2000},{"name":"New York Cheesecake","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":6000},{"name":"Sweet Cream","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Cream Whipped","vendor":"FA","millipercent":750},{"name":"Graham Cracker Clear","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Super Sweet","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":750},{"name":"Cinnamon Danish Swirl","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":400}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"17811","name":"Pumpkin Spice Chocolate Cheesecake "}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
