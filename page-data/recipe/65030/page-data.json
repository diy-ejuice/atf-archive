This recipe is not intended to be super heavy on the fruit notes, they are more of an accompaniment to the tobacco flavor. \r\n\r\nAdding a little extra pear with the complimentary flavors of apricot and white peach, this is a lightly sweet fruity tobacco with a bit of menthol. It's a nice change from heavier caramel dessert tobaccos. \r\n\r\nI have no issues with this as a shake and vape, but the flavors do come out more after at least a 3 day steep, and the tobacco blooms at 2 weeks, giving this a darker green earthy note after the full steep which is equally as good as fresh, just slightly different. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nphoto credit: www.tomlight.pl <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/63763185@N04/36608849466\">Krajobraz deszczem malowany</a> via <a href=\"http://photopin.com\">photopin</a> <a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/2.0/\">(license)</a>","steep_days":"3 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-10T14:52:16.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"1923","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Storm","flavor_id":"403","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1750},{"name":"Peach White","flavor_id":"543","vendor":"FA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Armenia (apricot)","flavor_id":"507","vendor":"FA","millipercent":750},{"name":"Apricot","flavor_id":"8549","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":450},{"name":"Aroma Arctic Winter (menthol Artic)","flavor_id":"514","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Pear","flavor_id":"411","vendor":"FA","millipercent":750}],"reviews":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"65030","name":"Stormy Weather"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
