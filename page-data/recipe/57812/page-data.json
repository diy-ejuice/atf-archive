If you haven't tried that recipe, you should. It's fantastic and a recipe I always go back to! This was one of the easiest all FLV recipes for me. Their tropical flavors are some of the best and this recipe just fell into place. The guanabana in this smoothie is rather subtle, but it blends into the creams and yogurt very well. I get more pineapple and coconut than anything else.\r\n\r\n Give this at least 7 days. The cream and coconut will blend with the yogurt and soften some of the sharpness. Once that happens, the Guanabana and other fruit pulls to the front, leaving you with a nice creamy exhale\r\n\r\n**Guanabana** - This flavor is and has been one of my favorites for the last year. So much going on. You get a cross between mango and pineapple with an almost banana cream back note. I needed to use this a bit higher to cut through the cream and yogurt.\r\n\r\n**Soursop** - Soursop brings some of the same qualities as guanabana but is a touch darker/ muskier with hints of coconut. There is also some tartness that kind of reminds me of a Granny Smith apple.\r\n\r\n**Greek Yogurt** - This is obviously the yogurt part. I know this isn't everybody's cup of tea. But, when used properly, you can bring out a very deep creaminess with just a touch of that \"twang\" to know this is a yogurt.\r\n\r\n**Pineapple** - I added this just to give a touch more tropical feel to the overall profile. I get a sweet pineapple juice from this one. But it has very deep and darker feel, that seems to play well with creams.\r\n\r\n**Cream** - This is here to help the Greek Yogurt from becoming too sour and bring this into more of a smoothie. It's a very neutral cream that is adding a lot of the texture.\r\n\r\n**Coconut** - One of the best coconut flavors on the market. This is not only adding a touch of coconut, but also adding to the overall creaminess/ mouthfeel. It's super strong! I used it at about 1 drop per 20ml.\r\n\r\n**Sweetness** - Reading the label of this smoothie drink, it says they use Stevia leafs as the sweetening agent. FLV Sweetness is made with Stevia. So this was an obvious choice. This seems to get sweeter the longer you let it steep. This has been my go-to sweetener lately. Not only do I think it plays better with creamy vapes, it also won't gunk your coils.\r\n\r\n*Optional* - Maybe the idea of a warm yogurt vape doesn't appeal to you. Try adding .5% FLV Ice or the cooling agent of your choice.","steep_days":"7","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"total_reviews":1,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:49:31.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"2853","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Guanabana","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Greek Yogurt","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Soursop","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":500},{"name":"Pineapple","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":500},{"name":"Sweetness","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":500},{"name":"Cream","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":750},{"name":"Coconut","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":150}],"reviews":[{"user":"Deejay_mills","score":"5","text":"First off i am honored you would take inspiration from a recipe of mine! By now we both understand eachothers love for the flv tropicals.&#xD;\nVery well balanced recipe, if you asked me to pick out what was in it just by taste i would not be able to. I know these flavors well but here they just mend so good together. I do understand what these flavors are doing to eachother even though nothing pops out too much in my face. &#xD;\nFlv greek yogurt can get weird and too tangy for me sometimes, here it adds just the right amount of tang or \"twang\". &#xD;\nDef a great mix, as per your recommendation i added a touch of fa polar blast just so the yogurt wouldnt get too weird for me.&#xD;\nGreat job jbird!"}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"57812","name":"Tropic Twang"}}}
