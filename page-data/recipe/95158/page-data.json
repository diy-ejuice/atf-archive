IMHO it is a candy orange but has an almost effervescent quality to it (ALMOST). I'm just getting into Orange vapes so my stockpile of flavors is limited. This is the most candy-like orange I have and it works pretty well here.\r\nFA Orange gets a bad rap but it's very realistic which seemed to balance out the VT mandarin's syrupy taste plus it's strong enough to show up @ 1%.\r\nLB Vanilla Ice Cream was a no brainer for me since I don't get pepper from it and it works well @ 3%. \r\nI didn't use sweetener because VT mandarin is very sweet already but it's DIY so if you like it sweeter then go for it.\r\nEnjoy","steep_days":"5","temperature":"0","recipe_score":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-11T15:02:42.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"3267","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Mandarin","flavor_id":"8923","vendor":"VT","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Orange","flavor_id":"500","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Vanilla Ice Cream","flavor_id":"1511","vendor":"LB","millipercent":3000}],"reviews":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"95158","name":"1-2-3 Orange Ice Cream"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
