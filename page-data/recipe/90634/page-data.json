Super easy at 1% FA Walnut and 1% FLV Classic Cigarette. First 5-6 days the walnut is the major player here but its a moist mouthful feel. after a week the ash from the classic cigarette peeks through and start to mingle with the walnut. The walnut eases n smooths the transition between the 2 flavors.\r\n\r\nCan be a SnV if you want that walnut dominance but if you wait a week or 2 then it gets alot better overall","steep_days":"10","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"updated_at":"2020-12-12T11:51:41.000-05:00","best_vg":"85%","views":"2030","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Classic Cigarette","flavor_id":"4358","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Walnut","flavor_id":"536","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000}],"reviews":[{"user":"ID10-T","text":"This is aptly named! I don’t even like Classic Cigarette - which tastes like chewing on a partially smoked cigarette - but this mixer has found the perfect complement to it, like these flavors were made for each other. Nutty and sharp, subtly sweet yet dirty and a little smoky, very moist but not soggy, thick and flavorful with just 2% flavor. It’s not one of those “tobacco recipes for people who don’t like tobacco,” but for people who do really like tobacco, I think it’s a must-try. This might be my new favorite vape for pairing with extra nicotine, hard drinking, and mornings after.
