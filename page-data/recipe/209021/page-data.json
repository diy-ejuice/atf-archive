(if its too much for your taste use 0.75%)\r\n","steep_days":"10 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T20:33:35.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"388","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Bavarian Cream","vendor":"JF","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Marshmallow","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":6000},{"name":"Vanilla Custard","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":5000},{"name":"Rice Crunchies","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":6000},{"name":"Meringue","vendor":"FA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Super Sweet","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1000}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"209021","name":"Krispy Treats"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
