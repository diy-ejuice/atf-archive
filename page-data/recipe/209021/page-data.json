(if its too much for your taste use 0.75%)\r\n","steep_days":"10 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-12T15:41:18.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"419","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Bavarian Cream","flavor_id":"4466","vendor":"JF","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Marshmallow","flavor_id":"332","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":6000},{"name":"Vanilla Custard","flavor_id":"188","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":5000},{"name":"Rice Crunchies","flavor_id":"142","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":6000},{"name":"Meringue","flavor_id":"530","vendor":"FA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Super Sweet","flavor_id":"2384","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1000}],"reviews":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"209021","name":"Krispy Treats"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
