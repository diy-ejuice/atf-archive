The Cream Fresh provides the dairy notes and the FLV cream helps create a thicker body.\r\nCAP Vanilla Whipped Cream: adds a light fluff and vanilla to the dairy body without compromising overall vape density.\r\nFA Meringue: more dairy, sweetness and creaminess in a S&C... is it a bad thing?\r\nFLV Sweetness: obviously optional but I find it best used low in this mix.\r\n\r\nSteep & Enjoy.","steep_days":"3","temperature":"0","recipe_score":4,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:50:41.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"1135","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Red Touch (strawberry)","flavor_id":"421","vendor":"FA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Juicy Strawberry","flavor_id":"8779","vendor":"FA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Strawberry (ripe)","flavor_id":"271","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Cream Fresh","flavor_id":"540","vendor":"FA","millipercent":750},{"name":"Cream","flavor_id":"604","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":750},{"name":"Vanilla Whipped Cream","flavor_id":"1","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Meringue","flavor_id":"530","vendor":"FA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Sweetness","flavor_id":"4413","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":250}],"reviews":[{"user":"cincinnatiking","text":"This was a good S&amp;C. I let it steep for over a month. The strawberry is a little light for my taste, which I expected, but it is a lot brighter than I thought. I can taste the strawberry for sure with a very thick cream base. The creams are layered very nicely. I might bump up the juicy and red touch a bit. Overall it's really good!"}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"135900","name":"[FragoLat]"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
