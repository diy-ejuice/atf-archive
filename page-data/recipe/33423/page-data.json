It has a lot of ingredients but trust me it works.  Give it a try and let me know what you think you won't be disappointed. This recipe is good after a shake but really  comes alive after a 5 day steep and to be honest it gets better and better every day it steeps. \r\n\r\nFLAVOR NOTES:\r\nLemon Sicily and lime tahity cold press both made flavor art make up my lemon flavor of the lemon meringue filling of the cannoli. Of coarse i need some  MERINGUE by FLavor Art this adds a creamy sugary sweetness to the mix.  Well then I have the flavorss that make up the creamy cannoli center. I used a combination of New York cheesecake and vanilla custard by capella i add a small amount of vienna cream by flavor  art it helps pull the new York  cheesecake  and vanilla custard together. I also add in custard by flavor art I added this to the mix to help with the lemon flavor and the cream part because it has notes of both in it. It is a different custard that doesn't work in many situations but it works great in lemon  flavors. To be honest I added the Nonna cake at a very small .25% more for mouth feel than to help the outer cannoli wrap. So i guess that brings me to the outer wrap of the cannoli i do this by using Inawera  Biscuit and  Flavor art Cookie both at .5 % . Well that's it$$$$$$ LET ME KNOW WHAT YOU THINK!!!!! I HOPE YOU ENJOY! !!! LOTS OF FLAVORS THAT WORK ","steep_days":"5 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T14:12:11.000-05:00","best_vg":"75%","views":"3174","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Meringue","flavor_id":"530","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Lemon Sicily","flavor_id":"524","vendor":"FA","millipercent":3500},{"name":"Lime Tahity Cold Pressed","flavor_id":"581","vendor":"FA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Custard","flavor_id":"484","vendor":"FA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Cookie","flavor_id":"490","vendor":"FA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Biscuit","flavor_id":"642","vendor":"INW","millipercent":500},{"name":"New York Cheesecake","flavor_id":"90","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Vanilla Custard","flavor_id":"131","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Vienna Cream","flavor_id":"516","vendor":"FA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Nonna's Cake","flavor_id":"2173","vendor":"FA","millipercent":250}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"33423","name":"Lemon meringue cannoli"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
