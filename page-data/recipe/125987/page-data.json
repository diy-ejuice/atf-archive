( simple with  only 3 ingredients) \r\n\r\n What you get a sweet thick vanilla cream on the inhale and full on   pumpkin spice on the exhale from a  simple mix.\r\nThis  works well in a RTA/ Subohm   and  made for the pumpkin spice lovers out there.  This will not be for everyone, but if you like full  sweet spice flavor this is  for you .  \r\nIt does not  really need sweetener, but I like it sweet and added    FLV sweetness at 0.3% \r\n\r\n\r\nLearn more about mixing here:\r\nfacebook - https://www.facebook.com/groups/diydownunder/\r\nDiscord - https://discord.gg/kH4Fqbc\r\nYoutube - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCTCwb7ULyfJALQlehomZZQA\r\nwebsite  - https://www.diydownunder.com/","steep_days":"5 (SNV)","temperature":"70","recipe_score":3,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T17:35:18.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"1039","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Pumpkin Pie","vendor":"LB","millipercent":12000},{"name":"French Vanilla Icecream","vendor":"HS","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Vanilla Ice Cream","vendor":"LB","millipercent":4000}],"reviews":[{"user":"Ebc88","text":"My First time mixing with LB Pumpkin and i guess it is just not for me.
