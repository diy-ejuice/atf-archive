The combination of 5 blueberry flavorings at these percentages is the perfect mix - FA Bilberry for earthy note, FW Blueberry, & TFA Blueberry Extra for dark, syrupy depth; and CAP Blueberry Jam & TFA Blueberry Candy for brighter notes & to fill out body.  The Bavarian Cream / Marshmallow give the fluffy, light & smooth feel.  The Meringue & Sweet Cream boost the sugary sweetness & mouth feel to nice combo.  All 9 flavors blend very well.  Shake & Vape is interesting, but 7 day steep allows all the blueberries to meld & the creams to fully come out to play.  Mix 70/30 VG/PG   Enjoy!!
