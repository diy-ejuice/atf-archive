Been hearing you gloat on these flavors for a few weeks. Had to mix it up. WOW. Simple and super flavorful.  Lime blends great with the lime back notes in Yoghurt Drink.  Just refreshing and creamy. ADV Im thinking and this is on the shake which Im sure is fine.  Now we'll see if the lime stands up after a couple weeks.  THANKS!"},{"user":"UnappreciatedRobot","score":"5","text":"3 flavor masterpiece!"},{"user":"Ebc88","score":"5","text":"Super simple and super tasty. Wife really enjoyed the room note this left.

You can never go wrong with VT Shisha Lime and this recipe is a prime example of how great it is! "},{"user":"Kittybit","score":"5","text":"This is some serious good stuff. I was scared, that the lime would completely overtake everything, but it didn't. 6% Yoghurt drink might seem high, but it suits the lime so very well.
