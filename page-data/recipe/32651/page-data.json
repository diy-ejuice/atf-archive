Which is a great waffle flavor, but not a Pretentious Pancake AKA Belgian Waffle.\r\n\r\nSummer is coming and here in the Hillcountry of Texas there will be Tarts and Pies galore.\r\n\r\nLB BW and CAP Sugar Cookie form the base for the thicker tart shell, the ones that are halfway between pie crust and cookie or dense cake.\r\n\r\nFW Butterscotch Ripple/TPA Whipped Cream and FA Meringue makes the thin layer of cream/custard/pudding under the fruits.\r\n\r\nApricot Fuji and Forest fruit makes the nice blend of fruits on top. Balanced for the main notes to be berries with Apricot peaking through, a hint of apple but mainly there for depth, sweet and flesh.\r\n\r\nI used Butterscotch Ripple in this to mask some of the notes in LB Waffle but they still poke through here and there, in a nice way ;)\r\n\r\nIMO Fantastic as a Shake n Vape but really starts to shine around 7 days.
