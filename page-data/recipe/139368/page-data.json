This Jam is black Berries / blueberries with a hit of Strawberry. Its super gooey and sticky - with a nice round mouthfeel. Not overly sweet - but somewhat sweetish. (Theo's description).  \r\nI took his Mixed Berry Jam and added .25% of  **FLV Boysenberry** for the inside of the pie.  The pie Crust is **FA Graham Crust** and **FA Pastry Zest**.  \r\n","steep_days":"3","temperature":"0","recipe_score":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-10T16:01:13.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"1167","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Berry Blend","flavor_id":"4395","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Shisha Strawberry","flavor_id":"1711","vendor":"INW","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Strawberry Sweet","flavor_id":"4745","vendor":"JF","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Boysenberry","flavor_id":"614","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":250},{"name":"Graham Crust","flavor_id":"9954","vendor":"FA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Pastry Zest","flavor_id":"8562","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":500}],"reviews":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"139368","name":"Glam Jam Pie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
