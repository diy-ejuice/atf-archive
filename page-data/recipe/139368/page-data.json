This Jam is black Berries / blueberries with a hit of Strawberry. Its super gooey and sticky - with a nice round mouthfeel. Not overly sweet - but somewhat sweetish. (Theo's description).  \r\nI took his Mixed Berry Jam and added .25% of  **FLV Boysenberry** for the inside of the pie.  The pie Crust is **FA Graham Crust** and **FA Pastry Zest**.  \r\n","steep_days":"3","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-01T02:15:35.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"1159","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Berry Blend","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Shisha Strawberry","vendor":"INW","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Strawberry Sweet","vendor":"JF","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Boysenberry","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":250},{"name":"Graham Crust","vendor":"FA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Pastry Zest","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":500}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"139368","name":"Glam Jam Pie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
