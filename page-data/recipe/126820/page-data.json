It doesn’t taste like banana nut pudding in the sense of a pudding with banana and nuts, like the picture. It is more like a banana bread bread pudding - a bread pudding made with banana bread. Which, of course, is pretty tasty. But there are a ton of bready bakery notes in there between the Banana Nut Bread and the Pudding Base. It also left me wanting just a little more banana flavor, like a banana nut bread bread pudding served with a few banana slices on top might taste.
