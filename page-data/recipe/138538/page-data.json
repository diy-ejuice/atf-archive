Its actually a great flavor combo for anyone making teas. Got the idea from ID10T off Noted if i remember right. This combo gives good body to the vape, not being to thin. \r\nLemonade LA and Lemonade FW are my favorite lemonade combo right now. Lemonade LA is the power house that brings a tart/sour lemonade and Lemonade FW brings in more flavor closer to the lemonade I like.\r\nWanted a authentic peach so I went with Peach INW and Peach FLV, together they create a sweet peach syrup like a store bought peach tea.\r\nSweeten and add your cooling agent of choice, but I like this were i placed everything\r\nShake n Vape Certified.\r\nTested in Kayfun 5, 20 watts.","steep_days":"1 (SNV)","temperature":"430","recipe_score":0,"total_reviews":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T17:35:29.000-05:00","best_vg":"50%","views":"2101","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Sweet Tea","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":10000},{"name":"Black tea","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":750},{"name":"Lemonade","vendor":"LA","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Lemonade","vendor":"FW","millipercent":3500},{"name":"Peach","vendor":"INW","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Peach","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Polar Blast","vendor":"FA","millipercent":500},{"name":"WS-23","vendor":"OTHR","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Super Sweet","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1000}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"138538","name":"Peach Sweet Tea Lemonade MTL / POD"}}}
