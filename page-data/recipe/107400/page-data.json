This simple recipe is a remix of the popular beverage by CAWSTON PRESS.\r\nThis recipe is simple and so refreshing especially and a hot summer day. It’s addictive despite its simplicity and I haven’t got bored yet. It was pretty easy to re create especially as its profile is only really 2 flavours so it’s not really difficult to fail. Here below are some quick notes.\r\n\r\nINW Rhubarb \r\nCertainly packs a punch and a little goes a long way. Nothing out there to compete with this flavour it’s perfect for drinks or desserts and here in this recipe it doesn’t overpower if used lightly. 0.25% is perfect here to allow it to sit upfront but not be a nuisance all the way through the vape.\r\n\r\nFA Apple Stark\r\nPerfect Apple for a Apple juice flavour, nothing else to add except it needs help from other apples.\r\n\r\nCAP Double Apple\r\nGreat Apple flavour that’s bright and zesty that doesn’t hide amongst other powerful flavours like the rhubarb. Perfect combo with the Apple stark.\r\n\r\nFA Wine Champagne \r\nThis adds a little fermented eliment to the recipe and melds the rhubarb and apples together alongside adding some mind of suggestion FIZZ!!!\r\n\r\nCAP Super Sweet\r\nA little sweetener takes away some acidity from the recipe.\r\n\r\nWS23\r\nIt’s a drink,it’s summer so let’s chill it down.\r\n\r\nShake n vape recipe but the apples can be a little on the alcohol taste so steep for 3 days if you find the taste that way.\r\n\r\nAdd some gin or vodka by VTA for a boozy summer delight.\r\n\r\nEnjoy","steep_days":"3 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:50:16.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"2711","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Rhubarb (yc)","vendor":"INW","millipercent":500},{"name":"Stark (apple)","vendor":"FA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Double Apple","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Wine Champagne","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Super Sweet","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":500},{"name":"WS-23","vendor":"OTHR","millipercent":1000}],"reviews":[{"user":"orangetree","text":""}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"107400","name":"pressed rhubarb "}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
