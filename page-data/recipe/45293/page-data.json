It was a second revision of the idea, the first one was a little lower on flavorings but I felt it needed to be a little more vibrant in general. The yogurt is not a full on yogurt kind of flavor, for me it adds to the overall tangy notes in the lychee, which turns this into more of a sweet cream thai chai with lychee in it.  I am making another variation with other tropical fruits, but that one is not finished yet.  \r\n\r\nThe FLV Thai Chai and FA Bergamot combo is definitely a flavor mix I foresee making several recipes around. The way these two flavors blend makes a lovely base flavor to layer other flavors over. \r\n\r\n\r\nFor More Mixing Tips and Info Visit my Site and Youtube Channel: \r\nhttp://flavor-pro.com/\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCA6gV-5vxieuG2_TcIKpYCg\r\n","steep_days":"3","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"total_reviews":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-06T14:07:01.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"1590","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Thai Chai","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":280},{"name":"Lychee","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":260},{"name":"Sweet Cream","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":550},{"name":"Sweet Coconut","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":340},{"name":"Greek Yogurt","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":440},{"name":"Bergamot","vendor":"FA","millipercent":600},{"name":"Sweetness","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1080}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"45293","name":"Thai Lychee Tea"}}}
