After working on it for about 1 month this was the final result. This was one of the few recipes created early in my DIY journey and it was a major motivater for me because it tastes exactly like you would expect Apple Pie with Ice Cream to taste like. (ðŸ˜¢sorry about the TFA VBIC manson ðŸ˜¢)  If you like apple and you don't taste pepper when you vape TFA Vanilla Bean Ice Cream I know you will love this. That being said it can be subbed with FW Vanilla Bean Ice Cream and work just as well. I recommend it mixed at Max VG and steep for 8 days. So mix it up, enjoy, comment, and rate it. Happy New Year everyone!!!!!!!

Needs a little crust flavor to it, and maybe some Apple Filling FLV (for my taste).  Over all, I like the flavor.  Can definitely see where this would be enjoyed by many.","score":5},{"user":"Hawger03","text":"Awesome dripper juice.  The only thing I would change to my liking is to add a bit of cinnamon to the mix.  I think the next batch I will add a small amount of Rich Cinnamon and see how it works.","score":4}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"24678","name":"ðŸ˜¤Apple Pie AllahðŸ˜¤"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
