I'm with Slasha in thinking that's just part of using a flavor as bold as maple though, so I won't dock it's rating for that.  Besides, it was pretty damn good still when all I could taste was maple sugar cookie."},{"user":"ID10-T","text":"Excellent combination of flavors and use of Maple Syrup! I just have a couple of nitpicky issues with this one. The high % of FLV Cookie Dough is giving me too much raw dough flavor almost to the point of a maple cookie dough versus a baked cookie. It's both a profile accuracy and a taste thing. I love soft, slightly undercooked cookies but I'm sure this recipe would be better with 4/2 Sugar Cookie/Cookie Dough instead of 3/3. Second, the sucralose, and I know this is highly subjective, but the 0.5% that works in some other recipes is coming across as too much here. It tastes \"tacked on\" rather than the integrated into the juice, so the final impression it leaves is less sugary maple cookie and more maple cookie followed by a half a teaspoon of Splenda. Not sure how much would work better, 0.25%? 0.35%? But less. "},{"user":"CygnusY1","text":""},{"user":"SlashaLO","text":"This was a great maple cookie mix. I very much enjoyed this. Biscuit added that slight bit of buttery goodness that it needs, and cookie dough is just plain amazing. The vanilla pudding added a great texture to this. I found myself going \"numb\" to the mix though after about a day. I think for some reason its the maple. I've noticed in most mixed that use it, i go numb to the whole mix after a day of vaping it. I see no reason to dock the rating at all for that, since that's just me. I really enjoyed this, good job!"}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"58427","name":"Maple Sugar Cookie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
