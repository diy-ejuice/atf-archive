If you done have VCE try subbing no Cap Vanilla Whipped Cream or VT Vanilla Buttercream Frosting. Haven’t tried subbing MC, but Cap NY Cheesecake might work.\r\n\r\nGolden Syrup brings it all together and adds a sticky sweetness like a nice stack of pancakes without the maple flavor. If you don’t have GS you might try OOO Powdered Sugar at 1%. This would make it totally different recipe, but still tasty.\r\n\r\nShisha Strawberry & Red Touch worked best here for me, but you can use any combination of strawberries that may suite you better.\r\n\r\nGood as a shake and vape, but really comes together nicely after a few days.","steep_days":"3 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-05T04:17:20.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"1112","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Red Touch (strawberry)","flavor_id":"421","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Shisha Strawberry","flavor_id":"1711","vendor":"INW","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Cannoli Shell SC","flavor_id":"10114","vendor":"WF","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Crème Brûlée Cookie SC","flavor_id":"10261","vendor":"WF","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Hazelnut","flavor_id":"1312","vendor":"FW","millipercent":500},{"name":"Mascarpone Cream Cheese","flavor_id":"10055","vendor":"WF","millipercent":750},{"name":"Vanilla Cream Extra SC","flavor_id":"8382","vendor":"WF","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Golden Syrup","flavor_id":"8887","vendor":"VT","millipercent":1000}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"160972","name":"Strawberry Mascarpone Cannoli"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
