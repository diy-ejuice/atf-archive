Ripe tropical Jackfruit and Mangosteen up front and Apricot nectar out the back. Add a splash of vanilla cream and a twist of dragon fruit to get everyone feeling friendly and you've got one hellava toe curling vape. Add 3 drops of super sweet per 30ml, it needs it and it creates it, this is supposed to be nectar of the gods, donâ€™t upset your maker.","steep_days":"1 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":4,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:49:33.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"1356","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Jackfruit","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2750},{"name":"Mangosteen","vendor":"FA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Vanilla Swirl","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Cream Fresh","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Dragonfruit","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Armenia (apricot)","vendor":"FA","millipercent":2500}],"reviews":[{"user":"Seef","text":"Nice fruity recipe. Sorry, but I didn't add super sweet :). I don't find mangosteen too strong like ObiWanCannoli. To me the cream fresh and vanilla swirl rounds it out.  "},{"user":"ObiWanCannoli","text":"Toe curling indeed! Mangosteen(FA) is a very strong flavor and completely takes over the mix. I would like to try this again but with maybe 0.5-1% Mangosteen. That aside, I still enjoyed this recipe. Anyone who is a fan of unique flavor profiles would probably enjoy this and moreso with the Mangosteen dropped a few notches to reduce that over the top piney-ness."}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"60702","name":"Jackie Ohh"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
