It’s a nearly Grack-Juice level of weird-but-good. It’s very sweet but also dirty and boozy, smooth but stout.  Full-bodied with a thick creamy feel but no of the usual creamy flavors’ tastes. The creator says it defies the needs for fruits, but countering the toasty nuttiness and boozy brown sugary sweetness I get just a touch of fruity nuance with the lemon from torrone and interacting with the hint musty grape from brandy. What it absolutely does defy for me is the need for a recipe to be a facsimile of some kind of food or drink. It’s a masterpiece of “weird” or abstract mixing. Definitely mix this up for something out of the ordinary that’s as warm and comforting as a big manly bear hug.

I compare everything else to it and really nothing really stands up to the joy I get from this recipe . If it wasn't for Stag Night I would of given up on vaping. Thank you Wiskeyking !!

The only thing I might change is decreasing the Torrone a little bit.","score":5},{"user":"mk0","text":"This is delicious.  It's not like anything i've tried before.  I went through a 15ml that was 7day steeps in a few hours so now the second bigger batch is being made.  Great job!&#xD;\n&#xD;\n*update* this is now in my ADV rotation.  Can't mix enough of it!
