His recipe is a superb custard that I highly suggest you try before mine. Also check out his other recipes too as he creates some lovely simple mixes and has a YouTube channel: \r\n\r\nhttps://alltheflavors.com/recipes/203151#baked_custard_all_day_by_rug_ly\r\n\r\nWith this I simply added the banana cream on top.\r\n\r\nThis is a simple banana and custard...
