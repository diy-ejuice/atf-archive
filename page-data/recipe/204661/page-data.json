His recipe is a superb custard that I highly suggest you try before mine. Also check out his other recipes too as he creates some lovely simple mixes and has a YouTube channel: \r\n\r\nhttps://alltheflavors.com/recipes/203151#baked_custard_all_day_by_rug_ly\r\n\r\nWith this I simply added the banana cream on top.\r\n\r\nThis is a simple banana and custard... Nothing fancy, but delicious.\r\n\r\nHeavier on the custard and light on the banana, which is what I wanted out of this for something mellow but flavourful all day.\r\n\r\nStraight off the shake the sugar cookie stands out but it does settle down after a day and the banana comes through.\r\n\r\nI may alter this slightly in the future with more cream of some kind and less sugar cookie.\r\n\r\nI mix this at 60vg/40pg and use in an Aegis Boost.","steep_days":"1 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T19:16:36.000-05:00","best_vg":"60%","views":"678","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Bavarian Cream","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Marshmallow","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Sugar Cookie","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Vanilla Custard 2","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":5000},{"name":"Super Sweet","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":750},{"name":"Banana Cream","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2500}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"204661","name":"Banan Med Vaniljsås"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
