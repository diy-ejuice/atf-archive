A bit raw a bit cooked, makes the banana closer to the real thing.\r\n\r\nFW Butterscotch Ripple: is my go to as its creamy, easy to use.. was obvious for me to choose this one.\r\n\r\nThe original FRYED on its description says : \" buttery cream\" but i prefered to use CAP Golden Butter to create that Deep Fried Buttery Banana.\r\n\r\nThe spice on WF DFPlantain is a bit non descript so to make it better the profile called for FLV Rich Cinnamon which is awsame, sweet , warm, strong .. its perfect.\r\n\r\nFW Graham Cracker: Bananas get better with graham cracker specially on the exhale,  it just makes them better, and here has a double duty, making bananas better and suporting  the fried, bready texture as well as giving a nice graham cracker after taste.\r\n\r\nYo can SNV it as its pretty tasty but its better when rich cinnamon calms down a bit after 3 days and waaay better after 10 days.","steep_days":"10 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-05T16:44:12.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"1112","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Banana Cream","flavor_id":"210","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":3500},{"name":"Butterscotch Ripple","flavor_id":"1217","vendor":"FW","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Rich Cinnamon","flavor_id":"638","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":50},{"name":"Super Sweet","flavor_id":"2384","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":500},{"name":"Deep Fried Plantain SC","flavor_id":"10108","vendor":"WF","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Graham Cracker","flavor_id":"1297","vendor":"FW","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Golden Butter","flavor_id":"60","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":500},{"name":"Banò (banana)","flavor_id":"501","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"155171","name":"Fryed Bananas & Butterscotch"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
