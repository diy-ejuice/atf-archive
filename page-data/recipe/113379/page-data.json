I know it exists, but I wanted to put a little spin on it. I decided to go with a more natural coconut, not sweeter/creamier coconut to offset how sweet blackcurrant and mango are. This is a simple and low % flavor that tastes great.

The mango comes out clear on top with that dark sweet-tart berry paying off of it. The recipe tastes like it would be lacking a base but that buttery rich coconut gives it a great one to finish on.
