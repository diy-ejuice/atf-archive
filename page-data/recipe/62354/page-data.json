Me neither.\r\n\r\nThis is a dessert tobacco that isn't too sweet. Tobacco Dark Chocolate, TA Cuban Cigar and DNB combine to make a cigar-like tobacco with hints of chocolate. I added the Double Chocolate (clear) to let you really know it has chocolate. I get notes of cocoa powder, Hershey's syrup and regular chocolate. Let me know if this recipe helps you win over the Michelle Pfeiffer in your life.\r\n\r\n","steep_days":"10","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T17:34:20.000-05:00","best_vg":"50%","views":"1176","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Tobacco Dark Chocolate","vendor":"INW","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Tobacco Absolute Cuban Cigar","vendor":"INW","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Tobacco Dirty Neutral (dnb)","vendor":"INW","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Double Chocolate (clear)","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1000}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"62354","name":"Choco Cigar"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
