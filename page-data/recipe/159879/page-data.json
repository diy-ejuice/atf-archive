I always liked cheesecakes and I tried to blend a Cheesecake with a Banoffee. Why not? So the return in Monkey Island is the birth of the Cheese'noffee.

Cheesecake notes and a rich caramel toffee win the game but the banana cream is holding up and works as the foundations of the recipe, alongside with the cookies.
