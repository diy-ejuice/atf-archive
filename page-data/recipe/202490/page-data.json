After 5 days, this is delicious.  **WF Vanilla Ruyan Custard** is Wonder Flavours version of an RY4.  I love this flavor, and with the **WF SC Bourbon Aged Cream**, it is amazing.  For an added deliciousness, I am added some **WF Peach Pie & Cream** with **WF SC Bavarian Cream**.  \r\nThis is nice and creamy, light tobacco, and a delicious peach in the back.  \r\nEnjoy  \r\n\r\ncheck out **https://www.youtube.com/c/OGADIY**\r\nhttps://www.diyflavorchaser.com/tam-vapes\r\n","steep_days":"5","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"total_reviews":1,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:51:41.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"900","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Bourbon Aged Cream SC","vendor":"WF","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Bavarian Cream SC","vendor":"WF","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Peach Pie & Cream","vendor":"WF","millipercent":5000},{"name":"Vanilla Ruyan Custard","vendor":"WF","millipercent":2500}],"reviews":[{"user":"Slushy","score":"5","text":"Ordered the missing flavors for this recipe will definitely back to this it looks...awesome üëå Ok..I'm back this is a wonderful vape extremely smooth and full of flavor a nice change of pace for me and my usual caramel heavy tobacco recipes I usually vape I get the bourbon on the inhale and cream on the exhale I get a beautiful peach with a touch of light leaf tobacco now that being said I don't get any bakery from WF peach pie and cream thats not a bad thing just saying another bakery would bring this recipe over the top overall this is stellar üëå Awesome recipe Tammy ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê"}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"202490","name":"Peach Ruyan"}}}
