After numerous attempts from the community to get a Duchess remix, I finally feel like this is worth releasing to the public. This is a few years in the making and I like to give credit to Method aka Mr. Hardwick for laying the foundation and getting us to this point. \r\n\r\nIn Duchess Reserve the thing that always had me baffled was the cookie aspect, I lowered the butter pecan to .25%, and it’s critical to not overpour because it can take over fast! And added in some graham cracker to round out the cookie notes. \r\n\r\nAlso the cakey aspect, I feel like the cake batter dip combined with tres leches covers that pretty well, and adds some sweetness, cake batter dip may have just been the missing link. I went back and forth with TFA vanilla custard, FW, and Cap VC, to me the Cap version was closer to the original in every aspect. Looking back to the time this eliquid came out, I could easily see them exclusively using FW and just getting the Cap Vanilla Custard from a vendor and buying that one concentrate in bulk. At that time, Cap VC was king and still is to this day. Especially after a good steep. \r\n\r\n\r\nWith that being said I do need to move on from this chase, and I’m happy to do so now since I really do think we’re damn close. Here I present my final version of the Duchess Reserve for #remixmonth.","steep_days":"7","temperature":"400","recipe_score":5,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:49:47.000-05:00","best_vg":"65%","views":"4482","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Butter Pecan","flavor_id":"1212","vendor":"FW","millipercent":250},{"name":"Butterscotch (natural)","flavor_id":"1219","vendor":"FW","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Hazelnut","flavor_id":"1312","vendor":"FW","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Tres Leches","flavor_id":"1446","vendor":"FW","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Graham Cracker","flavor_id":"1297","vendor":"FW","millipercent":750},{"name":"Cake Batter Dip","flavor_id":"1223","vendor":"FW","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Butterscotch","flavor_id":"1216","vendor":"FW","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Super Sweet","flavor_id":"2384","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":250},{"name":"Vanilla Custard","flavor_id":"131","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":3000}],"reviews":[{"user":"VaperKitten","text":"Excellent Mix, I have mixed two batches now and I love it.
