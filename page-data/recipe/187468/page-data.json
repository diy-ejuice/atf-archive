The profile up front is a creamy Pistacio pudding, with a bite of pineapple in the center and a warm nutty aftertaste. \r\n\r\n(The pudding) FLV vanilla pudding + FA cream, no surprises here. I’ve added WF Pistacio cream and TPA pistacio to make it a pistacio pudding. \r\n\r\n(The pineapple) CAP golden pineapple tastes just like canned pineapple, the caveat is that it tends to fade after a steep so I used it pretty high here. If it’s too sharp for you off the or you plan to shake n vape use less. It will decrease after the recommended steep time. \r\n\r\n(The rest) WF roasted pecan and cream is so good, it adds to the creamy texture of the vape and just the right amount of nutty pecan flavor so you know it’s there at the finish. The FA Marshmallow adds just enough of those fluffy little pillows of sugary goodness that every Watergate salad needs. \r\n\r\nI sweeten with 1% FW Sweetness.
