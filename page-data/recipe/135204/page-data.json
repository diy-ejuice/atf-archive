Only had the original commercial juice once but it was unique and inspirational.\r\n\r\nOn day one, a mandarin explosion.  Very enjoyable as is, but the way I preferred it was with a day steep. The mandarin will blend with the cactus and jack fruit. Very juicy and sweet.\r\n\r\nSweeten to taste. \r\n\r\nTested in the Horizon Tech Falcon Tank and entheon.","steep_days":"1 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"total_reviews":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T20:32:53.000-05:00","best_vg":"60%","views":"1830","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Cactus","vendor":"INW","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Jackfruit","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Super Sweet","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":750},{"name":"Mandarin","vendor":"VT","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Tanger (mandarin)","vendor":"FA","millipercent":2000}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"135204","name":"Noms (Cactus, Jack Fruit, Mandarin)Remix"}}}
