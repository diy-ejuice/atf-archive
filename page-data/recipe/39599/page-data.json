Juicy melon and bright, lightly floral hibiscus with a red berry almost Hawaiian Punch light musk to it.  I lose the distinct character of the pear a bit with everything else going on, but it works to sweeten and pull the entire vape together. Super well-balanced and satisfyingly sweet. Personally I'd like a touch less pear, but that only because the rest of the juice is  a bit more interesting... but I definitely enjoy this as it's mixed right now."},{"user":"ID10-T","score":"5","text":"Pleasant vape, sweet and juicy with fun floral top notes. Highly reminiscent of all the Honey Pearry clones and homages, but Hibiscus and Huckleberry make for a more interesting mix than the Honeysuckle and Strawberry that typically goes in those.
