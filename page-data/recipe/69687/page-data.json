Desperate, I went to the \"What Can I Make With My Flavors\" thread on diy_ejuice. ID10-T threw this back at me. It was glorious. Shake and Vapable, and it cut through my dead sinuses. It was even better after a week.\r\n\r\nI'd give it five stars if he'd have posted it, but since he gave me the go ahead, as  \"The truth is, I've never vaped that exact recipe, I just looked over your ingredients and pulled it out of my ass like \"yeah, I bet that will be pretty good.\"\r\n\r\nSeeing as this came out a lightly frosted, sweet lemon cookie that was very cool? His ass must be a more magical place than candyland.","steep_days":"7 (SNV)","temperature":"440","recipe_score":0,"total_reviews":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T17:34:26.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"2111","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Sugar Cookie","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":6000},{"name":"Vanilla Bean Ice Cream","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Italian Lemon Sicily","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":4000},{"name":"WS-23","vendor":"OTHR","millipercent":400}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"69687","name":"Cool Lemon Cookie by ID10-T"}}}
