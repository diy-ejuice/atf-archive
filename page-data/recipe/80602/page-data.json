I wanted to do something with chocolate and I thought about doing a pairing with lime. When I went to draft the recipe I was thinking of my recent tests on FA limes, cold pressed would have been fine and gave me a more natural lime that would go nicely with chocolate. I thought though about distilled, which is far from a natural lime. Distilled reminds me of the green suckers from the dentist office, that very distinct green hard candy that really tastes far from a real lime. So I decided to go for it, see where this would take me. Then I added some coconut and creams to really give more depth to the recipe. After a few revisions this was what I came up with. Enjoy!","steep_days":"14","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T22:32:35.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"1808","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Lava Cake","vendor":"LB","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Coconut Candy","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Coco' (coconut)","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Lime Tahity Distilled","vendor":"FA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Vienna Cream","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Vanilla Whipped Cream","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Chocolate Glazed Doughnut","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":3000}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"80602","name":"Mad Hatter"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
