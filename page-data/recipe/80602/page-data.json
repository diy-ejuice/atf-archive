I wanted to do something with chocolate and I thought about doing a pairing with lime. When I went to draft the recipe I was thinking of my recent tests on FA limes, cold pressed would have been fine and gave me a more natural lime that would go nicely with chocolate. I thought though about distilled, which is far from a natural lime. Distilled reminds me of the green suckers from the dentist office, that very distinct green hard candy that really tastes far from a real lime. So I decided to go for it, see where this would take me. Then I added some coconut and creams to really give more depth to the recipe. After a few revisions this was what I came up with.
