Started thinking about how I could personalize it a little to suit me a little better. Decided I might try a little remix to make it more of a mango pipe tobacco. I happened to be vaping it alongside my Turkish for Pipe, and I decided to do a bit of a mash-up. \r\n\r\nSo this is like a Turkish and Virginia Pipe Blend with some mango on top. \r\n\r\n2 months after I shared this I realized my fat fingers selected the wrong Oriental from the drop down. If you used the normal INW Oriental, you might be ok. If you got the Classic Oriental, my apologies. It should be FLV Oriental.
