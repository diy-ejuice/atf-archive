It propped that blue note up with a vibrant brightness and gave a definite lemon note in the background.  Thinking in terms of some of the water drop flavorings I use, I do enjoy a few of the fruit and lemonade flavors. But the lemon is behind the berry note, not the primary note.  I found fizzy sherbet to do just this. \r\n\r\nThe RF Black Raspberry adds depth to the raspberry part of the Blue Raspberry, while WF Sour Blue raz candy provides a definite blue note and the sourness of it is mild but adds to the lemony note in the recipe. \r\n\r\nYes, there's 1.5% FW sweetener. Yes it's on purpose. No it doesn't mute the recipe in any negative ways. IF you are really against using any sucralose or are like me and can't use it, try a stevia sweetener at about 0.3% and let it steep. It will build in sweetness over time. If you don't want to use any sweetener, try adding in 1% to 3% of FA Juicy Strawberry...you could go as high as 5% with it if you really want sugar lips, but you also have to add a bit extra of the raspberries and just a little bit on the fizzy sherbet. So like up the fruit by 0.5% to 1% and the sherbet up by 0.25% to 0.5%...it should balance out and after a few mls you likely won't taste the strawberry flavor much at all, it will blend in with the rest of the berries and just be sweetness.  But while the strawberry flavor will fade back into the background, it will leave behind sweetness that will require you to clean your coil off and recotton after every 80mls put through a coil. Aside from the chocolates, it's probably the dirtiest coil gunker FA makes (this is however far less gunk than sweetener or or sugary flavorings.) \r\n\r\nIf you like your e-liquid more commercial like, and the sweetener as suggested is not enough, just continue to increase it by 0.5% until the sweetness factor is right for you.  Going much beyond 4% with FW or CAP sweetener or really any sweetener may result in more muting than you'd like, in which case you'd need to turn the flavors of the recipe up to compensate for the muting. \r\n\r\nI have enjoyed this flavor in a pod and an RDA, adjusting the PG/VG according to device (higher pg for pods higher vg for RDAs) \r\n\r\nVisit flavor-pro.com for more great mixing information\r\n","steep_days":"7 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"total_reviews":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T23:37:15.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"2582","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Blue Raz – Super Concentrate","vendor":"RF","millipercent":3500},{"name":"Black Raspberry – Super Concentrate","vendor":"RF","millipercent":750},{"name":"Fizzy Sherbet","vendor":"VT","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Italian Lemon Sicily","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":750},{"name":"Sweetener (sucralose)","vendor":"FW","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Sour Blue Raspberry Candy","vendor":"WF","millipercent":1000},{"name":"WS-23","vendor":"OTHR","millipercent":250}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"133685","name":"Puckered Blue"}}}
