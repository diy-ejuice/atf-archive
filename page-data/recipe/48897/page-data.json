A big thank you to Wayne for his Yeo layer and learning alot about Mangoes from ID10-T.\r\n\r\nHere is the breakdown of the recipe (my 18th version).\r\n\r\n\r\nMango Layer:\r\n- Mango (FLV) - wonderful thick almost syrupy Mango. You need this Mango in your life\r\n- Mango (CAP) - need this ripe Mango to sit on the lower spectrum. \r\n- Mango SC (RF) - delicious nectar like Mango\r\n- Mango (FE) - this is another nectar like Mango that sits as the top note of the Mango. This flavor in combination with Real Flavors Mango is delicious.\r\n\r\n\r\nWayne's Yeo Layer:\r\n- Sweet Rice (FE) - get it now\r\n- Meringue (TFA)\r\n- Vanilla Swirl (TFA)\r\n\r\n\r\nCoconut Layer:\r\n- Sweet Coconut (FLV) - absolutely love this Coconut\r\n- Coconut Candy (TFA) - this works so well with Sweet Coconut and completes the Coconut base\r\n\r\n\r\nCream Layer:\r\n- Sweet Cream (CAP) - this is a wonderful cream for this recipe. Not to heavy and just works.\r\n*I tried Cream Fresh (FA) but felt Sweet Cream (CAP) worked better.\r\n\r\n\r\nMango Enhancer:\r\n- Lime Tahiti Cold Pressed (FA)\r\n\r\n\r\nSweetener:\r\n- Honey (FA) - this needs to be used sparingly, but done right, it takes it to another level and adds mouthfeel - optional but highly recommended. 1 drop per 15ml (Original FA bottle)\r\n- Sweetener (TFA) - used not only to add some sweetness but also the Ethyl Maltol to enhance the Mango\r\n\r\n\r\nMix it up and enjoy. I mix this at 60 to 70 VG and is shake and vape approved. Give it 3 to 5 days for the cream and coconut to come out. As always, feedback is truthfully wanted. This was a very difficult recipe to balance and get to the point of feeling it was ready to share with the community.\r\n\r\n*My preferred way to vape this is in a Kayfun V5 or my other various RTA's.
