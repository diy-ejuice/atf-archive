We all love cap vanilla custard just can't say enough great things about this flavoring with the addition of Bavarian cream it becomes thicker and richer. Then we add banana cream into the mix and you have a great banana custard. That really highlights the banana. Out of all of the basket ingredients I found this the most difficult highlight I had several great recipes but it seemed like and all my other vitense the banana was drowned out. That's why I went with this recipe the banana comes through and is delicious.\r\n\r\nMy accent flavorings are sugar cookies and Dulce de leche \r\n\r\nThe sugar cookie just completes the custard I love using cap sugar cookie and all of my custard recipes. It complements the vanilla nicely and gives you a light sweet Bakery note. \r\n\r\nDulce de leche is one of my new favorite flavorings and it does so much air helps sweeten up the banana Bridges the gap between the custard and banana adds to the density of the recipe and accents the tobacco. Unshaken babe I couldn't really tell that this ingredient was doing much but after one week of steeping it definitely stands out on the Excel you can really taste that delicious creamy caramel at the end of the vape. I was worried I was wasting an ingredient here but was happy I stuck with this flavoring it not only complements the tobacco but brings a delicious caramel note to the entire vape\r\n\r\nSoho\r\n\r\nThis flavor is amazing giving this banana custard a complexity I didn't think was possible. Adding earthy nutty notes to the flavoring making it much more interesting. I have to thank you for forcing my hand into the world of tobaccos. And after repairing this flavoring with pretty much my whole collection of tobaccos I have to say fuck you guys for picking the weirdest tobacco in the world. This was definitely the challenge. \r\n\r\nI know that Charlie Noble has a banana Custard with an RY4 kicker I can't say I've ever had the pleasure of vaping it and was not my intent to clone that recipe. This one is just so delicious it stands out against all my other attempts with these crazy basket ingredients. I don't feel but I went the safe route and hopefully you enjoy this recipe as much as I do it has been my ATV for almost a solid week now and I need to mix up more.\r\n\r\nNot only is this recipe delicious but I picked this one because I felt that it highlighted all the basket ingredients you get cream you get banana and you get that delicious Soho.","steep_days":"7","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-06T20:41:50.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"5865","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Soho","flavor_id":"413","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Banana Cream","flavor_id":"210","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Bavarian Cream","flavor_id":"4466","vendor":"JF","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Sugar Cookie","flavor_id":"115","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Vanilla Custard","flavor_id":"131","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":5000},{"name":"Dulce De Leche","flavor_id":"4575","vendor":"JF","millipercent":3000}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"21433","name":"Banana caramel custard"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
