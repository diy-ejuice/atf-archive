It's just a rejiggle of his fantastic recipe with a lil influence from @BigCloud... Hope y'all like it... It's no SnV. But after I tried it today @ day ten I think it's on its way to being a winner! If you mix it let me know what you think... And always, STAY SAFE & more importantly... KEEP MIXING!!ðŸ‘ŠðŸ˜Š","steep_days":"10","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"total_reviews":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-06T23:08:39.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"810","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Strawberry (ripe)","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Cinnamon Crunch","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Breakfast Cereals","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Custard Premium","vendor":"FA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Toasted Marshmallow","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Meringue","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Bavarian Cream","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Vanilla Ice Cream","vendor":"LB","millipercent":6000},{"name":"Toasted Almond","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":500},{"name":"Super Sweet","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":500},{"name":"Sugar Cookie","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":3000}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"189538","name":"Fried Ice Cream "}}}
