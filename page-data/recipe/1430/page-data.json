Has some off-notes. Very very close though. The cream is on point."},{"user":"NikosD","text":"I'm probably the weird guy here, especially given that I really enjoy orange vapes, but I don't like this :| I find this taste really on the \"chemical\" side. I tried it both as SNV and after one week."},{"user":"ParkusMaximusIII","text":"One of the only orange vapes that I really enjoy. A little harsh (possibly due to FW Blood Orange??) but the flavor is too damn good for me to not give this 5 stars. "},{"user":"OldAgeVaper","text":"best orange vape to date ! its now in rotation 5 stars."},{"user":"lolwtf","text":"All of Vurve's recipes are legit AF, no exception here.  I personally have a hard time chain vaping strong fruit flavors, so I wanted to mention here that if I were making this again, I would probably drop the Blood Orange/Orange Cream/Tangerine percentages down a little.  That is a personal preference thing only, though, because this recipe tastes like the real deal. "},{"user":"BradH","text":"This is fantastic. I can tell you put some serious work into it, and it paid off big time! It's a really great recipe."},{"user":"tw2k","text":""},{"user":"altneurose","text":""},{"user":"TheDrStore","text":"This stuff is amazing. Part of my rotation now. Great job!"},{"user":"hyperlite310","text":"Spot on Dreamsicle! Left out the Koolada and subbed VBIC for FW VBIC (pepperitis) and it's absolutely fantastic! When I took my first vape of this I could truly tell the amount of time and effort it took to prefect this! Absolute perfection my friend!"},{"user":"Bogey_Again","text":""},{"user":"Crazyndalazdayz","text":""},{"user":"itsnara","text":"Refreshing but creamy at the same time - great job."},{"user":"Dalpho","text":"Vurve this juice is wonderful!  I used double koolada because Im a koolada junkie and I'll definitely add this to my rotation.  Thanks for creating this awesome juice. "},{"user":"Chrisdvr1","text":""},{"user":"Trevorxgage","text":"Fantastic recipe. By far the best orange cream I've had. Great as a S&amp;V but a steep really does meld everything together."},{"user":"CriticalVape","text":"This is an excellent stab at the O/C. Great balance, great flavors. Gets creamier over time, of course. The CAP Sweet Tangerine does make the recipe imo. This is a keeper. Thanks for sharing."},{"user":"crisk","text":"This is amazing.
