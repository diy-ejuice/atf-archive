Has some off-notes. Very very close though. The cream is on point.","score":4},{"user":"NikosD","text":"I'm probably the weird guy here, especially given that I really enjoy orange vapes, but I don't like this :| I find this taste really on the \"chemical\" side. I tried it both as SNV and after one week.","score":3},{"user":"ParkusMaximusIII","text":"One of the only orange vapes that I really enjoy. A little harsh (possibly due to FW Blood Orange??) but the flavor is too damn good for me to not give this 5 stars.

I personally have a hard time chain vaping strong fruit flavors, so I wanted to mention here that if I were making this again, I would probably drop the Blood Orange/Orange Cream/Tangerine percentages down a little.  That is a personal preference thing only, though, because this recipe tastes like the real deal. ","score":0},{"user":"BradH","text":"This is fantastic.

When I took my first vape of this I could truly tell the amount of time and effort it took to prefect this!

Great as a S&amp;V but a steep really does meld everything together.","score":5},{"user":"CriticalVape","text":"This is an excellent stab at the O/C. Great balance, great flavors. Gets creamier over time, of course. The CAP Sweet Tangerine does make the recipe imo. This is a keeper. Thanks for sharing.","score":5},{"user":"crisk","text":"This is amazing.
