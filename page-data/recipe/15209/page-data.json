I dropped FA Cream Fresh from the mix as it in addition to the other creams were causing too much muting. I have also opted to replace TFA Rainbow Sherbet w/ FW Rainbow Sherbet, which I've found to be a lot less harsh than TFA's offering. IMO it's just a better flavoring overall. Hope you enjoy should you choose to mix this one up!","steep_days":"0","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-06T20:42:29.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"2765","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Blood Orange","flavor_id":"1197","vendor":"FW","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Vanilla Swirl","flavor_id":"189","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Vanilla Bean Ice Cream","flavor_id":"186","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Lemon Lime","flavor_id":"83","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Rainbow Sherbet","flavor_id":"1390","vendor":"FW","millipercent":5000},{"name":null,"flavor_id":"null","vendor":null,"millipercent":0}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"15209","name":"A Sure-Bet (Orange Sherbet)"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
