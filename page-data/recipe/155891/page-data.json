Took out Shisha Vanilla, added a little biscuit to try to get some breadiness since the LB BW is lacking, and added some FLV PB to prop up the TPA.  The avocado actually works well in here, adding a bit of nuttiness, but none of the green.  Might add some sweetener the next time, or just take up the Maple Syrup.  I vape this off of the shake, but due to the LB, a little steep time helps.
