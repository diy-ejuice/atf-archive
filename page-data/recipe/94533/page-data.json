The only thing it is really missing is the ash. Honestly I don't know that missing that is really a bad thing, but given the inspiration it is the only real criticism I think I can leave for this recipe. This is potent enough to use in a pod, but not overpowering or lacking in balance when used for direct lung "}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"94533","name":"Blackest Nights v3"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
