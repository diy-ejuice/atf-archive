It was a juice to me, that I wanted to keep vaping over and over, and was the first juice I wanted to try to clone when my brother and I first started making juices. And this recipe is my very first recipe I am putting out for display, so here we go!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is my 13th version that I have made of this recipe, and I am open to any suggestions on what could be done different if you have experienced this flavor as well. This recipe is what I would consider about 90% accurate to the real thing, however I think so far it's very enjoyable if you need something to quick mix up that's sweet and flavorful.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINW Shisha Strawberry - This was a flavor I recently added to the mix out of pure curiousity. I was previously using TFA's Strawberry Ripe from 3-4%, but was finding out that the strawberry was too authentic to what the real version calls for. I tried TFA's Strawberry, and CAP's Strawberry sweet in combinations, and by themselves. And just wasn't digging it. So I dropped the concepts about 10 mixes in.  To me, the mix required more of a mixture of both authentic and artificial flavor at the same time, and Shisha Strawberry did a great job at standing out on all levels, even being at 3%. If your curious, this would be one of the first things to mess with if you have any free time.\r\n\r\nFW Blackberry and FW Blue Raspberry combo - So the 2nd main ingredient in the Berry Voodoo recipe is FW's Blackberry. Now I used Blackberry because this was a flavoring to me, that was able to blend in very well with not only the Shisha Strawberry, (adding enough authenticity to make it like a fruity smoothie), but with the Blue Raspberry that I'm going to mention in a moment. I used to have this a little higher than 2.75%, but doing side by side comparisons was showing that 3.5% was too much blackberry, and needed to be toned down.\r\nNow here's where the Blue Raspberry comes in. I used the blue raspberry to act as an enhancer with mainly the Blackberry, and at 1.5%, it doesn't take away from the Blackberry and Shisha Strawberry main profile. I felt like blue raspberry was involved because of doing some smelling tests with the flavorings and the product. And with vaping the authentic version, I felt like there was another fruit involved in there more like an accent, and played a minor role in the mix. And to me, this flavoring worked just the way I intended it to.\r\n\r\nTFA Marshmallow - TFA Marshmallow is the body to this recipe. The marshmallow fills a lot of the void that the fruits are missing out on in this recipe. I started out using more marshmallow previously, and was finding out that it was muting the overall profile, and was hiding the Blackberry/Blue Raspberry combo. But I still needed it at a decent percentage, and figured out that 4% was a solid contender for what I was looking for. I even tried using other marshmallows like FA's, and CAP's Marshmallow, but was not happy with the results. FA's wasn't quite filling the void like I was expecting, and CAP's was just too sugary feeling, and was muting the whole mix. So by default, TFA's Marshmallow was the way to go.\r\n\r\nDX Banana Cream and Meringue combo - Now with this being a smoothie, my first intention was to start with TFA's Vanilla Bean Ice Cream, and CAP's Vanilla Custard, a typical smoothie combo from what I've seen around. But the thing that I noticed with the real product, was that it was more of a shake and vape, and was rather tasty right out the gate. The Vanilla Bean Ice Cream and Vanilla Custard combo is a combo that usually requires a decent steep, so I started thinking elsewhere. Granted, this may be a plausible combo still. TPA's DX Banana Cream came into play when I messed around with previous ideas on other recipes, and realized that it's a rather good shake and vape flavor when added. I had LA's Banana Cream at my disposal, but figured out that it was too \"banana-y\", and just threw everything off. The Banana Cream acted as, what I would like to call, \"the smoothie effect\" in that it gave the dimension of cream that I was aiming for with this clone. I wouldn't go any higher than 2%, or you may start getting more banana flavor than what you need.\r\nNow FA's Meringue is pretty much a required flavoring to acquire a creamy, yet sweetening, flavor that doesn't need time to steep much. It's pretty self-explanatory on what this flavoring does in the mix since it's in just about half of every recipe that's out there. Blends in well with the Banana Cream and the Marshmallow, and helps die down the Banana Cream in the mix from what I experience.\r\n\r\n-CAP Super Sweet - I fought, and I fought, and I fought, and I fought some more on using sweetener in this mix. Tried many variations, just weren't cutting it. But if you want the real thing, you HAVE to have sweetener in this. I would not add anymore than a couple drops depending on the sweetener you have.\r\n\r\nAs mentioned in my initial description, I'm open to all suggestions and ideas surrounding this clone. I just want to be able to achieve creating a 1:1 clone, and not have to spend the extra money. And to overall, gain more knowledge and views from other people since I would still consider myself, a novice, in this field. \r\n\r\n-Spacolie16","steep_days":"3 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"total_reviews":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-02T15:33:24.000-05:00","best_vg":"%","views":"2558","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Shisha Strawberry","vendor":"INW","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Blackberry","vendor":"FW","millipercent":2750},{"name":"Marshmallow","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Blue Raspberry","vendor":"FW","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Dx Banana Cream","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Meringue","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Super Sweet","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":500}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"37378","name":"Berry Voodoo Clone [Black Axis]"}}}
