However, it does not use strawberry but goes full on peach.  I also toned down the bavarian cream a little bit, so it is more custard-fruit centered.\r\n\r\nI do not recommend this as a Shake n' vape. Containing custard, creams, and peach flavourings, it will benefit from at least a week of steeping.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nNotes on progress:\r\n\r\n14/3/2016: Tried after 7 days. Not bad. I mixed a second batch with increased FA White Peach from 1.25 to 1.5, CAP Yellow Peach from 2.0 to 3.0, and CAP VC V1 from 4.5 to 5.0.  Let's see how it works.\r\n\r\n","steep_days":"7","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"total_reviews":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-04T21:25:05.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"1238","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Bavarian Cream","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Sweet Cream","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Vanilla Custard","vendor":"FA","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Yellow Peach","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Peach White","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1250},{"name":"Pistacchio (Pistachio)","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"125152","name":"#3 The Persian prince (version 1)"}}}
