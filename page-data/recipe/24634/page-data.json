I think I'm the only person in the world who doesn't like FA white peach. I was raised on yellow peaches. This combo is the closest I've come to a true yellow peach at least for my pallette. Strawberry ripe & Shisha vanilla add sweetness. \r\n\r\nOkay as shake and vape. Better after a week. Really good after 2 weeks.","steep_days":"14","temperature":"0","recipe_score":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-12T08:12:22.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"1658","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Juicy Peach","flavor_id":"81","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":2600},{"name":"Yellow Peach","flavor_id":"135","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":2600},{"name":"Peach","flavor_id":"542","vendor":"FA","millipercent":2600},{"name":"Oba Oba","flavor_id":"480","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1300},{"name":"Holy Vanilla","flavor_id":"2385","vendor":"DFS","millipercent":3250},{"name":"Shisha Vanilla","flavor_id":"841","vendor":"INW","millipercent":250},{"name":"Strawberry (ripe)","flavor_id":"271","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":500}],"reviews":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"24634","name":"Holy Peach "}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
