I think I'm the only person in the world who doesn't like FA white peach. I was raised on yellow peaches. This combo is the closest I've come to a true yellow peach at least for my pallette. Strawberry ripe & Shisha vanilla add sweetness. \r\n\r\nOkay as shake and vape. Better after a week. Really good after 2 weeks.","steep_days":"14","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"total_reviews":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-05T15:42:37.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"1646","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Juicy Peach","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":2600},{"name":"Yellow Peach","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":2600},{"name":"Peach","vendor":"FA","millipercent":2600},{"name":"Oba Oba","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1300},{"name":"Holy Vanilla","vendor":"DFS","millipercent":3250},{"name":"Shisha Vanilla","vendor":"INW","millipercent":250},{"name":"Strawberry (ripe)","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":500}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"24634","name":"Holy Peach "}}}
