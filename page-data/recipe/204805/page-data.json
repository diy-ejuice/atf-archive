Nachef purchased this e-liquid and didn't have a lot of good to say about the e-liquid, but he did like the concept of the profile.  So, using his description of what he was tasting, and with the goal of making it better, we came up with this wonderful recipe.  It's thick, creamy, eggy, with just the right amount of pistachio.  Give it a go, I'm sure you will enjoy this simple, yet flavorful delight!

Soft, creamy, the pistachio is not overpowering, love it!"},{"user":"Deftohms","text":"This stuff is stupid good. Its really good. Just mix it. Its good. If you're into this kind of profile, and you're considering not mixing this, you're wrong. Mix it. "},{"user":"whthek","text":"Hey, you 3 did a damn nice job with this! This is a keeper. I'm new to Pistachio, and had only tried it along with another flavor I bought with it(RY4),and I found it 'Mehh'! Been vaping for over 3yrs. and,for the longest time, just didn't want to be reminded of tobacco,but,thanks to you all,my Pistachio will not be sitting on the rack looking all lonely, and shit. The only thing I will likely do is cut back on sweetener a bit. Thank you! "},{"user":"R2ME2","text":"I’ve tried a few TFA pistachio recipes, but found the flavor to be too overwhelming.  This recipe is so well balanced and delicious I can’t put it down.  VT Vanilla Ice Cream does something magical here. Excellent work guys, 10 stars!"}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"204805","name":"Pistachio Gelato | Blind Remix | DEVELOPED"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
