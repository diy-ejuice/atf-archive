Simple and easy so I made one of my own.  This is my 2nd 1 2 3 recipe and they are nice and easy to mix and usually pretty tasty so maybe we can get a trend going.\r\n\r\nI recieved some vape train flavors and I really enjoy the pudding base.  It works really well with pistachio.  I used TFA for the artificial pistachio note and added in the FLV for an authentic notes.  Nice easy and tasty mix.

Probably because I don’t really get pudding out of VT Pudding Base, unless maybe it’s kind of an odd but delicious take on bread pudding, in which case I can sort of see it. But I love that combination of sweet fake and roasty real pistachio, and whatever the hell Pudding Base is, it certainly pairs up well with that pair of pistachios. It makes something almost like a crazy chewy pistachio cookie that’s more pistachio than chewy cookie. Whatever it is, it’s yummy without skimping on the nutty goodness. Very full-flavored simple mix with a dry roast top and sweet, thick, smooth finish, with some delightful little buttery bakery almost hidden in the background.

Finally a nutty flavor with the pistachio that doesnt overwealm the inherit pistachio notes neither is this here coverd up or muddled down by the cream notes. I have to say i dont get too much of the pudding component but as stated thats more a pro for me. Definitively try if like pistachios great simple recipe.
