I don't have sugar cone or waffle cone which she has been mentioning alot lately or at least in shows where I've seen her.  Churro is my best next go to for a different kind of bakery. \r\n This tastes great shake and vape - I hope it holds up to some steeping.  I thought churro with orange and cream sounded good so I went for it and added a floral dash to it - straight away it's not obvious but the bergamot you can taste right off the bat even at such a small percentage and it adds a nice extra bitter-sweetness somehow.  If you want something sweeter than this you could definitely bump up the super sweet.  The biscuit is silverline but I don't see that here.","steep_days":"3 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-06T12:55:18.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"1163","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Churro","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Biscuit","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1300},{"name":"Bavarian Cream (vanilla)","vendor":"LA","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Fresh Strawberries","vendor":"WF","millipercent":1800},{"name":"Lime Tahity Cold Pressed","vendor":"FA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Bergamot","vendor":"FA","millipercent":250},{"name":"Lavender","vendor":"FA","millipercent":200},{"name":"Blood Orange","vendor":"FA","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Catalan Cream","vendor":"FA","millipercent":650},{"name":"Lemonade Cookie","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Super Sweet","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":250}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"90373","name":"Orange Creme Churro"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
