And maybe I can understand not leaving a review on a recipe you didn't like but that's not the case with this one.  I might have mixed it earlier if people had indicated how good it was but...  nevertheless..&#xD;\nThis is a banger and nice change of pace by leading with the FLV Pudding.  Very smooth and its only been a week.  I think those butterscotches need a little more time to come thru and it'll be that much better.   Nice recipe.  Mix it and review it!  ***  UPDATE**  THIS SHIT IS DELICIOUS!! MY FAVORITE FURIOUSMIX TO DATE.","score":5}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"130952","name":"Benito Del Custardo"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
