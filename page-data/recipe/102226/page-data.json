I wanted it to be light so it can be all day vape. Fresh cream and a little amount of VBIC gives just the right amount of milk flavor. The rest of the recipe is just a mix of different strawberry flavors with dragonfruit to prompt the strawberry.\r\n\r\nOK to shake and vape. You get more of the fresh cream and milk. But after steeping for 2+ weeks, everything just melded and a bit of candy-like sweetness pops up.\r\n\r\nJust started mixing less than two months and only playing with limited flavors in my hand. This recipe is my current favorite.","steep_days":"15 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"total_reviews":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:50:11.000-05:00","best_vg":"80%","views":"1567","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Juicy Strawberry","vendor":"FA","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Strawberry (ripe)","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Vanilla Bean Ice Cream","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Erythritol 5%","vendor":"OTHR","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Strawberry","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Cream Fresh","vendor":"FA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Dragonfruit","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":3000}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"102226","name":"Pink Milk v2"}}}
