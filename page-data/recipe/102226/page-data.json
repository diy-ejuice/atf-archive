I wanted it to be light so it can be all day vape. Fresh cream and a little amount of VBIC gives just the right amount of milk flavor. The rest of the recipe is just a mix of different strawberry flavors with dragonfruit to prompt the strawberry.\r\n\r\nOK to shake and vape. You get more of the fresh cream and milk. But after steeping for 2+ weeks, everything just melded and a bit of candy-like sweetness pops up.\r\n\r\nJust started mixing less than two months and only playing with limited flavors in my hand. This recipe is my current favorite.","steep_days":"15 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-11T16:20:33.000-05:00","best_vg":"80%","views":"1583","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Juicy Strawberry","flavor_id":"8779","vendor":"FA","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Strawberry (ripe)","flavor_id":"271","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Vanilla Bean Ice Cream","flavor_id":"4","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Erythritol 5%","flavor_id":"4528","vendor":"OTHR","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Strawberry","flavor_id":"272","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Cream Fresh","flavor_id":"540","vendor":"FA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Dragonfruit","flavor_id":"226","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":3000}],"reviews":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"102226","name":"Pink Milk v2"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
