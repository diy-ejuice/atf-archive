He ended up liking this better than the original, I'll just take his word for it :). \r\n\r\nThis is a raspberry shortbread cookie that has a slight nuttiness to the cookie part.  Think of an English or Scottish biscuit cookie with Raspberry.  If that's not your thing, just drop the AP and you will still end up with a solid vanilla cookie base. The vape experience is cookie up front as a \"low note\" and raspberry coming in as a \"top note.  On the exhale, you get a nice raspberry jam flavor. \r\n\r\nThe Lemon Sicily is here to lift and separate the Raspberry sweet from the cookie.
