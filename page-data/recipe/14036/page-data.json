I think it does this well in its profile granted it's not to everyone's taste basically down to its harshness that some experience but hopefully the obaoba calms it down I feel it does somewhat.  Juicy peach just works for this recipe it's candy like profile suits the recipe it takes on that peach profile we are looking for here thus it's sweet has that candy like gummy sour profile and it's not to realistic so it doesn't fall away from the fun profile that it's participating in.\r\n\r\nCapella sweet Strawberry \r\n\r\nSo with the peach taking the star role I wanted a fruit that sits side by side something that accompanies the peach and Strawberry does this very well. They play along with each other and this flavour is just noticeable in the exhale of the vape. Sweet Strawberry again is one Strawberry that suits the profile it's candy properties again work well in it not mimicking a natural Strawberry.  The recipe requires some sweetness and this plays well. A natural Strawberry just wouldn't work remember this is a fun recipe. \r\n\r\nFA Fuji \r\n\r\nThis is this magic touch a fruit that you think shouldn't be there but along side the other fruits it kicks it in another direction. FA Fuji is a great flavour it works in whatever its trying to be whether a complicated recipe that requires dimension or as fun factor. It sits nicely at the rear just adding that tart apple after all that sweetness. It's bold and even at a small percentage it will tell you it's there. It definitely completes the whole experience. \r\n\r\nFA obaoba \r\n\r\nNow the magic if it was just the 3 fruits it's still going to work but I felt it needed something.  Like some sharpness or fizz not sweetener Yeah I could of added that and it will turn it up all that fruit needs a little sweetness but obaoba does that to a degree. It adds some citrus to it like some bite it tears through the fruits but it also comes across like a cream soda think like marshmallow but with some sparkle or fizz. It really is a magical ingredient and I'm glad I found it.\r\n\r\nSteep time... Good as a shake and vape 2-3 calms the peach somewhat \r\nMix 70vg 30pg","steep_days":"0","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:48:48.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"18085","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Sweet Strawberry","flavor_id":"121","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Peach (juicy)","flavor_id":"254","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":5000},{"name":"Fuji","flavor_id":"506","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Oba Oba","flavor_id":"480","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000}],"reviews":[{"user":"Ebc88","text":"Mixed as you suggested and steeped for a week. It is really tasty. Reminds me of Pop Rocks candy with out all the fizzy explosions that go along with them. The use of FA Oba Oba is what got my attention and made me mix this up. Works perfectly in here and pairs well with your fruit combo. Was a little worried that TPA Juicy Peach might be a little harsh @ 5% but it wasnâ€™t.

After a few days the peach seems to take over and the apple goes to the background.  I was  on the fence about this the first weeks, but now after a 2 month steep I really enjoy it."},{"user":"Darklyspectr","text":"Great recipe Daz. It needs a couple of days for me to have the peach chill out on the throat hit but it is definitely a great fruity vape. definitely one of my favorites."},{"user":"crisk","text":"Oba Oba all the way! I purchased this flavour just to make this. I don't regret it :)"},{"user":"KRUCIAL","text":"This vape reminds me of that peach flavored sparking water. Its very smooth and very tasty fruit recipe.
