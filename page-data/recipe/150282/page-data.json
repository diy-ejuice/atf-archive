Much worse was it, that I brought it to work too so I was stuck with it all day long.\r\nCame home, sat down, thought of my inventory as I needed a SnV immediately - and then it came to me. I need a candied apple!\r\nSo I mixed this up - little trial and error and I got it just perfect after a couple of tries.\r\n\r\nChoices:\r\nFA Fuji - Being low on apples in general, my choice fell on this, as it's the sweet kind of apple I'm after.\r\nVT Blood Plum - While my mix here does have a weak aftertaste of the plum, my choice on this was strictly for the candy flavor VT Blood Plum has. Therefor 1%\r\nVT Salted Caramel - Usually I go FW Caramel (Salted) when I want something caramel, but it's very potent, and VT's version is a little bit more damp in it. Needed that for the apple not to be overpowered.\r\nFA Butterscotch - There's to back-up the VT Salted Caramel and add a little butteriness to it.\r\nFLV Rich Cinnamon - Keeping it low as usual, potent stuff. But in my imagination, a sprinkle of cinnamon on a candied apple sounds delicious!\r\nCAP Super Sweet - Helps pretty much about anything in this mix to make it all more bright.\r\n\r\nCan be used as SnV (I do!) but if you feel the need to mellow out the cinnamon a little and let the caramel become more visible, leave it over night or a few days.\r\n\r\nEnjoy!\r\n\r\nCome visit us on discord: https://discordapp.com/channels/456953264857153536/456953264857153538","steep_days":"1 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-10T17:58:14.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"1306","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Fuji","flavor_id":"506","vendor":"FA","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Blood Plum","flavor_id":"8834","vendor":"VT","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Salted Caramel","flavor_id":"8959","vendor":"VT","millipercent":1250},{"name":"Butterscotch","flavor_id":"495","vendor":"FA","millipercent":750},{"name":"Rich Cinnamon","flavor_id":"638","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":250},{"name":"Super Sweet","flavor_id":"2384","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":250}],"reviews":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"150282","name":"Kitty's Candied Apple"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
