The Vanilla Bean Gelato is more of a Vanilla flavor than a Gelato flavor. FA Custard Premuim is by far the best custard flavor on the market. I know that it is a difficult flavor to get your hands on so it can also be replaced with TFA Vanilla Custard or CAP Vanilla Custard V2. They do their jobs quite well as replacements.\r\nLet it steep for about 7 days and you should be good to go! This is going to be my ADV, its damn good!\r\nEnjoy.","steep_days":"7","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"total_reviews":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-02T08:11:15.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"1058","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Lychee","vendor":"FA","millipercent":3500},{"name":"Lime","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Pear","vendor":"INW","millipercent":500},{"name":"Vanilla Bean Gelato","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Super Sweet","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":500},{"name":"Custard Premium","vendor":"FA","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Lemon Lime","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Sweet Lychee","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1500}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"143405","name":"Lyme Custard (Lime and Lychee)"}}}
