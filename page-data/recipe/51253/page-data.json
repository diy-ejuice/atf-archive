It is really, really good. Got bored and threw this one together and have been alternating it into my rotation of bored mixes.\r\n\r\nThis recipe is a bit thick, LB White Chocolate Peppermint is not the strongest of flavorings. Going the lazy route with the VBIC / Meringue combo :)\r\n\r\nEnjoy. Just a tasty thick easy recipe. I shake and vape, it of course gets better over time.","steep_days":"7 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:49:23.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"5694","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"White Chocolate Peppermint","vendor":"LB","millipercent":8000},{"name":"Vanilla Bean Ice Cream","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Meringue","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1200}],"reviews":[{"user":"BigRed","text":"I added one percent of LB white chocolate"},{"user":"julezz","text":"This is so good. LB wcp is great and this recipe perfectly highlights it while giving it some body and thick creamy ice cream goodness"},{"user":"kindground","text":"Fantastic and simple recipe. I love creamy vanilla peppermint! I added a half a percent of FA Peppermint and it helps carry it through the steep a little more. Now I know what to do with that huge bottle of LB WCP.

Thanks Fear, great job!"},{"user":"Ebc88","text":"Excellent work really enjoyed that peppermint throat kick when i was battling a cold last week"},{"user":"Deweysuds","text":"one month steep.  Simple recipe, but very authentic to what it is supposed to be.  I think to only thing I would change is add to the ice cream base to add some depth and thickness.  Maybe hangsen ice cream or something along those lines.  The nice thing about this one is itâ€™s simplicity though and having 4oz of WCP from the awesome box this is a great way to use a bunch of it!

I don't like cold vapes really but this one is delicious.  "},{"user":"Rageisalotofwork","text":"Even as a shake and vape it's delicious as a much more smooth WCP without the scratchiness. I'm sure it will be even better after the weeks steep."}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"51253","name":"WCP Ice Cream"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
