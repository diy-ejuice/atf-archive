I noticed there wasn't many recipes for pods, so I thought iâ€™d whip a few up. This one turned out quite pleasent! You really have to boost your percentages to get decent flavor in these things. This combo of berries taste great with a bit of apple to brighten them up and give them some texture. If you dont have razzleberry or RF strawberry TPA sweet raspberry and TPA strawberry will do just fine. I hope you all enjoy this recipe! Please let me know what you think in the comments!","steep_days":"1 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T20:32:49.000-05:00","best_vg":"50%","views":"2943","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Razzleberry","flavor_id":"1393","vendor":"FW","millipercent":6000},{"name":"Apple Fuji","flavor_id":"4886","vendor":"FA","millipercent":5000},{"name":"Boysenberry","flavor_id":"614","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Strawberry","flavor_id":"2294","vendor":"RF","millipercent":6000},{"name":"Super Sweet","flavor_id":"2384","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":150}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"129068","name":"Razzle Dazzle (Nic salt Pod)"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
