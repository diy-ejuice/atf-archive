IMO\r\n\r\nGrape Juice TFA - the grape juice is used to push the grape to a sweeter profile and give a bit more brightness. I would experiment with other grapes as well to see what works best. I haven't had a chance to try anything else yet. \r\n\r\nDouble Apple CAP - A great apple taste thats authentic and doesnt really need any other help to get there. \r\n\r\nWild Melon FLV - This keeps things a bit more fruity rather than candylike. \r\n\r\nTPA Black Currant - I find this really helps round the flavors out and bring them together. This is optional and totally up to you. \r\n\r\nLet me know what you think and if you guys try anything else, let me know in the comments.
