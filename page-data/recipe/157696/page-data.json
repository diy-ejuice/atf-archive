Almost impossible to find anymore so I decided to make my own \"clone\" or variation that I feel is a close enough facsimile for my palette. I feel like the original has a LOT more sweetener in it, but I much prefer it with more flavor, less sweetener. Speed/heat steep doesn't seem to do much to this stuff, but time definitely morphs it. 5 day steep seems to really make it pop, but even as SNV it's pretty excellent. If you sub Rick's with CAPS Super Sweet make sure you cut it in half as the super sweet really is... super sweet, lol! Maltol used to brighten the berries and keep them strong after steep.\r\n\r\n14 day steep and this stuff sweetens up a LOT. The strawberry has stayed strong and the creaminess/graham is evident on the exhale. 21 days and it really sits well on the palette. Strawberries on the inhale, cream and biscuit on the exhale with a lot of sweetness, but not like a frosting or crunchy either... just, sweet! 28 days and it's full on flavor packed and ready for vaping.\r\n\r\nAs a side note... This juice is INCREDIBLY easy on coils for what it is. Whether it's a sub tank, RDA or what have you, I've been getting an extremely long coil life on everything I've put this in. An example: Crown IV tank with a mesh coil, 4000 puffs, >200mls of juice, still same coil, same taste and no build up. It's delightful!\r\n\r\n(Post up your adaptations or suggestions please!)","steep_days":"14","temperature":"","recipe_score":0,"total_reviews":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-02T08:00:57.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"539","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Cheesecake (graham Crust)","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Strawberry (ripe)","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Rick's Sugar Daddy","vendor":"TBV","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Dx Sweet Cream","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Sweet Strawberry","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Biscuit","vendor":"INW","millipercent":500},{"name":"Ethyl Maltol","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":250},{"name":"Vienna Cream","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"157696","name":"Kaptin Kaos' Vape Pockee Remix 50%"}}}
