I too enjoyed this recipe but feel it needs some adjusting to bring it to \"wow\". Great job Zooter."},{"user":"Mixepic","score":"4","text":"After 30ml's I think it's a good profile but could use some separation within the fruit base. They become rather muddled together and difficult to determine which one you're tasting. Maybe the raspberry is bringing them too close together and forcing itself in the middle. However, I did enjoy the bottle I made, the sugar on top was very evident and well done. "}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"1572","name":"strawberries and pear with sugar on top"}}}
