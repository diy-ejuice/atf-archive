It brings a sour note as well as rounding out the other ingredients to make it a single entity.\r\n\r\nI'll be honest, I've never even used TPA Raspberry. It was sitting in my drawer, I was brainstorming flavorings for this profile, tasted it on the back of my hand, and threw it in here. I feel it compliments the WF Sour Blue Raspberry Candy well, and adds more sweet depth to the raspberry flavor.\r\n\r\nWF Sour Blue Raspberry is such a good Blue Razz. Sour, sweet, and syrupy. As soon as I exhale, I want to pick it up again. Lick a drop of this flavor off the back of your hand and you'll know all you need to know.\r\n\r\nIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII\r\n\r\nBest vaped from drippers or flavor forward RTA's. This recipe tastes like slightly sweet air out of most pods and sub-ohm tanks in my experience, even with percentage's doubled.\r\n\r\n\r\nUpdate: 9/10/2020- Almost a year and a half later, but adding WS-23 at your desired percentage is great with this as well","steep_days":"1 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T02:17:03.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"1744","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Sour Ball Candy SC","vendor":"WF","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Raspberry","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Sour Blue Raspberry Candy","vendor":"WF","millipercent":3000}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"147906","name":"1-Blue-3"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
