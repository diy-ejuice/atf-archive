Hints of cinnamon, and a touch of crust. The white chocolate adds a creaminess that lingers on the exhale. It’s sweet and it’s definitely pie. It’s pretty good off a shake and vape but it definitely needs 4-5 days to really incorporate the flavors and tame the apple. The caramel and cinnamon will develop along with the slight creaminess from the white chocolate.
