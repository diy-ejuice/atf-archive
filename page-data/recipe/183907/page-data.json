Love feedback and tweeks . I drink a Mango dragonfruit refresher everyday I highly recommend trying that and comparing it to let me know how they go together , Give it an overnight steep just to let everything settle in ... Once again Fuck any type of vape ban \r\n\r\n\r\nEdit: If you liked V1 and try this please let me know which you like better \r\n","steep_days":"1 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-06T20:45:35.000-05:00","best_vg":"72%","views":"913","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Island Mango","vendor":"WF","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Mango Indian Special","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Dragon Fruit - Pitaya","vendor":"INW","millipercent":500},{"name":"Lemonade","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Lemon Zest","vendor":"FA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Boysenberry","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":500}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"183907","name":"Mango Dragonfruit Refresher revised"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
