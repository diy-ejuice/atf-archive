FLV cookie dough is a little weird to work with, at first I really didn't like it. It almost has an RY4 taste to it right away as weird as that sounds, to me atleast. But I can see why Wayne went that route. With some supporting flavors and of course a little time it does come out pretty tasty! I don't add any sweetener here, and it probably would benefit from some, so add .5% super sweet if you want. FLV Cookie Dough, and FLV Frosting are a little harsh right away, so I do like to add a little more VG. This is my spin off from Obsidian, here I present MrColdOnes Creamy Cookie Dough!","steep_days":"7","temperature":"400","recipe_score":5,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:49:17.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"3793","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Cookie Dough","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":2250},{"name":"Frosting","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Cookie","vendor":"FA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Cream","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Hazelnut","vendor":"FW","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Toasted Marshmallow","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Graham Cracker Clear","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Butterscotch","vendor":"FW","millipercent":750}],"reviews":[{"user":"cxxxxp","text":"checks out... the ingredients seem right up my alley... I will give this a mix and let you know how it is after a week or two's steep! :) just noticed the ingredients seem quite modern considering this has been out for some time too.

Once it did, the butterscotch and hazelnut came through delectably."},{"user":"mlNikon","text":"I just mixed this up so it hasn't steeped yet, but already this is a very tasty recipe. I love any chance to use flv cookie dough. I liked it so much I also mixed up a version with wf chocolate chunks in it.
