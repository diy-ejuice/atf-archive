You're a tough sale, but that's okay! How do you like... Them apples?\r\n\r\nToasted Redux #3. Pulled that cinnamon, threw in some apple, and adjusted the base. Upped Cereal 27 to compete with the crispness of Fuji. Dropped Meringue and Cream Fresh a touch because the apple sticks to them and they were taking over. Makes for a nice dry cereal and tart apple cream vape. Notes for everything but apple are over on Toasted.\r\n\r\nFlavor Notes:\r\n\r\nFA Fuji is my guy. I needed a crisp apple to drop right next to the cereal, and there's nothing better than ol' faithful. At 2% it doesn't totally take over, but it begins to command the recipe. Fuji's tasty. I know it, you know it, we all know it. Boom.\r\n\r\nThis is good off the shake, but after 5 days it starts to become whole. Fuji will recess a bit and the creams will settle.\r\n\r\nHappy mixing. ðŸ‘½","steep_days":"5 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"total_reviews":1,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:49:20.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"2137","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Cereal 27","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":5000},{"name":"Graham Cracker Clear","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Meringue","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Cream Fresh","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Toasted Marshmallow","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Super Sweet","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":250},{"name":"Fuji","vendor":"FA","millipercent":2000}],"reviews":[{"user":"NIL8","score":"5","text":"Apologies, I'm just now getting around to reviewing this. This is excellent! I agree TFA Meringue is better in a cereal than the FA counterpart.  Although still delicious if others only have FA to sub. Crazy close this recipe is to my remix of The One: Apple Cinnamon by Beard Vape Co. and a variation of this is adding cinnamon. I like a drop of Rich Cinnamon to a 60ml but I'm sure a drop per 30ml would be loved by many.  If you like that juice...  add cinnamon and this is a cleaner, smoother, and overall way better version IMO. "}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"47485","name":"Them Apples"}}}
