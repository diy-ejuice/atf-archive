So I introduced WF Croissant SC to back it up. At 1% I feel it does the job backing up the 3% VT Croissant.\r\n\r\nFor the pudding I have tried a few custards such as FA Custard and Custard Prem. CAP Vanilla Custard was at the table at some point too, all in some variations with FLV Vanilla Pudding.\r\nSadly, no matter the combination I did, I just felt it was too overpowering, so for my final version, I decided to just stick it with FLV Vanilla Pudding.\r\nThe almond just serves as an accent for topping and so does the OOO Powdered Sugar.\r\n\r\nIt's a simple recipe, but I quite like it despite the simplicity it has.\r\n\r\nI feel this is best after about 12 days, but very enjoyable after just 7.\r\n\r\nEnjoy!","steep_days":"12","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:51:02.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"1083","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Croissant","flavor_id":"8867","vendor":"VT","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Powdered Sugar","flavor_id":"6522","vendor":"OOO","millipercent":750},{"name":"Vanilla Pudding","flavor_id":"4433","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Almond","flavor_id":"528","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Croissant SC","flavor_id":"9022","vendor":"WF","millipercent":1000}],"reviews":[{"user":"Skywxp3d","text":"On day 7 and loving this!
