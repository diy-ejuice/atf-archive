Its surprisingly addictive. The mix of peppermints creates a nice minty base and cinnamon red hots  blends it all together.  You can use Arctic winter, polar blast, WS-23 or Koolada as the cooling agent, adjust the percentage accordingly.  I opted to use two to get the perfect cooling effect without overpowering everything else.  Hope you enjoy as much as she does!","steep_days":"3 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T22:32:22.000-05:00","best_vg":"60%","views":"1315","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Candy Cane","vendor":"FW","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Cinnamon Red Hot","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":750},{"name":"Mild Winter (peppermint)","vendor":"FA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Polar Blast","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Peppermint","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Aroma Arctic Winter (menthol Artic)","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"62135","name":"Tammy's Temptation"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
