I don't really know what that means, I just had to write something to make this public.\r\n\r\nIf you have the ingredients, mix it up and give it a try, it's shake and vape certified, and yes, the TFA Pineapple will make it cloudy.

Absolutely Perfect for the transition into spring and summer!  It is bright and tropically fruity almost punchy!  It has a nice body to it without being any bit of harsh.  I love that its quick to mix up too! I have to order cherimoya now and will be vaping this stuff often.  SNV no doubt!  Mix it up!!  You wont regret it!","score":5}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"91840","name":"Surprise Sauce"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
