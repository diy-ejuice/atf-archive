This one just uses a touch of VT Boysenberry to sharpen some blueberry against a rich cream base that might otherwise overwhelm it. That works, and this stuff is delicious. It mostly tastes like someone “harvested” the blueberries out of dozens and dozens of blueberry muffins blended those up into luxurious rich vanilla ice cream. I have a few words of advice regarding this recipe. One, mix it up, people. I doubt you’ll regret it.. Two, turn your temperature control or wattage down a little more than you normally have it. This stuff sings under less heat. If you throw too much power at it, it keeps that creamy finish, but the blueberry on top gets much sharper, almost to the point of harshness. Also, it some of that deep cooked berry sweetness gives way to more of an artificial, candied sweetness. Three, where’s the muffin? I’m not getting any of the promised cake notes. Probably more sensitive taster would, but they aren’t showing up for me (one of the reasons for monkeying around with the settings). Ordinarily I might dock a star when reviewing a recipe for not delivering 100% as promised, but you see here I did not. That’s because it’s that damn yummy. But if you really have your heart set on tasting some muffin in there, rather than just the tons of blueberries harvested from muffins, maybe add a touch of that FLV Lembas Bread, or if you want bakery but want it more in line with cake than muffin, a bit of one of any number of the tasty WF cake flavors might do the trick.
