But once I got my hand on JF Yellow Cake, I had to use it. \r\nDelicious apple cake with a sweet frosting \r\nCAP CDS/JF Yellow Cake- JF does most of the work here. It's sweet and moist, but not too moist. It's absolutely delicious. CDS adds a nice little cinnamon dusting and adds some fullness to the batter.\r\nFuji/Apple Cider- I don't get a whole lot of apple from the cider. It has that fermented taste that you would associate with ciders and is very sweet. Combined with the Fuji, it's a perfect representation of an apple cider.\r\nVanilla cupcake- This makes up the frosting. It does actually help the batter but I definitely get more of the frosting than batter.\r\nStrawberry Ripe- Now, I can't taste strawberries very well but I use ripe quite a bit. Usually to sweeten a mix. Not this time. While it does add some sweetness, I'm using this to smooth some harsh notes. Apple cider is a great flavor but can be a little harsh on the throat at times. Strawberry ripe does a perfect job of smoothing that all out.\r\nI made 10 different recipes with many variations and this is the one I can't stop vaping. I hope everyone enjoys this as much as I do. Maybe not that outside of the box,but it's so good!","steep_days":"5","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-02T07:27:12.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"1301","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Cinnamon Danish Swirl","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Strawberry (ripe)","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Fuji","vendor":"JF","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Apple Cider","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Vanilla Cupcake","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1300},{"name":"Yellow Cake","vendor":"JF","millipercent":2000}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"17634","name":"Apple Cider Cake"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
