Halo no longer produces this juice, I know this because i recently contacted them to purchase some. Twisted Java was one of my very first e liquids, and brings back that era of vaping... when I contacted Halo about why they dropped this flavor from their line they said that it wasn't a big seller... So I asked them for their recipe and they said that they wouldn't give it out, getting kind of rude about me asking them... So here it is! For the whole free world to have! Thanx again to HIC! This is spot on!\r\n\r\nFW Candy Cane: This is the backbone of this flavor...A twisted candy for a twisted java...\r\n\r\nTPA Caramel Cappuccino: A nice sweet caramelly coffee for the java aspect \r\n\r\nFW Hazelnut: HIC recommends this for the authenticity of the profile... Also adds that it's not a necessity other than for authenticity....\r\n\r\nI sincerely hope anyone looking for this lost jem enjoys mixing it up and taking a trip to the past! ðŸ˜¤ðŸ’¨ðŸ’ª","steep_days":"7 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"total_reviews":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-06T07:14:45.000-05:00","best_vg":"50%","views":"2893","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Candy Cane","vendor":"FW","millipercent":10000},{"name":"Caramel Cappuccino","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Hazelnut","vendor":"FW","millipercent":500}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"26151","name":"Twisted Java Clone (Halo)"}}}
