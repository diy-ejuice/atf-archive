Wanted a richer strawberry cheesecake flavor, so i combined 2 of strongest/darkest strawberries I had. For the cheesecake to come through and mix with that \"strawngberry\" i used inw yes we cheesecake and combined with TFA cheesecake Graham cracker crust. I also added sugar cookie with inw biscuit for a  good cookie crust. I added some FLV Cream with some Cap Bavarian for the creamy flavor and a splash of Inw Vanilla shisha to add to the custard and cream. The most important part of any custard is... well the custard... I used MB Legendary custard. You can also use tpa or cap vanilla custard if you don't have Legendary or fa premium. The key to this (like most custards) is the steep. 3 weeks Minimum! I wait like 5-6 weeks myself.\r\n\r\nSUBS:\r\nAlready explained you can substitute the custard (though id definitely stick with MB Legendary)\r\n\r\nI feel Red Touch is necessary for the taste im looking for. You can also replace the INW STRAWBERRY SHISHA w\r\nTpa Strawberry Ripe @ 6-7%\r\n(Thats actually how i originally made this, but I have a hard time tasting SB Ripe sometimes so I changed it up)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","steep_days":"30","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"total_reviews":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T23:38:18.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"1274","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Legendary Custard","vendor":"MB","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Sugar Cookie","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Biscuit","vendor":"INW","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Shisha Vanilla","vendor":"INW","millipercent":500},{"name":"Yes, We Cheesecake","vendor":"INW","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Cheesecake (graham Crust)","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Shisha Strawberry","vendor":"INW","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Red Touch (strawberry)","vendor":"FA","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Cream","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Bavarian Cream","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":750}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"173984","name":"Big Mad Custard"}}}
