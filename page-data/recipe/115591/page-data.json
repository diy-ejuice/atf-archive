I have been enjoying this fantastically simple mix for months and it has become my go-to \"palate cleanser\". The fresh and vibrant mix of forest berries sits perfectly, with just the slightest touches to make it shine.\r\n\r\nFA Forest Mix\r\nI cannot say any more that has not already been said about this marvellous flavour. Bilberry, raspberry, strawberry, blackcurrant, and a lick of blackberry blended perfectly to provide a crisp, authentic and vibrant burst of unrivaled berry goodness.\r\n\r\nThe FA Cream provides some body & creaminess, allowing the berries to show their full potential.\r\n\r\nWS23 cools everything down without detracting from the stars of show. Feel free to start the WS23 off at 0.25% and adjust up if required.\r\nSub WS23 with Koolada at your preferred % if preferred.\r\n\r\nEDIT: 1% FA Marshmallow adds a little sweetness if that is your thing...\r\n\r\nAllow the Forest mix to settled and blend with the creams for at least 3 days and your'e good to go!!\r\n\r\nEnjoy!","steep_days":"3","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"total_reviews":1,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:50:24.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"5362","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Forrest Mix (forest Fruit Mix)","vendor":"FA","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Cream Fresh","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"WS-23","vendor":"OTHR","millipercent":500}],"reviews":[{"user":"ooooNaSuGamisoooo","score":"5","text":"nice and simple mix&#xD;\nbetter than many premium e-liquids!!!"}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"115591","name":"Icee Berry"}}}
