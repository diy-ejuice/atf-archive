It is not really refined or sophisticated but it is genuine, fresh and highly addictive. As a bonus, you should be able to shake and vape - like a good fresh orange juice.\r\n\r\n1. FA Coco': this is the base. A creamy, milky, slightly sweet coconut.\r\n2. FA Blood Orange: this is the top note. A tangy, slightly acid, bittersweet blood orange. The contrast with the coconut, sitting on top.\r\n3. INW Marzipan: satellite or accent. Subliminal almond, sugar and alcoholic notes hidden between the coconut and the blood orange.\r\n\r\nAs mentioned in the beginning, I didn't try to refine this a lot. While solo testing the above flavours I thought that they could be a nice match due to the contrast/complimentary nature of the notes. I did 1-2 takes and without even waiting for the flavours to steep (ok, I waited 6 hours) I considered this recipe a keeper ...until further refined.","steep_days":"1 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":4,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:50:42.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"1159","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Coco' (coconut)","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Blood Orange","vendor":"FA","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Marzipan","vendor":"INW","millipercent":500}],"reviews":[{"user":"Asire","text":"I really cant decide is this is more of a summer or a winter juice for me :D i guess both &#xD;\nThe Orange Coco combo is what i like to think of the \"sang\" here. Its really nice balanced but the mazipan it what does it here for me. It gives this recipe a depth i only used to get from bakery vapes. It also sweetens up everything plenty so there is no need for sweetener here. The coco and the orange blend very nicely together with the notes of marzipan on the back end. For me personaly id like to see a bit more intense orange taste in this but thats totally personal so still nice work here."}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"137033","name":"1-2-3 Coco Sang!"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
