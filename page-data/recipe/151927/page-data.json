Of course you need to add your sweetener of choice, I didn't add it to the recipe just so I could keep it as a 321 but use whatever you want at whatever amount you want. Edit: After letting this steep more it's actually tasting more like a fruity tea which is weird because there is not tea flavor here.","steep_days":"3 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T23:37:43.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"1477","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Jackfruit SC","vendor":"WF","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Starfruit SC","vendor":"WF","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Strawberry Gummy Candy SC","vendor":"WF","millipercent":1000}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"151927","name":"Fruit Tea Punch"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
