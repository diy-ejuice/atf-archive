It is similar to a slushie. \r\nMade for day time franks Mixin in the kitchen episode on marshmallow \r\n\r\nOn the inhale you get a strawberry  that  transitions to coconut and ends with a watermelon and finishes with a light cooling note\r\n\r\n**watermelon** is a slightly candy type of watermelon but does have some green notes here that is really prominent on the exhale. if you want a bit more realistic watermelon MB or FA watermelon lean more realistic \r\n\r\n**pineapple** adds a darker sweetness that contrasts some of the bright top notes of the watermelon and sits in the middle of this mx - and it is not meant to be very prominent as it is more of a filler  for the middle \r\n\r\n**Strawberry** adds some jammy ripe strawberry notes that bring out the \"red\" notes of this mix   \r\n\r\n**sweet coconut** adds some volume and takes the bitter notes off of the watermelon which can occur when used above 1% \r\n\r\n**Vanilla Marshmallow** adds density body, and sweetness with a light vanilla note that supports the red flavor in this mix \r\n\r\n**sherbet** and **sorbet** are accent notes here. sherbet adds the citrus notes to help bring bright top notes of the fruit out. Sorbet has some additional melon notes with a bit of a mint cooling on the finish \r\nfeel free to add sweetner Cap super sweet at .5%","steep_days":"3 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T22:33:26.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"1815","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Fizzy Sherbet","flavor_id":"8878","vendor":"VT","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Juicy Strawberry","flavor_id":"8779","vendor":"FA","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Marshmallow (Vanilla)","flavor_id":"1798","vendor":"OOO","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Sorbet Base","flavor_id":"8970","vendor":"VT","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Sugarloaf Pineapple","flavor_id":"8978","vendor":"VT","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Sweet Coconut","flavor_id":"605","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Watermelon","flavor_id":"616","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1500}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"141232","name":"Watermelon Strawberry Cooler "}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
