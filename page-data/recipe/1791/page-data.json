The cream base is simple and delicious. Excellent job and thanks for sharing "},{"user":"Philosaphucker","score":"5","text":"I love this after a month. So smooth and the melons just meld right into the cream. This goes great with a dark, malty beverage."},{"user":"Apexified","score":"5","text":"This is one of the few recipes that I've made multiple times without tweaking anything. It's damn near perfect and really highlights how well FLV flavors play off of one another. If you don't have the flavors, get them. They're worth it for this mix alone but very versatile, as well.
