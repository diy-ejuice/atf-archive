I then mixed @Dmilin recipe over on ELR. Both recipes were inspired by @Gwandrei Hawaiian POG Remix and the original by Naked, which I still haven't tried. I started mixing all these together but the recipe was still lacking in body and brightness.\r\n\r\nFA Passion Fruit: I really love the  flavor but it's sweeter than a real passion fruit, it's missing the zing of it. I like it strong, but you can take it down by 0.5% up to 1% if you need to.\r\n\r\nFW Blood Orange: a great orange that compliments CAP Juicy Orange very well because it gives it more body and compensates the watery aspect of CAP JO. The combination of both is a really tasty orange juice.\r\n\r\nCAP Grapefruit: brings the tang and tart, red flavor to the passion fruit, the guava and the orange that was missing for me in the all the Hawaiian POG recipes I've tried.\r\n\r\nThis recipe does well at higher wattages and in PODs alike. Don't be intimidated by the higher-ish level of flavorings in this recipe,  most of them have a tendency to need mixed at higher percentages.\r\n\r\nRepresentation matters in all aspects of life and in the vaping community.  I hope those of you who will mix this will enjoy vaping this POG and have a thought about social justice, equal rights, love and what it's like to be different in the world we live in, as you vape it.","steep_days":"3 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":4.5,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:50:14.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"3161","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Dragonfruit","flavor_id":"226","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Super Sweet","flavor_id":"2384","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":500},{"name":"Sweet Guava","flavor_id":"118","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":7000},{"name":"Passion (passionfruit)","flavor_id":"585","vendor":"FA","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Sweet Tangerine","flavor_id":"123","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Juicy Orange","flavor_id":"80","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":5000},{"name":"Blood Orange","flavor_id":"1197","vendor":"FW","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Grapefruit","flavor_id":"65","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":4000}],"reviews":[{"user":"MECH_MOD_RN","text":"This is a  well balanced lovely mix, that I could easily vape all day; right of the shake .  it  is bright and juicy, and just the perfect blend of sweet fruit and slight tart back note from grapefruit.   Sadly I did not have the  cap grapefruit only INW grape fruit but it worked perfectly in  this mix  ( i have ordered the cap grapefruit to see if there is a difference) .  if you enjoy  vibrant crisp clean  fruit mixes then this is for you .  Well  DONE  cheers!
