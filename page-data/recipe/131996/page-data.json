I achieved this by combining sour, super sweet and koolada with one of the FW lemonades (normal or pink can be used) \r\n\r\nI then experimented with various fruit combinations, and this one is my favourite so far (I will release other versions with different combinations) \r\n\r\nCertified S&V, and very enjoyable! Please let me know what you think!
