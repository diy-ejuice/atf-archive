I'm going to give this a shot and see what I can come up with and what results do I get. I'll be updating to you guys as soon I get some results. I have lots of  good feelings about really good recipes out of this flavor. Some of the characteristics of the guanabana is that pair very well with sour flavors such as pineapple, lime, passion and others. Also is very versatil to mix, such as shakes, custards, bakery and what ever you want to do with it. I decided to take the long route first for some reasons, flavors wise. This is so popular in my country that you can find it anywhere and I'm super happy to have it now in a vape version. Remember this is a 1st version recipe and is up to you if you want to wait for my results or give it your self a shot at it. Comments and opinions are always welcome.\r\n\r\nMix at 80 VG/ 20 PG","steep_days":"5","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"total_reviews":1,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T20:31:43.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"1688","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Cream","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Guanabana","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":6000},{"name":"Moose Milk","vendor":"FW","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Cookie","vendor":"FA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Shisha Vanilla","vendor":"INW","millipercent":500},{"name":"Sweet Cream","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Milk Condensed","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Butter Cream","vendor":"FW","millipercent":500},{"name":"Brown Sugar","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Lime Tahity Cold Pressed","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Cocopilada","vendor":"INW","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Cinnamon Ceylon","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Vanilla Custard","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":3000}],"reviews":[{"user":"Mr-G","score":"none","text":"its ok"}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"14729","name":"Guanabana Milk Shake"}}}
