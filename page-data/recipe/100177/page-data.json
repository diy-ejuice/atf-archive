The cap custard and tpa custard are the stars with pie crust and biscuit backing them up then adding caramel and butter pecan to give it interest.  I now add supersweet to almost everything at .25% because I do believe it is kinda like salt - it brings flavors forward.  I used to avoid sugar but if you use just a little it won't gunk up your coils.","steep_days":"15 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:50:09.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"1701","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Vanilla Custard","flavor_id":"131","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Vanilla Custard","flavor_id":"188","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Butter Pecan","flavor_id":"8740","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":2200},{"name":"Caramel","flavor_id":"26","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1150},{"name":"Pie Crust","flavor_id":"179","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1250},{"name":"Super Sweet","flavor_id":"2384","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":250},{"name":"Biscuit","flavor_id":"8737","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1500}],"reviews":[{"user":"amouthforwar","text":"It's a delicious vape! I've let it steep for about 3.5 weeks before cracking it open and the custards are super delicious paired together. Nice sweet caramel and butter pecan top notes I just can't get enough of, and a good pie crust undertone. Maybe it was just the batch I got but my TFA Pie Crust does give me an odd burnt/overly toasted flavor but it's not enough to detract from the rest of the mix here. 5/5!"}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"100177","name":"Trey's Butter Pecan Custard Pie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
