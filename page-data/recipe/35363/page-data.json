Love all these straps there's so many to choose from its a god dayum Strap-On paradise! I think this Wild Strap-On is just the thing to complete the party, although many more will be added, this ones is essential to always being in the mix. I take no credit for the 75% of the mix that is ID10-T's **STR**awberry **AP**ple watermel**ON** (https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/6487).  Also, I like top notes which generally fade away the quickest so I like it best as a shake and vape but a 1 or 2 day steep helps the flavors bind together and really makes it into that honeydew-cantaloupe-strawberry-watermelon-apple mix.**VARIATIONS** Personally I like to add in 1% TFA Honeydew cuz I like me some honeydew (I prefer TFA's over CAP's). And Mango SC or FLV at 1% makes this magical, credit for the Strap-On-Mango goes to Apexified. Can up the Wild melon to 2% to make it more of a melon mix but it does cover up the strap on pretty well.","steep_days":"2 (SNV)","temperature":"420","recipe_score":5,"total_reviews":2,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:49:10.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"3275","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Red Summer (watermelon)","vendor":"FA","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Apple Fuji","vendor":"FA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Red Touch (strawberry)","vendor":"FA","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Wild Melon","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1500}],"reviews":[{"user":"ID10-T","score":"5","text":"This recipe turns me on. It also turns the \"On\" part of Strap-On from a kinda boring and oddly dry watermelon into a wildly succulent and refreshing mixed melon while still letting the \"Strap\" part poke out. I'm so glad I got the FLV Wild Melon for this!  Thanks, Reldof!  "},{"user":"super8line","score":"5","text":"I ordered all of the things i needed to make a few of these recent Strap-On recipes and this is the first one I sampled. Wow, made it 4 hours ago and it is fantastic! I'm usually not a melon guy or a huge fan of fruit recipes but this is just awesome!  Now I can't wait to try the other's.
