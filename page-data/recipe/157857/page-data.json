To add a bit of brightness, you can add FE Lemon at .25% and to make it a bit darker you can increase the JF Cookie to 1.5%.

Not surprised that it’s a very well balanced flavor, given that developed comes out with my favorite recipes, but for a recipe way out of my ballpark in terms of the profile, I can’t put this down. It’s so good. If you’ve ever had epicus nebulas Blue General this is spot on to the fruit but also has a way better base. Keep em comin guys!"},{"user":"Scism","text":"Accurate to the description.
