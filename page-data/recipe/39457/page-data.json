FLV Guanabana bolsters the mango and also adds some tart tones to the mango flavor.\r\n\r\nFLV Cream and FA Vienna Cream give some mild creamy body, without affecting the candy profile with a little help from FLV Sweet Coconut.","steep_days":"7","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"updated_at":"2020-12-12T11:50:46.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"5678","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Cream","flavor_id":"604","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Guanabana","flavor_id":"4427","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Mango","flavor_id":"3516","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Sweet Coconut","flavor_id":"605","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":500},{"name":"Vienna Cream","flavor_id":"516","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1250},{"name":"Violet","flavor_id":"512","vendor":"FA","millipercent":2500}],"reviews":[{"user":"trandism","text":"Truly amazing.

FA Violet turns FLV Mango into mouthwatering purple mango candy - not mango + violet + candy, but sweet, smooth violet mango candy, and leaves me wondering why I can't create anything this amazing. ","score":5},{"user":"shyndo","text":"Had a chance to check this out early and I have to say its a really solid vape. Solid balance with a nice floral finish and subtley changes as you vape it. Its acidic and then creamy with a floral ending, really quite pleasing. I find guanabana can carry most vapes but the fact that the mango is the main player with the violet is really impressing.","score":5}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"39457","name":"Mango Beauregarde"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
