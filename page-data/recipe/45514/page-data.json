I certainly am not sorry I mixed it and will be happily finishing my 40ml. But there's room for improvement in the fig: FLV Fig (0.75%ish) would be so much better instead of CAP Fig here. Its boldness would stand up better to the high % of Toasted Marshmallow, its muskiness would enhance the rather light tobacco notes, its darkness would be a much better fit for that awesome description of FIg's existential crisis.
