Adapted from my Caramel Cheesecake base, I pushed the Coconut Cookies a little higher to produce a delectable, fresh coconut cookie. Both these ingredients are just sublime and when combined, are magnificent!   This pairing fuses the best characteristics of each flavor to produce a light & crisp vanilla flavored coconut cookie accentuated with the rich & creamy notes of INW Cheesecake to produce a mind blowing cookie.\r\n\r\nFW Blood Orange is (still) the undisputed king of oranges - a somewhat bitter, slightly sweet, blood orange with a hint of grapefruit. It sits unassumingly in the background and does not dominate the cookie base in the least. Feel free to increase to 2% if you prefer a more prominent blood orange presence.\r\n\r\nGive this baby 3 to 5 days to settle and enjoy!","steep_days":"5","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-05T19:51:24.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"883","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Coconut Cookies (yc)","vendor":"INW","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Yes, We Cheesecake","vendor":"INW","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Blood Orange","vendor":"FW","millipercent":1000}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"192150","name":"3-2-1 B.O.C"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
