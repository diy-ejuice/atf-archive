It darkens them like they've been cooked...The fruit is lighter than the cake note. And there is definitely a solid nutty note as well. Will be playing around with this more, but overall I am very impressed initially. Will also steep.\r\n\r\nv2 boosts all fruits by .5%\r\n\r\nThis is very good off the shake but would suggest a few days for proper homogenization.\r\n\r\n***AS ALWAYS add sweetener to your subjective persuasion***","steep_days":"3 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-10T19:01:54.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"354","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Apple","flavor_id":"5517","vendor":"NN","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Pear","flavor_id":"3955","vendor":"BF","millipercent":3500},{"name":"50/50 Cherry","flavor_id":"6409","vendor":"OOO","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Bourbon","flavor_id":"4411","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":350},{"name":"Toasted Almond","flavor_id":"294","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Hazelnut","flavor_id":"1312","vendor":"FW","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Cake (yellow)","flavor_id":"1222","vendor":"FW","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Corn Bread","flavor_id":"2007","vendor":"OOO","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Nonna's Cake","flavor_id":"2173","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000}],"reviews":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"204973","name":"Orchard Cake"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
