I got it as I wished to learn about how to go about replicating the famous dinner lady \"Blackberry Crumble\" eLiquid. Replicating that wasn't in the spirit rather creating something to my taste which is the fun part of DIY, so this is how I went about it.  \r\nThe FW Wild Berry Cobbler offers a delicious medley of pastry, crumble & berry notes already but I want more lol ! I want more delicious ripe, syrupy and deep flavored berries a little creaminess and a crumble with all the nuances of flavor. \r\nThe FA Wow helps the pastry & helps fill out the mouthfeel of this profile which really helps to give this recipe a full mouthfeel experience and offers a little sweetness. \r\nThe deep berry trifecta of JF Forest MIx, FLV Boysenberry, & JF Strawberry Sweet all assist with extra syrupy berry deliciousness while the \r\nINW Yes We Cheesecake helps to bring the rich yet delectable creaminess here along with some base notes that assist the sweet crumble along. \r\nThe INW Shisha vanilla just helps to deliver a lovely smoothness to this over all profile through the middle. \r\nWhile pleasant enough to vape off the shake I recommend a steep of 7 days for the best flavor appreciation. \r\nI hope you enjoy this just as much as I have creating this. \r\nLet me know what you think in the comments below ! \r\nI enjoy this on a single coil sst alien coil 0.25 ohm on a recurve RDA at 60W, Enjoy! \r\n\r\nLearn more about mixing here:\r\nfacebook - https://www.facebook.com/groups/diydownunder/\r\nDiscord - https://discord.gg/kH4Fqbc\r\nYoutube - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCTCwb7ULyfJALQlehomZZQA\r\nwebsite - https://www.diydownunder.com/\r\n","steep_days":"7","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"total_reviews":4,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:50:36.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"4773","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Forest Mix","vendor":"JF","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Strawberry Sweet","vendor":"JF","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Shisha Vanilla","vendor":"INW","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Boysenberry","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":500},{"name":"wOw","vendor":"FA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Yes, We Cheesecake","vendor":"INW","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Wild Berry Cobbler ala Mode","vendor":"FW","millipercent":6000}],"reviews":[{"user":"Outofhand","score":"5","text":"Bought FW wild berry cobbler just to try this out. After a 2 week steep (kind of forgot about it in the closet), it is lovely. Mouthfeel is full, the berries are dark and jammy, supported by the cream of Yes We Cheesecake, which then leads to a full and satisfying bakery finish. "},{"user":"TamVapes","score":"5","text":"Absolutely delicious, well done. Some of my favorite concentrates used in this recipe; although, I was a bit skeptical at first with the use of Wow, but wow. It works. Pastry is great. Berry notes are great, so just bite me. You proved my skeptical side wrong.  ðŸ˜Š"},{"user":"Untitled","score":"5","text":"I also had this one now 17 days steeping. I can agree with everything @MECH_MOD_RN said. Well done!"},{"user":"MECH_MOD_RN","score":"5","text":"After a 17 day steep I  gave this a try  I wanted to let the cheesecake and wow have time to do their thing ( as off the shake I was not getting any  bakery notes.)   The berry mixture is more dark berry  then red and is a just lovely and carries through the whole  vape with a little  bright tart note at the end. The impression of just cooked  berries with syrup glaze is achieved  really well    This  combo of Berries will go in my notes for sure, for use in future mixes.   The bakery  crumble note is underneath and subtle, and  more prominent on the finish, it seems to sit in the mix  rather then gaining any  separation.    The body to the vape is  full , dense  and  lush.    The more I vaped this the more I wanted to vape this.   VERY glad I mixed up a big bottle  "}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"130699","name":"Bite Me"}}}
