AnyHoot \r\ni chose WF S&S purple drink- due to its unique drink like flavor..and the main body of this profile ...\r\nVT- Light rum & Russian vodka make up the alcohol portion(Minus the alcohol)..\r\nFLV Sweet Coconut to compliment the Lt Rum and make it more of a Malibu style rum...\r\nCap Golden Pineapple to add that tropical flair to it ..\r\nand the coup de gras.... Delosi Black licorice to give it that absinthe like taste...\r\n\r\nthis is still a work in progress and as i get more appropriate flavors i will consolidate this down to a more suitable and flavorful recipe.","steep_days":"3 (SNV)","temperature":"65","recipe_score":0,"total_reviews":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-06T23:07:52.000-05:00","best_vg":"60%","views":"2729","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Sweet and Sour Purple Drink","vendor":"WF","millipercent":5000},{"name":"Russian Vodka","vendor":"VT","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Light Rum","vendor":"VT","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Super Sweet","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":500},{"name":"Golden Pineapple","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Sweet Coconut","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":500},{"name":"Black Licorice","vendor":"DF","millipercent":250}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"109300","name":"Purple Haze"}}}
