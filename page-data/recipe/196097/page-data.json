Pineapple hits you at the forefront, coconut steps in just after the pineapple and then mango and passionfruit sit just at the end to really convince you that this is a tropical mix, sugarloaf and queen have been a combo I’ve used for some time now and there’s no mistaking the fact that there is pineapple in this recipe, this was the first time I’d used VTA coconut in a recipe and it’s a really good coconut, it’s not dry/bitter it just oozes that coconut you might taste in Malibu rum. VTA yellow passion, it’s the best passionfruit for taking higher as far as a percentage is concerned. WF is a good passionfruit but if you take it too high then you’re in dirt city (too earthy above 1%), same goes for the mango, VTA shisha I find is the best and least earthy mango amongst its competitors, if you don’t have this one in your arsenal there you’re missing out. Fizzy sherbet gives a carbonated feel.\r\n\r\nSweetener and coolant totally subjective but adds to the overall profile.\r\n\r\nIf you mix this then please rate and review accordingly :) \r\n\r\nDon’t forget to check out my one-shots as an easier alternative to trying my work.\r\n\r\nEPIC!
