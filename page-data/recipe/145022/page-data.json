The Aurora and Fizzy Sherbet base give you that limeade start.  Once I added the strawberry trinity I realized it would over power that lime so I added the Florida Key Lime and Tahity cold pressed to even it out.  I get this earthy spice from the Tahity that I love, but I also felt the sweeter florida key lime would help minimize it in the mix.  Overall I'm really enjoying this mix after a full day steep.  On SNV its super floral and you can't really taste the strawberry.  On day 2 the strawberry really pops.  I think FA Kiwi could work really well in here so there may be a V2 coming.","steep_days":"1","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:50:49.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"2390","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Lime Tahity Cold Pressed","vendor":"FA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Aurora","vendor":"FA","millipercent":750},{"name":"Fizzy Sherbet","vendor":"VT","millipercent":3500},{"name":"Shisha Strawberry","vendor":"INW","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Red Touch (strawberry)","vendor":"FA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Strawberry Sweet","vendor":"JF","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Florida Key Lime","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000}],"reviews":[{"user":"rougeislander401","text":"Tied for my favorite puck recipe, this is an excellent strawberry limeade and as always puck does a great job balancing all the required ingredients. I personally like this mix better after a 5+ day steep when the lime has calmed down a little bit and the strawberry opens up more, will be mixing again, thanks puck!"},{"user":"Urs1ne","text":"This is a great mix. I love the use of Fizzy Sherbet. I think pear would be a great addition so I look forward to a v2."},{"user":"TamVapes","text":"Excellent recipe. Very well balanced. Of course you canâ€™t go wrong with Strawberry Trinity, but mixing in a limeade profile is brilliant. Well done, thank you for sharing. ðŸ‘Œ"}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"145022","name":"Strawrora Limealis"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
