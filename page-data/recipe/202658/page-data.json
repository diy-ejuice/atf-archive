Something akin to the hard cider I make at home.\r\n\r\nIn the search for the fermented alcohol note I came across this recipe, and realized that a wine yeast is what this needed.  It is what I use to make my cider anyway.\r\n\r\nhttps://alltheflavors.com/recipes/135959\r\n\r\nMECH MOD RN hit me in the taste buds with this sparkling wine profile.  \r\n\r\nThus, we have the alcohol layer of Blood Orange Champagne for that boozy note and a little citrus to brighten things.  Golden Syrup and Sparkling wine to round it out.\r\n\r\nI wanted a nice full, pure apple flavor so I started with FA Apple Fuji with FA Pear to back it up.  It took me a while and a chat with some Fancy Folks to pin down FLV Apple as the compliment.  \r\n\r\nSuper Sweet to make it pop.\r\n\r\nI don't know if I will change the ratios, but for now. . . . I dig this.  I tested this Max VG for dual coil Kennedy with a .3 round wire and a series mech around 250W.","steep_days":"0 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-12T11:53:43.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"303","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Blood Orange Champagne","flavor_id":"8833","vendor":"VT","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Golden Syrup","flavor_id":"8887","vendor":"VT","millipercent":1300},{"name":"Sparkling Wine","flavor_id":"843","vendor":"INW","millipercent":1250},{"name":"Apple Fuji","flavor_id":"4886","vendor":"FA","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Pear","flavor_id":"411","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Super Sweet","flavor_id":"2384","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":500},{"name":"Apple","flavor_id":"4364","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1000}],"reviews":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"202658","name":"Apple Wine v.4 #DevelopedSummer"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
