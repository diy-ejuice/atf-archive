After three days the strawberry ripe and dragonfruit pull through to give it a bit of balance, resulting in a nicely balanced tangy ADV. The VBIC just rounds it off with the Marshmallow/meringue combo, giving a nice cream base, sweetness, and density.\r\nOverall, it's one of my favorite, and first recipe I ever thought was banging.\r\nI'll release it on this account on the off chance anyone still has FE Mandarin.\r\nDue to the discontinuing of FE Mandarin, however, I am in the process of making a V2, so the Tang may never die.","steep_days":"2","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"total_reviews":2,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:48:56.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"1377","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Dragonfruit","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Mandarin","vendor":"FE","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Marshmallow","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Meringue","vendor":"FA","millipercent":750},{"name":"Strawberry (ripe)","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Vanilla Bean Ice Cream","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2000}],"reviews":[{"user":"DigitalDrops","score":"5","text":"This is the only reason I have FE Mandarin and if I ever can get it I will hot air ballon into mainland China and zipline down to everyone one of the 14 million factory's in that placevtill I find the FE plant and take hostages until they release the mandarin .............that it until god trump negotiated another release , I mean he is on a roll ,right , ....right .
