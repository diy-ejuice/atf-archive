These devices need triple to quadruple the amount you'd use for a typical RDA. This is a very accessible recipe as most people already have these flavors in their stash. \r\n\r\nAfter 5-6 iterations I really like this mix. I tried INW Pineapple and FLV Mango but when I pushed them high enough to saturate the flavor it wasn't what I was looking for. The Capella Golden Pineapple and Sweet Mango can go pretty high without getting all weird. \r\n\r\nI was still missing some depth, so I went searching other mango recipes. It seemed that people were using peach to brighten things up a little and fill out the profile. So I went with all Capella and used Juicy Peach. You can't taste it much but it rounds out the profile well. \r\n","steep_days":"1 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T19:15:38.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"12232","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Golden Pineapple","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":8000},{"name":"Sweet Mango","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":12000},{"name":"Juicy Peach","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Sucralose Solutions (10% PG)","vendor":"NN","millipercent":1000}],"reviews":[{"user":"Trots79","text":""}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"110781","name":"Mango Pineapple (for nic salt pod devices) "}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
