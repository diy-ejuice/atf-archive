I haven't messed with DFS HHG all that much and wanted to do so. I also haven't used VT Love (White Chocolate) much either.  Naturally...lets put them together. I was going through my fruits and trying to figure out what would go well with a RY4 and White Chocolate. For some reason Pineapple stood out to me big time....so away we go!\r\n\r\n\r\nThere isn't a whole lot of complexity to this recipe and I was happy with the choice of flavors so at this point it was just a matter of nailing down percentages. \r\n\r\n**INW Pineapple/Cap Golden Pineapple-** This is my favorite Pineapple combo. Cap Golden is the nice sweet slightly candied pineapple which blends really nicely with the more *prickly* realistic INW Pineapple. INW is a weak bitch of a flavor but it does really well at 5%.\r\n\r\n**DFS HHG-** There ain't much to say here. It's delicious. Some Vanilla, some Caramel, tiny bit of bacco. Can't go wrong!\r\n\r\n**VT Love (White Chocolate)-** I've fallen in love with this flavor. Nice and rich, thick almost creamy white chocolate. I prefer this to LBs White Chocolate because it isn't even close to as coconut heavy as LBs version. I love coconut, but it just doesn't belong here. \r\n\r\n**V1-** I started with 7% DFS HHG, 3% Cap Golden Pineapple, 5% INW Pineapple and 2.5% VT Love. The HHG wasn't as pronounced as I was hoping for and the White Chocolate was a tad buried. The Pineapple blend was perfect just where it was.\r\n\r\n**V2-** Because both HHG and the White Chocolate were not as prominent as I hoped for I bumped the HHG to 8% and the WC to 3%. This was a step in the right direction. I liked where the WC was at but the the HHG was overpowering the Pineapple blend. \r\n\r\n**V3**- I decided to split the difference for the HHG and go with 7.5% enough to keep it out front but not enough to drowned out the pineapple. 3% Cap Golden Pineapple, 5% INW Pineapple, 3% VT WC and I'm in Heaven. I've mixed 2 or 3 30mls of this version within the last couple weeks and cannot get enough of it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSo the twist. Sometime in the middle of developing this recipe, DIY Flavor Shack for whatever reason...announced HHG will be getting a V2 with no more V1. This blows. I've started testing HHG V2 and so far I'm finding it lacks the body that V1 has. I'm not terribly sure how it will affect this recipe. However, I do plan on mixing up a batch with V2 to see what tweaks will need to be made to get it as close to this delightful version. So, on that note. Mix this shit up because I can confidently say its one of the best ways to use up the rest of your V1 HHG ;).\r\n\r\n","steep_days":"0 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":4.5,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:51:00.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"1605","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"HOLY HOLY GRAIL RY4","flavor_id":"5037","vendor":"DFS","millipercent":7500},{"name":"Golden Pineapple","flavor_id":"61","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Pineapple","flavor_id":"809","vendor":"INW","millipercent":5000},{"name":"Love DIY","flavor_id":"8920","vendor":"VT","millipercent":3000}],"reviews":[{"user":"reuben","text":"I want to thank you for this recipe it is absolutely awesome &#xD;\n"},{"user":"Foment_life","text":"I dig what you've done on a broad scale, you've taken 3 things that have absolutely no business being together and made something that is at the very least palatable. &#xD;\n&#xD;\nI'm conflicted though about it, because I feel like I want \"more\". More white chocolate, more dirty tobacco-y stuff, this for me feels like the pineapple took the wheel and never let go leaving the VT Love and HHG RY4 to hang out in support but without a whole lot of room to shine. I feel like their contribution is primarily in the textural side of the recipe and less on the actual flavor. Making for a relatively sharp, yet somehow creamy, pineapple with hints of caramel and vanilla that linger on the palate but don't assert themselves until the pineapple has finally cleared out. &#xD;\n&#xD;\nI'd love to see a somewhat more robust version of this concept that allows all 3 elements their time in the sun, though I fear that the more balance that comes to the recipe, the less it will work in practice."},{"user":"nowar","text":"This combination is definitely unusual. I can see caramel, pineapple and white chocolate working but it's not coming together here for me. I think my problem is that HHG in itself is just too sweet to start and I always like to use it with significantly less sweet flavors. INW pineapple cranks that sweet up to some next level sweetness. Also, HHG has a strong creamy element to it. White chocolate I'm already on the fence about so this portion is not exactly selling me and probably contributing to the sweetness factor. In all, I get a strong sweet pineapple start with a nice medium caramel middle and an overly sweet creamy finish. Not sure what I would change about this recipe if i were to mix it again since it's a pretty unusual combo. Unique, tasty components, just a little too sweet for my tastes. I'd maybe have tried for a more neutral cream like vanilla ruyan custard instead of love and dialed down HHG just a little bit. That or take advantage of the sweet and use a darker chocolate that needs sugar like Australian Choc or just a smidge of milk choc?"},{"user":"UnappreciatedRobot","text":"I was lucky enough to be blessed by a fellow member with some HHGRY4. Unfortunately I now hate that individual and Mr. Pizza since I have a very limited amount I can make of this recipe. Pineapple and white chocolate sounds kind of odd, and then throwing some sweet sweet RY4 on top of it sounds like an odd combination, but it works so well here. The pineapple is definitely the main flavor that you get up front. That is followed up by a very odd white chocolate/caramel/vanilla note that is very weird, but somehow works perfectly. &#xD;\n&#xD;\nThe combo of INW Pineapple and CAP Golden Pineapple is amazing, and VT Love is probably my favorite white chocolate, so I really can't find anything to complain about. If you have any HHGRY4, I highly recommend mixing this weird, but delicious, recipe!"},{"user":"LaJuanaPipa","text":"looked the combo I immediately thought it was a golden strike.
