I've used it in fruit mixes at 1% with great success previously, but because I'm wanting it to be the main note here, I started at 3%.\r\n3% ended up being a little too strong in the final mix, so I toned it down to 2.7%.\r\n\r\nCAP Cinnamon Danish Swirl is a really nice cinnamon, but the pastry is a bit lacking unless you're going to add something like INW Biscuit.\r\nI'm not really going for a pastry flavour in this drink, but the cinnamon is going to pair really well with the apple and the subtle pastry notes will add depth to the juice.\r\n3% might seem quite strong, but it'll come together as the other 'spice' flavours I'm using in this drink seem to lack cinnamon and I want that warmth!\r\n\r\nTFA Strawberry Ripe. I'll be honest, there are other strawberries out there that I like better than this one. To me, this has always seemed like a very tacky strawberry flavour.\r\nWhen I've tried to use it as a main note, it's always a bit too sickly sweet for me. What I did find out when mixing it with TFA Absinthe is that it makes a GREAT sweetener!\r\nSo we're going to use it to add sweetness to our apple juice drink! Anywhere from 0.5% to about 2% will do. I'm going to sit it at 1.5%, it's really going to add to our apple juice!\r\n\r\n\r\nAdditional ingredients!\r\n\r\n- TFA Chai Tea\r\n- TFA Horchata\r\n- TFA French Vanilla Deluxe\r\n\r\nTFA Chai Tea is a STRONG flavour that normally needs a bit of a steep to calm down. This is what's going to add the bulk of the spice to our drink. \r\nThis is going to give us a chunk of clove, some ginger and a bit of cardamom, but we're going to have to go lightly on it, because we want it to flavour our apple juice, not overtake it!\r\n\r\nTFA Horchata (not to be confused with Horchata Smooth) is another STRONG flavour. This one is really heavy on the cinnamon and it'll pair really well with both TFA Chai Tea and CAP Cinnamon Danish Swirl. We're going to add it in at 1%.\r\n\r\nTFA French Vanilla Deluxe is pretty much a vanilla custard without that eggy note. We're not using a custard because we're really not going for a latte. The tasty tasty diketones in the Deluxe variant of this vanilla are really going to smooth out the spices without affecting the overall crisp taste of our apple.","steep_days":"3","temperature":"0","recipe_score":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-10T14:51:40.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"1594","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Chai Tea","flavor_id":"346","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Cinnamon Danish Swirl","flavor_id":"35","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":3000},{"name":"French Vanilla Deluxe","flavor_id":"169","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Apple Fuji","flavor_id":"4886","vendor":"FA","millipercent":2700},{"name":"Horchata","flavor_id":"174","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Strawberry (ripe)","flavor_id":"271","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1500}],"reviews":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"18380","name":"Apple Chai"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
