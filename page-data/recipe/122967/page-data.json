The custard is filled with a tangy Rhubarb.**\r\n\r\nThe Custard is **INW Custard**.  This is a delicious and simple custard base.  I added **OOO Vanilla Custard Cheesecake** to boost the vanilla and creaminess.\r\n\r\nThe Rhubarb I choose was **DV Rhubarb Cuddle**  This is a tangy rhubarb that has been paired with Decadent Vapors Creme Anglaise, This also helps boost the custard a bit more.  \r\n\r\nThe topping is **WF SC Oats and Cream Cookie**.  This gives the oats taste and texture.  I also used **VT Honeycomb** at 1% it adds a bit of deep caramel and the honeycomb texture.\r\n\r\nHope you enjoy!  \r\nLearn more about mixing here:\r\nhttps://www.diydownunder.com/\r\nhttps://www.facebook.com/groups/diydownunder/\r\nhttps://discord.gg/kH4Fqbc\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCTCwb7ULyfJALQlehomZZQA \r\nwww.instagram.com/diydownunder","steep_days":"3","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"total_reviews":1,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:50:29.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"2141","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Rhubarb Cuddle","vendor":"DV","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Custard","vendor":"INW","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Oats & Cream Cookie SC","vendor":"WF","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Vanilla Custard Cheesecake","vendor":"OOO","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Honeycomb","vendor":"VT","millipercent":1000}],"reviews":[{"user":"Demented76","score":"5","text":"I had to play with my settings and turn my watts up higher than usual but once I hit that sweet spot this was SO freaking good.  Creamy, sweet rhubarb with subtle hints of the oats intertwined.   If you like custard and rhubarb then you have GOT to try this.  I let it steep for almost 2 weeks and it is absolutely delicious!"}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"122967","name":"Crunch my Custard Rhubarb"}}}
