So don't imagine this served cold, but it's sweet and the flavors should come off candy like. Maybe I'll change it to a straight up candy profile if this profile doesn't work out. (note: after a LONG steep, I like this one quite a bit. I do want to make it a bit more juicy, but I'm not sure how I'm going to yet.)\r\n\r\nPear: I LOVE TFA Pear, if it was up to me it's the only pear I would ever use at like 10% :) but I wanted to round out the pear for others that might want to try. I used a 1:1 FA TFA Pear mix. I also added a little bit of TFA Quince to round it off.\r\nRaspberry: I used what I had, INW and TFA once again to give it a fuller flavor.\r\nCactus: I used a small amount of cactus to add a juicy mouth-feel.\r\nFuji: From my experience with fuji I thought that it would mix well with the profile I'm looking at.\r\n\r\npicture credit: yonanas UK","steep_days":"3 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"total_reviews":5,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:49:06.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"3977","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Pear","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Pear","vendor":"FA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Quince","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":300},{"name":"Raspberry","vendor":"INW","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Super Sweet","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":500},{"name":"Cactus","vendor":"INW","millipercent":500},{"name":"Raspberry (sweet)","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Fuji","vendor":"FA","millipercent":500}],"reviews":[{"user":"Seef","score":"5","text":"This juice is addictive. Normally raspberry is too strong in mixes, but this is perfect. It's sweet, it's juicy and light candy. It's awesome. I don't think the super sweet is necessary, but definitely give this one a shake. "},{"user":"vagdal","score":"5","text":"Thanks for sharing I let it steep for 5 days and I really like your recipe! All those flavors are great combination for a perfect sweet juicy summer vape!"},{"user":"ObiWanCannoli","score":"5","text":"I had been working on a unique blue raspberry flavor for a couple of months when I stumbled upon this recipe. My recipe also used inw raspberry at 1% as well as SC Pear(which I VERY highly recommend!) and once I mixed this up it was very close to mine. Raspberry and pear work amazingly together and I have tasted pear in many blue raspberry products. The apple and quince are a nice touch, although quite subtle as the inw raspberry tends to be a bit of a bully in many recipes. All said, this is a great, flavorful and juicy recipe and definitely worthy of a mix."},{"user":"kindground","score":"5","text":"I love this mix. Very sweet and juicy. The INW Raspberry is the star here with that pear lingering on your palate. Nicely done. This will be on my list of fruit mixes to keep coming back to for sure. "},{"user":"Annathiika","score":"5","text":"My very first juice I bought over and over again was a pear-raspberry mix and the profile really appeals to me. While this recipe tastes very different from that flavor in that the raspberry takes the foreground, as INW Raspberry does, at least as a SNV, it's fresh and very tasty. Thanks!"}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"31208","name":"Pear Raspberry Juice"}}}
