Edited to be tailored for Pod / MTL Devices. Tested on a Smoant Pasito @ 25mg 15w\r\n\r\n#####**Notes**\r\n*I'm only going to note changes I have done, if you want to view the original flavour notes head to the OG*\r\n\r\n**WF Blueberry Gummy Candy** - I upped this concentrate by a mere .5%. It just boosted the candiness and gummy feeling a little bit and better incorporated the blueberry in this concentrate with the recipe. \r\n\r\n**FW Blueberry** - I upped this by 1% while adjusting for MTL Devices. I found that the blueberry note was really lackluster in a lower-powered device. This helped immensely with the blueberry flavour. I started at .5% but it was still too in the background to even notice. \r\n\r\n**CAP Jelly Candy** - Upped by .5% to battle the % increases of the blueberries, and to help with the gumminess of the recipe. This probably wasn't 100% needed but hey, it works!\r\n\r\nMake sure to leave a review if you enjoyed this recipe, thank you!","steep_days":"0 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T09:27:51.000-05:00","best_vg":"50%","views":"1265","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Blueberry Gummy Candy SC","flavor_id":"10405","vendor":"WF","millipercent":5000},{"name":"Jelly Candy","flavor_id":"2170","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Blueberry","flavor_id":"1201","vendor":"FW","millipercent":3500}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"181577","name":"Blueberry Gummy Candy (Pod / MTL)"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
