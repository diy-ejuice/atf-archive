Everyone has their idea of what a fruit salad is comprised of.

I chose SC Strawberry(SC) at 1% and FA Strawberry at 2%. I have always preferred Flavour Arts Strawberry over TFA so this was an easy decision. I used RF Strawberry Super Concentrate to boost FA as it can sometimes not pack enough 'umph'.\r\n  \r\nThe melon part was interesting because I had just received FLV Wild Melon in the mail. Upon opening that concentrate(and the RF Strawberry), I knew I had to make something special with them. I wanted a bit of watermelon as well, as a background note. I have always liked FAs version. Never been a fan of LA Watermelon. It just tastes like rancid lipstick to me.\r\n  \r\nTFA Philippine Mango seemed like the perfect addition to this mix. I only had a real Philippine mango once in my life(i usually purchase the more citrus-like Puerto Rican variety at the local supermarket). But what I remembered about the Philippine variety was the sweet light and fleshy taste. And that was definitely what I wanted to add to this mix. \r\n  \r\nI added FA Oba Oba in because I can't stand even the tiniest percentage of INW Cactus. The taste is just....ugh. And I found Oba Oba to brighten, sweeten, and slightly juice up my fruits.\r\n  \r\nNow. I wanted to add something unique to my recipe. I wanted the taste of spearmint, but not an up front kind of a spearmint. I chose CAPs because it's the most authentic. However, it needed a little kick to be more authentic. This is when I decided to add some Koolada. It was the perfect pairing. After taste testing, I decided something was lacking. And that something was lime. I purposely avoided Cold-Pressed, etc., and settled on Capella Lime because it's much 'softer'. \r\n  \r\n**Do not take it upon yourself to copy and publish this recipe over to ELR.
