This probably could be tweaked a little but I'm enjoying it as it is for now. \r\n\r\nBenefits from a day or so of steeping to settle in, and for the lemon to sit further back and add the tart note I was looking for. The VT Sherbet works well here, giving a nice little fizz to the profile.  I guess you could substitute the JF Sweet Strawberry for Capella's version, but it's a candy-like strawberry that adds to the fake strawberry in these sweets, I think.  Anyway, hope you enjoy and feedback is always welcome.\r\n\r\nHappy vaping :)","steep_days":"1 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T23:37:21.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"1273","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Raspberry (sweet)","flavor_id":"267","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Strawberry (ripe)","flavor_id":"271","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Strawberry Sweet","flavor_id":"4745","vendor":"JF","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Fizzy Sherbet","flavor_id":"8878","vendor":"VT","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Sour Lemon","flavor_id":"8971","vendor":"VT","millipercent":750},{"name":"Jelly Candy","flavor_id":"2170","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Super Sweet","flavor_id":"2384","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":250}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"138323","name":"Strawberry Sherbets"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
