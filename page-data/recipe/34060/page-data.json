I let it have about 36 hours steep, didn't take long at all for this delicate flower to work its way into this Strap-On wonderfully. Honeysuckle complements this fruit mix without getting too floral at 2%. It actually seems to enhance the inherent sweetness in the fruits. Kinda reminds me of Honey Pearry. Kudos, Havohej! Thank you for this!  "}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"34060","name":"Suckle My Strap-On"}}}
