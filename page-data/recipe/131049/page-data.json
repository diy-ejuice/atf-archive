When I got FA Joker in the mail I wanted to try my take on a cannoli using  that as my shell flavor instead of biscuit and joy and my preferred creamy filling flavors.\r\n\r\nJoker is a very sweet fried dough so no sweetener is needed here. It has an almost glazed, powdered sugar taste to it on it's own. 6% seems to be the preferred single flavor ratio. I tried going lower than 5% but I really like this flavor being very forward in the mix so 5% it is. \r\n\r\nI went with the 3-2-1 cheesecake trinity but removed the graham crust, not wanting it to interfere with my crust layer.\r\n\r\nAt this point, I thought it was tasting pretty good but didn't have enough body to the filling flavor. Cap VC seems to fit the bill well and add a nice eggy note that a cannoli should have. \r\n\r\nFinally, I wanted a bit of a lemon zest on top to add some depth to the flavor and keep it interested. FA Lemon Sicily works perfect for this, tieing in with both the sweetness of the Joker and the tang of the cheesecake flavors. \r\n\r\nI may still adjust the percentages a bit but I think it is good enough to share at this point. Feedback is very much welcome. Hope you like it!
