I've made a few changes and figured I'd put it out there. The FW Blueberry, FLV Blueberry Muffin, FA Blilberry, and INW raspberry combo make a very sweet, and almost realistic blueberry. I sometimes use FA Fuji in place of the INW Raspberry, but I like my blueberrys a little darker with a custard. Speaking of custard I use the good ol Cap V1 VC as my go to custard, along with TFA cheesecake graham crust to provide that depth. And of couse I had to add in the combo of FLV Cream and INW Shisha Vanilla, made famous from the recipe \"Longing\" to finish of the cream base. Being the custard fan I am, I could vape this and Coop34's Raspberry Custard forever and probably not get sick of it. Let sit for a good 7 days, as with any custard it gets better with time. Hope you all enjoy!","steep_days":"7","temperature":"400","recipe_score":5,"updated_at":"2020-12-12T11:50:47.000-05:00","best_vg":"65%","views":"3795","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Vanilla Custard","flavor_id":"131","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Cream","flavor_id":"604","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Shisha Vanilla","flavor_id":"841","vendor":"INW","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Cheesecake (graham Crust)","flavor_id":"152","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Blueberry Muffin","flavor_id":"608","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Blueberry","flavor_id":"1201","vendor":"FW","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Bilberry","flavor_id":"533","vendor":"FA","millipercent":250},{"name":"Raspberry","flavor_id":"667","vendor":"INW","millipercent":500}],"reviews":[{"user":"chillibenny","text":"This is my new favourite, well done.&#xD;\nBeautiful flavour but only once steeped!!","score":5},{"user":"bhamcatmaybe","text":"this is the best blueberry custard i've tried- i really love the sparing use of bilberry which i find to be too musty in other recipes. flv's blueberry muffin was a great addition as well, really rounds out the berry flavor. after 10 days this stuff is magic. thanks for sharing!","score":5}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"40853","name":"Blueberry Custard"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
