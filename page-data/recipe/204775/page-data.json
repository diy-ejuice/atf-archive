It's got all the elements to build a foundation for a great cinnamon doughnut, Paired with WF Angel Cake, it gives the recipe that yellow cake-like body. WF Glazed Donut is amazing! A greasy fried doughnut with a glaze of icing and a very nice pastry feel to it. The exhale is smooth and sugary with this flavor. The glazed part of the doughnut needed a little help so I used FW Cake Batter Dip. When paired with WF Glazed Donut, It's a wonderfully crafted Icing packed with creaminess and body.\r\n\r\nPlease enjoy and share your feedback!","steep_days":"3","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"total_reviews":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T22:34:19.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"681","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Super Sweet","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":500},{"name":"Angel Cake SC","vendor":"WF","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Cake Batter Dip","vendor":"FW","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Cinnamon Roll","vendor":"FW","millipercent":4500},{"name":"Glazed Donut SC","vendor":"WF","millipercent":2000}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"204775","name":"Cinnamon Glazed Doughnut"}}}
