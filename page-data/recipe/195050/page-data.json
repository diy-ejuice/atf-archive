It’s everything a lime should be and nothing it shouldn’t. This is just an attempt at building around it as a primary note. I’m using it as the central flavour in a lime curd. \r\n\r\nFA Meringue and TFA Toasted Marshmallow make a pretty convincing Pavlova base. \r\n\r\nVT Persian Lime, LB VIC and INW Custard make up our lime curd. \r\n\r\nThe rest is really up to you. I added very small amounts of Mango, Raspberry, Blueberry, Blackberry and Strawberry for the topping, but feel free to mess with this if you don’t have these specific flavours.\r\n\r\n Just keep them at very low percentages, to prevent them from stomping all over the pavlova and lime curd base.
