Remix month is here and cereal vapes are big to clone. This is one I've been working on for a while so it's not a remix of a commercial juice. However, this is fucking delicious. FW Fruit rings is important. It's much better than TFA fruit circles.  On top of this, adding TFA berry crunch is going to give it more complexity instead of just lemon while keeping the cereal element there. Cap's new silver line fruit circles is a necessity. This adds more of the lime to the cereal. For me, fruit loops isn't just lemon. The mixture of creams works great and gives it a nice milky backbone. The cheesecake adds some cream and lends to the cereal texture. Sweetener is there, because, it's a sugary cereal. This doesn't put it in the too sweet category, just the perfect amount of sweetness, that really helps tame the lemon, and balances all the flavors together. This is a week steep minimum and best after 2. Before that the flavor will be a bit weak, and the creams won't really come out. Hope you enjoy!","steep_days":"7","temperature":"0","recipe_score":4,"updated_at":"2020-12-12T17:11:17.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"2296","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Bavarian Cream","flavor_id":"145","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Berry Crunch","flavor_id":"136","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2750},{"name":"Cheesecake (graham Crust)","flavor_id":"152","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Fruit Circles","flavor_id":"8742","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Fruit Rings","flavor_id":"1285","vendor":"FW","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Lemon Meringue Pie","flavor_id":"84","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Meringue","flavor_id":"530","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Super Sweet","flavor_id":"2384","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":250}],"reviews":[{"user":"KylezKloudz","text":"Nice tasting stuff! üëçüëç Definitely spot on Fruit Loops.
