Check out his recipes on this site and on DIY or Die.\r\n\r\nThis is an alternate take on the massively popular Bronuts recipe with the Bavarian Cream.  I decided to give Capella's yellow cake a try as I'm trying to avoid fructose, sugar syrup, and other things of that nature.  My first batch was 1% yellow cake and it didn't seem strong enough.  Bumped it up to 2% and it was much better.  IMO, Capellas yellow cake needs a steep so give this one about 2 weeks.  At first it tastes super artificial but mellows out long term.\r\n\r\nThanks once again to Wayne for providing this recipe.","steep_days":"14","temperature":"0","recipe_score":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-10T14:55:01.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"2941","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Bavarian Cream","flavor_id":"145","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Chocolate Glazed Doughnut","flavor_id":"34","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":7000},{"name":"Yellow Cake","flavor_id":"5854","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Joy","flavor_id":"401","vendor":"FA","millipercent":750},{"name":"Biscuit","flavor_id":"642","vendor":"INW","millipercent":750}],"reviews":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"31193","name":"Bavarian Cream Bronuts Remix"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
