The King himself would approve. \r\n\r\nI'd usually use FA banana in this ratio with Banana Cream, but it got lost amongst the PB and Graham. It steers the recipe more towards a Runts/candy taste, but I think it works well. I don't have TFA's Ripe Banana but I understand it's v similar to FLV's so feel free to sub. Likewise I don't have LA Banana Cream - it may be better, it may be worse, it may be identical. Have at it. \r\n\r\nCAP PB and FA Peanut in this ratio make my perfect Peanut Butter. I like a health food store, no added sugar/salt/oil type. Side note - since those PBs are 100% peanut, FA peanut should be great standalone, right? Wrong! It tastes awful. But it adds the perfect amount of bite and dryness here. \r\n\r\nTFA GCC works fine if it's all you have, I prefer CAPs because I find it slightly spicier. I've also tried a combo of the two but it seemed to be needlessly over complicating the recipe. \r\n\r\nFA Maple Syrup is great here - it adds a dark sweetness and is much more interesting that caramel or butterscotch. There's also a slight smokiness that plays into the s'mores vibe. \r\n\r\nFW Butterscotch Ripple compliments every flavour here, and just fills out the background notes. It blends very well with Banana Cream. \r\n\r\nThere you go. If you're interested, I mix at 70VG, 2mg. \r\n\r\nThis was actually very good after just leaving overnight, but you probably couldn't call it a s'more - it's too light on Graham Cracker. That comes through over a week or two. \r\n\r\nUh huh huh.
