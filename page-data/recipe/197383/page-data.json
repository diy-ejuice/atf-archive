The cookies in Little Debbies Oatmeal Cream Pies are super chewy and dark. I used VT Xmas Pudding to help achieve that. It adds that chew that this recipe needs and the spice and raisin notes really help the authenticity. I added TFA Oatmeal Cookie in to boost the Oatmeal note and make sure that it doesn’t get covered up or steep out. \r\n\r\nThe cream that’s inside of these suckers is fluffy and sticky and it has a slight vanilla note. It reminds me a lot of that Jet Puffed Marshmallow Cream that comes in a jar. I had consider OOO Marshmallow Vanilla because it’s my favorite, but I thought maybe the vanilla would come through too much and turn it into more of a frosting. FA Marshmallow gives me what I need without the vanilla. The FA isn’t fluffy enough by itself. I used OOO whipped cream to fill both of those roles and make the cream filling exactly what it needs to be. \r\n\r\nLastly I sweeten with FW Sweetness at 1%.
