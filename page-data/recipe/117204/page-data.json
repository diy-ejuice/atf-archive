Kind of been in a lull where I only make juice to vape not for fun. That being said I've got some ideas. This is something I mixed a while back and didn't really think anything of it. Well after a month steep it is absolutely amazing.\r\n\r\nMy idea was to make a boysenberry maple syrup based custard as well as try some new flavors out that I hadn't used.\r\n\r\nThe syrup - the boysenberry can be quite strong and off putting so blueberry was added to round it out a bit, and the maple syrup is there well....to you know make it a syrup\r\n\r\nCustard - I believe I had pulled the custard idea from dewey and it works well, Oak Milk i felt bridged the gap between the syrup and the custard to make it a more cohesive flavor.\r\n\r\nYou can vape this after a week or two, but the boysenberry is strong. If that's your thing absolutely go for it but after a month that rich custard comes through and the maple tones down a bit.","steep_days":"30","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:50:26.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"1937","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Custard Premium","flavor_id":"9118","vendor":"FA","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Devon Cream","flavor_id":"4223","vendor":"CC","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Oak Milk","flavor_id":"1668","vendor":"FE","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Blueberry","flavor_id":"1201","vendor":"FW","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Boysenberry","flavor_id":"614","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Maple Syrup","flavor_id":"509","vendor":"FA","millipercent":500}],"reviews":[{"user":"MrZigglesworth","text":"This was definitely a treat to try. I agree with Seakow that if you are patient everything blends together really nice after about 2+ weeks. The maple tones down, the fruits settle in and blend with what is already an amazing custard. Mix this up and leave in a drawer for a while, I promise you will enjoy it."}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"117204","name":"Berried Custard"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
