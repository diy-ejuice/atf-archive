It has a perfect balance between the actual fruits, cereal and milk. It delivers a nice crunchy fruity cereal vape with the perfect amount of milk. Seriously addictive and delicious.\r\n\r\nThis is easily one of the best recipe i have ever created.\r\n\r\nSome people prefer a steep of 2 weeks, i really enjoy this recipe after 7 days. If you don't like it after 1 week let it steep for another week and try again.\r\n\r\nThe base was inspired by Pebbles from NotCharlesManson.\r\n\r\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/60p8xj/berry_pebbles_a_blueberry_strawberry_cereal_with/\r\n","steep_days":"3","temperature":"0","recipe_score":3.5,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:49:12.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"1513","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Bilberry","flavor_id":"533","vendor":"FA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Blueberry (wild)","flavor_id":"215","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Strawberry (ripe)","flavor_id":"271","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Sweet Strawberry","flavor_id":"121","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Lemon Lime","flavor_id":"83","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":500},{"name":"Vienna Cream","flavor_id":"516","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1250},{"name":"Meringue","flavor_id":"530","vendor":"FA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Sweet Cream","flavor_id":"183","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1250},{"name":"Graham Cracker Clear","flavor_id":"325","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Sugar Cookie","flavor_id":"115","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":3500},{"name":"Hazelnut","flavor_id":"1312","vendor":"FW","millipercent":500}],"reviews":[{"user":"Deschain","text":"I've steeped this for over 2 weeks now. I've tried it earlier as well, and to me it doesn't feel like the taste changed that drastically in the mean time. For now, I just can't seem to taste the defined profile in the description. It doesn't taste awful or anything, it just doesn't seem to taste like anything specific to me, like it's a mish-mash of the flavors above and they just don't really come together to make a recognizable taste."},{"user":"mk0","text":"At first I thought this was eh and left it in my drawer.  2 weeks later I tried it again and it was awesome!
