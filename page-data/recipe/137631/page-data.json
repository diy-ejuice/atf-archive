White Mocha is lovely and put a dash of cinnamon in it and something magical happens. It's my Starbucks secret for you. I like even better in coconut milk.\r\n\r\nThis is really milky but very little coffee, so if you want more just increase WF Brazilian Coffee up to 0.75% or more to your taste.\r\n\r\nNotes and details of this mix will be added shortly.\r\n\r\nEnjoy, be queer & vape on.","steep_days":"5 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:50:42.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"1629","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"White Chocolate","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Smooth Cappuccino Cream","vendor":"WF","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Rich Cinnamon","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":100},{"name":"Holy Vanilla","vendor":"DFS","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Cream Milky Undertone PG","vendor":"OOO","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Coconut Custard SC","vendor":"WF","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Sweetness","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":500},{"name":"Brazilian Coffee SC","vendor":"WF","millipercent":100}],"reviews":[{"user":"MECH_MOD_RN","text":"This is a spot on  Starbucks style \" cinnamon dolce\" white mocha, which is my favorite Starbucks beverage .  On the inhale you get a sweet milky light vanilla/ coconut  note that transitions to white chocolate with cinnamon and light coffee.    If you want more of a coffee note you can easily up the coffee.  This is easily an all day vape for me and am in love ,   well done !!!!
