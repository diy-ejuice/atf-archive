Red Burley, Virginia Tobacco, and Kentucky Blend.\r\n\r\nAdded a touch of FLV Cream and FLV Bourbon to act as a bridge between the apple pie and tobaccos.  The slight suggestion of booze from the bourbon has this flavor profile leaning towards an apple pie moonshine.  Got me to thinking about fall weather sitting around a campfire sipping moonshine from a jar (Mason).\r\n\r\nOff the SNV this is a great mix . . . will update after a steep and, possibly, slightly bringing the caramel and bourbon notes a little more forward in the mix.  As of now, I'm enjoying this immensely!\r\n\r\n","steep_days":"1 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-06T23:07:25.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"1013","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Apple Pie","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Dulce De Leche","vendor":"JF","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Red Burley","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Virginia Tobacco","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Cream","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Kentucky Blend","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Rich Cinnamon","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":150},{"name":"Bourbon","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":500},{"name":"Fuji Apple","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":2000}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"60738","name":"Capt.
