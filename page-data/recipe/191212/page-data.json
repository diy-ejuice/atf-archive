ID10-T's Strawberry trinity and then combining it with one of my favorite light and fluffy \"Cream\" layers, I've found this recipe works well for people who are partly to severely \"Blind\" to Strawberries. The (FA) Lemon Sicily @ 0.25% is not present after the recommended steep time, yet aids in bringing the strawberries forward in the mix. The recipe was created and tested on a dual coil RTA @ 0.12 ohms and mod set to TC Mode @ 75watts and 420 degrees F. Recommended Steep is 14-30 days.","steep_days":"14","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-02T10:29:57.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"3581","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Lemon Sicily","vendor":"FA","millipercent":250},{"name":"Shisha Strawberry","vendor":"INW","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Red Touch (strawberry)","vendor":"FA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Strawberry Sweet","vendor":"JF","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Sweet Cream","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Sweetener","vendor":"FW","millipercent":750},{"name":"Vanilla Ice Cream","vendor":"LB","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Vanilla Whipped Cream","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1000}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"191212","name":"Strawberry & Cream (There's Never Enough) by \"Mixalott\""}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
