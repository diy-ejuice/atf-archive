House Atreides rules Arrakis, the home world of the spice Melange. The spice Melange gives you longer life and expands your consciousness but beware...it's highly addictive and once you start you can never stop. \r\n\r\nThis recipe is how I imagine Paul Maud'dib and his mother, Lady Jessica might consume Melange. It's a spicy tea with a light fruity back note.
