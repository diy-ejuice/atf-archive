Based this off of an OG POG but didn’t want to use passionfruit so i used peach instead. Add the Bavarian cream to help smooth everything over peaches and citrus's both then to be a little harsh. Taste fine off the shake but needs to steep for 3-5 days so everything can settle down.

A POG with peach instead of passionfruit and grapefruit instead of guava. The peach comes in underneath and realistic to the point of almost feeling the fuzz on it, while the grapefruit and orange blend together with some of the peach on top into some kind of delicious fanciful peach citrus hybrid fruit. I can taste some cream in there with the peach so it’s not just an all-fruit no-cream mix, but who doesn’t love peaches and cream? The whole thing is just pleasant, fairly easy to vape, and full-flavored and satisfying. The cream doesn’t fully mitigate a little harshness here. I only get it building over time when chain vaping the stuff, but it’s hard not to because it’s so tasty. "}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"158308","name":"Pogged Out"}}}
