I came up with  this one to help U/ICbillows when he needed help with the sweet currant. The cap sweet currant is a tangy jammy currant flavor and it adds that dark currant tang to the mix that the LA Lemonade compliments beautifully ofc all this tangy sourness needs some sweetness so i added my favorite duo of strawberries into this to get extend the syrupy vibe I was getting from it. The dragon fruit is in there to emulsify and bring everything together. This was my first time helping someone and i hope i did not steer him wrong.","steep_days":"0 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:50:58.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"1316","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Dragonfruit","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":250},{"name":"Lemonade","vendor":"LA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Strawberry (ripe)","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":750},{"name":"Sweet Currant","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1250},{"name":"Super Sweet","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":750}],"reviews":[{"user":"sinsayers","text":"love this mix.
