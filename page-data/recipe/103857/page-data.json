If you don't have OOO Vanilla Custard Cheesecake, you can order direct from OOO or on Amazon, or DIY Vapor Supply has it. I highly recommend this flavor concentrate. \r\nThe peaches used for the yogurt base, FA White Peach and Cap Yellow Peach. These 2 together work very well with the yogurt. \r\nThen for the yummy Flip cobbler pieces and crunch I went with, WF Oatmeal and Cream Cookie SC and FLV Cinnamon Crunch. \r\nThis may become one of my new all day vapes, especially for summer. \r\nEnjoy!!!","steep_days":"7","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"total_reviews":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T20:32:35.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"1547","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Greek Yogurt","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":5000},{"name":"Vanilla Custard Cheesecake","vendor":"OOO","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Cinnamon Crunch","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Peach White","vendor":"FA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Yellow Peach","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Oats & Cream Cookie SC","vendor":"WF","millipercent":1500}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"103857","name":"Flip my Peach Yogurt"}}}
