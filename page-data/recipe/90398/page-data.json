I used the black currant to give the raspberry a jammy texture and the strawberry ripe to brighten it up. the recipe is pretty sweet on its own, so you can certainly leave out the super sweet. its great off the shake, but better if it steeps for 3-4 days. if you want to add a little mint to the mix, add 2% of fw cr√®me de menth. it sounds weird, but it's tasty!","steep_days":"3 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-02T15:37:01.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"1113","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Raspberry V2","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Raspberry","vendor":"INW","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Black Currant","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":500},{"name":"French Vanilla Icecream","vendor":"HS","millipercent":500},{"name":"Strawberry (ripe)","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Vanilla Bean Ice Cream","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Super Sweet","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":250}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"90398","name":"Raspberry Beret"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
