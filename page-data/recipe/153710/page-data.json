MB captain rum is pretty darn authentic to Captain Morgan spiced rum with just the right amount of boozy notes. The lime is present in the back like you want it to be and FLV cola assists with the citrus note. WF rum and cola help with the rum and sweetness of a cola. Swirl rounds out any sharpness.
