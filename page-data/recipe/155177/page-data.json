Peach tea with accents of rose, berry, and milk. I can pick out all the parts that are supposed to be there, but the berry and milk take a backseat to the rose and peach, while the tea does seem to come through about right. It’s not muddled, but it does seem overly busy with both the excessive peach and a tiny bit of berry accent. Overall it tastes good, but it tastes like a recipe designed by committee, which of course it was. It seems like this could be two separate recipes, rose milk tea with berry and rose milk tea with peach, and it would be better than having them both in one. At the very least, the peach needs to be turned way down.","score":4},{"user":"Brandon451","text":"Wow this is really really good.
