A perfect blend of wintergreen, anise, and hints of sarsaparilla. It's a bit thin tasting, so it needs a little help with depth. We get that much needed help from FLV Vanilla Bean and FLV Caramel.\r\n\r\nFLV Vanilla Bean: This has some elements similar to FLV Cream, but a bit more tame and a lot less dairy. Those dairy notes are replaced by a soft vanilla overtone that shows up just enough to keep the root beer authentic.\r\n\r\nFLV Caramel: Our dark, syrupy sweetness. We don't need much here, at .5% it barely shows through at all. Lower than .25% it wasn't present enough, and at .5% it's almost too much. Wanting to balance the higher % of caramel, I added a tiny bit of FLV Lime to brighten up the back end and finish the recipe.\r\n\r\nFLV Lime: It took just a few drops to turn this around and make a perfect bright soda finish.\r\n\r\nFLV Ginger: My first test at .25% this didn't show up quite enough. .75% was too high for my taste and it started to wash out the more delicate notes in the Root Beer. Dialed back to .4% it seems to sit just right. Present, but not overly so.\r\n\r\nI may come back and tinker with this, but I'm pretty happy with where it is right now.","steep_days":"3","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"updated_at":"2020-12-12T10:33:41.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"2353","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Root Beer","flavor_id":"8567","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":2250},{"name":"Ginger","flavor_id":"4415","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":400},{"name":"Vanilla Bean","flavor_id":"8573","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Caramel","flavor_id":"612","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":500},{"name":"Lime","flavor_id":"634","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":330}],"reviews":[{"user":"Slippaz","text":"If you're already into the carbonation effect from FLV Root Beer, this is definitely one that's worth trying.  The FLV Ginger does an excellent job of transforming the root beer, and the brightness of that lime really locks everything in.  The one (slight) shortcoming here is that, if you're used to vaping actual root beer recipes, you're also used to mixing it at a higher percentage.  And at 2.25% the effervescent effect does fade into a \"flat\" and somewhat syrupy mouthfeel toward the end of the exhale.  It doesn't bother me at all because it's still delicious, but it's worth noting.  Obviously these are the limitations inherent in transforming FLV Root Beer, and this is absolutely a recipe I'm going to keep on tap at all times from here on out.  Excellent work!","score":5},{"user":"ID10-T","text":"I've never had ginger beer this interesting and complex, but I want to. It tastes like half delicious ginger ale half deeply authentic root beer, with a little twist of lime. FLV Root Beer already has that foamy finish that mimics the frothy head on a frosty mug. Combined with that bite from the ginger and citrus, this does a carbonated beverage just as good, if not better, than anything I've tried in a vape. Awesome stuff!
