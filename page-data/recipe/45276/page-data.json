This mix was inspired by a simple, real life desert I make in the summertime with cake, cream cheese, sugar, and peaches. The breakdown:\r\n\r\nFA Apricot - This adds another dimension to the peach flavor to give it a little more complexity\r\nFW Yellow Cake - is the main cake note in the desert\r\nLA Cream Cheese Icing - is the cream cheese and sugar mixture that gets baked into the dessert\r\nFA Liquid Amber - This flavor adds the much needed baked note to the peaches\r\nCAP Sugar Cookie - yellow cake needed some help and cap sugar cookie works with yc perfectly to add some body and weight to the cake portion without making it too dry.\r\nFLV Peach - is the main peach note, this is a great peach flavor, not nearly as harsh as some peach flavors can be, this makes the recipe vape-able right after a mix.\r\nFW Tres Leches - The hardest part of this mix was making a wet cake, and tres leches does a wonderful job of giving the cake a bit more weight while adding some creamy goodness to help the custard and cream cheese icing out\r\nFLV Vanilla Custard - this flavor is used to add some depth to the cream cheese icing and make it thicker and creamier.\r\n\r\nYou can vape this mix right after a shake but the whole thing comes together better after a few days to a week.","steep_days":"7 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"updated_at":"2020-12-12T14:05:20.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"5086","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Armenia (apricot)","flavor_id":"507","vendor":"FA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Cake (yellow)","flavor_id":"1222","vendor":"FW","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Cream Cheese Icing","flavor_id":"2380","vendor":"LA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Liquid Amber","flavor_id":"476","vendor":"FA","millipercent":300},{"name":"Peach","flavor_id":"629","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Sugar Cookie","flavor_id":"115","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Tres Leches","flavor_id":"1446","vendor":"FW","millipercent":500},{"name":"Vanilla Custard","flavor_id":"633","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1000}],"reviews":[{"user":"dougc","text":"This is delicious Emily!
