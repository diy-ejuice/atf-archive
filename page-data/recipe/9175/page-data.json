This recipe definitely made it worth it. I waited a week just to give the VBIC some time and man is this good. I've seen FA Joy used as a cone-type flavoring before and it does a great job in this recipe as well. I would definitely recommend this if you want to try a traditional profile with an excellent twist. It is indeed......DANK"},{"user":"RuntDastardly","text":"I love this crazy recipe. Only a mad genius would think to combine these flavors, but man, do they ever work. Strangely delicious, super original and incredibly addicting.
