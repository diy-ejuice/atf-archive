Fairly sweet.\r\nPineapple Juice- Solo tested at 2%- A darker pineapple than the above. As the name suggests, a much more juciey type pineapple, like you'd expect in a carton. Ticker, almost as if its a Pineapple Puree.\r\nIce Pineapple- Solo tested at 2%- Theres the ice I was after. I can tell I wont be needing to add any coolada or WS23 to this mix. A very cool Pineapple, with a very slight menthol taste,\r\n\r\n\r\nOverall I feel this is a perfect, cool, fresh, pineapple sorbet :D\r\n\r\nLet me know your thoughts :):)","steep_days":"1 (SNV)","temperature":"50","recipe_score":0,"total_reviews":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T17:35:04.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"1778","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Lemon Lime","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":4500},{"name":"Golden Pineapple","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":5500},{"name":"Ice Mango","vendor":"VT","millipercent":500},{"name":"Lime Cordial","vendor":"VT","millipercent":250},{"name":"Ice Pineapple","vendor":"VT","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Pineapple Juice","vendor":"VT","millipercent":1250},{"name":"Sugarloaf Pineapple","vendor":"VT","millipercent":750},{"name":"Super Sweet","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":750},{"name":"Mango","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1250}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"109463","name":"Pineapple Sorbet"}}}
