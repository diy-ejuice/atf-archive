Yes, I know, a little arrogant; but, I have mixed several cookies and cream by various mixers, and while they have been great, most lack that Oreo taste and texture that I associate with a cookies and cream. So with that said, this is my take on a real cookies and cream. It's not perfect, but it's pretty damn close.\r\nAs any mixer can attest to, chocolate is hard to get right. Especially when you're going for an Oreo tastes and texture. Oreo's have a distinct chocolate taste unlike a chocolate bar. It's more of a dry, dark, gritty taste with a luscious cream smashed between. I went through 7 versions to try to get the Oreo right. My first choice of cookie was FA Cookie, and that was exactly the right cookie to start with. The chocolate was a different matter. I started with TPA Double Chocolate(clear) at 2%. And while the chocolate was there, it was too \"in-your-face\" and slightly bitter so I brought it down to 1%. That seemed pretty close. I also tried combining INW Milk Chocolate, and while it's a good chocolate to work with, it tended to make the recipe into more of a chocolate shake, and that was not what I was going for. I ended up settling on TPA Double Chocolate (clear) at .75% and it seems spot on, especially when combined with FA Cookie at 2%. Now the cream. This was probably the easiest of the layers. TPA Bavarian Cream is one of the best flavors in any mixers arsenal. It's creamy, rich, and has a depth that some creams fall short on. When paired with CAP Sweet Cream at .5%, it lends itself well to that sweet and creamy center of an Oreo. Last, but not least, the TPA Vanilla Bean Ice Cream. My original version didn't have this flavor and while it was a good cookies and cream, it was more like a double cream Oreo cookie. It seemed to need a little extra push into a Real Cookies and Cream and TPA Vanilla Bean Ice Cream at 1% did the trick. I added CAP Super Sweet at .25% to sweeten things up a bit, and voilà, The Real Cookies and Cream! \r\nCan be a shake and vape but is best after a 3 day steep.\r\nVisit Freedom To Mix on Discord https://discord.gg/SmSc8Ef\r\nVisit Freedom To Mix on FaceBook https://www.facebook.com/groups/415341418920740/ \r\n\r\nPlease comment, mix, and or rate,....it makes us all better mixers.

I dont like chocolate vapes normally, but this one is perfect, dry crumbly texture just like an oreo, and ZERO band-aid off notes. This is my new ADV, thank you. Im going to try this with JF bavarian cream and see if it makes it even better.","score":5},{"user":"beeker","text":"Clearly this recipe benefitted from the 7 revision cycles, as you nailed the Oreo Cookies &amp; Cream Ice Cream flavor perfectly. A very well balanced juice that tastes great and tastes exactly like its name, thanks folkart!","score":5},{"user":"Muscles","text":"Very nice and subtle flavoring. I'm not overly familiar with Oreos but this to me tastes like cookies and cream ice cream flavor. Add some Koolada and it would be.","score":4},{"user":"mlNikon","text":"This is a really good mix my guy! The little touch of chocolate is all you need to bring the authenticity of cookies and cream. It is a very sweet and satisfying vape. ","score":5},{"user":"BTCruiser","text":"I really enjoy this recipe. When I vape this the flavor I get takes me right to a Oreo Blizzard or Oreo Ice Cream. Is it 100% there? No, but close enough to give it 5 stars. I have been vaping this on a Kayfun 5 with an 0.4 ohm 2.5 mm Kanthol Clapton coil at 32 watts and it is just dreamy goodness.","score":5},{"user":"SlashaLO","text":"To me, you NAILED a cookies and cream vape. Low %'s and very good tasting. I get a good cookie taste/feel and a great creaminess. It's almost too artifical for me to vape. It reminds me of some of the artifical cookies and cream protein shakes, or drink mixes I have tried. Its good, but it's lacking something. The chocolate in this plays very nice, especially with bavarian cream. I love DCC and BC together, tastes amazing. ","score":4},{"user":"chief63","text":"I'm not much for chocolate type vapes but took a chance here and glad I did.  You certainly have a knack for developing tasty vapes at low percentages.  Good job.  ","score":4},{"user":"DodgerFog33","text":"So I mixed this up last Thursday tasted today after a 5 day Steep. I’m definitely getting the Oreo flavor. However I’m not getting the sweet icing part of the cookie in the middle. For me it’s a great flavor just really wanting that sweetness of the cookie. If I can get it to give me that creamy sweetness. It would be a 5 star recipe. But for my palate I have to give this 4 stars. ","score":4},{"user":"Ebc88","text":"Another excellent recipe folkart. Gonna to add some FLV peanut butter when i mix it again and try to get a pnut butter oreo","score":5},{"user":"Dalpho","text":"This is actually the best cookie and cream I’ve ever had.","score":5},{"user":"ParkusMaximusIII","text":"Been vaping this for the past few days and I've got to say I believe you've nailed the profile. The cream is the star of the show with the chocolate cookie being the back note of the recipe. I get a nice, lightly sweet cream on the inhale followed by the hint of the dry and gritty Oreo cookie on the exhale. Not to sweet and perfectly balanced. This can be a little harsh off the SnV, but after the recommended 3-day steep time this is a very enjoyable recipe that isn't too heavy or taxing on the pallet. Kudos to you for making this recipe, will definitely mix this one again. ","score":5},{"user":"6retro6","text":"Thanks for this, great chocolate cookie flavor, probably best I ever had, and very true to the profile. Took a chance and mixed 100ml direct, not sorry I did. Half the bottle are gone in a few days...","score":5},{"user":"Highwind","text":"I gave this just a little overnight steep and man, honestly this is the most accurate Oreo cookies'n'cream flavor I've had yet. It's got that perfect dark, dry Oreo chocolate flavor, and the cream flavor is right on the money! The Bavarian cream works perfectly as the lead cream imo it just goes so well with this dark chocolately goodness and the supporting vbic and sweet cream are just *muah*","score":5}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"62176","name":"The Real Cookies and Cream"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
