It's what outer space tastes like. It's cold and weird and kinda purple.\r\n\r\nGrape to taste, but don't use as much as in Grack Juice. I enjoy it as low as 1% but my senses are so tender.\r\nAlso the koolada will freeze you, just like space would. That one's to taste, too.","steep_days":"7 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":4,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:49:00.000-05:00","best_vg":"75%","views":"7511","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Grape","flavor_id":"784","vendor":"INW","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Dragonfruit","flavor_id":"226","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Sweet Strawberry","flavor_id":"121","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Raspberry","flavor_id":"667","vendor":"INW","millipercent":500},{"name":"Bavarian Cream","flavor_id":"145","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2250},{"name":"Meringue","flavor_id":"530","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Koolada 10 Pg","flavor_id":"280","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":750}],"reviews":[{"user":"ID10-T","text":"This really is what outer space tastes like, but it's way too much for Koolada for me.
