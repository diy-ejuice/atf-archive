Very light cream just enough to enhance the cantaloupe but not cover up the cucumber.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nCAP/TFA Cantaloupe: A pleasant cantaloupe combination. Adds the bright sweetness and \"summer\" flavor.\r\n\r\nCAP/FA Cucumber: Not enough to be a star, but enough to pair with the cantaloupes. FA Cucumber is in there just to get the peel and \"green\" flavors.\r\nFLV Cream: A nice, simple, moderately dense cream to accent the cantaloupe's creamy texture.\r\nFA Caramel: Just a tiny bit will do good. Adds \"dark\" sweetness to the mix. Not enough to actually taste full caramel.\r\nAdd menthol/koolada to taste. I find 1 drop/30mL of FA Menthol Arctic is nice.  \r\n\r\nIt is nice as a shake and vape, but a 7 day steep is where it begins to shine.","steep_days":"7 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-10T14:52:11.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"1156","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Cucumber","flavor_id":"558","vendor":"FA","millipercent":250},{"name":"Cucumber","flavor_id":"43","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Cantaloupe","flavor_id":"23","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Cantaloupe","flavor_id":"220","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Carmel (caramel)","flavor_id":"503","vendor":"FA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Cream","flavor_id":"604","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":750}],"reviews":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"58929","name":"Cukaloupe 'n' Cream"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
