I wanted to use FW Creamy Sponge cake (Twinkie) or whatever but I couldn't find it. I have heard Mas. Cream from WF needs a long steep so this was made about 3 weeks ago, tested about 2 1/2 weeks in. Not sure if it does anything since I used it low. I used the Mol. coffee for the espresso note as it is a strong coffee and I personally have not liked any of the actual espresso flavors I had tried thus far. Cocoa WF is a nice chocolate so I added a touch of that but the main note is the Irish cream/ cream in general. I used FA because it is my favorite Irish cream, layered with FLV cream and whipped cream. FLV Cream adds a nice bodied cream note without adding any other inherent flavor. FLV whipped cream adds a more vanilla heavy cream note.
