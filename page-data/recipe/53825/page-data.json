My thoughts, since this is a southern song,   We grow watermelons in the south, at least we did when I was a kid, And if it were made into a wine, well damn!  That would be worth a solitary dime.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","steep_days":"1 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"updated_at":"2020-12-12T18:29:20.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"2284","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Wine Champagne","flavor_id":"457","vendor":"FA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Strawberry – SC","flavor_id":"7550","vendor":"RF","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Watermelon – SC","flavor_id":"7561","vendor":"RF","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Super Sweet","flavor_id":"2384","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":250}],"reviews":[{"user":"ID10-T","text":"I've never had watermelon wine but this simple, tasty recipe is what I imagine it would be like.
