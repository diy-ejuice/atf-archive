I think it turned out pretty tasty and showcases INW Cheesecake.\r\n\r\nThe FA Forest Fruit it a great berry mixture in my opinion and stands up well in a mix. Yes We Cheesecake quite a ridiculous name, but nonetheless it’s pretty damn tasty. Has crust notes and the “funky” cheesecake note that makes a cheesecake flavoring so good. I just wanted it a little richer and for it to have more body. Which is why I added the FLV Vanilla Pudding. It adds a nice thick body as well as a rich vanilla note in my opinion.\r\n\r\n","steep_days":"10","temperature":"0","recipe_score":4,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:50:22.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"2056","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Vanilla Pudding","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Yes, We Cheesecake","vendor":"INW","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Forrest Mix (forest Fruit Mix)","vendor":"FA","millipercent":3000}],"reviews":[{"user":"cdaniell30","text":""}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"113313","name":"Keep It Simple Stupid"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
