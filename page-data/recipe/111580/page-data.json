Murica is a bomb pop flavor. I have never had murica  before so i cant tell you if i like it or not. So i was looking for ideas for  recipes  when i found out the vape wilds #1 selling e juice is a bomb pop flavor called murica. So i figured i haven't ever made a bomb pop and it sounded good. So this is my take on a bomb pop. You can probably add coolant or ws-23 but i hate all forms of coolant unless i am sick i dont vape any cooling agent..\r\n\r\nSo a bomb pop is made up of cherry, blue raz, and lime. I used tfa cherry extract because its actually pretty dam good. At 4% its perfect it adds a great cherry for this bomb pop. For the blue raz i used real flavors blue raz super concentrate. I find that you can take  it up a little higher than you would normally take a super concentrate and i actually prefer this one up to 3-4% at 4% in this recipe it adds a good blue raz syrupy sweetness. Then i added a little tiny .50%  of tfa dragon fruit an d i added this to help that syrupy sweetness that comes from a Bomb Pop.  The last layer is the white layer. The white layer is lime so after trying a few i landed on lime tahity cold pressed i went with .75% because i wanted the lime present but not overpowering because lets be honest the best parts of a bomb pop are the blue and red sectionsüòú. Or at least they are my favorite sections and its my recipe so...... Sweetener in this recipe is a good thing in my opinion because no one likes sugar free bomb pops. Use whatever your preferred sweetener is and at your desired strength. Personally i went just a touch higher than my usual amount of sweetener. I normally use .35% of flavorah sweetness but i ran out and ended up using .50% cap super sweet.  As soon as possible i am going to get another 4oz or maybe even 8oz bottle of flv sweetness because i definitely prefer it over super sweet but most\r\n prefer super sweet go figure lol. \r\n\r\nSteep time: This is a good old shake and vape but it is probably best after it has a night to rest and let the flavors come together a little.","steep_days":"1 (SNV)","temperature":"420","recipe_score":5,"total_reviews":2,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:50:20.000-05:00","best_vg":"75%","views":"6925","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Cherry Extract","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Blue Raz ‚Äì Super Concentrate","vendor":"RF","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Lime Tahity Cold Pressed","vendor":"FA","millipercent":750},{"name":"Dragonfruit","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Super Sweet","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":500}],"reviews":[{"user":"carolinavapen","score":"5","text":"I had my eye on this one and got around to mixing it. After only a day steep I am really liking it. IMO it is far better than Vape Wild‚Äôs version. The lime and cherry play great together. Lime upfront with a sweet cherry/blue raspberry finish. üëçüèªüëçüèª"},{"user":"8062282","score":"5","text":"Never had the original. This is full of flavour. I'm vaping it on a SMOK big baby beast at 50W. Not getting much lime but nonetheless it's very tasty. I used CAP super sweet. I added 1% of WS-23 (30%) also.."}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"111580","name":"Murica Remix \"The Bomb\""}}}
