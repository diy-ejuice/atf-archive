This is an odd profile, a Creamy guava vape. It's pretty calming and smooth and a great vape if you enjoy the taste of guava. There are a few changes I would make looking back but this is the original recipe. Some changes you could implement : dropping FA Meringue (this milks the recipe up so drop it if thats not what you want), adding TFA Dragonfruit 1% (would help to bridge the fruits and make them just all around brighter), and maybe adding 0.75% of EM for those who need sweeteners.

"},{"user":"bhamcatmaybe","score":"5","text":"i really love this recipe. sweet guava is such a great flavor and this recipe really highlights it's beautifully. the creamyness takes the slightly sour edge off the fruits, and it vapes like a dream. really love that for once guava isn't paired with strawberry, which i feel just produces a muddled fruity thing. this has lovely structure. A++, already mixing more."},{"user":"ID10-T","score":"5","text":"This is an odd profile that might not be for everyone, but I loved it and found it to taste very much like the filling in those delicious Goya Guava Wafers. I might try adding a very small (1.5% or so) amount of CAP Sugar Cookie and maybe some TFA Vanilla Swirl (1.5% or so) to see if I can get the wafer part and really emulate those things.  "},{"user":"Philosaphucker","score":"5","text":"What the fuck determines stars anyway? I rated this 5 stars because I found this to be quite tasty, especially after a week. Additionally, I thought the guava + cream combo was a pretty cool idea. I like this best after a week. It isn't overly sweet and I enjoyed it with my morning coffee."}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"13795","name":"Wanderlust"}}}
