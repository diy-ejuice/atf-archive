Normally I wouldn't push milky undertone this high but it needed it in this recipe.  All these ingredients work in harmony together to make a very fluffy vanilla forward marshmallow mix.  Give it a try.","steep_days":"7","temperature":"0","recipe_score":4,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:51:31.000-05:00","best_vg":"75%","views":"877","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Cream Milky Undertone PG","flavor_id":"6539","vendor":"OOO","millipercent":2000},{"name":"French Vanilla","flavor_id":"56","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Marshmallow","flavor_id":"473","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Meringue","flavor_id":"530","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Sweet Coconut","flavor_id":"605","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":250},{"name":"Vanilla Pudding","flavor_id":"4433","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1600}],"reviews":[{"user":"MaschelleMEcfs","text":"immediately after mixing I'm get that fluffy mouthfeel I want in a marshmallow vape.  The marshmallow note is present, and I don't taste coconut, which I don't want in my marshmallow.  Just the right amount of sweet and the flavors are already well blended.  I think the milky undertones work beautifully here. I can't wait to see how this develops in the next week... if I can leave it alone for that long.  I like it NOW.  4 stars until I revisit it when a 7-day steep is over.  Good job! "}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"191898","name":"TOC'S Fluffy White Clouds"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
