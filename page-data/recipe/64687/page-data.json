This is pretty good right off the rip, but benefits from a week steep like most recipes with cream. Tried at first with CAP GCV1 but it wasnt that great, you think V1 would be better but , with this recipe its alot better with V2. If you dont have V2, V1 will work but, doesnt carry what it needs from V1. Hope yall enjoy!","steep_days":"5 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"total_reviews":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T09:26:36.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"1914","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Cake Batter","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Graham Cracker V2","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Sugar Cookie","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Vanilla Bean Ice Cream","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":5000},{"name":"Super Sweet","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":500}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"64687","name":"Sugar Cookies N' Cream "}}}
