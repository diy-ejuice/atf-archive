This version uses an alternative pineapple pairing, bolstered by sweet and juicy chucks of fresh mango...\r\n\r\nThe coconut base is nothing new - this combo is used in most Pina Colada recipes and it just works so well that I saw no need in reinventing the wheel. Each of these coconuts bring their unique characteristics to the party to form a deep & creamy coconut base without overwhelming the tropical fruit. The coconut trio is blended with FA Cream to fashion a delectable coconut cream worthy of the topical wonders about to be received... \r\n\r\nThe pineapple layer  is comprised of a pairing which is a departure form the stock standard pineapple combos and brings a refreshing new dimension to this category. VT Sugarloaf & MB Funky Pineapple combines to form a succulent & authentic pineapple, set to rival the status quo. Naturally sweet without being candied and best of all, no tinned pineapple vibe!  \r\n\r\nFE Mango and FLV Mango adds another dimension by enhancing the tropical feel and prevents a linear vaping experience, often present in simple fruity vapes. The FLV Mango fortifies the authenticity of FE Mango and adds a delicious, almost 'dark' mango element to ensure it gets noticed through the pineapple puree.\r\n\r\nGive this baby 5 days or so for the fruits to become friends.","steep_days":"5","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"updated_at":"2020-12-12T20:31:30.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"1352","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Mango","flavor_id":"3516","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Mango","flavor_id":"1659","vendor":"FE","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Sugarloaf Pineapple","flavor_id":"8978","vendor":"VT","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Funky Pineapple","flavor_id":"1515","vendor":"MB","millipercent":3500},{"name":"Cream Fresh","flavor_id":"540","vendor":"FA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Coco' (coconut)","flavor_id":"416","vendor":"FA","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Coconut Extra","flavor_id":"316","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Coconut Candy","flavor_id":"223","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":500}],"reviews":[{"user":"wadeyloops","text":"This one was interesting, for the first 5 days or so I thought I was vaping a peach and a pretty nice one at that. I forgot about it for a while and just re-tried it and it has all melded together nicely. I would be tempted to use a different cream here or drop the fresh cream by 0.5% and add 0.25% VT vanilla cream just for some thickness to the cream in future. Love your mixes, keep them coming.","score":5}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"181359","name":"Pinita Colada"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
