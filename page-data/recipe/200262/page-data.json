I had asked him for some help in cloning one of my first juices, Frozen Hulk Tears. The man, the myth, the legend came back at me with this mix telling me both (1) this will be a better version and (2) the cap SS is essential here and not to mess with that scary 1%. He was right on both accounts. I've silently enjoyed this recipe for a good while and had asked a while back if he minded I shared it. I just never really got around to posting it, unsure also about how to properly do the recipe justice, or thank my friend properly for making something this amazing that truly hits that spot.\r\n\r\nIf you liked Frozen Hulk's Tears or just like a sour apple/watermelon profile, try this. \r\n\r\nOriginal art by @zany","steep_days":"0 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"total_reviews":2,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:51:40.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"1314","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Big Watermelon","vendor":"MB","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Forest Fruits","vendor":"FA","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Green Apple Hard Candy","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":6000},{"name":"Sour Apple","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":750},{"name":"Super Sweet","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Watermelon","vendor":"LA","millipercent":4000},{"name":"WS-23","vendor":"OTHR","millipercent":500}],"reviews":[{"user":"Skywxp3d","score":"5","text":"Really great after the shake, to me it looses a lot of the flavor over time (like a lot of fruit and candy mixes to me) - Id recommend small batches and vape it while its fresh and juicy!
