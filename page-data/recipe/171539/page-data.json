The base I've used with Nonna's cake (Nonna, Marshmallow, Sweet Cream, and Vienna cream) you can almost use with any other flavors to change the toppings of a cake base. The Apples play together here perfectly with the caramel giving a  dark sweetness. This one is definitely a keeper!","steep_days":"7","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"total_reviews":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-06T08:38:02.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"739","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Apple Fuji","vendor":"FA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Apple Stark","vendor":"FA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Caramel","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Nonna's Cake","vendor":"FA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Sweet Cream","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Marshmallow","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Vienna Cream","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"171539","name":"TOC'S FairRide Cake"}}}
