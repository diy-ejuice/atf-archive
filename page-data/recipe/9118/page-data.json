I read id10t's review about dropping the spice a little to let the pastry dough shine thru a bit more. My opinion is leave the spice and add just a touch of sweetener to bring the pastry dough forward. But really it's well played as is, and my 1st experience with cardamom flavoring. "},{"user":"nowar","text":"For me, this is a light cardamom taste, since I grew up with cardamom tea and cardamom pastries. That's off the shake and vape. This is my second 30ml I'm mixing up because I remember it being a light but flavorful base to showcase the cardamom flavor I love so much. I'm tempted to add cinnamon like some others but resist the urge. Cinnamon is a show boater. Let the little guy shine here. If you desperately need some extra add some floral top or something and let cardamom stand on its own feet."},{"user":"tw2k","text":""},{"user":"altneurose","text":"Super authentic. Great with FLV Rich Cinnamon too."},{"user":"Bogey_Again","text":"I love Cardamom! Tastes just like Krumkake \"Krum KaKa\" a Norwegian Christmas cookie... now all it needs is some grand marnier whip cream ;p"},{"user":"MrColtux","text":"Really interesting recipe. I will definately be using cardamom in more recipes because of how well it works in this recipe. It's very Christmas-y and I would recommend everyone to give this a shot. "},{"user":"RuntDastardly","text":"I absolutely love this recipe, and I'm kicking myself that I didn't make a bigger bottle. This is the best use of cardamom I've ever tasted, and even though it's bold, it balances with that pastry base perfectly. Gorgeous recipe!"},{"user":"HAMFIST","text":"I was skeptical on the amount of joy here, but the cardamom perfectly covers the weird notes while letting the good stuff shine through. Great recipe!"},{"user":"Chrisdvr1","text":"This is great stuff really highlights cardamom as an ingredient.Massive flavor for only being 4.5% flavoring"},{"user":"ID10-T","text":"5 stars for deliciousness, overnight steep only, wish I'd made more because I don't think this is going to last very long at all. But almost gave only 4 stars due to false advertising; this is not just a \"touch\" of cardamom - it's super cardamommy. Will definitely mix again, might cut the spice in half next time to see how that sweet dough tastes without so much of it. But might not, because it is so, so good.
