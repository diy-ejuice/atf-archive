Its full and rich on flavour. For my taste a liitle to much flavor, so that i lover the overal percentage to 17.5%. Also i decreased the sweetener to 0.75%. But thats a personal reference.&#xD;\nPS. This is really a great plattform and iam also disapointet, that only a few people make a review when they mix a recipe.&#xD;\nIts helping everyone. So come on guyes, make a review next time, you mix a recipe, or also for recipes you have mixed in the past.&#xD;\nThanks for the recipe @daytimefrank1!"},{"user":"bjorama","score":"5","text":"How many of us look at reviews of Recipes and find that information useful??  I know I do.  Frustrating that this recipe has over 1000 mixes and until now there was not a single review.  &#xD;\nDaytimeFrank this is tasty.  I toned the sweetener and its right up my alley.  Mix us up another RY4 recipe.  I'll take another!"}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"102995","name":"Butterscotch Reserve RY4"}}}
