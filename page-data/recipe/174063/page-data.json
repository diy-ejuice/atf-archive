It was the first time trying the Apple/Mango pairing and I can say for sure that it’s not the last time. They go so well together.\r\n\r\nFA Fuji and FLV Mango were no-brainers for me. They are two of my favourite concentrates. Very authentic tasting! I used FA Pear to sweeten and juice up the mix a little more. It’s such a light flavour, that it doesn't take away from the goal profile, but supports it. Sweetener and coolant to taste, if desired.\r\n\r\nIt’s another simple 1-2-3 recipe and I hope you enjoy it.","steep_days":"1 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"total_reviews":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T20:33:14.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"1707","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Pear","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Fuji","vendor":"FA","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Mango","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":2000}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"174063","name":"1-2-3 Apple Mango"}}}
