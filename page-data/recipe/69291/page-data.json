After a 2 day steep it is really good.\r\n\r\nFuji Apple-  The main note in this juice, has a wet apple juice taste on the inhale\r\nKoolada-  Might be too strong for some, but I like it, gives it the ice sensation.\r\nPeach Juicy-  Reminds me of a fresh peach on the exhale.\r\nPeach White- Balances the peach flavor.\r\nStrawberry Ripe-  To be honest I can't taste it, I think it is helping with the sweetness or assisting in joining the apple and peach, either it works.","steep_days":"2","temperature":"0","recipe_score":4,"updated_at":"2020-12-12T11:51:18.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"1711","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Fuji Apple","flavor_id":"8456","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Koolada 10 Pg","flavor_id":"280","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":750},{"name":"Peach (juicy)","flavor_id":"254","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":5000},{"name":"Peach White","flavor_id":"543","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Strawberry (ripe)","flavor_id":"271","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":8000}],"reviews":[{"user":"Bex87","text":"This recipe is delicious.
