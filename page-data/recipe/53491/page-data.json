Perfect Summer Vape.\r\n\r\nINW grapefruit has a very authentic grapefruit flavor for me. During my testing after I got the flavor, it was quite strong at 5%. I wanted to whip something up that tamed out the bitterness, and added some fruity complexity and sweetness at the same time. I mix this at 75/25 VG/PG and its great as a shake and vape, but the grapefruit mellows a bit after a day or so. Berry base really supports the grapefruit zing and bitterness well.\r\nAn awesome fresh summertime ADV for me\r\nHope you enjoy.","steep_days":"1 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":4,"updated_at":"2020-12-12T18:29:20.000-05:00","best_vg":"75%","views":"1210","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Blueberry (extra)","flavor_id":"218","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1200},{"name":"Blueberry","flavor_id":"1201","vendor":"FW","millipercent":800},{"name":"Bilberry","flavor_id":"533","vendor":"FA","millipercent":200},{"name":"Strawberry","flavor_id":"272","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Strawberry (ripe)","flavor_id":"271","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Grapefruit","flavor_id":"785","vendor":"INW","millipercent":3000}],"reviews":[{"user":"Screwdriver","text":"A very nice summer-vape indeed, and not too sweet and very refreshing.
