So, if you haven't yet, it's time to jump aboard. While I never was able to get my hands on a guanabana, I did manage to find a cherimoya. Oh my! These things are absolutely delicious! There is some serious complexity to this amazing fruit. I get a mix of apple, pineapple, mango and banana mashed together with a very creamy coconut. Between the price and the scarceness of the custard apples in my area, there really was only one option. Make it a vape! That shouldn't be hard, I thought. INW makes cherimoya. Not so fast......\r\n\r\n**INW Cherimoya** -  I have to say INW didn't do a bad job at all but still found it to be missing some depth. I get the pineapple and apple up front. With a smooth creaminess on the exhale. I kind of pick up a acidic mango but not much at all.\r\n\r\n**FA Coconut** - While I wouldn't call this the best offering (FLV still holds the crown,imo), it's definitely a suitable replacement. It's fresh, creamy and fits into the cherimoya perfectly.\r\n\r\n**FA Banana** - Like a lot of FA fruits, this is a realistic tasting banana. I found out the hard way, it can be a temperamental flavor. If taken too high, can lean towards an artificial taste with some chemically thing happening. If used too low, it seems to just get lost in the mix. After many failed tries, I finally got it to do what I wanted. It's not too forward and plays nicely with the coconut.\r\n\r\n**More on Cherimoya** - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cherimoya\r\n\r\n\r\n**Conclusion** - I feel this is a really good representation of the actual fruit and I'm happy with the results. If you never have had a custard apple,I'm confident you'll want to run out and buy a few, after tasting this. This is a good S&V but loses a little of the acidity after the first day.
