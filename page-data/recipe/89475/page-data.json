Is flavoring can taste a little thin as a shake and vape. Just need some time to develop.\r\n\r\nBavarian cream + dolce de leche - a simple cream combination with complex results. Steeps out smooth and sweet with a rich thick mouthfeel.\r\n\r\n honey - flavourart honey, is to date the only honey flavoring I have tried that isn't complete garbage.
