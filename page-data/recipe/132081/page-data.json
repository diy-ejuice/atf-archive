FLV sweetness   would be what i recommend.  FLV Irish cream   is my favorite Irish cream   but   FA  Irish cream  can also be used  at the same percent it will lend a bit of a chocolate back note\r\n","steep_days":"5","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"updated_at":"2020-12-12T18:30:11.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"1897","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Butterscotch","flavor_id":"495","vendor":"FA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Carmel (caramel)","flavor_id":"503","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Golden Syrup","flavor_id":"8887","vendor":"VT","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Irish Cream","flavor_id":"4445","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Pound Cake","flavor_id":"4306","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Vanilla Pudding","flavor_id":"4433","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1500}],"reviews":[{"user":"Daytimefrank1","text":"This recipe was very well built. Off the shake the butterscotch and creams are present with a maple type finish. Iâ€™m getting a coffee note that I can assume is from the Irish Cream.
