Cap sugar cookie I wanted to be my base. As you can see I went overboard with it but I'm glad I did because it gives the ice cream that cone. To add more to that cone and to give it more of a crust I used tpa cheesecake graham crust at 3%. I wanted it to be very creamy, which it is very creamy so I went with fw vanilla bean ice cream at 5%. Fw butterscotch was added at 2% to bring out more sweet notes like a vanilla ice cream with a swirl of butterscotch drizzle in it. EDIT: I now have fw butterscotch drizzle but I have not mixed this recipe with it yet. Next time I mix it I might just try using it in replacement to regular fw butterscotch and come back to this. 1% super sweet was added to brighten everything up and make it more commerical. This recipe the way it is can be good in an rda, sub ohm tank, or a pod! I have used it all my devices and it still holds up as a great eliquid all around","steep_days":"14","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"updated_at":"2020-12-12T08:14:44.000-05:00","best_vg":"60%","views":"1377","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Sugar Cookie","flavor_id":"115","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":7000},{"name":"Vanilla Bean Ice Cream","flavor_id":"1451","vendor":"FW","millipercent":5000},{"name":"Kettle Corn","flavor_id":"329","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Cheesecake (graham Crust)","flavor_id":"152","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Butterscotch","flavor_id":"1216","vendor":"FW","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Super Sweet","flavor_id":"2384","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1000}],"reviews":[{"user":"lndscapr","text":"WoW!
