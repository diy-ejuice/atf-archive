Cap sugar cookie I wanted to be my base. As you can see I went overboard with it but I'm glad I did because it gives the ice cream that cone. To add more to that cone and to give it more of a crust I used tpa cheesecake graham crust at 3%. I wanted it to be very creamy, which it is very creamy so I went with fw vanilla bean ice cream at 5%. Fw butterscotch was added at 2% to bring out more sweet notes like a vanilla ice cream with a swirl of butterscotch drizzle in it. EDIT: I now have fw butterscotch drizzle but I have not mixed this recipe with it yet. Next time I mix it I might just try using it in replacement to regular fw butterscotch and come back to this. 1% super sweet was added to brighten everything up and make it more commerical. This recipe the way it is can be good in an rda, sub ohm tank, or a pod! I have used it all my devices and it still holds up as a great eliquid all around","steep_days":"14","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"total_reviews":3,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:51:24.000-05:00","best_vg":"60%","views":"1371","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Sugar Cookie","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":7000},{"name":"Vanilla Bean Ice Cream","vendor":"FW","millipercent":5000},{"name":"Kettle Corn","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Cheesecake (graham Crust)","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Butterscotch","vendor":"FW","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Super Sweet","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1000}],"reviews":[{"user":"lndscapr","score":"5","text":"WoW!

Perfect in my tank and my rda, but I rock this in my pod daily! Thanks for coming up with this awesome new favorite "}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"185310","name":"Ice cream kettle"}}}
