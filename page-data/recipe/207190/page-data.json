It's got a nice texture, it's soft and pink and slightly chewy, the cherry and strawberry are somewhat combined and sit atop the \"chew\" base and towards the second part of the exhale the citrus notes come through, they are a nice mix together - lemon lime and orange. The apple I can taste more after the exhale.\r\n\r\nThis sounds complicated and I wasn't sure how this would turn out to be honest but I am really enjoying this and it's a wonderful candy vape without being way overpowering and in your face. This is really interesting how these flavours play off each other. SSA Juicy cherry is really nice in this mix. This flavour would pair so well with coconut.\r\n\r\nIf you've got these flavours, give this a mix and tell me what you can taste! This is a fun and fruity mix for sure!\r\n\r\nSuper Sweet is totally optional, for reference, I added it at 1% like I do with most candy or soda recipes, but you can add less, or more, if thats your thang. Enjoy :)\r\n\r\nUpdate: After 1 day steep the citrus notes are more prominent over the pink notes and I may try and balance this out, this mix continues to surprise me!","steep_days":"0 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-12T15:41:17.000-05:00","best_vg":"80%","views":"618","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Blood Orange","flavor_id":"4407","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":500},{"name":"Blood Orange","flavor_id":"1197","vendor":"FW","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Sour Lemon","flavor_id":"8971","vendor":"VT","millipercent":1750},{"name":"Persian Lime","flavor_id":"8942","vendor":"VT","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Pink Burst","flavor_id":"4489","vendor":"JF","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Cherries","flavor_id":"757","vendor":"INW","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Strawberry Gummy Candy SC","flavor_id":"10097","vendor":"WF","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Sour Apple","flavor_id":"4379","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":2500}],"reviews":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"207190","name":"FRUIT MACHINE üçí | Liquid Starburst "}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
