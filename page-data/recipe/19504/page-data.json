I also like it loaded with jelly and some thin layers of Peanut Butter. This recipe is pretty high on the % side, but I feel that it does a good job accomplishing what I set it out to be.\r\n\r\n\r\nINW Grape is pretty weak, and always seems to fade after a decent amount of time, leaving Peanut butter as the main note (when mixed around 3.5/8) So I changed the percents around to (4.5/3.5). Peanut Butter is strong, and higher percentages give a realistic PB taste and mouthfeel, kind of dry, but I really just want the flavor of it here. I may consider bumping PB up by .5% or so. Cookie is to give a bit of a 'bite' to this recipe, like some crumbles on top of the milkshake.\r\n\r\nStill working on this, but I can't wait to see what it steeps out as. PB Seems kind of weak as is, but it's definitely tasted in there.\r\n\r\nI would give it a few days to a week for the vienna cream to round out, as it always has an odd \"soury\" taste to me right off the bat.\r\n","steep_days":"5","temperature":"0","recipe_score":4,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:48:53.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"2564","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Cheesecake (graham Crust)","flavor_id":"152","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Vanilla Bean Ice Cream","flavor_id":"186","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Vanilla Cupcake","flavor_id":"129","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Vienna Cream","flavor_id":"516","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1750},{"name":"Grape","flavor_id":"784","vendor":"INW","millipercent":3500},{"name":"Peanut Butter","flavor_id":"291","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":3500},{"name":"Cookie","flavor_id":"490","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1500}],"reviews":[{"user":"ID10-T","text":"Absolutely love the idea behind this one. My favorite version of PB&amp;J is grape jelly too!  Enjoyed the vape too, I like how it all has a nice gooey feel to it like an actual shake with PB in it. The only room for improvement I noted is that the grape tastes more like raw grapes than jelly, and that by the time the off-note in Vienna Cream steeps out (tried after an overnight steep first), both the peanut butter and grape, which were previously distinct and in just the right place, became somewhat muted and muddled. Might try it again and just leave out the Vienna Cream or swap it for something else and shake and vape it rather than waiting for Vienna to steep, cuz that gooey PB and grape inside a shake is NICE.
