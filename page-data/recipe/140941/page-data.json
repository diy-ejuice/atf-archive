All we need to achieve vibrant, purple neon goodness is equal parts of both TPA Grape Juice and TPA Grape Candy. Honestly either of these at 5% is enough to get that very artificial purple candy grape flavor that you may be after, but together their forces combined create an absolute banger. \r\n\r\nAs far as TPA Grape Juice goes, it is certainly an odd one. It has the most mild alcohol vibe to it, much the same aroma I get from cheap Gin. It also has a distinct smell of purple Laffy Taffy, which adds a filmy, almost creamy aspect to the vape and mouthfeel. The grape here is as artificial as it is pronounced, and that benefits us greatly in this mix. \r\n\r\nTPA Grape Candy is also fairly unique. I have heard pixie stick, taffy, and many other sugary purple things sold on grocery store shelves being claimed as the intended flavor of this one, though I'll let you be the judge. To me, at least, Grape Juice tastes more like a Jolly Rancher than anything. In the bottle, the concentrate smells of freshly cut grass and shares the same neon purple top note that Grape Juice supplies, combining beautifully. \r\n\r\nHere is the fun part; Alterations to this recipe can (and should) include plugging in Vurve's Best Damn Pink Lemonade base, that being 6% LA Lemonade and 0.75% Lemon Sicily. In the summertime I sometimes like to add 0.5% WS23 to this grape base to get a nice, almost Popsicle tone to the whole mix. Throw in 2% FA Fuji or 1% INW Cactus for a refreshing ass flavor. A little FW Blueberry or TPA Pineapple makes a pretty welcome addition to really amplify the tang of the mix. Really anywhere you think a Grape would be good, give this a shot. Add in Guava, Papaya, maybe even some ice creams to get a grape soft serve type horror. \r\n\r\nSweetener is definitely detrimental to this particular combo. If you get inadequate amounts of sweetness from these two flavors, then try turning them up to 5%-6% before reaching for the super sweet. EM will just do it's regular ole' thing of muting the top notes, which is actually an impressive feat here.\r\n\r\nShake and Vape certified, or would it be Shake and Grape?","steep_days":"1 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:50:45.000-05:00","best_vg":"%","views":"2826","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Grape Juice","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Grape Candy","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":4000}],"reviews":[{"user":"kitu5","text":"This is the most grape thing I've ever tasted.
