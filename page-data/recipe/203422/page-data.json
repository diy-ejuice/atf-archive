Layering in some fresh slices of apples balanced delicately with apple pie spices. Some crumble topping to finish things off!!\r\n\r\nGive this a week to become balanced and full bodied.\r\n\r\nI always add .3% SS, or 1 drop per 10ml.

And how GOOOD does that Sugar Cookie SC smell! I really love this recipe, it's well balanced and I like that I can taste all the different elements. Although my tastebuds are tempting me to play around with it and give the apples a boost, it would likely mess up the balance you've got here. Fantastic mixing +1 I've mixed a couple of your recipes this week. You are very talented! Graham toff tarkin... Oh my lord!"}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"203422","name":"Applescotch Cookie Pie"}}}
