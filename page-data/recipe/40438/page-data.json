In shake and vape fashion none the less!  I live in an area with one of the highest densities of hispanics per capita in the US...  In Tennessee.  In the mountains.  It surprised me too!  Well, the good 'ol boys told me about \"MexiMilk\", a regional colloquialism referring to horchata.  And just like the first time I tried rock, I was hooked!\r\n\r\nThe base\r\nCAP Horchata/FW VBIC/CAP Sweet Cream---I was looking for light and sweet, and when it comes to VBIC, FW wins that title in my eyes.  However, it could use the extra sweetness and silky mouthfeel that CAP Sweet Cream can bring.  Also, these don't take a month to steep like so many other options, which brings me to the star of the show...CAP Horchata.  It's the perfect balance of rice milk to cream, easy on the cinnamon, and great fresh or aged.  It's far better than any build-it-from-scratch horchata I've tried to make.\r\n\r\nThe accouterments\r\nHoly Vanilla- What can I say that hasn't been said about HV, except...  I use it in my actual horchatas!  In vapor form, it really bridges the gap between the creams, and seems to be able to take 2 disparate ingredients and make them taste as one.  While there is no real disparity to quench here, it makes the entire vape seem so much more consistent.\r\n\r\nFW Hazelnut- Originally this recipe started with TPA Malted Milk, but excluding that and adding the Hazelnut formed a much richer, \"malty\" cream base.  Also, I feel it acts like a very small amount of Saline in a recipe- salinity brings out inherent sweetness,\r\n\r\nFLV Rich Cinnamon-Duh, just duh. 1 drop per 15ml.\r\n\r\nTPA Sweetner-Optional, but I put 2 small drops per 15ml, just enough to barely notice it.  I like the 50/50 bleand of EM and Succulose here, as opposed to one or the other.\r\n\r\nNow let's face it, all recipes change over time.  However, my main goal was a silky, creamy vape that tastes good on day 1.  After 3 days, it's matured quite well, and at a week, well, fuckin a mate!\r\n\r\nEnjoy, Hombr√©!
