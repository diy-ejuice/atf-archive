I no longer had JF sweet strawberry so I swapped in CAP sweet strawberry instead. Upped the apple, m&h and meringue. I lowered the cactus and added a drop of MTS, which tastes a bit like coconut to me, adding to the depth of flavor and pulling the top notes down just a touch.","steep_days":"0 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"total_reviews":1,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:51:01.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"1770","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Cactus","vendor":"INW","millipercent":500},{"name":"Fuji","vendor":"FA","millipercent":750},{"name":"Meringue","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1250},{"name":"Milk & Honey","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":500},{"name":"Sweet Strawberry","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Custard","vendor":"FA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Vanilla Custard","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Yes, We Cheesecake","vendor":"INW","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Mts Vape Wizard","vendor":"FA","millipercent":100}],"reviews":[{"user":"ID10-T","score":"5","text":"This tastes amazing and delicious, just like the bizarre but addictive recipe it was based on, with a similar otherworldly fruity topping. It's similarly situated on a creamy silky custard with a sweet, sugary finish. I actually prefer the original just a little more, though I'm not sure if that has more to do with the shock of how wonderful Golden Snozzberry Custard was, when on paper it looks like it could have been a nightmare, or if it has more to do with what I perceive as the main difference between Rainbow Snozzberry Custard and Golden Snozzberry Custard. The Golden Snozzberry Custard came out tasting to me like it was perfectly balanced between the fantasmagorical fruit and rich custard. This one tastes little unbalanced in favor of the custard. Which is not to say there's anything wrong with the recipe. I'd just say it's the Snozzberry for people who liked Golden Snozzberry but wished there was a little more emphasis on the creamy custard.
