Here it comes the TPA Juicy peach to mitigate the FA white peach and give the sensation of a peach mix.\r\n\r\nAlmond amaretto: this is the accent of this receipt. This flavour is very strong and you will need just a .5.\r\n\r\nAgain in real life Almond amaretto is a special type of cookie. So i tried to combine this with FA cookie or INW cookie, but at the end I erased those cookies from my recipe because the TPA almond amaretto is a very complete flavour and it has already inside it all the cookie you need.","steep_days":"2","temperature":"","recipe_score":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-10T13:45:32.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"1054","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Chocolate","flavor_id":"489","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Double Chocolate V2","flavor_id":"47","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Peach White","flavor_id":"543","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Peach (juicy)","flavor_id":"254","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Almond Amaretto","flavor_id":"343","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":500}],"reviews":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"108993","name":"Amarpeaches"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
