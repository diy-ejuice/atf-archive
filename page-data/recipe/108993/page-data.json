Here it comes the TPA Juicy peach to mitigate the FA white peach and give the sensation of a peach mix.\r\n\r\nAlmond amaretto: this is the accent of this receipt. This flavour is very strong and you will need just a .5.\r\n\r\nAgain in real life Almond amaretto is a special type of cookie. So i tried to combine this with FA cookie or INW cookie, but at the end I erased those cookies from my recipe because the TPA almond amaretto is a very complete flavour and it has already inside it all the cookie you need.","steep_days":"2","temperature":"","recipe_score":0,"total_reviews":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-05T04:16:45.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"1050","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Chocolate","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Double Chocolate V2","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Peach White","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Peach (juicy)","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Almond Amaretto","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":500}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"108993","name":"Amarpeaches"}}}
