I've done 50+ revisions of lemon tart remixs over the last year or so. This is by far the one that knocks it out of the park. It's not a clone of dinner lady's version by any means, it's so much better. I've been a long term believer that Tfa's lemonade cookie is a key component to cloning the original. But this recipe focus' on how to make the lemon stay nice and vivid through the steep as the custards gain their strength, which it does. If you have these ingredients then mix this one up. You won't regret it, cause can't stop vaping it!","steep_days":"7","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:49:51.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"3146","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Acetyl Pyrazine 6%","flavor_id":"9168","vendor":"VT","millipercent":500},{"name":"Biscuit","flavor_id":"642","vendor":"INW","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Lemonade Cookie","flavor_id":"2367","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Lemon Cake","flavor_id":"661","vendor":"INW","millipercent":500},{"name":"Lemon Meringue Pie","flavor_id":"1335","vendor":"FW","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Custard Pi 3.14","flavor_id":"4839","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Vanilla Custard","flavor_id":"188","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":6000},{"name":"Ethyl Maltol 10%","flavor_id":"8874","vendor":"VT","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Sweet Mate","flavor_id":"8981","vendor":"VT","millipercent":1000}],"reviews":[{"user":"wadeyloops","text":"Don't go past this one, the lemonade cookie and lemon cake finish this one off so well."}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"83300","name":"Lemon Custard Tart"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
