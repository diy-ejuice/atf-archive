I like this more the more I vape it. I get a bit of a coconut note from TFA Cheesecake Graham Crust which works really nicely. I might try adding a touch more Dulce de Leche if possible just to bump that element up a bit- or try it in a less airy RDA. But it’s really, really tasty and pretty simple to mix. I’ll def make more and use Dulce de Leche more often. ","score":5},{"user":"Kiviskus","text":"This is a solid mix.
