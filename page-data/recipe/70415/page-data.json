I wanted to smell this as much as taste it.\r\n\r\nFA Watermelon: I chose this watermelon because I find it provides a sweet but slightly more subtle flavor. It’s a dryer watermelon that blends well without overpowering the mix.\r\nINW Cactus: Pairs perfectly with FA Watermelon. At 1.75% it adds a lot of juiciness and got me started on the floral scent I was looking for.\r\nFA Pear: I find this flavor works similarly to INW Cactus. It adds some juiciness, a great earthy-tasting sweetness on the backend, and really boosts the aroma.\r\nCAP Sweet Guava: Again, this one adds some wetness to the dry watermelon and a sweet yet flowery inhale. I’ve had this flavor since day one, but was honestly never a big fan. I had serious doubts along the way if I could get this to work. Most recipes have Sweet Guava at 4% or higher, but I found it to be way too sweet. It balances very well at 1.5%.\r\nFA Meringue: My go-to fruit sweetener, plain and simple. Despite the added sweetness from the FA Pear and the Guava, I couldn’t get the sweetness I wanted from those two without boosting the % and screwing up the flavor balance. A touch of Meringue took care of that.\r\nKoolada: Stop me if you’ve heard this before – the Koolada is totally optional, based on personal preference. I like to add just 1-2 drops per 10mL, which gives this mix the airy, cold taste you’d expect from a margarita.","steep_days":"2","temperature":"0","recipe_score":4,"updated_at":"2020-12-12T14:05:50.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"2140","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Red Summer (watermelon)","flavor_id":"471","vendor":"FA","millipercent":6000},{"name":"Sweet Guava","flavor_id":"118","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Cactus","flavor_id":"647","vendor":"INW","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Meringue","flavor_id":"530","vendor":"FA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Pear","flavor_id":"411","vendor":"FA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Koolada 10 Pg","flavor_id":"280","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":200}],"reviews":[{"user":"cdaniell30","text":"I've tried so many different recipes trying to like a watermelon vape, but for me it's always something that's only been useful as an accent note.
