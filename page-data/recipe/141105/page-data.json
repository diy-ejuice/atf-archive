Cap V1 lays the foundation, Vta vanilla cream blends well and helps the white chocolate out and Vta Devon cream also blends well and brings a cocoa note to the mix, now we build on that with Vta love adding yet more cream and a white chocolate note which already takes that Vta Devon cream over to a white chocolate then add in some FlV and Vta white chocolate to finish off the white chocolate component, several white chocolate components have been used to avoid that dry Rice Krispie taste that white chocolate tends to give off when used high, now finish with a healthy dose of tfa raspberry sweet and flv red raspberry to add a touch of zing to an otherwise soft raspberry.\r\n\r\nIf you enjoy what I do please rate and review ;)","steep_days":"14","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"updated_at":"2020-12-12T11:52:36.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"3057","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Vanilla Custard","flavor_id":"131","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":9000},{"name":"White Chocolate","flavor_id":"4444","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1500},{"name":"White Chocolate Base","flavor_id":"8999","vendor":"VT","millipercent":1250},{"name":"Love DIY","flavor_id":"8920","vendor":"VT","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Sweetness","flavor_id":"4413","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":250},{"name":"Raspberry (sweet)","flavor_id":"267","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":4500},{"name":"Red Raspberry","flavor_id":"4367","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":500},{"name":"Devon Cream","flavor_id":"8869","vendor":"VT","millipercent":500},{"name":"Vanilla Cream","flavor_id":"8992","vendor":"VT","millipercent":1500}],"reviews":[{"user":"Wildgypsy","text":"Very well done!
