Yeah, it's borderline suntan lotion territory, but in the right ways. Very creamy, sweet, and well, the juicy peach swallows down that suntan lotion note whenever it comes too close. Quick, easy and delightful.&#xD;\n&#xD;\nNicely done!"},{"user":"Lauzzy77","text":"Really tasty! Not too sweet but sweet enough! Just Peachy! Thank you! :)"},{"user":"HerrHut","text":"It's an okay vape, but I won't be mixing it again.

I can't wait to see what the next few days bring with this one because I know the Juicy Peach will settle just a bit and I bet it gets even better.
