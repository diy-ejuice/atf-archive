To achieve an authentic, fresh, perfectly ripe mango in DIY was was virtually impossible. Until now... \r\n\r\nAlong came FE Mango and restored my faith in the search for the e-liquid mango kingdom's holy grail...the humble mango.\r\nFE Mango is the quintessential mango flavour to date and I predict that it will become the go-to mango very, very soon. It perfectly encapsulates the very best a fresh, ripe & luscious mango to be with zero, zip, zilch, nada room for improvement. The is the epitome of mango. Period.\r\n\r\nAt 4%, this is pure heaven and easily a solo ADV. I added a splash of TFA Papaya and a smidgen of Peach to create a mango forward melange of fresh, ripe fruit. The peach adds a slight peachiness without messing with our hero and keeps things nice and moist. \r\n\r\nI adore the inherent bitterness of Papaya, which perfectly balances the sweetness of the mango, whist adding to the mouthfeel with results in a thick, full vaping experience.\r\n\r\nGive this baby 2 days or so to settle and be prepared to be transported to your ultimate oral glee...\r\n","steep_days":"2","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:50:39.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"2214","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Papaya","flavor_id":"252","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Mango","flavor_id":"1659","vendor":"FE","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Peach (juicy)","flavor_id":"254","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1000}],"reviews":[{"user":"TamVapes","text":"This is absolutely delicious.
