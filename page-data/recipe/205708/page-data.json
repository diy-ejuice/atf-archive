The chill in the air has inspired me to create a nice and creamy Pumpkin Pie recipe.\r\n\r\nTo create the body of the pie (the pumpkin puree) I used FLV Yam. I think it emulates a pumpkin puree perfectly. It's has a deep and rich flavor with hints of brown sugar. I added FLV Pumpkin Spice to give it even more of a prominent pumpkin flavor. It has hints of nutmeg, cinnamon and ginger spice. I absolutely love this flavor! For the crust I'm using TFA Graham Cracker (Clear) and JF Biscuit. To give recipe more creaminess and body I'm using OOO Vanilla Custard Cheesecake. It taste similar to LorAnn Cream Cheese Icing but with less steep time. Of course you can't have a great pumpkin pie without whipped cream. My favorite whipped cream by far is OOO Whipped Cream. Silky and smooth with an amazing thickness.\r\n\r\nPlease enjoy and share your feedback!","steep_days":"5","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T17:36:33.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"364","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Biscuit","flavor_id":"4487","vendor":"JF","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Graham Cracker Clear","flavor_id":"325","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2250},{"name":"Pumpkin Spice","flavor_id":"4436","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":700},{"name":"Vanilla Custard Cheesecake","flavor_id":"6532","vendor":"OOO","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Super Sweet","flavor_id":"2384","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":500},{"name":"Whipped Cream","flavor_id":"6582","vendor":"OOO","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Yam","flavor_id":"8575","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":750}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"205708","name":"Country Bumpkin"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
