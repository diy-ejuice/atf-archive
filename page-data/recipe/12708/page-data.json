By 2016 standards, this is an awesome recipe. You get the pineapple, you get a little grapefruit, it’s chilled and refreshing, it’s even a little fizzy feeling. Between the CAP Sweet Pineapple and Koolada, it even kinda tastes like it came out of a can. I’d pay good money for a 2019 version using things like WS-23 and FLV Citrus Soda or VT Fizzy Sherb, as well as a little punchier grapefruit.
