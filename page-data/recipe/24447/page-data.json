Well this is my attempt at just that a LEMON sugar cookie with icing. If you don't have the cream cheese icing that is fine because it is still a great Lemon sugar cookie without it. It tastes good after  settling over night but gets much better with a 7 day steep.","steep_days":"7","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:48:57.000-05:00","best_vg":"75%","views":"3640","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Sugar Cookie","flavor_id":"115","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Cream Cheese Icing","flavor_id":"2380","vendor":"LA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Meringue","flavor_id":"530","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Marshmallow","flavor_id":"332","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Lemon Sicily","flavor_id":"524","vendor":"FA","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Cookie","flavor_id":"490","vendor":"FA","millipercent":2000}],"reviews":[{"user":"Pilgrim","text":"This recipe is top notch!
