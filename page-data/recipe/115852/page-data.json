Balanced together they create a bright, sweet and tropical ice cream flavor.\r\n\r\nThe Sweet Coconut & Desiccated coconut in this recipe not only complement the Banana Custard and Taro, they add richness to the bottom white cake layer. Love's role has a dual purpose as a cake and ice cream enhancer. With its rich cream, light white chocolate notes, and accents of fluffy white cake it rounds out the base; adding dimension and weight to the overall mix.\r\n\r\nThis recipe is sweet on its own. If you would like to add sweetener, I would suggest FW Sweetener at 0.25% or under.\r\n\r\n&nbsp; \r\nüîπRecipe created for: DOD's Noted. Ep. 62 - Yam / Ube / Taro (ft.
