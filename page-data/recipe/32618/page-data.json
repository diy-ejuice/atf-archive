A light and refreshing mix.\r\n\r\nFlavor Notes:\r\n\r\nFA Fuji provides a crisp and tart apple. 1% starts out strong, but after a few days it recedes into its place in the mix.\r\n\r\nFA Kiwi is a juicy and sweet tropical burst. At 2% it's the body of the vape. It's Kiwi. It's a great flavor. That's a bad descriptor for what we're doing, but that's it in a nutshell.\r\n\r\nI've been trying to find a use for INW Strawberry Shisha because I usually don't like it. I couldn't come up with anything for the syrup flavor it has going on until now. Here, that syrupy quality pulls the apple and kiwi together. Fuji's crispness tones down the syrup note, leaving a candied strawberry at the bottom of the recipe.\r\n\r\nFA Marshmallow is here as a light sweetener. You could probably exclude it if you wanted to, but I preferred just a touch.\r\n\r\nShake and vape certified. I like to let it sit a few days though.\r\n\r\nHappy mixing. ðŸ‘½","steep_days":"3 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":4.7,"total_reviews":3,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:49:07.000-05:00","best_vg":"80%","views":"2303","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Shisha Strawberry","vendor":"INW","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Kiwi","vendor":"FA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Fuji","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Marshmallow","vendor":"FA","millipercent":500}],"reviews":[{"user":"cincinnatiking","score":"5","text":"Excellent fruit combo!"},{"user":"Deetzz","score":"4","text":"This is a Great recipe thanks @Mrburgundy !!
