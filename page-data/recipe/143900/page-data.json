This recipe is better than the original IMO. Steep time is 30days it should turn into a nice light amber color like the original version.  You can substitute holy vanilla for Shisha Vanilla and if you feel funny about vaping FW yellow cake leave it out but it won't have  the same texture in the custard I was going for....Thanks üòé","steep_days":"30","temperature":"0","recipe_score":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-12T03:46:31.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"2256","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Lemon Meringue Pie","flavor_id":"84","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":6000},{"name":"New York Cheesecake","flavor_id":"90","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Vanilla Custard","flavor_id":"131","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Lemon Sicily","flavor_id":"524","vendor":"FA","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Vanilla Pudding","flavor_id":"4433","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Super Sweet","flavor_id":"7787","vendor":"PUR","millipercent":500},{"name":"Cake (yellow)","flavor_id":"1222","vendor":"FW","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Holy Vanilla","flavor_id":"2385","vendor":"DFS","millipercent":1500}],"reviews":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"143900","name":"Killer kustard üçã lemon ( clone) remix "}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
