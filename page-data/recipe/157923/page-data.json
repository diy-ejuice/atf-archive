It's hard to describe with words what it tastes like, since it's more of an abstract work of art, but I think his name \"Rainforest\" fits very well. The sweetness of the guava, sweet/floral honeysuckle and funky cactus makes for a very interesting combination.\r\n\r\nAs I keep throwing things at my soda base (FLV Citrus Soda, CAP Lemon Lime & WS-23), I think this combo turned out great. It preserves the unique taste of the original mix, but adds a slight fizzyness to it.","steep_days":"0 (SNV)","temperature":"420","recipe_score":5,"total_reviews":1,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:51:02.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"2744","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Sweet Guava","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Honeysuckle (pg)","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Cactus","vendor":"INW","millipercent":500},{"name":"Citrus Soda","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1250},{"name":"Lemon Lime","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":2000},{"name":"WS-23","vendor":"OTHR","millipercent":500}],"reviews":[{"user":"Rubicone","score":"5","text":"I like the original recipe and I like this variation too.
