I wouldn't expect any substitutions to work very well â€“ the three flavors here are fairly unique. FA Cinnamon Ceylon makes a nice addition if you like your cider spicier. Adding FA Brandy will give you a hard apple cider flavor. Play around!\r\n\r\nThe fundamental recipe is great example of building your recipes around base, heart, and top notes to form a cohesive flavor. Using only three flavors makes it simple to mix, and a great base on which to build your own personal adaptations.\"","steep_days":"1 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"total_reviews":1,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:48:52.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"1474","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Apple Mix","vendor":"HS","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Cherry Blossom (pg)","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Liquid Amber","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1500}],"reviews":[{"user":"ChewingPaintChips","score":"5","text":"I did this exact recipe but with CAP double apple, but this looks delicious with the HS apple  "}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"18351","name":"Mustard Cider"}}}
