I did not want a darker cider with alot of heavy spice  like a  mulled cider. I wanted a brighter  crisp apple forward cocktail   which I think I was able to achieve here .\r\n\r\nMost cider flavors are a darker  apple  note often with spices   -  which I really did not want ;  so the combination of INW  two apples and  WF  Thai apple create a really bright crisp  full apple flavor.  Molinberry apple cider is a a lighter brighter   cider  which worked as the predominate  cider note int his mix .  The mint    is light for me me and adds a bit of coolness in this mix, and is less noticeable   as it steeps  but I happen to enjoy that cooling in this  mix\r\nThe  sweet citrus of the blood orange and the tartness of the  cranberry are nice accents notes to this   predominate apple forward mix \r\nThe geingerale and  golden syrup create some darker sweet ginger base notes  for this mix  with out distracting too much  for the brightness of the mix.   \r\nSince this is based on a vodka   cocktail I used    VT russian vodka for the booze   top note  \r\nSWEETNER: I added  .5%  of cap  to help lift the apple notes a bit ","steep_days":"5 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-06T20:45:09.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"728","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Cranberry","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Blood Orange Champagne","vendor":"VT","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Cider Apple Mint","vendor":"MB","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Golden Syrup","vendor":"VT","millipercent":300},{"name":"Thai Apple SC","vendor":"WF","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Two Apples","vendor":"INW","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Russian Vodka","vendor":"VT","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Ginger Ale","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1000}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"171314","name":"September  Brew   (cranberry,  blood orange,  apple cider cocktail) "}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
