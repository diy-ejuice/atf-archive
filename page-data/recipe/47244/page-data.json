Loving this at the mo, definitely got that Dinner Lady vibe going on from that FW LMP. I love the C27 twist, sometimes I get funky off notes from it but not in this recipe! Tastes fantastic in my Troll RTA and still great in the TFV8. Great recipe, ADV for me. Cheers! =D"}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"47244","name":"Lady Killer (The Real Lemon Square)"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
