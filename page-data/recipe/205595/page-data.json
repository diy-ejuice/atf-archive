The creaminess of this flavors blends perfectly with WF Coconut Cream Pie. WF Coconut Cream Pie is a wonderfully thick coconut cream that has all the feel and characteristics of a well-balanced pie. The crust part was lacking a bit so I added OOO Pie Crust and JF Biscuit. It definitely has that crust with burnt edge taste to it. \r\n\r\nThat's all I needed for this recipe. Simple yet perfectly balanced and delicious. It's all there.\r\n\r\nPlease try and share your feedback!","steep_days":"3","temperature":"0","recipe_score":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-12T05:56:44.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"625","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Pistachio Cream SC","flavor_id":"8376","vendor":"WF","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Coconut Cream Pie","flavor_id":"1253","vendor":"FW","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Biscuit","flavor_id":"4487","vendor":"JF","millipercent":750},{"name":"Pie Crust","flavor_id":"2010","vendor":"OOO","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Super Sweet","flavor_id":"2384","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":500}],"reviews":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"205595","name":"An Xxxellent Creampie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
