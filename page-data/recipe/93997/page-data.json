The pear adds a little juiciness to the mix, and the toasted marshmallow adds a bit of sweetness and mouth feel and lets you keep the sweetener low.  Try adding a little of your favorite coconut flavoring to add some more tropical feel to this mix.","steep_days":"3 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:50:04.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"1395","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Banana Cream","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Super Sweet","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Pineapple","vendor":"RF","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Red Touch (strawberry)","vendor":"FA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Strawberry (ripe)","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Sweet Strawberry","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Toasted Marshmallow","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Pear","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000}],"reviews":[{"user":"cdaniell30","text":"I subbed INW Pineapple, so I'll refrain from commenting on the actual recipe.  Instead, let me say that the profile of the recipe is excellent.  It borders on having too much going on with the fruits, but it doesn't cross that line...rather, it does a beautiful little dance right on the edge.  Everything plays together nicely, and it's making me look forward to getting on a big boat next week and sailing to somewhere warm and windy."}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"93997","name":"Honolulu Hallelujah"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
