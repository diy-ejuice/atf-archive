But the formulation of \"Utopia\" changed all that for me. Its' genesis was quite the happy accident. This recipe was NOT what I originally set out to create. Far from it. My goal was a fresh, juicy apricot liquid. Anyway, after some 10 different variations of apricot 'this' and apricot 'that', I became frustrated and just wanted to relax for awhile and un-think my poor brain, in order for something else to occupy the space in my mind.*\r\n  \r\n*I pulled open my Flavour Arts brand drawer and immediately saw FA White Peach and FA Mandarin lying on top of the other neatly organized storage drawer's bottles. THAT was the happy accident. But what followed was purely brilliant and well thought out.*\r\n  \r\n*It's highly unusual that my flavor drawer would not be neatly arranged in alphabetical order. I immediately picked up the two bottles and imagined what they would taste like in my mind. I admit, I was intrigued...but not completely convinced in my imagination that those two would be enough to satisfy and leave me wanting more. I don't know about anyone else, but I was in need of a new \"All Day Vape\".*\r\n  \r\n*I leaned back on the floor and imagined the imaginary(lots of imagining here) eliquid to need something to...\"juice\" it up, sweeten it up, and maybe even \"pulp\" it up a smidgen.  I immediately grabbed the bottle of FA Berryl(Raspberry). That flavor, as I recalled, is certainly juicy, sweet, and \"fleshy\" like a fresh real fruit. I smirked to myself and thought \"Shit. This is gonna be good\".*\r\n\r\n*So, ignoring all thoughts of the pressure of the World Cup challenge, I simply sought out to make a nice fruit vape I could just 'chill' to. I figured, \"Tomorrow I'll rethink possibilities to enter into the competition\".*\r\n  \r\n*Long story long(no one can say that was a short story), I mixed it up at the percentages that made sense in my head. And the rest is....Utopia! Enrich your senses with a mouth-watering(created solely by the Berryl) inhale of sweet fresh tangerine, followed by an exhale of juicy white peach. I really believe the FA Berryl (Raspberry) makes Utopia special. It provided nuances that Inawera's Cactus flavoring can only DREAM of! To call this a peach/tangerine mix is blatantly imprecise. As it is so very much more...*\r\n  \r\n**Pure deliciousness. Pure mouth-watering fulfillment. Pure...Utopia!**","steep_days":"1 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:48:59.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"4269","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Berryl (raspberry)","vendor":"FA","millipercent":5000},{"name":"Peach White","vendor":"FA","millipercent":3500},{"name":"Tanger (mandarin)","vendor":"FA","millipercent":2500}],"reviews":[{"user":"Fiftytrent","text":"Also had to swap in TPA juicy peach because I was missing FA Peach White.
