While many have moved on from FW Yellow Cake, it's my go to for a sweet, sticky cake base and with the addition of INW Yes, We Cheesecake, I get the body I'm looking for in the mix. \r\n\r\nVT Vanilla Buttercream Frosting adds a finishing creamy note that compliments the INW Cheesecake.  It COULD be used at a higher percentage to taste however I prefer this flavor under 2% in a mix like this. \r\n\r\n","steep_days":"4 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:51:03.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"1013","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Sweet Strawberry","flavor_id":"121","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Cake (yellow)","flavor_id":"1222","vendor":"FW","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Super Sweet","flavor_id":"2384","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":100},{"name":"Alpine Strawberry","flavor_id":"4360","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":200},{"name":"Yes, We Cheesecake","flavor_id":"9272","vendor":"INW","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Vanilla Buttercream Frosting","flavor_id":"8990","vendor":"VT","millipercent":2000}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"159183","name":"Crazy Eyes - Strawnilla Cake"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
