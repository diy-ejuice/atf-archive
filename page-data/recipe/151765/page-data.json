Lol, however, this is more of a realistic strawberry/old fashioned milkshake. This is about as far away from a McDonald's strawberry as you can get so don't expect that sickly sweet artificial berry/fake ice cream. This is a LONG steep too... I only found this by accident in the bottom of my steep box, lol!\r\n\r\nMilkshake by Molinberry - Fantastic stuff, hard to explain other than it's a milkshake with no flavoring. This and the VBIC make the backbone of the recipe. The length of the steep is due to these two ingredients I'm sure.\r\n\r\n3 Strawberries - Overkill, right? I don't think so... To get that REAL strawberry flav I wanted some of each of these 3. JF Sweet because CAP Sweet was too candy-ish, TPA Strawberry to fill the bulk of the flavor and TPA Ripe to really get that fresh ripe berry taste.\r\n\r\nVienna cream - I usually add this with my tart berries because it really brightens them while adding even more cream. 2% seemed like a lot at the time, however, turns out it was just right.\r\n\r\nBe patient with this one... Time is key. Don't cook it or the berries will go bye bye.","steep_days":"28","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T21:33:02.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"1263","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Strawberry (ripe)","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Strawberry","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Milkshake","vendor":"MB","millipercent":5000},{"name":"Vanilla Bean Ice Cream","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Vienna Cream","vendor":"FA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Sweet Strawberry","vendor":"JF","millipercent":2000}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"151765","name":"Old Fashioned Strawberry Shake"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
