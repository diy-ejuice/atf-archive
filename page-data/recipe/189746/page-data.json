Bubblegum flavored Lemonade.\r\n\r\n2 layers.\r\nLayer 1: i used LA lemonade at 4%, FE lemon at 2% and VT fizzy sherbet 1.5% to build my lemonade base. I tried with flv lemonade as well but felt it wasnt quite right for this recipe. FS adds depth to the \"drink\" aspect of this vape as well as adding citrus. FE lemon is a neigh on perfect smelling lemonade lemon.\r\nLayer 2: LA bubblegum was used at 3% at first with just 2 lemons and was balanced very well but thin. I bumped it to 4% to balance with the addition of VT FS. That was too much, but 3.5% wasnt enough so we settle on 3.75% and that sits just perfect.\r\n\r\nCAP sweet guava is here low at 3% to add depth and sweetness to the bubblegum without detracting it from a true bubblegum flavor.\r\n\r\ntpa dragonfruit at 1% emulsifies the layers into 1 mix without extra flavor.\r\n\r\nI chose LA bubblegum here for the fact it has no texture just flavoring. I dont want a chewy lemonade i wanted a drink with bubblegum flavoring. IMO sweetener is essential for this recipe to make it taste like a real, syrupy, bublegum lemonade drink vs a la croix or something lol .5% cap super sweet was enough for those results.\r\n\r\nOvernight steep for best results, but SnV approved!\r\n\r\nIf you like my mixes please rate and review!!\r\n\r\nMuch love to the community ðŸ¤˜âœŒ","steep_days":"1 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:51:29.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"1390","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Bubble Gum","flavor_id":"923","vendor":"LA","millipercent":3750},{"name":"Lemonade","flavor_id":"951","vendor":"LA","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Lemon","flavor_id":"1655","vendor":"FE","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Fizzy Sherbet","flavor_id":"8878","vendor":"VT","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Sweet Guava","flavor_id":"118","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Dragonfruit","flavor_id":"226","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Super Sweet","flavor_id":"2384","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":500}],"reviews":[{"user":"notsonattynate","text":"I noticed that I finally have the right ingredients for one of your recipes and Iâ€™m glad it was this one! Man, this hits the spot. I like a lemon vape but, like actual lemonade, it makes my saliva thick and gross. This solves that issue with the bubblegum. Instead Iâ€™m left with that sweet powdery bubblegum instead and I really dig it. Great work! Graham Jefe is next on the list..."},{"user":"winder73","text":"Just mixed it up, this is delicious! My poor La Bubblegum has been pretty damn lonely until now, but what a role it plays in this.... great job! Just what I was looking for"},{"user":"NOVITEC","text":"Fantastic job on this recipe.
