Moist heavenly all day vape.  The infamous (CAP) vanilla cupcake for the pastry.  The French vanilla and vanilla swirl to back up the vanilla in the cupcake and I'm using to cheesecakes, (CAP) cheesecake for the cream and the CGC to add more texture to the cupcake.

One of the few to go from 15 to 120mls..  hits the profile on the head. Thanks for sharing. "},{"user":"cincinnatiking","text":"This is an excellent recipe. It's one of the most asked for from my friends. Thanks for sharing!"},{"user":"phried","text":"So damn rich. But I'm not complaining, it satisfies my cupcake itch. Two to three week steep for me and it's overwhelmingly good. I can see some percentages being taken down a notch, but as the author intended it hits its target."},{"user":"DeadHer0ine","text":"This is a VERY sweet juice. Tastes 'premium' - so a good recipe for someone who's just starting their DIY game or those who have an insatiable sweet tooth. That being said, the different cake flavors all work together quite well without becoming muddy, and the vanilla is very present."},{"user":"kirstyla8","text":"Thanks for sharing this recipe! Its the first time ive used some of the flavours in this recipe. This is amazing and after only 4 days. My partner tried it before me and the smell was sooo good i had to try it immediately. This recipe is definitely going to be in my daily rotation now. So smooth, such a great mouthfeel to it and tastes just like you're eating a real cupcake. Great job!"}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"61729","name":"French vanilla cheesecake cupcakes"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
