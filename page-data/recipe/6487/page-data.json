I love adding one ingredient to this, and that one ingredient varies depending on my mood. FA Kiwi, TFA Dragonfruit, and INW Cactus are some of my favorites to add to it.

I am strawberry mute for the most part, but still love the flavor this gives.  I get a solid but subtle true watermelon, mixed with apple back ground.  I cant say I taste strawberry, but there is obviously a non watermelon apple flavor I get, but cant name. Going to let this sit for a few days, and try after it steeps a little.  Thanks for sharing this,  My first use of Red Summer, and Love it."},{"user":"Benoz","score":"5","text":"Have mixed a similar recipe before and know it tasts good."},{"user":"Fiftytrent","score":"5","text":""},{"user":"Philosaphucker","score":"5","text":"Strap-On is more than a recipe. Thinking analytically, it is a category. Thinking paradigmically, it is an approach to recipe creation. Thinking politically, it is a platform that endears you to the public. Thinking existentially, it exemplifies being authentic. Thinking practically, it is a guarantee of results with minimal investment. Thinking romantically, a well-balanced strap-on will win anyone's heart and affections."}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"6487","name":"Strap-On"}}}
