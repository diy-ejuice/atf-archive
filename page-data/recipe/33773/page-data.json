As a shake and vape this felt like a lucky accident to me (being pretty new to mixing) but it tasted exactly like I had hoped for - a slightly greasy cake type blueberry doughnut with sweet glaze. After sucking down about 4ml of this pretty quickly though, I started to feel a little queasy so I let it sit for a few days. Going back to it every couple of days I noticed some changes... less blueberry one day, more egg another, still enjoyable to vape a half tank of, but after 19 days it was back to tasting just like I remember from the  first day - minus the queasiness. Not an ADV type of flavor for me, but it hits that craving for donuts in the morning :)\r\n\r\nZeppola is the base of the doughnut, with just the right amount of greasy feel to percieve the powdered sugar as being a glaze\r\nCAP Yellow Cake because this is a cake type doughnut, not the fluffy fried type of doughnut\r\nMeringue to add a hint of egginess and to help accentuate the sweetness\r\nJoy at low percentage for that barely there yeasty dough / glaze\r\nBlueberry Extra / Wild - I just love this combo of blueberries\r\n","steep_days":"19 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"updated_at":"2020-12-12T09:12:32.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"5880","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Blueberry (extra)","flavor_id":"218","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":5000},{"name":"Blueberry (wild)","flavor_id":"215","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Joy","flavor_id":"401","vendor":"FA","millipercent":250},{"name":"Meringue","flavor_id":"530","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Yellow Cake","flavor_id":"5854","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Zeppola","flavor_id":"6312","vendor":"FA","millipercent":3500}],"reviews":[{"user":"SlashaLO","text":"This...this was freaking SPOT ON. great job here.
