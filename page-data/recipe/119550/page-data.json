I tried it after two weeks and it almost tasted like it had a tobacco in it. I tried it again after one month and two months, and there wasnâ€™t much change. So I put it back on the shelf. After three months, I was not hopeful at all, but it was actually really nice.  You could use more caramel, but it does kill the coils a bit, so I tend to use it sparingly. \r\n\r\nDefinitely DO NOT shake and vape.\r\n\r\nEnjoy","steep_days":"50","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"total_reviews":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T05:58:20.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"1258","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Cappuccino","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Caramel","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Vienna Cream","vendor":"FA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Bavarian Cream","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"French Vanilla Deluxe","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2000}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"119550","name":"Caramel Latte"}}}
