Here it provides citric brightness while helping to tame the grape side of things a bit. Just a touch of gr.... I mean lemon Sicily helps emphasize the lemon lime, turning this jam into call and response territory. \r\n\r\nSpeaking of grape, the dark star here is a double whammy, with tfa grape juice and inw grape rounding out that purple profile perfectly. \r\n\r\nTruckin right along the middle, flavor wise, is a ripple of the other one, vanilla swirl. Tying the rest together with rich vanilla sweetness it lends some flair and body.\r\n\r\nMe and my uncle both agree that this mix is best with some cooling, so ws23 was happily added, though choose your own path for best results. \r\n\r\nThanks to the lemon Sicily, this is a shake and vape approved recipe, so ain't no time to wait. Thanks for putting up with my lame Grateful Dead references if you've made it this far!
