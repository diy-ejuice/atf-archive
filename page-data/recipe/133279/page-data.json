MACON CREAM\r\n\r\nI have been on the quest to sort out flavors I can use vs what needs to be gotten rid of to make room for all the new stuff  and this little gem was born.  \r\n\r\nONE PEACH - Weak  but pleasant canned peaches in heavy syrup.  No throat hit for me from this one. \r\n\r\nTPA VB GELATO - Vanilla creamy non eggy goodness. Adds some mouthfeel as well. \r\n\r\nVT HONEYCOMB - This is used to add some Caramel type of a flavor to darken the cream a little and add some sweetness\r\n\r\nJF HONEY PEACH - Love this peach. Sweet kinda dark with a little honey note. For me I prefer this one after a steep. \r\n\r\nFLV CREAM - Just a great cream for all this peach to hangout in. \r\n\r\nFW SWEETENER  - This is my goto sweetner as of late feel free to sub whatever your preference is. \r\n\r\nFA ARMENIA -  This adds some Juciness helps brighten the other peaches  adding and there layer to the fruit.
