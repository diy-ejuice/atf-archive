It was custom for Jungleflavors and they might not get anymore. I will update this if I learn more (or find a sub). Sorry, I didn’t know when I posted the recipe. \r\n\r\n\r\nEmpty the packet, add water, microwave, splash of milk. That’s what I’m trying to recreate. \r\n\r\nFE Oatmeal N Milk• The core of the recipe, has the weird fine texture of oatmeal and some milk but leaves room to play. \r\nFLV Apple Filling• Apple and spice but also some thickness from the apple and a little texture/dry from the spice. \r\nCAP Sweet Cream• Fills out the milk and adds a little sweet.\r\nTFA Sweetener• Because the real thing isn’t too sweet and TFA is only sucralose at 5%. \r\nVT Butter Base• I think this is one of the keys to making this work. At .5% it doesn’t stand out but adds some creaminess while suggesting salt that’s in butter but is missing from the Oatmeal N Milk. Those little packets are full of salt so hopefully you think this works, too. \r\nCAP Double Apple• Gives a bit of a boost to the apple, without making it too juicy and spoiling the fun of recreating rehydrated dehydrated apples. \r\nFLV Caramel• For that brown sugar flavor.\r\nFA MTS Vape Wizard• (.02=1drop/50ml) The idea is to thicken it up and blend it, just a touch. Take the edges off and make the dairy cooperate. You’ll probably survive without this if it’s all you’re missing. \r\n\r\nI’ve tried this a few different ways and this is what I’ve settled on. I think it’s pretty accurate but, like the packets it’s based on, it’s not a loud flavor. Too much Oatmeal N Milk gets weird but I didn’t want to drown it, either. If you need it louder I’d start by bumping up the sweetener and Double Apple because that won’t mess with anything too much. The way I’ve got it hits me like comfort food so I’m done searching for perfection.
