A rework of a previous recipe, \"Beat The Champ.\r\n\r\nSame profile as beat the champ, but bigger, and bolder.\r\n\r\n**The Raspberry**\r\n\r\nI just went with an old friend, FW Razzleberry.  The original recipe used some FLV Cranberry and FA Raspberry for something raspberry-ish.  This is a little complicated, a little punchier, and for some reason FW Razzleberry works really well with chocolate too, so bonus.  And the raspberry here is reinforced by the berry notes in the TPA Ruby Chocolate.\r\n\r\n**The Chocolate**\r\n\r\nHey, TPA Ruby Chocolate.  This is newer.  I dig it.  I dig the semi-sweet chocolate thing, and the red berry hints are pretty darn nice.  The Cereal 27 is just bringing in some AP and seems a bit weird, but settles into boosting up the chocolate.  And FW White Chocolate because why not back up that chocolate and add some richness.  Also TPA tastes like black pepper.  Fite Me.\r\n\r\n**The Whiskey**\r\n\r\nNot really a straight bourbon.  I'm playilng around here a bit.  FA Whisky is a scotch, but like a fruity scotch. It works pretty well with red berries in general and I love it.  The red oak is there for some char and some tannic mouthfeel.  And I have no idea why the Lemon Grass works here, but it does.  I promise, the lemon grass is worth it.\r\n\r\nSo, let this steep for about a week.  It calms down, smoothes out, and the AP from the Cereal 27 vanishes into the chocolate.

The razzleberry mixes with everything else to be a perfect liquor covered raspberry. The red osk adds the hint of char, and the lemongrass the extra bit of peat to get that whisky just perfect. The white chocolate mixes with that ruby chocolate to just be this perfect overall chocolate. It's not cloying or overwhelming. This is a lovely little adult dessert. Totally love it, and hate myself for only making 30ml. This bottle has vanished too quickly. Absolute banger and oh so ADV. Nice one!","score":5}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"88051","name":"Heel Turn"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
