Wasn't a fan of straight zeppola or the usual cap\\tpa glazed donut concentrates on their own. Also the latter force a glaze on you. This works very well, stands up to a longer steep & lots of different flavor combos. Oh, I get zero play-doh from this which is a bonus. \r\n\r\nEnjoy on it's own or add whatever floats your boat.\r\n\r\n**Donut base:** zep for the fried dough note, enough for a taste & to give us an outside to fill with the cake mixture. \r\n**Yellow Cake & Cake batter:** I want this to be a nice full flavor. 3% for that nice cake taste & texture. 1% Cap cb to help smooth the mix out & drive home that this is a cake donut. This flavor holds it's own & can really help fill out a cake mix in a heavier way. (If you  wanted\\can't get jf you could sub fw Yellow cake (sugar warning)) **I have not tried this with cap cake batter v2, if anyone does\\has I'd love to hear how it turns out! Thanks!**\r\n\r\n**Sweetener:** ( I used 1 drop\\15ml of cap ss) seems needed for this on it's own I feel. But unless you want that plain donut that nobody else touches it helps. Leaving it out because someone always eats that donut. Not sure if desperation or enjoyment ðŸ¤”\r\n\r\nTo make this a glazed donut: add 1%ish la cci, or flv frosting or tpa frosted donut.\r\n\r\nPowdered sugar donut: add .5- 1% ooo powdered sugar or, if you get powdered sugar taste from it: .5%ish tpa glazed donut. Even a little fa meringue would probably do the trick.\r\n\r\nBlueberry donut: 2% tpa blueberry extra & 4% fw blueberry with .5% lemon Sicily\r\n\r\nWill post my favorite version as soon as I'm done tweaking it.\r\n\r\nThere's really a ton you can build with this. It's tasty off the shake & 3-5 days should give it a fairly good chance to develop. Because of the cake batter, if you get off notes I ask you please give it a full week before rating :) I *usually* add fruits afterwards with this one depending what I'm in the mood for. Have suggested ratio at 80\\20 so you can actually weigh it out as pre-mix on atf when adding flavors to it but we've vaped this between 65\\35 on up without issue.\r\n\r\nEnjoy & Happy Mixing!
