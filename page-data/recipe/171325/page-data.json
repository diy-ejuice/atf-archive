I like it without frosting which brings out the actual flavors of the carrot and the hazelnut a lot more.\r\nAlthough i am not very happy with the available Carrot Cake flavors on the market, i thought i use two of my favorite ones in a recipe.\r\n\r\nooo Carrot Cake is definitly the one which comes the closest to an actual swiss Carrot Cake, but it fades very quickly and doesn't have that hazelnut note that i am missing in all of the varieties.\r\nI paired it with VT Carrot Cake and ooo Corn Bread and JF Hazelnut to blend all of the respective qualities together.\r\nI added a drop or two of FLV Bourbon and i use up to 0.5 sweetener. \r\n\r\nFreshly mixed it's just a mess as the cakes and corn bread need to calm down.\r\nGive this mix a good steep (1 week) and it will taste a bit more the way i like it.\r\nIt is not a very strong recipe, it is not as strong as some of other cake recipes, but i like it as and all day vape in a lower wattage vape setup.","steep_days":"7","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"total_reviews":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-05T23:55:59.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"755","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Carrot Cake","vendor":"OOO","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Carrot Cake","vendor":"VT","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Hazelnut","vendor":"JF","millipercent":500},{"name":"Corn Bread","vendor":"OOO","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Bourbon","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":200}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"171325","name":"Garden Cake (CCC)"}}}
