With the TPA Brown Sugar its got that dark sweet body like the original. Sweetener is added for sweetness without blowing your coil.\r\n\r\nLast but not least, I believe all the ingredients are DX - please let me know if you know otherwise.\r\n\r\nEnjoy!","steep_days":"3 (SNV)","temperature":"20","recipe_score":0,"total_reviews":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-06T04:10:55.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"1706","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Golden Pineapple","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":5000},{"name":"Shisha Strawberry","vendor":"INW","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Strawberry (ripe)","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Red Touch (strawberry)","vendor":"FA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Sweetener","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Coconut Extra","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Burnt Sugar","vendor":"OOO","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Sweet Tangerine Rf","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Dragonfruit","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"DX Brown Sugar","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":300}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"64292","name":"Lava Flow Over The Cuckoos Nest"}}}
