I let it steep for 18 days and it is considerably better than it was of the shake. The tobacco experience is strong with a slightly \"dry\" feel to it backed up by the sweet undertones of the RY4. The brown sugar and bourbon frame it very well with a docile sweetness effectively making me wanna sit around like a Lazy Dog. This is gonna pair real well with my George Dickel in the cabinet. Great Job!!"}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"66760","name":"Lazy Dog "}}}
