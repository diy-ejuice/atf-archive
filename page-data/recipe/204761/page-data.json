Huckleberry is like a mix between blackberry and blueberry.\r\n\r\nFor the yogurt base we take WF frozen yogurt which is creamy and just slightly tangy enough, and pair it with FW yogurt which isnt tangy at all but so DAAPy and delicious, so to get some more of that tang out we add in a smidge of FLV greek yogurt. Some shisha vanilla to smooth it all together into something i would imagine would be sold on shelves.\r\n\r\nA vanilla yogurt infused with dark huckleberrys.\r\n\r\nEnjoy! Probably my favorite yogurt recipe so far.\r\n\r\nI used tpa v custard II in version 1 at 1.5% and felt that detracted from the profile too much. Inw shisha vanilla is a great supportive creamy vanilla without the intensity of the profile of tpa vcII lol\r\n\r\n***AS ALWAYS SWEETEN TO YOUR LIKING\r\nI ADD 1 OR 2 DROPS PER 10ML OF CAP SS OR ABOUT .3-.5%***\r\n\r\ntested this on a pixie rda fused clapton idk what core .35ohm at 48w","steep_days":"3","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T23:39:16.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"462","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Huckleberry","vendor":"DF","millipercent":5000},{"name":"Blackcurrant","vendor":"VV","millipercent":750},{"name":"Frozen Yogurt SC","vendor":"WF","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Yogurt","vendor":"FW","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Greek Yogurt","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":750},{"name":"Shisha Vanilla","vendor":"INW","millipercent":1000}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"204761","name":"A-Hyuckin Hyogurt"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
