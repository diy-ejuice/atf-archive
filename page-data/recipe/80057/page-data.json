This has been a solid ADV in our house for awhile now*\r\n\r\nA creamy butterscotch RY4 inspired by the deliciousness of Glas Basix \"Butterscotch Reserve.\" \r\n\r\nEven though I was initially going for the Glas profile, at the end of the journey it turned into something completely different. This recipe ticks all the flavor profile boxes and is a satisfying desert tobacco vape that you can enjoy almost immediately. I always try to keep some on hand, but if I run out...shake and vape, baby! It just gets better over time.\r\n\r\nFlavor profiles:\r\n\r\nFA Butterscotch adds punch to the FA Caramel. Butterscotch Ripple adds a creamy roundness to really bring out the above flavors and enhance the caramel notes in the RY4.\r\n\r\nEnjoy!","steep_days":"3 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T23:36:09.000-05:00","best_vg":"80%","views":"3150","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Ry4 Double","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":5000},{"name":"Vanilla Swirl","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Butterscotch","vendor":"FA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Carmel (caramel)","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Butterscotch Ripple","vendor":"FW","millipercent":3000}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"80057","name":"Butterscotch Reserve"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
