Vanilla Shisha is creamy vanilla that doesn’t hide easily behind that pretty much buttery Salted Caramel. It’s a rock solid vanilla flavor, exactly what’s required by this recipe. Vanilla Swirl is the type of vanilla that touches your palate before any other flavor, it just sits upfront and rolls the drum.\r\n\r\nButterscotch Ripple (FW) – it’s creamy enough to soften both Vanilla Shisha and Salted Caramel. Butterscotch Ripple is missing that true butterscotch flavor unless mixed with caramel or another brown-sugar-like flavor. It will also make the vape creamy, soft and silky.\r\n\r\nDX Bavarian Cream (TPA/TFA) – another source of vanilla and sweetness. Bavarian Cream also provides texture and density. The most widely used cream ever which pairs perfectly with almost any known flavor.\r\n\r\nSweetener is optional. You may rather want to add Cotton Candy or Marshmallow instead, it’s up to you. I just love that straight sweetness on my lips.\r\n\r\nLet it steep 7 - 10 days before judging. Two weeks will make it vape perfect!\r\n\r\nOriginal (maybe updated) recipe: http://vapingmule.com/articles/ejuice-recipes/moose-salted-vanilla/","steep_days":"10","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"total_reviews":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-06T22:02:25.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"1158","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Butterscotch Ripple","vendor":"FW","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Dx Bavarian Cream","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Salted Caramel","vendor":"OOO","millipercent":4500},{"name":"Sweetener","vendor":"FW","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Shisha Vanilla","vendor":"INW","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Vanilla Swirl","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2500}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"82684","name":"Moose Salted Vanilla"}}}
