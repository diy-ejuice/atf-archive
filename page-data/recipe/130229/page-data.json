According to their wiki, it is a super sweet sugary substance called moon sugar, blended with a \"nightshade\" of which there is no other description.  So taking from that, this flavor is friggin sweet. Moon sugar is supposed to be super sweet, so yes, I used 3% CAP super sweet to stimulate this effect...and yes it's a lot, but it kinda needs it for the fantasy of this recipe.  \r\n\r\nOOO Powdered sugar gives it a slightly more powdered and little bit waxy nature, which was exactly what I intended it to do.  \r\n\r\nFor the non descriptive nightshade notes, I decided to do something that would resemble belladonna berries, because that seems like the most logical nightshade to include in a narcotic type substance, choosing flv elderflower and boysenberry for berry type notes, the syrupy sweetness of elderflower adding to the boysenberry.   Sugar orchid also adds a bit of waxy floral note, and FA violet adds some floral spice notes. The little bit of kick from the VT bitters adds just a touch of bite to the berries cutting through the sweetness and giving balance to the recipe. \r\n\r\nWould I suggest mixing this? Well if you like sweet vapes, it will hit the spot.  But it is a fantasy flavor not based in reality and may be a bit much for many mixers who have never played with florals.  It is weird. And if you're sensitive to sucralose it's really not the recipe for you.  You can try to sub the super sweet, but it was the only one that gave the sugar lips effect I was aiming for (yes I tried a few different ones.)  If you do mix this, I suggest only mixing a 10ml to start with.
