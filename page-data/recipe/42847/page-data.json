I spent many summers as a kid chillin out on the project benches going to town on these things. They usually come in a long stick but I've found miniatures version recently. I went a while with not eating these and as per my moms request she begged that If I found some to pick her up some. So me being the good son I am I did find them, I bought her a bunch and some extras for the kiddo and myself. Eating them I came to the conclusion that a peanut butter and toasted coconut might make for an interesting vape. *PB*  \r\nHS/TPA- My favorite PB ATM has to be FLV but here it was too creamy and not quite exactly what I wanted. HS PB has a distinct peanut taste. I felt the combo of the 2 make for a very pleasing PB.  \r\n*Toasted Coconut*  \r\nFOr this I went with FLV Macaroon it has that \"toasted coconut\" along with a bit of \"Crunch\" that comes with eating chicko sticks. Added a bit of FA Cookie for more crunch. My first instinct told me to use some TPA coconut candy to help out the macaroon but I winded up liking a bit of sweet coconut better. Toasted Marshmallow puts the finishing touch on my \"toastedness\".  \r\nBavarian cream is just a supporting flavor here it adds a bit to tame that Peanut flavor but moreso I just used it here as something for everything to sit on. Kinda blend things together.  \r\nHope you guys enjoy. 2 Week steep needed on this one","steep_days":"14","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:49:16.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"12709","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Peanut Butter","vendor":"HS","millipercent":500},{"name":"Peanut Butter","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Toasted Marshmallow","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Macaroon","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Sweet Coconut","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":500},{"name":"Cookie","vendor":"FA","millipercent":750},{"name":"Bavarian Cream","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Sweetness","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":350}],"reviews":[{"user":"Billywilly","text":"Phemomal job on this recipe. I absolutely love chic o sticks and this recipe is just that, a chic o stick. I actually started vaping this after just an overnight cure. I'll be mixing up a much larger bottle of this soon. I had to pick up hs peanut butter for this recipe and I'm glad I did.. it works wonderfully in this recipe along with the tpa peanut butter. I did use super sweet instead of sweetness because I just like it better."},{"user":"Thadentman","text":"I let this steep for quite a bit and am eating the candies while vaping this, The flavor is incredible and I'm really digging the toasted coconut in this recipe. Perfect representation of a cloned irl \"thing\" . Crunchiness toasted coconut and an amazing peanut butter, complex and extremely enjoyable.
