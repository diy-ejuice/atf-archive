There's a lot of different flavor elements getting thrown against the great wall of Fuji, but what I'm getting is the feeling that I'm eating some sort of smooth pudding made from nothing but fuji apples.  I mean it's surprisingly accurate to the flavor of an actual apple, and the creams are doing a lot more work at smoothing the texture than they are actually altering the flavor of the mix.","score":5}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"25350","name":"The Fugeees"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
