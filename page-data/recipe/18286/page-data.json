I have topped my tart with cinnamon sugar.\r\n\r\nTHE BASE- CAP Sugar Cookie- Due to the limit of 6 ingredients, I've used just 1 ingredient for the base. Sweet, buttery CAP Sugar Cookie. Does it really need anything else? \r\n\r\nTHE FILLING - FA Armenia(Apricot) - in a french apple tart, apricot glaze is brushed onto the top of the tart. I chose apricot because it goes so well with strawberry, as i found out after making the strawberry astronaut clone from reddit many months ago. Even though that recipe calls for TFA strawberry and not ripe, the Strawberry ripe and apricot combo is still giving that unusual but delicious taste you get from the two together.\r\n\r\n                      - FA Fuji - I am in Australia and placed an order just days before you announced the competition, and received my order 2 weeks into the comp.Thank god I ordered CDS and Sugar cookie. Unfortunately I didn't order JF Fuji, as i have a 50ml of FA Fuji to get through. So that is my legitimate reason for using FA Fuji. The real life french apple tart calls for a sweet and tart apple to be used. This was not going to happen, due to the 6 flavour limit. This is a tart,sharp apple that i added sweetness to with EM and TFA Strawberry Ripe.\r\n\r\n                        - TFA Strawberry Ripe- This is mainly used as a sweetener to brighten and sweeten the Apple. But it also plays very well with the Apricot, which is why I pushed it up to 5%, to give that combo flavour that they bring together.\r\n\r\nTHE SUGAR ON TOP - CAP CDS - I kept the % low on this, because I heard it does not play well with Strawberry. So at 1.5% I'm just trying to get a touch of cinnamon flavour out of it. Also my first time playing with this flavour, so I kept it simple.\r\n\r\n                                    - FA Meringue- powdered sugar to sprinkle on top, mixed with the CDS to make cinnamon sugar. It may even lend some egginess to the base.\r\n\r\nFREE INGREDIENTS - ETHYL MALTOL (10%)- ok so when I was listening to B.Blending last week, the chat got to talking about whether or not TFA Strawb. Ripe has E.M in it. Turns out it doesn't. It only has Maltol. So I added it in to sweeten the pot a little, and make the strawberry more like TFA Strawberry, which does have E.M in it, and is my favourite.(and is the strawberry that goes so well with apricot.)\r\n\r\nI did have a lovely photo to go with the recipe, but it was the wrong file type, and i'll be fucked if I know how to fix it. (way to old and nooby)\r\n\r\nI just want to say that this competition has pushed the shit out of me as a mixer, and steepened my learning curve. I've learned a lot just by participating, so thanks guys.\r\n\r\nGreg Miller\r\n\r\n\r\n","steep_days":"7","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:48:52.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"1016","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Armenia (apricot)","flavor_id":"507","vendor":"FA","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Cinnamon Danish Swirl","flavor_id":"35","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Ethyl Maltol","flavor_id":"1710","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Fuji","flavor_id":"506","vendor":"FA","millipercent":3500},{"name":"Meringue","flavor_id":"530","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Strawberry (ripe)","flavor_id":"271","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":5000},{"name":"Sugar Cookie","flavor_id":"115","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":4000}],"reviews":[{"user":"FizzChaser","text":"This is absolutely excellent.
