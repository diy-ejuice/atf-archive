It's VERY strawberry forward and TPA Strawberry gives it that sort of strawberry soda/candy taste (think strawberry Fanta). I might try a mix with the strawberry toned down or split between Strawberry and Strawberry Ripe. I'll update my review after a couple days steep so I can see if the VBIC comes through a little more. It's there but very faint and just adds more of a thickness to the taste than any cream."},{"user":"Mr-G","score":"none","text":"its ok"}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"6888","name":"Unfit Berries"}}}
