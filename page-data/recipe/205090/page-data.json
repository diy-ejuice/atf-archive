I'm not a huge orange fan but this one is easy to vape. A tiny bit throaty but it's ok. 5 star cause it's good and you guys are awesome üòã &#xD;\nEdit: the harshness disappeared after 24 hour and the first 2 days the flavor was pretty good....try it again today after 8 days and the flavor has completely changed, I must say that I'm not able to vape it after a week, to me it's kinda dry and there's a wired taste that I cannot put my finger on, but I don't like it.....still 5 star for a 48 hour mix, I'm going to mix it again, like 10 or 15 ml and vape it right away.....","score":5},{"user":"Maralie1184","text":"This is delicious!! I've never really vaped anything this distinctly ORANGE before, so I was pleasantly surprised. It's super bright &amp; punchy &amp; 100% accurate to the profile. I'm still pretty new to mixing, so I was blown away by just how flavorful an 8.5% total flavoring recipe could be. The Developed guys definitely don't disappoint with this one!! üçäü§§","score":5}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"205090","name":"Blood Orange Sherbet | DEVELOPED"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
