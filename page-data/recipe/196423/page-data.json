The buttery yet soft cookie provides the perfect base to this cookie.\r\n\r\nJF Cookie helps shape it and provide the realistic crunchy edges and golden flavor that a fresh baked cookies have.\r\n\r\nTFA Butter is used just low enough to provide a buttery note that is present in a fresh sugar cookie or even snickerdoodle.\r\n\r\nCAP Cinnamon Sugar and FLV Rich Cinnamon provide the spice backnotes to a true spice dusted sugar cookie\r\n\r\nFLV Vanilla Custard helps provide the right amount of body while thickening the mix to provide a dense slighhtly saturated mouthfeel that you get when eating a sugar cookie.\r\n\r\nCAP Super Sweet at 0.25% to 0.5% is crutial here to provide the sweetness you get while eating cookies especially one as sweet as a sugar cookie. I like it at 0.25% however\r\n\r\nSUBS: If you don't have FLV Vanilla Custard you can use CAP Vanilla Custard at 1%,","steep_days":"5","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"total_reviews":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T15:22:10.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"487","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Butter","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":300},{"name":"Cinnamon Sugar","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":400},{"name":"Cookie","vendor":"JF","millipercent":800},{"name":"Sugar Cookie","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Super Sweet","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":250},{"name":"Vanilla Custard","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":250}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"196423","name":"Cinnfully Sugared Cookie"}}}
