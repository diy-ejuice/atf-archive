While this is not meant to be a sherbet or taste like Shurb, it has a reminiscent sugary sweet sizzle that shares many similarities.   \r\n\r\nBefore I get ahead of myself, I do want to mention that yes, there are several high % flavors and I know that will freak some folks out, but I simply could not achieve what I was going for with any less, trust me I tried(48 times to be exact).  Taste is certainly subjective, so Jelly Candy and Salt Water Taffy could probably lowered without major detriment.  Super Sweet on the other hand assists the blood orange & pineapple in carrying the sugary sweet sizzle across the tongue in a way I couldn't achieve without it.  \r\n\r\nThis recipe is the culmination of tireless attempts to clone a juice and eventually pulling my hair out, trying some more, then giving up and coming up with something relatively new.  It reminds me of throwing back a hand full of jellybeans, but a much bigger punch!","steep_days":"1 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-06T20:42:01.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"1543","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Blood Orange","vendor":"FW","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Jelly Candy","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":6000},{"name":"Pineapple","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2750},{"name":"Salt Water Taffy","vendor":"FW","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Super Sweet","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":250},{"name":"Sweet Strawberry","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":5000},{"name":"Watermelon","vendor":"LA","millipercent":5000}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"29161","name":"Five Fingers"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
