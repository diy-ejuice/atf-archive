In my opinion this is spot on \"Yoplait\", those small dessert style vanilla yogurts.\r\n\r\nWhat really makes it here is the combo of **FW Yogurt** and **DFS Holy Vanilla**, as it brings that creamy vanilla yogurt flavor and mouthfeel. Added a relatively high dose of **FLV Boysenberry** for that very sweet, jammy and delicious berry flavor on top of that.","steep_days":"1 (SNV)","temperature":"420","recipe_score":5,"total_reviews":1,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:50:55.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"1565","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Boysenberry","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Yogurt","vendor":"FW","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Holy Vanilla","vendor":"DFS","millipercent":1000}],"reviews":[{"user":"XleaDrof","score":"5","text":"This a spot on, easy to mix, berry yogurt.
