All I can say is wow this is probably one of the best peaches that I don’t get a perfume note from. It lacks a little in the pie department but it’s a easy fix.  Paired with JF biscuit, Cap Vanilla whipped cream and touch of Tfa vbic makes WF peach pie & cream  shine. Great job Wonder Flavours. Don’t be afraid to push this one 5 to 7 % range.
