Caramel and tobacco heavy. Medicine Flower and FlavourArt caramel together at this ratio is the perfect RY4 caramel to me. This needs to steep for sure!\r\n\r\nI've updated this to use JF RY4 Double (3%) instead of DIYFS Holy Holy Grail RY4 (4%) because I feel like the simplicity of the JF works better. Holy Grail has a lot going on already. Feel free to still use Holy Grail or even TFA RY4 Double (3-4%) if you like.
