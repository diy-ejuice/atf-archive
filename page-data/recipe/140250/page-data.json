I also had some FE Mango around that I wanted to try.\r\n\r\nA soft tropical Juice putting attention on the Honeydewz! Using Mango as my boosting tropical background and Country apple to liven things up with a fresh fruit vibe.\r\nI also added some FA Pear for a touch of moistness and some TPA Sour Apple for a pucker of tarty freshness of a delicious fruit Juice.\r\n\r\nThis vapes great as a SnV! and Strangely also changes flavor depending on temp/wattage vaped at. Lower wattages I get mostly Honeydew and Higher tempts a more blended Honeydew with the Mango and WS23 coming forward.\r\n\r\nA Great Summer Vape!\r\n\r\nSS- Leave sweetener out if you want to BUT I used 0.4% SS. Your choice.\r\nWS23 - Push up to desired %\r\n\r\nGive this a mix if you enjoy Honeydew or Mango","steep_days":"3 (SNV)","temperature":"1000","recipe_score":0,"total_reviews":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:50:45.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"1249","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Honeydew","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Pear","vendor":"FA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Sour Apple","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Mango","vendor":"FE","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Vanilla Swirl","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":600},{"name":"Super Sweet","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":400},{"name":"WS-23","vendor":"OTHR","millipercent":500},{"name":"Country Apple","vendor":"PUR","millipercent":1500}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"140250","name":"Tropical HoneyDewz"}}}
