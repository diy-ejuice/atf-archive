I wanted a heavy yet creamy base for the other flavors to blend into.  This combo works great.  The crembrulee adds to the caramel.  The FW Salted caramel and flv butterscotch make a nice bright carmel and even gives the hint of the salted note.  I used flv milk chocolate because it blends well with the custard and does not have an over powering chocolate with no off notes.  The sweet coconut low works to enhance everything and give a nice sweetness.
