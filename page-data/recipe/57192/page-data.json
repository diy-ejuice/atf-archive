I was looking for a way I could use FE Sweet Rice in a recipe with flavors that I had. This mix is crazy addictive I wasn't even going to share this but I'm honestly impressed with it.\r\n\r\nFE Sweet Rice gives a great body that isn't grainy but just moist soft white rice.\r\n\r\nFLV Rich Cinnamon 2 drops in a 30ml really takes cinnamon to the forefront and sits as mostly the top note of the mix but is blended throughout.\r\n\r\nFLV Guanabana is the only flavor I have with coconut in it and even though it's not exactly what I want (I'm not a fan of coconut) this works great in the mix.\r\n\r\nTFA Bav/TFA Sweet Cream/FA Cream Fresh/TPA Van Swirl\r\nWell rounded cream base that blends and sits right in front of and above the Sweet Rice deliciously.","steep_days":"1 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T23:35:51.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"1236","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Sweet Rice","vendor":"FE","millipercent":5000},{"name":"Bavarian Cream","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Guanabana","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":500},{"name":"Meringue","vendor":"FA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Vanilla Swirl","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Sweet Cream","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Cream Fresh","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Rich Cinnamon","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":100}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"57192","name":"Cinnamon Breakfast Rice"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
