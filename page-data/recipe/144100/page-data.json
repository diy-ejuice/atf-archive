First off, I didn’t have the same ingredients for the most part, so I subbed my own. Secondly, I made some changes and introduced flavorah wild melon. The original recipe suggests 2% super sweet which is obviously excessive, but I tried it at 1% and was pleasantly surprised. It’s great. \r\n\r\nShake and vape but there’s a lot of flavoring there. It settles down and blooms around the one week mark. \r\n\r\nOriginal recipe here: http://e-liquid-recipes.com/recipe/1083464/Mama%20Melons%20%28Inspired%20by%20Monster/Mega%20Melon%29","steep_days":"7 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:50:48.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"2344","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Cantaloupe","flavor_id":"23","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Wild Melon","flavor_id":"619","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Honeydew Melon","flavor_id":"73","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Sweet Mango","flavor_id":"120","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Papaya","flavor_id":"252","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Blue Raspberry Cotton Candy","flavor_id":"15","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":500},{"name":"Super Sweet","flavor_id":"2384","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1000}],"reviews":[{"user":"AAP-DAAP-DERP","text":"Wow.
