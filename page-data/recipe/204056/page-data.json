This is a pretty straightforward recipe and only the first version of it, feel free to play around with the %'s of those dark sweeteners and see what works, the toffee comes through quite well at 1%, I would like to see some more of that butterscotch though. I suppose it all depends on the device you use it on too. I haven't been able to taste anything on this pod, I'm more of an RDA lover myself :) Please reduce the SS if you wish, all the percentages are high because pods.\r\n______\r\nGive this a week to steep for best results. It's possible to SNV it but I think the custard really starts to fill out and combine with the darker flavours by day 5 (and the toffee settles down) TPA VC2 is top notch custard indeed!\r\n______\r\nI'm a new mixer, started in April, only just started playing with some MTL stuff and any feedback is appreciated so I can improve my mixing skills.  I swore I'd never get a dotAIO but when the hype still hadn't died down I figured I'd get one for when dripping isn't practical, ya know :) ","steep_days":"7","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"total_reviews":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T07:01:49.000-05:00","best_vg":"60%","views":"737","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Vanilla Custard 2","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":12000},{"name":"Butterscotch","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Caramel","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Toffee","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Cream","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Super Sweet","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":2000}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"204056","name":"Toff Notch Custard | For MTL/Pod Devices"}}}
