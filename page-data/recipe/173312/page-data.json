This is my interpretation of a simple fruity mix with a touch of ice. \r\n\r\nFA Pomegranate and INW Raspberry are the stars here and provide an authentic, earthy & deep red fruit base. These 2 were destined to be wed and compliments one another to birth this magnificent hatchling. \r\n\r\nFA Coconut provides an intriguing, intricate, creaminess whilst imparting a delicate natural coconut edge. I have tried various other coconut choices but this one just works here so much better. \r\n\r\nFA cream fresh blends our fruit masterfully and, off course, adds that delicious creaminess which has made this baby a staple in every self respecting DIY’ers arsenal. \r\n\r\nWS23 is used to add an icy edge and keeps this ensemble from being linear. The OG uses menthol but I realize that most mixers prefer WS23, hence the inclusion. \r\n \r\nThis baby is good to go after 2 or 3 days!","steep_days":"3 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:51:12.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"1540","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Pomegranate","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Raspberry","vendor":"INW","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Cream Fresh","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Coco' (coconut)","vendor":"FA","millipercent":500},{"name":"WS-23","vendor":"OTHR","millipercent":250}],"reviews":[{"user":"Xist","text":"I'm usually very reluctant to try a mix with INW Raspberry, but I went for it.  There have been some exceptions such as Glaistig, which was my favorite mix for the longest time.  As usual though it's all I can taste in this mix, and it's just not for me.  So, if you're like me, and don't dig that candied raspberry flavor. skip this one, or maybe take the rasp down lower."},{"user":"beigeduck","text":"Delicious! I've got a bit bored of coconut recently and considered skipping this recipe but the mix is nuanced, it's not a coconut flavour that comes through but instead - as the mixer says - this delicate creaminess and extra dimension to the strong berries.
