I took inspiration from various lemon meringue pies but I was looking for something less pungent than straight up lemon meringue. I think the whole secret to smooth pout the lemon flavor in general is FA Apple pie and FA meringue. For the coconut side FLV Sweet coconut is unbeatable but I wanted to help with the other 2 coconuts I had for different notes. To add creaminess FA Custard premium is my favourite and FW coconut cream pie give a good base. Probably all this could be done way easier and with fewer ingredients by an experienced mixer.  After a few attempts I love the result. It needs a few days to settle up but after that it's creamy goodness. The % are a bit high for somebody but I feel they work for me. Sweetener is also optional but after trying both I prefer it with.\r\n I would like to thank many mixer who I took inspiration from , expecially DazCole, but I don't remeber all the recepies I looked at, so thank you mixer community!\r\np.s . If you feel the lemon still pungent, add a few drops of TFA Smooth or similar.
