I  love the nutty backnotes and the dialed-back sweetness.  I would like more of a fluffy, thick mouthfeel but it's not too far off the mark to stop me from keeping this in my daily rotation.  A really nice toffee custard! "},{"user":"Deftohms","score":"5","text":"Woah, this is good. I don't know why it took me such a long time to mix it. It has a very \"phillip rocke creme de la creme\" vibe to it. Really smooth and dark flavor, nothing too crazy or complex, just a very satisfying and tasty mix. Lately Cap vanilla custard hasnt been doing much for me, been getting really burnt from that flavor. This is a great mix that doesnt let it overwhelm at all, and for me makes it very enjoyable again.
