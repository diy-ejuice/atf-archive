To me it brings a nice red apple flavor with out the skin.\r\nDragon Fruit and Sweet Guava bring in some extra juiciness and some sweetness.\r\nStrawberry (Ripe) and Sweet Strawberry are doing their thing, being strawberry and tasty. \r\nJuicy Orange and Sweet Tangerine aren't on the label on the original, nectarine is, but this is tangy delicious combo.\r\nSweetener to taste, recommend at least .5% but I just tried it with 1% and its really really good.\r\n\r\nOriginally I put this on a 3 day steep time but have mixed up another bottle and couldn't wait to crack into it. I now give this a shake and vape certification.\r\n\r\nTested in the Falcon Tank and the Entheon.\r\n","steep_days":"1 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"total_reviews":1,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:50:39.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"2400","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Apple Fuji","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1300},{"name":"Double Apple","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":2620},{"name":"Dragon Fruit - Pitaya","vendor":"INW","millipercent":660},{"name":"Juicy Orange","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":660},{"name":"Strawberry (ripe)","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Super Sweet","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":660},{"name":"Sweet Guava","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":2660},{"name":"Sweet Strawberry","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":5250},{"name":"Sweet Tangerine","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":2300}],"reviews":[{"user":"CaptainCornbread","score":"5","text":"Wonderful mix! I knocked down to about 75% of the original percentages, and it came out beautiful. I also changed the dragon fruit to tfa dragon fruit but kept the super sweet at .66%. I used 70% vg. Excellent layering of the flavors and a overall a very good recipe!üëç"}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"133706","name":"Trending - A Pachamama Remix"}}}
