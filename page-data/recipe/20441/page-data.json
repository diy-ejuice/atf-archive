It's only fitting this is the first recipe I post. I used to mix sweettart at like 10% when I was Vaping out of cartomizers so needless to say my old mix needed a little tweaking. After reworking this thing for the past six months i think i've come up with a pretty good representation. I wanted to capture that chaulky ambiguous fruit flavor where you can't tell if the different colors are different flavors.\r\n\r\nSweet & Tart- It's called Sweetangy on ECX, idk how many names they've had for this flavor but its the sweet tart candy flavor from TPA.  A little of this goes a long way for me. This is really more like a sweet tart than smarties but at lower percentages adds that fruit flavor that you just can't get anywhere else. This flavor is a little bitter  though and doesn't provide much sweetness, hence the sucralose.\r\n\r\nFW Jawbreaker- Seeing this flavor was what inspired me to take another stab at this recipe. i was so disappointed when i cracked it open and smelled nothing but fucking juicy fruit gum!!!! Well i did a test anyways and figured out it was really just the smell not the taste when vaping it and at low enough percentage the juicy fruit smell steeps off and you're left with a chaulky candy quality that works great with the sweet tart. This can work up to .5%, after that juicy fruit stays.\r\n\r\nAlmond- This was the other missing link. One thing i really like about Wayne's marshmallow cereal milk is it reminds me of the white candy cigs i used to blow through packs of as a kid. I couldn't isolate what flavor i was getting that from until i noticed it again in Krucial's butter almond custard. Fantastic recipe btw. This flavor works some kind of magic to blend the other ingredients and add depth and density but doesn't steal the show in any way.\r\n\r\nEverything else is pretty much to smooth it out and add sweetness.  I tried my best to make it work without sucralose but my other sweetening option weren't working out. You could try jacking up the ethyl maltol and sub out the FA marshmallow for TFA or use whatever sweetener you like. It is a candy recipe though so sugar that shit up.\r\n\r\n\r\n","steep_days":"5","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:48:54.000-05:00","best_vg":"75%","views":"2094","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Sweet And Tart","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Jawbreaker","vendor":"FW","millipercent":250},{"name":"Vanilla Swirl","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Almond","vendor":"FA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Bavarian Cream","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Marshmallow","vendor":"FA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Sweetener","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2000}],"reviews":[{"user":"ID10-T","text":"Holy shit thatâ€™s perfect. Spot on Smarties. You want to vape Smarties? This is the recipe. I was really skeptical of the FA Almond in there until I went to mix it and took a whiff pf Almond before dripping it into the bottle. It 100% belongs in there. MIND BLOWN. It seems to me that this mixer is a genius for figuring that out and Crazyndalazdayz just gained a follower.  Just make sure to mind the steep to get that gnarly grain alcohol taste out of the TFA Sweet &amp; Tart.
