On the inhale you get that bright citrus note followed by the sweet honeydew  and bit of  sweet warmth added from the  bourbon.  Good  on an RDA at 60 watts  after a 3 - 4 day steep. **NOTE This grows a bit and the honeydew  really comes forward after  a day or so, so give  it at least 3 days before deciding if you want to change anything  to suit your taste**  \r\n\r\nFor   the melon  -  FLV honeydew is the main note - it  is a sweet almost creamy type  of honeydew   it is full body  and has a slight  syrup/ sticky sweetness note to it and seems to grow over time    this need to be balanced with some wild melon and melon rind  to add some more wetness of a cocktail \r\n\r\nFor the sweet and sour mixer i used a combination of  citrus soda which to me is very much like a sprite soda  with a lemon/lime main note  - it is bright, front forward and also seems to grow..   Blood orange which brings a nice bright  citrus sweetness  along with some tartness  and helps filling the middle a bit    finally apple sour which is a sweet and sour  candy syrup  like  note.  This contrast is needed  to create balance in a handcrafted cocktail. \r\n\r\nBourbon is used low here for some warm notes  as you would expect in an alcohol beverage  - but it is not booze .   it also add some darker sweet notes to contrast some of the brighter top notes\r\n SWEETENER:  I added sweetness to mine at .5%  as I like that additional sweetness  which   midori has     but it is really not needed as the honeydew is pretty sweet on its own \r\n","steep_days":"3","temperature":"0","recipe_score":4,"updated_at":"2020-12-12T11:52:38.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"1221","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Blood Orange","flavor_id":"4407","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":500},{"name":"Bourbon","flavor_id":"4411","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":750},{"name":"Citrus Soda","flavor_id":"10083","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Honeydew","flavor_id":"10089","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Melon Rind","flavor_id":"10087","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":750},{"name":"Sour Apple","flavor_id":"4379","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Wild Melon","flavor_id":"619","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1500}],"reviews":[{"user":"ID10-T","text":"On one hand, Midori is something I've chased off an on for a very long time and I've never gotten anywhere near this close to that unique flavor. Not even in the ballpark of this close.  I don't know exactly how it all fits together but I'm convinced now that FLV Honeydew, Melon Rind, and Wild Melon, maybe with the help of one or more of these other flavors, is essential for Midori. And it does indeed taste like Midori mixed with sweet and sour. I'm definitely going to steal from this recipe to try to recreate what a I want - a cocktail made of Midori, coconut rum, and Sprite or 7up. So I really appreciate that bit of awesomeness. However, I get a bit of that charred oak that makes FLV Bourbon so good in other settings, and it tastes weird, and frankly a little gross, up against that melon. There has to be something else to give it that alcohol warmth and darker sweetness that won’t bring along anything icky. Maybe TFA Kentucky Bourbon. Maybe FA Liquid Amber. Maybe one of the rum flavors. Basically, the Bourbon makes this taste like it was forced to be an all-FLV recipe when it shouldn’t have been.
