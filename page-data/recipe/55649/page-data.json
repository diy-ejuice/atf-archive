Came across this recipe that I wound up not making but still might. \r\nBut, I had to vape it.,\r\nGive a google and you will find some interesting recipes for it, they all call for either lemon or lime juice with it. I tried several here and it just got too much on the citrus for me.\r\n\r\nAs for the rest, I LOVE FLV MANGO, but it can be thin at times and is super juicy. I used FLV Peach (which is AMAZING) to give it some more body. If you have FLV Pear and are not afraid to use it drop peach to 1% and add .5% of FLV Pear. It provides that amazing texture without it's godawful flavor.\r\nI used FLV Marshmallow here because I have it and it is <3 I needed something to provide the sorbet softness and add sweet, so here you go.\r\nFLV Blood Orange, I have been eager to use this in a mix since I smelled and tasted it. Much over 2% in mixes and it gets REALLY rindy, to me. At this level it is enough to stand and sing with the Mango.\r\nPolar Blast and Sweetness, YES, cold and SWEET. Feel free to get CAP SS in here, I would not add any extra Maltol with TFA Sweetener... If you dont have FLV Sweetness you should, it is a bit different.\r\n\r\nSteep time, this is really good as a SnV, full body comes in after a few days.\r\n\r\nCooling: This is really good without the Polar Blast, I tried it with FLV Ice and I get a weird note with that one, not as bad as straight Koolada but still. Also good with WS-23","steep_days":"4 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:49:29.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"6072","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Mango","flavor_id":"3516","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Peach","flavor_id":"629","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1200},{"name":"Blood Orange","flavor_id":"4407","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Marshmallow","flavor_id":"3521","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":500},{"name":"Polar Blast","flavor_id":"5910","vendor":"FA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Sweetness","flavor_id":"4413","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":200}],"reviews":[{"user":"ConcreteRiver","text":"I did the Pear / ws-23 version and I'd definitely recommend stepping your game up.   Mango forward, with a blood orange accent. Cooling level with the ws-23 is dead on.  Texture is also a thing to behold.  My only (extremely limited) point of contention is that the peach is maybe just a bit clearer than I'd expect from the profile but it's delicious and you kind of have to be looking for it to notice it.  Great stuff, and, without hyperbole, absolutely fantastic."},{"user":"ID10-T","text":"What started as merely trying this recipe because FLV Mango + Fear = Must Mix for me after Abuela, turned into a project of comparing and contrasting four different versions, all of them delicious and fitting the bill for a mango-orange sorbet and wonderful summer treat. As written, it had just enough cool to be refreshing and suggest a sorbet. Tried the FLV Pear variation with Polar Blast and although I wouldn't recommend buying that Pear, as it is an abomination, it made the sorbet texture even better. Spot on. Tried it as written with WS-23 as a 1:1 sub for Polar Blast and it was colder, smoother, and more satisfying, but the WS-23 seemed to damage or at least distract from the thickness you want in a sorbet; it became more of a slush. Tried the Pear version with WS-23 and this is what's up. That Pear gave it back what the WS-23 took away and created an amazing sorbet vape with body and chill. If you happen to have both FLV Pear and WS-23 in a 30% dilution, give that a try. Love it. Blood Orange and Mango (with peach to give it some volume) comes together so well, I hope to see more of that pairing. Well done!
