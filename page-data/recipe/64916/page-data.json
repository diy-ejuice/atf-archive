Well, let me say I was not disappointed whatsoever! I loved it so much that I've vaped it constantly all month without getting bored; something that is extremely rare for me.\r\nDecided to have a crack at a remix/clone as I can't justify ordering more when I've got all these flavours that need using!\r\nWe know 2 of the ingredients; those have been included but the rest is educated guess work.\r\nIâ€™d recently gotten hold of JF Sweet Strawberry and originally didnâ€™t think thereâ€™d be enough diversity in the strawberries if I used this, but it had that Rosemilk quality so I used a reasonable amount and it seems to work. TFA Dragonfruit brightens and melds those strawberries beautifully, making them more â€˜Rosemilk-yâ€™. \r\nI'd also put money on there being a good amount of CAP NY Cheesecake in there too,  4 % felt about right, prominent but not too much. \r\nThe CAP VCV1 was included solely because I remember Wayne saying there was a small amount in, otherwise I may have left it out. \r\nObligatory super sweet ðŸ˜‰\r\nIâ€™ve gotta say this is damn close in flavour and mouthfeel, 95% there if I had to put a number on it.\r\nI would also encourage anyone that hasnâ€™t tried the original to do so immediately! Itâ€™s not your ordinary Strawberries & Cream.
