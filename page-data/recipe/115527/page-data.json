A weird thing, but a thing. And this does that thing as well as it could be done, as best I can tell. There's some separation here, with both the stellar root beer top notes and as bold a creamy banana finish as you could hope for without going candy. Where they meet in the middle, there's a brief moment when it's almost chocolately, somehow, , but it's tasty so I can't find anything to complain about. Great flavor and lots of it even if it is an odd combo. ","score":5}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"115527","name":"Weighty Flocks #GrimmGreen"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
