This reminds me of fruit monster mixed berry. Which I loved. There is just the right balance of blackberry/ sweet currant to buttery custard note. Excellent full mouthfeel from LB VIC and the FLV pudding. INW biscuit is always great for that buttery crispy bakery bite! Thank you @Freshepies for a beautifully executed recipe!"},{"user":"DodgerFog33","text":"I saw this and it looked so good I had to try it. I didnâ€™t have LB VBIC so I subbed with FW. Right off the shake this vape is outstanding, great flavors and a nice crispy buttery finish. Well done.
