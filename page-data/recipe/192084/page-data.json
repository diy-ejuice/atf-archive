This one is for you all! \r\n\r\nEarly in my time mixing, I enjoyed a lesson in mixing patience and steeping with a recipe called \"God Milk\". It was an excellent example of a strawberries and milk 4+ years ago. This recipe is not attempting to replicate that great recipe in anyway rather to respect it for what it was along with so many other amazing similar recipes since. \r\n\r\nIt's past time time though with all the amazing concentrates in hand that are available here in 2020 to create the finest Strawberry Milk of them all! \r\nThis is \"Goddess Milk\".\r\n\r\nThe Cream Base - Is a delicate combination of authentic flavours blended carefully to get the right balance and the most realistic mouthfeel possible once steeped.  \r\n\r\nThe Strawberry - JF Strawberry Sweet is the God to the Goddess here. It holds up beautifully against all the creams and sits just nicely here. \r\n\r\nWhat to expect? \r\nOn the Inhale a delicious and full,sweet, syrupy & rounded strawberry followed on the exhale with the strawberry softening while blending with the silky smooth blend of creams of the very authentic strawberry milk mouthfeel on the exhale.  I have vaped 120ml of this already without fatigue. \r\n\r\nStrawberry Blind? \r\nPlease try the \"Blind Goddess\" by subbing JF Strawberry Sweet at 2.5% with Wonder Flavours Strawberry Gummy Candy. \r\n\r\nSteep Time: While very vapable off the shake I recommend for best flavour experience to allow 5-7 days. \r\n\r\nI enjoy this at 60W on a Single 0.2ohm SST coil on a Recurve RDA.\r\n\r\nI hope you enjoy this just as much as I enjoyed creating this recipe, but let me know what you thought in the comments below.\r\n\r\nSeriously if you like a solid recipe that works give it a go!\r\n\r\nCheers for reading this far, now go and get mixing!\r\n\r\n\"Together, Let's Discover!!!\"\r\n\r\nFacebook - https://www.facebook.com/groups/diydownunder/\r\nDiscord - https://discord.gg/kH4Fqbc\r\nYoutube - https://www.youtube.com/c/diydownunder\r\nWebsite - https://www.diydownunder.com/\r\nInstagram IGTV : @diydownunder\r\n","steep_days":"7","temperature":"0","recipe_score":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-12T02:46:10.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"3037","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Cream Fresh","flavor_id":"540","vendor":"FA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Milk","flavor_id":"523","vendor":"FA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Strawberry Sweet","flavor_id":"4745","vendor":"JF","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Super Sweet","flavor_id":"2384","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":500},{"name":"Vanilla Ice Cream","flavor_id":"1511","vendor":"LB","millipercent":3500},{"name":"White Fudge SC","flavor_id":"8383","vendor":"WF","millipercent":500},{"name":"Sweet Cream","flavor_id":"8979","vendor":"VT","millipercent":1000}],"reviews":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"192084","name":"Goddess Milk "}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
