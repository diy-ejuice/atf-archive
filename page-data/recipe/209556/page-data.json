The flavor profile is an exotic blend of deep, bold lychee, mouth watering guava, and juicy, tangy orange. These three are all balanced beautifully with lychee being right up front. The guava carries all the flavors underneath. The orange is that heavenly bridge between the lychee and guava the just really seals the deal on this whole thing. I hope you guys find this as addicting as I do! \r\n\r\nAnd please remember to give me constructive criticism if you have any issues with the recipe :)","steep_days":"2 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-12T18:31:03.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"9","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Lychee","flavor_id":"628","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Sweet Guava","flavor_id":"118","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Pink Guava","flavor_id":"637","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Sweet Tangerine","flavor_id":"123","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Blood Orange","flavor_id":"4407","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Cactus","flavor_id":"647","vendor":"INW","millipercent":250},{"name":"sweetener (sucralose)","flavor_id":"2313","vendor":"OTHR","millipercent":400}],"reviews":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"209556","name":"Fruit from the Stars: Andromeda "}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
