I’m too busy enjoying this masterpiece. Stuff is amazing. If you like butterscotch, vanilla, or any type of tobacco that’s supposed to taste good, you’ll be happy that you finally found a recipe like this one "},{"user":"kindground","score":"5","text":"This is a really nice tobacco forward recipe! You can't go wrong with Red Burley. That chocolate note is amazing. I was afraid that it would clash with the Butterscotch here but it doesn't. It layers with it nicely. The Cured keeps this a bold tobacco with its cigar like quality and slight ashiness. When I vape this I get a face full of that chocolate note layering with the subtle Butterscotch and all that tobacco goodness backing it all up underneath. Very nicely balanced mix! If you love tobaccos this is a winner. "}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"112532","name":"Burley Scotch"}}}
