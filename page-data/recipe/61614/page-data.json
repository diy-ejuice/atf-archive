The blue raspberry from Real Flavors is just a really good flavor and brings in a nice sweet but tangy flavor that bursts this flavor to beyond it limits adding such a great amount of flavor. Inw raspberry is a strong flavor but used at very low percentage adds just a great dark raspberry note to the recipe. This truly is just a sweet melon that will keep your mouth begging for more all day long. No steep required definetely a Shake and Vape that has the perfect amount of flavor and sweetness. Steep 3 days and the flavor is absolute bliss. Try it you won't be disappointed. Simple but great. Mixed 65/35PG if you like it sweeter add .25-5 FLV Sweetness or Cap Super sweet","steep_days":"3","temperature":"0","recipe_score":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-10T14:52:13.000-05:00","best_vg":"65%","views":"1332","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Blue Raz","flavor_id":"2222","vendor":"RF","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Watermelon","flavor_id":"7797","vendor":"PUR","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Apple (green)","flavor_id":"1176","vendor":"FW","millipercent":750},{"name":"Raspberry","flavor_id":"667","vendor":"INW","millipercent":250},{"name":"Wild Melon","flavor_id":"619","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1000}],"reviews":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"61614","name":"\"Melon Smash\""}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
