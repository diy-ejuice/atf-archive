I've been working on a watermelon kiwi candy lately and I'm pretty happy where this is at. On the front you get a watermelon with kiwi accents and the sugar that comes with all candies. This recipe has been my ADV for the last week. It's simple and yet offers enough to keep coming back for more.\r\n\r\nI've use FW candy watermelon and FW kiwi as these pair up really well. I've found FW seems to do candies very well. I've used watermelon at 4% and kiwi at 2.5% because I wanted the watermelon candy present throughout the vape and kiwi on the tail end.\r\n\r\nTFA Marshmallow is so great and when picking which marshmallow to go with I needed something to fluff up the mix and make it taste sticky. Marshmallow at 2% is enough to not give off any marshmallow flavour.\r\n\r\nNow as for cotton candy and CAP super sweet. They are perfect for a candy recipe and I tried using just tfa sweetener, but the water content really does kill the mix. You can sub CAP super sweet with FW sweetener at 1%.","steep_days":"3 (SNV)","temperature":"470","recipe_score":4,"total_reviews":1,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:49:11.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"3764","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Candy Watermelon","vendor":"FW","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Kiwi","vendor":"FW","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Super Sweet","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":500},{"name":"Cotton Candy","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Marshmallow","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2000}],"reviews":[{"user":"Div","score":"4","text":"Nice mix.&#xD;\nI made this a few days ago and waited the recommended steep time before trying it. My first impression was that of a straightforward watermelon however, after spending a lil more time with it I noticed the kiwi more an more. Its subtle to be sure as the marshmallow has softened the high citrus notes of the kiwi and the cotton candy is a nice touch that adds to the candy feel of the mix. &#xD;\nOverall I enjoyed it. Its a little lighter of a vape than I normally enjoy but the flavor is a nice twist on watermelon without being overly complicated. Simple yet delightful.
