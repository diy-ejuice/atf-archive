This started out as a test of the Strawberry Trinity and was then turned into a lovely ice cream. Super Smooth and really smack you in the face Strawberry. This vape only lasted a few days and was gone. The Ice Cream is a pretty standard Ice Cream layer I use in a lot of recipes and backs up this berry really nicely. It is all Strawberry on the inhale, smooth thick and creamy mouth feel - followed by a hint of cream on the exhale. Already mixed up more of this and is steeping away in a dark corner. Let me know what you think ... this was my first recipe with ID10T's trinity mix ... love is an understatement.","steep_days":"5 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-12T14:07:44.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"1675","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Shisha Strawberry","flavor_id":"1711","vendor":"INW","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Red Touch (strawberry)","flavor_id":"421","vendor":"FA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Strawberry Sweet","flavor_id":"4745","vendor":"JF","millipercent":1500},{"name":"French Vanilla Icecream","flavor_id":"2129","vendor":"HS","millipercent":750},{"name":"Vanilla Ice Cream","flavor_id":"1511","vendor":"LB","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Vanilla Swirl","flavor_id":"189","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Super Sweet","flavor_id":"2384","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":500}],"reviews":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"178200","name":"Strawberry Trinity Ice Cream"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
