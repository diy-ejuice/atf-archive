So since I haven't tried the actual recipe I'm remixing, I wanted to keep things simple and succinct. Thanks to ID10-T for the 2/2/2 macaron base.\r\n\r\nThe macaron base I used was something @ID10-T introduced in his Mango Blossom Macaron recipe (check it out, it's yummy). I really enjoyed that recipe and in the spirit of #remixmonth, I figured I'd tweak it into a lemon macaron which is the profile of GG's Vlog Day. \r\n\r\nDave's base is a 2%/2%/2% mix of CAP Sugar Cookie, FA Meringue, and FA Almond. Now, that is a fantastic base for a straight to the point macaron so I did not want to stray too far from it. FA Almond was left at 2% to give us that perfectly clean almond flavor. FA Meringue was also left at 2%. This is just the perfect ingredient for a macaron recipe. It's light, sweet, and airy while also bringing along the egg white taste we need. CAP Sugar Cookie is pretty self explanatory and contributes it's sweetness along with just enough texture to fill out our base. I bumped the CAP Sugar Cookie up by 0.25% just to help sort of tame the lemon combo we have going on. You might not think 0.25% will do much of a difference, but I found that little adjustment to help a lot. \r\n\r\nFLV Cream is just a perfect neutral cream for a macaron cream filling without turning this into a lemon cookies and cream recipe. This flavor allows itself to be present while still allowing complexities and other layers to do their thing. It's the Switzerland of creams. I did play around with replacing FLV Cream with LA Cream Cheese Icing (@ 1.5%) and while it was still tasty, CCI blended things together too much for me. It gave the recipe more of an almond lemon cookie with sweet frosting feel \r\n\r\nFE Lemon and FA Lemon Sicily are great \"toppings\" for this base. FE Lemon by far holds up to a steep much better than FA Lemon Sicily so that is why I used it here at 2%. It's sweet and kind of candy like, but fits very well into bakery recipes while not dying with a steep. FA Lemon Sicily does not hold up to a steep as well, but I think it tastes just a little better than FE Lemon. That being said, I wanted just a little bit of sharp tartness to round out my lemon layer and 0.3% Lemon Sicily does exactly that. If you do not have FE Lemon, FA Lemon Sicily at 2.5% can be an okay substitution but will not hold up to a longer steep as well as FE Lemon.\r\n\r\nI would definitely let this recipe cure for at least 5-7 days to allow everything to come together. Also, don't forget to check out ID10-T's Mango Blossom Macaron recipe!

Fuck you, Goldfish. I'll be so happy when I run out of this delicious and perfect lemon macaron recipe so I get back to my to-do list. The only word of warning I would give about this recipe is to mind the steep time. I snuck a taste at 5 days and while it was tasty, the lemon is a just little too much for a delicate macaron. At 8 days, the lemon drops down just enough for that less in-your-face lemon you want in this kind of pastry. If you love lemon bakery recipes, give this one a try. If you've made your own lemon bakery recipes, you'll appreciate how much work I imagine went to balancing this. "}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"51247","name":"Blog Day #Remixmonth"}}}
