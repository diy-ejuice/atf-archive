It can be used at low percentages as an additive role or as the main role. At 4%, stays right at the front note without messing the overall balance of the profile. It's the only watermelon I enjoy because it's authentic, juicy and doesn't fade so much especially at this percentage. Next, FLV Wild Melon to give a little more body to the Watermelon itself.\r\n\r\n**TPA Dragonfruit / TPA Honeydew** - Both flavours make this profile even juicier and TPA Dragonfruit helps a lot here creating a bond between the watermelon and the berries.\r\n\r\n**FA Forest Mix / CAP Harvest Berry** - Both percentages for my taste are just enough to be present in this profile. If I go higher, I start to get plastic off-notes especially with CAP Harvest Berry. Combined, the blackcurrant and the raspberry are present while the blueberry and the strawberry note stays right at the back being slightly present aswell.\r\n\r\n**CAP Super Sweet** - Optional here but in this case, creates a more full mouthfeel.","steep_days":"1 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:50:22.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"5151","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Watermelon","flavor_id":"616","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Wild Melon","flavor_id":"619","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Dragonfruit","flavor_id":"226","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":750},{"name":"Forrest Mix (forest Fruit Mix)","flavor_id":"453","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Honeydew","flavor_id":"238","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":300},{"name":"Harvest Berry","flavor_id":"69","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Super Sweet","flavor_id":"2384","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":150}],"reviews":[{"user":"Ebc88","text":"Excellent recipe everything was well balanced surprised this doesnâ€™t have more reviews.

Flavors blend well and give off a pleasant vape experience. I am sure with time it will get a bit better. Great summer fruit vape.
