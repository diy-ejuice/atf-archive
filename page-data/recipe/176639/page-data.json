Actually it did not have the wild melon in it last night. But as I was enjoying vaping it I found that the melon was just not showing up how I wanted it or envisioned it when I put JF honeydew in. Someone I know vapes tried it and said yummy grape! So somehow 2 apples, 1 pear, 2 honeydews, 1 cantaloupe, and 1 blueberry somehow makes grape. NOTES...I love VT bilberry ripe and this was what I wanted to build a recipe with that day. I really couldnt come up with a better partner to showcase this flavors than a couple of really nice melons. They work well together and they did me well again here. I also noticed how well melons work as a background flavor. Probably the best mixing tip I have learned thus far is that 97% of flavors out there by itself is not goos. Making a good recipe involves building something from the ground up and complimenting one flavors weaknesses with another's strength. Getting to know your flavors is a huge aspect of becoming a good mixer and you get that by mixing more. Anyways I was getting closer but for whatever reason I wanted these fruits to taste like they had just been sprayed by those sprinklers in the grocery store and you picked 5 of them up (and somehow blueberry jam was a thing mixed in those fruit) and shoved them in your mouth. I used pear to attain this effect. Just needed balancing from there. Sub whatever you have to except FA pear, Flv wild melon, Jf honeydew, and VT bilberry ripe are all integral and the recipe would not convey what I wanted without them. EDIT: This isnmy favorite thing I have come up with in the month that I began mixing and I also made it better, at least I think. I added 1% fw blueberry and it just sets this recipe from really good to banger status. Really would like to hear what you guys think. <3","steep_days":"0 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"total_reviews":2,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:51:15.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"1995","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Fuji","vendor":"JF","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Double Apple","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Honeydew Melon","vendor":"JF","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Bilberry Ripe","vendor":"VT","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Pear","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Wild Melon","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Super Sweet","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":600},{"name":"Blueberry","vendor":"FW","millipercent":1000}],"reviews":[{"user":"DumHed","score":"none","text":"Cap harvest berry is a better sub than fa bilberry, it has a grape-like flavor similar to bilberry ripe @AutomaticFailure"},{"user":"AutomaticFailure","score":"5","text":"Mixed this up, yet subbed VT Bilberry for FA Bilberry at 1%. I get one of two things going on here. Knowing what is inside this mix, I definitely taste the melon mix going on. (Honestly, I think that's a downfall with DIY in general, is that you know what is in the mix, so your brain pinpoints those flavors out) Which, if that's what this was supposed to be, you got my vote.&#xD;\nNow, if you were to hand this to me, blindly, and just say 'Vape this!' I can totally see the grape aspect here. It seems as if you deskinned a red grape and just popped it in my mouth. There is a watery, yet textured aspect to it. A more natural of the vine grape than that bullshit purple candy grape.&#xD;\nEither way you look at it, it's good.  "}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"176639","name":"Grape!?"}}}
