Its a nice mellow cinnamon flavor, if I close my eyes I can pretend that I am a child again and eating cereal at moms table. I can even taste the cinnamon swirls on the toasty graham pieces! All and all a really good vape, I am liking this mixer more and more with this one.","score":5}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"201339","name":"Cinnamon Crunch Cereal"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
