One of the best coffee flavors IMO. Smooth coffee with a caramel sweetness and no burnt off notes.\r\nVT Coffee Milk Froth to add the creamy milk froth note and give the coffee more depth.\r\nOOO Cream Milky Undertone to add a smooth milk note with some mouthfeel.\r\nFA Meringue to round out the cream/milk notes. Give a more airy egg flavor and add some sweetness.\r\nFLV Eggnog was the obvious choice for the Eggnog flavor. Best Eggnog flavor out there also IMO. Well balanced spices with the nog in the background.\r\nFA Jamaican Rum to add a slightly boozy spice sweetness.\r\nPUR Super Sweet to sweeten it up a touch, but can be omitted as it is already sweet. I just like it sweeter.\r\nMinimum 7 day steep for it to start to smooth out.  Really get solid after 2-3 weeks. It is vapeable off the shake but is a bit harsh.","steep_days":"21","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-11-29T18:20:11.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"1310","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Caramel Coffee with Sweet Milk","vendor":"PUR","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Coffee Milk Froth","vendor":"VT","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Eggnog","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Meringue","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Cream Milky Undertone PG","vendor":"OOO","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Jamaica Special (jamaica Rhum)","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Super Sweet","vendor":"PUR","millipercent":250}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"124033","name":"Eggnog Latte"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
