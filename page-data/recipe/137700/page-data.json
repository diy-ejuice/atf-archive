Brandy is used here since there are very few solid cognac flavors that come across as cognac without some hard to avoid off notes. \r\n\r\nOn the inhale you get nice sweet apple brandy that transitions to with a slight tart lemon berry finish.  Best vaped  in an RDA at 60 - 70 watts (4.2v)  this is a easy all day vape\r\n\r\n**apple-cranberry** and **two - apples** work to create the cranberry apple fruit juice for this mix. Apple cranberry is just a great tart slight sweet flavor that is perfect for a cocktail mix Two apples has more of a fermented apple similar to a sparkling cider and works with the brandy \r\n\r\n**bandy** has a sweet grape that leans almost dark raisin fruit note with a nice warm boozie . There is also a bit of an orange peel finish. it is ideal for cocktails. \r\n\r\n**Pomegranate** and **grenadine** create a pretty solid genedeine type of syrup. WF grenadine is thin but has a solid flavor and needs help. FA pomegranate is really close to a solid grenadine so it is used here. \r\n\r\n**milk and honey** works for some body and darker sweetness \r\n\r\n**Lemon** FE is just a solid fresh lemon that will hold up and last in this mix , as many lemons tend to fade.  **honey Pomelo** adds a nice finish to the mix  and helps the pomegranate and lemon.  f you want a more prominent sour note try a bit of VT lemon sour in addition. \r\n\r\n **NOTES:**  FA brandy can be used in place of VT but it does not carry a boozie note   but will work nicely here are as well.  I like a bit  of sweetener with fruit so I added  FLV sweetness at .50% .  FLV cranberry can be subed for  apple  - cran  for a tarter  mix.  but  I really like that touch of apple in the cran apple.  \r\n\r\nLearn more about mixing here:\r\nfacebook - https://www.facebook.com/groups/diydownunder/\r\nDiscord - https://discord.gg/kH4Fqbc\r\nYoutube - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCTCwb7ULyfJALQlehomZZQA\r\nwebsite - https://www.diydownunder.com/","steep_days":"3 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T21:32:53.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"941","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Apple Cranberry","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1750},{"name":"Brandy","vendor":"VT","millipercent":4500},{"name":"Grenadine SC","vendor":"WF","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Lemon","vendor":"FE","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Milk & Honey","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Pomegranate","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Two Apples","vendor":"INW","millipercent":1750},{"name":"Honey Pomelo","vendor":"VT","millipercent":1000}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"137700","name":"Last Dance (cran-apple, lemon, brandy cocktail) "}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
