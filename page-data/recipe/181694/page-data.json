Been working on this for over a month now and I think I finally got it. Definately was not easy but I will let you all be the judge on how I did. Recipe Creation: My cloning process is simple; whatever profile I am after, I test 2-3 flavor combos that I think would make up the main aspects of the recipe. I keep testing combos until I find a similar enough base to build off. In this case it was zeppola and deep fried pastry dough. From here I had to figure out what flavor were needed to get me to the end product. The sugar cookie and cinnamon Danish swirl add more light airy pastry, sweetness, and spice. The golden butter helps boost the fried aspect and the richness. The Bavarian cream helps with some rough edges and keeps it from being dry. Enjoy!","steep_days":"7 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":4.7,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:51:21.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"3718","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Zeppola","vendor":"FA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Deep Fried Pastry Dough SC","vendor":"WF","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Bavarian Cream","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Cinnamon Danish Swirl","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Golden Butter","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":500},{"name":"Sugar Cookie","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":3000}],"reviews":[{"user":"Johnny2Vapes","text":"I've bought and vaped a good share of #32 by Beard Vapes and this tastes a lot like it. I was skeptical at first and thinking no way could this be CDS and I was proven wrong just by the initial taste taste. It's definitely not as sweet as the comercial line but that's not a bad thing."},{"user":"grumpyoldfart","text":"eh"},{"user":"BigRed","text":"i love this mix"},{"user":"Gordo","text":"I have bought and vaped '32 since 2016, possibly 2015. This remix has always been my own great white whale. Your mix is fantastic.  It is just how you describe it [...not so sweet, ...] .  Five stars, I think you are 95% there. What is so great is I may not see # 32 after may. Thank you for this."}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"181694","name":"Beard #32 clone (funnel cake)"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
