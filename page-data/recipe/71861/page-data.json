Love this stuff. Very dairy heavy but it's a great concentrate. \r\n\r\nNotes\r\n\r\nFw blueberry - IMO the king of blueberries. 2% is all that's needed here. Nuff said.\r\n\r\nWf frozen yogurt - as I said this stuff is the bomb! 2.5% is a good amount in this recipe. Super rich dairy creamy yogurt.\r\n\r\nFa juicy strawberry - Another bomb concentrate. Juicy sweet strawberries for days. 1.5% of this stuff is just right to mix with the blueberry and yogurt/vbic.\r\n\r\nFa red touch - 0.5% just to back up the juicy and give our berries that little extra depth. \r\n\r\nTfa VBIC - This is here to add some vanilla and a little extra cream. \r\n\r\n","steep_days":"7","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:49:41.000-05:00","best_vg":"80%","views":"1856","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Frozen Yogurt SC","vendor":"WF","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Vanilla Bean Ice Cream","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Blueberry","vendor":"FW","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Juicy Strawberry","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Red Touch (strawberry)","vendor":"FA","millipercent":500}],"reviews":[{"user":"FizzChaser","text":"WF Frozen Yogurt is excellent.
