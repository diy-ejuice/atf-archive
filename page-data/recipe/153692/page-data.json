Muddle the berries and ice until they are crushed.\r\n\r\nDivide the guava juice between the two glasses. Fill the remainder of the glasses with club soda or seltzer water. Gently stir and serve immediately.\"\r\n\r\nI wanted a refreshing Strawberry vape and never found a good use of FLV Alpine Strawberry in this kind of vape, so this was the time.\r\n\r\nFLV Alpine Strawberry is the king of the recipe, 1% is a good amount to get its full brightness, you can taste it at 0.2% but i wanted it full pack.\r\n\r\nTPA Strawberry Ripe adds sugary strawberry sweetness a good touch of ripe flavour and gets rid of the sharp notes to get more the effect of Strawberry water.\r\nTheres no need to say more about this flavouring its really good.( if you can taste it, and if not for its other properties)\r\n\r\nThe Agua Fresca : Agua Fresca  means \"Fresh Water\" in this recipe is made from CAP Sweet Guava and VT Sherbet playing the role of Club Soda and Guava Juice.\r\n\r\nCAP Cool Mint adds the mint leaf touch in the end of the vape and a bit of green bitterness. \r\n\r\nWs-23 at 2% is my go to percentage i love Monster Fresh vapes, a good point to start maybe like 0.75% if you are not into icy Vapes.","steep_days":"3 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"total_reviews":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T04:40:59.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"1243","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Alpine Strawberry","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Strawberry (ripe)","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Sweet Guava","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":5000},{"name":"Fizzy Sherbet","vendor":"VT","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Super Sweet","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":500},{"name":"WS-23","vendor":"OTHR","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Cool Mint","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":250}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"153692","name":"Strawberry Guava Mint \"Agua Fresca\""}}}
