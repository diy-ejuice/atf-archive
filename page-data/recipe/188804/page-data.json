It’s also thick and a bit creamy - the plush part, I guess - with nice floral top notes that speak of Spring. The bit of bitterness from the Elderflower and Hops comes back around in the finish and lingers in a way I’m personally not very fond of, but others will probably find it refreshing and appreciate that it’s so full-bodied without being too rich and finishes without a cloying sweetness that too many recipes have.
