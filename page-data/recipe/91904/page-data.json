That banana back note works in this recipe but may not work in a more savory type vape.. Adding citrus to it seems to even bring that note out more and acts as the top note . The honeysuckle and meringue add the sweetness that is needed in a gelato . and bring the vanilla galeto and avocado together in this mix .   The Key lime is the top note and well who does not like lime and avocado!   This is a a creamy light bright gelato that could easily be an ADV . The percentages are made for a RDA and profile may not be strong enough in a subohm","steep_days":"3 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"total_reviews":1,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:50:01.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"1410","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Avocado Cream","vendor":"VT","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Honeysuckle (pg)","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":750},{"name":"Key Lime","vendor":"FW","millipercent":750},{"name":"Meringue","vendor":"FA","millipercent":750},{"name":"Pistacchio (Pistachio)","vendor":"FA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Vanilla Bean Gelato","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2000}],"reviews":[{"user":"CygnusY1","score":"5","text":"This looks interesting and delicious.
