A lot of people are switching to the Real Flavors SC line but the flavors that I used are from the original VG line.  I caught them on sale and they tend to need higher percentages so if you try this with the SC line you will need to adjust.  The steep time is really needed to pull the ingredients together. \r\n\r\nI used the RF-Cinnamon Custard, FLV-Eggnog and CAP-Vanilla Custard to add more spices, egg and mouthfeel to the mix.\r\n\r\nThe FLV-Maple Bar and FA-Maple Syrup were to bring out the syrup flavor.  The FA-Zeppola was used for the fried aspect.  \r\n\r\n***I made this without any sweetener and although it was good it could use a little bit of sweetener.  I prefer Sugar Daddy Vanilla or Cinnamon for this recipe but PUR-Super Sweet would work as well.  IMO I don't think CAP-Super Sweet would work well for this recipe.***\r\n\r\nImage Credit-Google Search/Alltherecipes","steep_days":"14","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-06T14:08:01.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"4272","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Cinnamon Custard","vendor":"RF","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Eggnog","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1500},{"name":"French Toast","vendor":"RF","millipercent":6000},{"name":"Maple Bar","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":500},{"name":"Vanilla Custard","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Zeppola","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Maple Syrup","vendor":"FA","millipercent":500}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"113419","name":"Homemade French Toast "}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
