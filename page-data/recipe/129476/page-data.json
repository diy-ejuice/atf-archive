I can actually taste the flavors in it, especially the lemonade. I did, however raise the flavor percentage to 30% and found no off notes or other weird stuff. Maybe 20% flavoring would taste the same as my 30%, no idea. Thanks for sharing. "}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"129476","name":"Strawberry Lemonade (Pod nic salt)"}}}
