I mixed it on April 1, tasted it today. I have say this flavor is really outstanding. The mix of the strawberries is perfect. It perfectly sweet. I would have never thought to use Bavarian cream in the recipe but it really makes the recipe blossom. It has a nice thick creamy mouth feel after three days. I can't wait to see how this flavor develops after a week steep. Great job on this recipe. This definitely could be an ADV for many people. Thanks for the great recipe. "},{"user":"Kriswk","score":"5","text":"Just delicious.. a well blended strawberries and cream. The strawberry here is very unique to me. That combo of sweet sb and shisha creates this super jammy, sugared strawberry with a very slight tang right on the end. All throughout the vape is this amazing, thick carmelized cream. Very custard-like and sweet, which just creates a perfect ADV for me. although, this really is better after a pretty decent steep. Like a week to a week and a half is definitely its sweet spot. The creams really overcome the strawberry in a good way and everything blends together. Thanks for this man. Great job."}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"11789","name":"Ol'e Nessie"}}}
