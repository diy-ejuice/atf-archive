The Vta lemon tart already contains sucralose so drop the super sweet if you wish :)\r\n\r\nIf you like what I do and this recipe then please rate and review :)","steep_days":"7 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-12T11:52:46.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"2239","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Berry Blend","flavor_id":"4395","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":3500},{"name":"Jammy Berry","flavor_id":"10150","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":500},{"name":"Cookie","flavor_id":"490","vendor":"FA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Custard Premium","flavor_id":"9118","vendor":"FA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Flapper Pie SC","flavor_id":"10106","vendor":"WF","millipercent":3500},{"name":"Lemon Meringue Tart","flavor_id":"10071","vendor":"VT","millipercent":1750},{"name":"Super Sweet","flavor_id":"2384","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":500}],"reviews":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"149952","name":"Summer Pie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
