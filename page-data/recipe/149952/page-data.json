The Vta lemon tart already contains sucralose so drop the super sweet if you wish :)\r\n\r\nIf you like what I do and this recipe then please rate and review :)","steep_days":"7 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"total_reviews":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T23:37:38.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"2233","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Berry Blend","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":3500},{"name":"Jammy Berry","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":500},{"name":"Cookie","vendor":"FA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Custard Premium","vendor":"FA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Flapper Pie SC","vendor":"WF","millipercent":3500},{"name":"Lemon Meringue Tart","vendor":"VT","millipercent":1750},{"name":"Super Sweet","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":500}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"149952","name":"Summer Pie"}}}
