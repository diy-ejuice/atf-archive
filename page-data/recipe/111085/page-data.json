So I created Amara's Custard.. According to lore this is the sister of the oh great one..  I figured a custard over a Milk because we all know sibling are all different..\r\nVanilla Custard V1 is a must.. \r\nLemon Meringue Pie within the mix for that slight lemon notes with a creamy taste.\r\nMarshmallow.. What can I say.. it's Marshmallow you can't go wrong.\r\nNew York Cheesecake.. yet another flavor you can't go wrong.\r\nSweet Coconut.. DUH!!\r\nVanilla Whipped Cream.. This is like the Frank's Red Hot.. I put That Sh*t on everything.\r\nGolden Butter.. What's a little Butter in a mix.. This will help with the creams.\r\n\r\nOverall a very tasty mix and well balanced in flavor as well as creaminess throughout.. \r\n\r\n\r\nCheck out what DIY Downunder has to offer:\r\nhttps://www.facebook.com/groups/diydownunder/\r\nhttps://discord.gg/kH4Fqbc\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCTCwb7ULyfJALQlehomZZQA\r\nhttps://www.diydownunder.com/","steep_days":"7","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T23:36:46.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"3015","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Vanilla Custard","flavor_id":"131","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":3500},{"name":"Lemon Meringue Pie","flavor_id":"84","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":2750},{"name":"Meringue","flavor_id":"4112","vendor":"RF","millipercent":800},{"name":"Golden Butter","flavor_id":"60","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":500},{"name":"Sweet Coconut","flavor_id":"605","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":850},{"name":"Marshmallow (Vanilla)","flavor_id":"1798","vendor":"OOO","millipercent":1650},{"name":"Vanilla Whipped Cream","flavor_id":"1","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1850},{"name":"New York Cheesecake","flavor_id":"90","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":2550}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"111085","name":"Amara's Custard"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
