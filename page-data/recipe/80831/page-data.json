Wow... love how this mix is developing!  Think it will be one of those super satisfying vapes that lingers goodness in your mouth.  I will update my review and rate after recommended 30 day steep."},{"user":"SlashaLO","text":"This was a phenominal custard. The cereal 27 gives JUST enough gritty/AP texture and graininess and it fits so well with the custard. This is honestly probably my new favorite custard mix. Thank you for this. And thank you for not using Cap VC1 haha. "},{"user":"CygnusY1","text":"Was looking at this today. Have the ingredients so will mix it up later. Clever use of Cap Cereal 27, I have it in a fried ice cream recipe at 3% and it tastes great! "}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"80831","name":"27 Custard "}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
