But it is too hot to stand by the fire and roast a marshmallow.  So this recipe gives you that yummy S'more, without the fire, but better yet you get it deep Fried in a pastry dough. Delicious!!\r\nI built this recipe starting with FLV Smore.   This is a great concentrate with the chocolate flavor, I just built upon it for a more delicious smore.   I added FW Graham Cracker,  OOO Marshmallow (Vanilla), and a touch of  VTA Dark Chocolate. To give the deep fried taste, WF Deep Fried Pastry Dough and a little FA Joy.  \r\nIf you do not have the OOO Marshmallow (Vanilla), you van sub with Cap SL Whipped Marshmallow, or a marshmallow you like.  \r\nSteep 3 days for excellence, but it is delicious after shake. \r\nEnjoy!!\r\n\r\nCheck out my original version of this if you enjoy a more chocolatey vape.  It is good as well..\r\nhttp://e-liquid-recipes.com/recipe/2430511/Deep%20fried%20S%E2%80%99mores\r\nLOOKING for a group to learn about mixing your own juice check out these groups and your tube channels\r\n\r\nhttps://www.facebook.com/groups/diydownunder/\r\nhttps://www.diydownunder.com/ \r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/user/frank1360\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0xkeZFSG04Has ","steep_days":"3 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"total_reviews":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-05T15:43:39.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"2541","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Smore","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Deep Fried Pastry Dough SC","vendor":"WF","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Marshmallow (Vanilla)","vendor":"OOO","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Graham Cracker","vendor":"FW","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Dark Chocolate","vendor":"VT","millipercent":100},{"name":"Joy","vendor":"FA","millipercent":250}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"106405","name":"Deep Fried S'mores"}}}
