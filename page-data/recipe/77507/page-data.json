The american blend gold is euro flavor brand but it was not in the list. The american blend gold(EF) and virginia(FA) blend into a great tobacco flavor that hits all the right notes. Combined with the ry4 double(tpa) gives it a nice sweetness that my first  try of this mix was missing. The koolada and menthol give it a nice \"kool\" like menthol punch.
