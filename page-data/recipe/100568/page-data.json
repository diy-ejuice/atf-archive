This is it!! That custard!! The custard you have been needing in your life. The custard you just need to buck up and get the ingredients and mix because its that dam good. This custard is on ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥.  Oh and mix a big bottle because you will need it because like i said this custard is fire. What are you doing??? Mix this recipe already\r\n\r\nIts a corn bread custard. This doesn't obliterate your coils after vaping 5ml like country clouds corn bread pudding its absolutely delicious. If you absolutely have to you can sub Capella sugar cookie for real flavor super concentrate sugar cookie but you really should buy rfsc sugar cookie because its an amazing flavor.. Oh and use or don't use your preferred sweetener of choice I use flavorah sweetness its just right for me.  Coffee milk froth by vape train was actually the reason behind making this recipe the second i tasted it i got a corn type creamyness. I couldnt think of what to use it in when then it came to me a corn bread custard its perfect for the corny creamyness from coffee milk froth. Well thats all the notes i can stand to type considering this is the fifth time i have wrote them. Just mix it and mix a lot of it because your gonna like it!! That is if you like custards of coarse lol. Enjoy!!!

Mixed May 14th, and pulled it out yesterday. I made a 60ml. Wish I had made more, that is my only complaint. well done!!"},{"user":"Billywilly","text":"I mixed it as written, steeped/aged for approximately 14 minutes, been vaping it since last night. This is probably gonna be a popular recipe on here. Its pretty good and i have mixed thousands of my own recipes and hundreds of others.. and pretty much like none of them. I give away hundreds of bottles of 30ml juice i dont like every couple months. This is good though."}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"100568","name":"Corn On The Custard"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
