This is one of those ... was nice at the 14 day steep, but it is even better at the 30 day mark - just gets deeper and richer and thicker. This is a great vanilla / cake / mild ADV flavor you can rock all the time. The yellow cake and sugar cookie do the heavy lifting here and provide a soft cake layer backed by that vanilla cream pudding coming from a great layer of FA CP and FLV pudding. Easily one of the best pudding vapes I have mixed. Will be making this on the regular.","score":5},{"user":"BadaG","text":"I’m loving this one, it’s really nice to have a cake profile that emphasises the actual cake flavour without it hiding behind a strong top note. Really nice mouthfeel and well balanced Vanilla after a three day steep. Can’t wait to taste it after the full two weeks. Delicious ","score":5}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"195493","name":"PUDDIN"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
