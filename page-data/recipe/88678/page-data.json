Who knows, maybe this would be the recipe that would change my mind about menthol? It didn’t, but I can’t hold that against it. It’s sweet, juicy, delicious (aside from the menthol, lol). Candied and artificial more than natural honeydew vape, but that's ok, not everything has to be authentic. Should be a great, refreshing summer vape for menthol lovers, might work just as well without it for people like me, and really makes the case for TFA Honeydew II as a solid ingredient.
