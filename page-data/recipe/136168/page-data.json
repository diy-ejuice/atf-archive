But it is a very smooth creamy lemon vape with a coconut exhale. Well worth the mix. I love the Lemon tartness in this, with the coconut exhale. Just a very delightful vape.","steep_days":"7","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-04T21:25:18.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"1386","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Coconut Custard SC","vendor":"WF","millipercent":750},{"name":"Cream","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":300},{"name":"Cream Cheese Icing","vendor":"LA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Dessicated Coconut","vendor":"VT","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Lemon Meringue Tart","vendor":"VT","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Sour Lemon","vendor":"VT","millipercent":2250}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"136168","name":"Creamy Lemon Coconut Tart"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
