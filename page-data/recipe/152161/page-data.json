Its seductively Dark and boozy while still being sweet enough to enjoy all day long!\r\n\r\nSweetner:\r\nAs Always I'd say yes, But here I would say Hell Yass! It makes for a delicious Vape!\r\n\r\nI feel this needs the few days steep for the Stronger Herbal notes of the Juniper to settle and mellow down to where I like it, But if you like a full on Gin, smash this as a SnV.\r\n\r\nEnjoy!\r\n\r\n","steep_days":"3 (SNV)","temperature":"70","recipe_score":0,"total_reviews":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:50:57.000-05:00","best_vg":"1111%","views":"1038","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Juniper Gin","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1750},{"name":"Cucumber","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1750},{"name":"Elderflower","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":250},{"name":"Blackcurrant","vendor":"FA","millipercent":3500},{"name":"Super Sweet","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":400},{"name":"WS-23","vendor":"OTHR","millipercent":500},{"name":"Citrus Soda","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1000}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"152161","name":"Black Juniper"}}}
