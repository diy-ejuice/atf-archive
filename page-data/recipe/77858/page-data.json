Personally, I would probably drop the HS VIC a bit as it can get a bit funky for me at higher percentages but overall still pretty damn good. WF Chocolate Chunks is a totally underrated/underused concentrate for some reason, it is seriously one of the best chocolates out there and I think everyone who wants a good chocolate vape should pick it up. Good job on this recipe.","score":5},{"user":"KRUCIAL","text":"This smells amazing I will complete a review once it steeps and I vape it","score":0}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"77858","name":"Triumvirate: a Threesome remix #RemixMonth"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
