This is a very important flavor, I mean it's the main note in the real green tea kit kat. This is the base of the mix. It helps tie everything together in all of its white chocolate deliciousness. Yeah it’s not as creamy as I would like it to be, but it's a pretty damn accurate white chocolate. There is just the slightest hint of caramel when mixed for standalone or mixed with other creams that bring it out, but in this mix, you don't detect any caramel which is great. It has excellent mouth feel and really helps bring this mix into an ADV.\r\n \r\n**Vanilla Whipped Cream (CAP) 3%:**\r\nThis flavor pulls double duty. Not only does it bring out the creaminess of the white chocolate, but it acts as the frosting between the wafers. It’s light and sweet and creamy.\r\n \r\n**Sugar Cookie (CAP) 1.5%:**\r\nThis one actually does a bit of double duty too. Not only is it the wafer, but it also adds the extra sweetness needed for the frosting between the wafers. At a low %, it’s subtle, just like the actual wafer in the kit kat.","steep_days":"3","temperature":"230","recipe_score":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-12T09:12:23.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"2565","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Pistachio","flavor_id":"293","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Sugar Cookie","flavor_id":"115","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Vanilla Whipped Cream","flavor_id":"1","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":3000},{"name":"White Chocolate","flavor_id":"194","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":4500}],"reviews":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"23291","name":"Pistachio Kit Kat"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
