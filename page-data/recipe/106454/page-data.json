The OOO Creme Brulee is there to add the torched sugar top to the custard.  The creme brulee part of the recipe, with the Vanilla Ruyan and burnt sugar of the OOO Creme Brulee really plays well with the FLV tobaccos.  It bridges the gap between the bright, sweet fruit notes and the darker, earthy tobaccos.\r\n\r\n[Long Gone Lonesome Blues by Hank Williams](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-qcSj97CQU)\r\n\r\nWhere the name Lonesome Rhodes comes from . . .

The little bit of lemon did excellent in pushing the blueberry through the cream and tobacco. The tobacco and cream base are excellent. I feel the WF ruyan was the perfect ingredient to bridge the 2 together. "},{"user":"adio","text":"This is great right off of the shake, but gets better each day. It reminds me a bit of a backwoods cigar.  Both my husband and I are enjoying this one a lot. "},{"user":"ID10-T","text":"It sounds like it would be a hot muddled mess, Blueberry Tobacco Creme Brulee - are you kidding me? But holy crap this really is everything it's creator says it is and it is so good. It's the layers. The bright blueberry just bursts out and then there’s this torched sugar and caramel mingled with tobacco that’s reminiscent of RY4s, only better,  with a measure of smooth vanilla custard underneath. I am in fucking love with this recipe! It is now enshrined alongside Cardinal and Abuela as the best tobacco recipes I have ever tried.
