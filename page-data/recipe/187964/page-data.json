I wasn't so happy how the previous version of \"Drunkin' Freedom\" steeped. Here is the new recipe.\r\n\r\n**Spiced apples, buttery ice cream, with a still boozy bourbon sauce.**\r\n\r\nThis is some melty good shit. I love using FLV Apple Filling and FLV Caramel together with bourbons. This time I gave Milk & Honey a go, and I love the way it works into the ice cream without being to busy. PUR Country Apple is the perfect apple for this recipe, especially with some Apple Filling. This bourbon is definitely still boozy, and I am much more happy with it now.\r\n\r\nSweeten to taste. I like a drop CAP SS per 10ml","steep_days":"5 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-12T02:46:07.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"842","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Kentucky Bourbon","flavor_id":"361","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Bourbon","flavor_id":"4411","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":250},{"name":"Apple Filling","flavor_id":"4376","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":250},{"name":"Milk & Honey","flavor_id":"609","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":750},{"name":"Vanilla Ice Cream","flavor_id":"1511","vendor":"LB","millipercent":5000},{"name":"Country Apple","flavor_id":"7754","vendor":"PUR","millipercent":2000}],"reviews":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"187964","name":"Milk, Cream, & Alcohol"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
