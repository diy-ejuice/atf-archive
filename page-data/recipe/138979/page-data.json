It's my favorite kind and is perfect for fruits.\r\n\r\nFA Cookie/CAP Sugar Cookie/CAP Golden Butter form the cookie buttery crust. In France we don't use graham crackers at all, so we don't have graham cracker crusts. This crust is a little less defined but you will definitely taste a smooth buttery cookie.\r\n\r\nFLV Sweet Dough/TPA Brown Sugar is here to add a little gooey at the bottom of the pie where you add a little semolina and brown sugar to absorb the cooking juices of the baking fruits.\r\n\r\nWF Sweet and Sour Rhubarb/WF Bumbleberry/FLV Cream are the fruit mix of this pie. The rhubarb is actually a little sour and bumbleberry does taste like a very dark but vibrant mix of berries. The cream is here to round it all up and add some body and sweetness.\r\n\r\nEnjoy, be queer and vape on !\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Photo: Becky Luigart-Stayner; Styling: Lydia DeGaris-Pursell]","steep_days":"7 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"total_reviews":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-05T09:53:12.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"1067","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Cookie","vendor":"FA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Sweet Dough","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Golden Butter","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Brown Sugar","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":750},{"name":"Sweet and Sour Rhubarb SC","vendor":"WF","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Bumbleberry SC","vendor":"WF","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Sugar Cookie","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Cream","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":750}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"138979","name":"Rhubarb Berry Butter Crust Pie"}}}
