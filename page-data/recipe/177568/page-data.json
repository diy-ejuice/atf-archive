The dark berry flavour of FLV Boysenberry goes soo well with the creamy nature of TPA Coconut Candy. Chuck a touch of Pink Guava in there for some brightness and citrus to balance it all out and some WS-23 to keep it cool for summer in Australia at the mo. \r\n\r\nThis is a simple 3 flavour banger that absolutely rips. Stoked on this one to be honest.

Its really good. I love the tartness from the Pink Guava and the creaminess from the Coconut Candy. Really well done."},{"user":"YippYo","text":"Wow now that is a very tasty combo! The boysenberry &amp; coconut play off each other very well and kind of meld into a creamy sorbet like flavor. The Pink Guava is a great accent note to it all. Only issue is that the cooling agent is a bit too strong for my taste. Kind of distracts from the profile a bit. So I'll lower it for future batches. Well done mate!"}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"177568","name":"Black Lotus"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
