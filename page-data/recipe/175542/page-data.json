This is nice! I get a nice almond frosting cake with hints of chocolate sprinkled with pistachios. WOW, just WOW! The almond frosting is on the top, with the cake underneath and with the exhale I get the hints of chocolate and pistachio.  Very well layered and super accurate to the profile. Great job. I'm guessing that the chocolate is coming from the MB Bounty combined with the Bavarian cream. I'm really surprised that I'm getting so much cake and chocolate being that the only \"cake\" that's in there is cap vanilla cupcake and no chocolate flavoring at all. Flavor bending at it's best!"}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"175542","name":"Pistachio Layer Cake - JW"}}}
