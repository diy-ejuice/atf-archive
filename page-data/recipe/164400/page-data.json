I wanted something woody and smoky with a heavy-handed pour of vanilla.  The Ylang Ylang edges the vanillas in a spicy, floral direction, which meshes well with the Red Oak and sandalwood of Wood Spice.  Black Fire adds the char.  Vanilla Ruyan, also, helps bring this into the realm of a smoked vanilla essence.  Butterscotch is there as deeper note underneath and to bring a level of richness to the table.  Even with other devices charged and filled, I keep reaching back for this.  It's a welcome change of pace.  It's not really like anything else, it just is what it is . . . smoky, woody vanilla","steep_days":"1 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-06T12:56:24.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"1029","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Holy Vanilla","flavor_id":"2385","vendor":"DFS","millipercent":5000},{"name":"Black Fire","flavor_id":"458","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Butterscotch","flavor_id":"1216","vendor":"FW","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Wood Spice","flavor_id":"4447","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":500},{"name":"Red Oak","flavor_id":"375","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Ylang Ylang","flavor_id":"513","vendor":"FA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Vanilla Ruyan Custard","flavor_id":"6066","vendor":"WF","millipercent":3000}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"164400","name":"Smoked Vanilla"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
