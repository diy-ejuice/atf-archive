My original version of this recipe used the Holy Trinity for blueberries, but I found that it was being heavily overpowered by the rest of the recipe. After sending a sample of to Foment_Life he recommended subbing out the Blueberry Extra for the Blueberry Jam and halving the VBIC and putting Vanilla Swirl into the mix.    \r\n\r\nSpot on recommendation that really made this recipe come alive. The Blueberry Jam really helps boost the blueberry flavor over the Vanilla and Ice Cream without overpowering them for a great sweet but not overly sweet vape.\r\n","steep_days":"5","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:50:28.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"4416","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Bilberry","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Blueberry","vendor":"FW","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Blueberry Jam","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Marshmallow","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":750},{"name":"Vanilla Bean Ice Cream","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Vanilla Swirl","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2500},{"name":"WS-23","vendor":"OTHR","millipercent":500}],"reviews":[{"user":"Ebc88","text":"Excellent blueberry combo, cream combo is nice as well, and the ws-23 keeps it cool &amp; refreshing "}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"121647","name":"Blueberry Ice Cream"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
