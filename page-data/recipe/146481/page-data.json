Love the fact that you called it eggos as that's exactly what you get. Right out of the frozen section. Thanks for sharing!

You can really taste the waffle, butter, syrup, and blueberry."},{"user":"eyemakepizza","score":"5","text":"The picture for this recipe sums it up perfectly. The waffle, the butter, the syrup, the blueberries, they're all there. The only thing the juice doesn't have that the picture does is the cardboard box and well....that's a good thing!"}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"146481","name":"Blueberry Eggos"}}}
