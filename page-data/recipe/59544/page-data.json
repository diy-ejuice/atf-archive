This one is great. Wasn't sure it would work but it turned out fantastic. Its like a French vanilla ice cream with just a hint of the honeysuckle. The HS didnt really stand out like I thought it would even at 5% but it does add a nice honey like sweetness to the vape. And it even has that \"green\" taste to it although its very faint. Goes great with the French vanilla and vanilla bean. I've been vaping this one all day for a few days now. I hope you enjoy it too! Would love some feedback on this one along with any advice on what else I can use this honey suckle for. Thanks peeps!
