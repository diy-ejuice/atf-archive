It's sweet and apricot-forward. The combination of juicy peach and sweet tangerine tastes as  much like nectarine as anything else. \"Torte\" can be used to describe a wide variety of baked desserts, from a huge fluffy cake to a crunchy little tart. And there is just a touch of ginger that indeed tastes candied in combination with the sweet stone fruits and citrus. \r\n\r\n*Mind the Steep. This is not a recipe for impatient mixers.* There's a reason Blue Dot advises you to steep their juice and gives you the option of paying a little extra for a pre-steeped bottle. This stuff needs it. The ginger comes on too strong and there are bitterness and astringency issues that steep out completely, just give it time. \r\n\r\nThis juice was a joy to recreate because the source material and, after a healthy steep, every version I mixed while trying to copy it, was delicious. If the profile interests you but clone accuracy doesn't really matter, I actually preferred an earlier version that had 3% Apricot, 1.5% Juicy Peach, and 0.75% Sweet Tangerine with the 4% Graham Cracker and 2% Gingerbread. Although the percentages can easily be played around with and make great vapes, I don't think any of the ingredients can be substituted. TFA Graham Cracker Clear might be a better graham cracker for most applications, but it's just too crunchy, not sweet enough, and missing the tiny hint of cinnamon that this needs. \r\n\r\nHappy Mixing and Remixing!

My rating had nothing to do with the original. Thus tastes great, but I think the juicy peach is slightly over powering in the mix, even after a steep. I'll be making this again and just lowering the peach, this has made it into my small rotation! &#xD;\n&#xD;\nUpdate on this, I left half of my 30mL for a few months and came back to it. The peach finally settled down enough for me to not dominate the rest of the mix. The ginger came out much more and this is an amazing me now. For me, the steep was too short and it caused the peach to be VERY dominate and overpower the others. My assumption is after a month steep it hit where I wanted it to for personal tastes. This was amazing after a longer steep to my taste.","score":5},{"user":"Chewymidget","text":"Peach forward with tangerine and apricot mixed together great. Not one fruit is trying to compete to be at the front. The graham cracker and gingerbread are on the back end finishing the well balanced mix. Just ever so subtle note of cinnamon. I like this more than the original as I couldn't taste any fruit in it. Tasted mostly of graham cracker and ginger. This is well done and definitely going into my rotation. Highly recommend to anyone looking for something a little different. The steep time is torturous to but well worth the wait!","score":5}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"48608","name":"Titanic"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
