Still the same concept but is so far a big improvement while staying true to the profile. \r\n\r\nAdd Super Sweet 0.5-1% to your liking, adjust the -23 and drop the sour lemon slightly if you prefer. I like it like this, lemon forward, bit of a fizz, a more complete raspberry, more saturation with less total flavour percentage. Let me know what you think, especially if you mixed the first one up. Side by side, I like this one at least 5x better! Enjoy :) \r\n\r\nP.S. SA Framboise = Raspberry  \r\nThese are two of my new favourite raspberry flavours, the WF shines through on a pod system as well\r\n\r\nOriginally mixed at a ratio of 20:80/PG:VG\r\nTested on a dotRDA, Quad 28g twisted, flattened wire by Badazd, ~0.2Î©, 21700 mech mod","steep_days":"2 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"total_reviews":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T04:41:50.000-05:00","best_vg":"80%","views":"708","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"framboise","vendor":"SA","millipercent":3500},{"name":"Lemons Kick","vendor":"INW","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Pink Lemonade","vendor":"LB","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Raspberry Jelly Bean SC","vendor":"WF","millipercent":1250},{"name":"Red Raspberry","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":750},{"name":"Sour Apple","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":500},{"name":"Sour Lemon","vendor":"VT","millipercent":2750},{"name":"WS-23","vendor":"OTHR","millipercent":1000}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"205228","name":" Sour Lemon & Raspberry Lemonade inspired by V Energy (New & Improved)"}}}
