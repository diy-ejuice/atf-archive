It might look \"simple\" on paper considering how few flavors it is, but the taste I get from this is very complex. The vanilla ice cream part is perfect, not too light and not too eggy. The lemon is relatively sweet and blends in perfectly with the ice cream after just 1-2 days. Basil might seem wierd to some people, and indeed it is wierd, but good wierd. Amazing wierd even. The basil is a bit sweet and gives a very pleasant savory note, I also get a very very slight touch of anise from it, which is fantastic. Don't get me wrong though, it doesn't taste like anything like licorice which some people might think when they hear that, but it has a very slight anise like touch. I can't believe this recipe doesn't have any more reviews, it's just fantastic. It's everything you want from a recipe, it's simple to make but yet extremely complex in taste. Not that I would expect anything less from \"the ice cream man\" himself, but this deserves more than 5 stars."}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"141467","name":"Long Beach Island (LBI) (Lemon Basil Ice Cream)"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
