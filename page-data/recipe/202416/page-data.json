Off the shake its killer IMO, super wet and flavorful but after a quick steep it comes together.\r\n\r\nCAP Sweet Currant was used as a main note here as I had gotten the flavor awhile ago but never made good use of it. It is a really nice flavor, juicy and well rounded and can be used as a stand alone if desired.\r\n\r\nFLV Jammy Berry and TFA Blackberry is a blatant rip from Foment_Lifes use of the combo in DAAPLBerry Cream. The 2 concentrates just meld real nice together and worked wonderfully with the sweet currant as a dark berry mix for my fruit notes.\r\n\r\n(Original mix was 1% FLV Sweet Coconut) this stuff is just killer and works well with berries. Its not real pronounced in this mix at 1% but I was using it as a note to lighten up the berries as well as a bridge to the cream. \r\n\r\nAfter revisiting this mix I switched to an equal percent FA Coco as I enjoy the flavor a bit more and it melds with the creams better. Either coconut is fine though.\r\n\r\nINW Custard and INW Yes, We Cheesecake the idea of the juice was to have a quick steeping mix so this just seemed to fit. I was originally going to just use the custard and a vanilla but wanted a thicker body so the cheesecake came into play. There is room for a crust or bakery note as well but I was just going for a cream/fruit aspect here.","steep_days":"3 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T04:41:45.000-05:00","best_vg":"80%","views":"520","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Blackberry","flavor_id":"214","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Jammy Berry","flavor_id":"10150","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":750},{"name":"Coco' (coconut)","flavor_id":"416","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Custard","flavor_id":"4210","vendor":"INW","millipercent":1750},{"name":"Sweet Currant","flavor_id":"10171","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Yes, We Cheesecake","flavor_id":"9272","vendor":"INW","millipercent":2250},{"name":"Super Sweet","flavor_id":"2384","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":350}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"202416","name":"Berried Treasure "}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
