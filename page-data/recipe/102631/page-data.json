I had assumed it was a new recipe.  Now I have no idea how I found it.  But I realize I did leave my flavors out where I left them it's obvious what goes in here and I kinda remember the numbers.  I know the 4% strawberry ripe for sure but the others while I know are less I am less confident in how close I am.  In any case it was great!!  So trying to recreate it here.  If you created this or almost this please claim your recipe and give me the name so I can look it up and leave a review. :)","steep_days":"5","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-04T22:28:06.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"1046","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Strawberry (ripe)","flavor_id":"271","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Cookie Butter","flavor_id":"1257","vendor":"FW","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Vanilla Custard","flavor_id":"188","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1500}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"102631","name":"Take off from someone I lost the recipe darnit - I was gonna leave a review - shoot LOL"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
