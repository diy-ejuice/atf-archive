Using TFA Blueberry Extra in place of Strawberry Ripe and TFA Blueberry Candy in place of CAP Sweet Strawberry creates a flavor that tastes like a Blueberry Syrup. I kept them both at the same percentages. The only other substitution is TFA Sweet Cream in place of CAP Sweet Cream. This choice was purely out of convenience as I didnt have the CAP version.\r\n\r\nI tested the first batch that I made at the following intervals.\r\n\r\nS&V - Tastes good. Nice and sweet but lacks any real depth. A bit too strong on the Blueberry.\r\n2 Days - About the same but a bit more body from the Cheesecake and the Blueberry is a little better.\r\n7 Days - Starting to get that baked flavor. The Blueberry has calmed down a bit but is still sweet and flavorful.\r\n14 Days - About the same as 7 but a little smoother.\r\n30 Days - OK, I am in love! The flavors have all come together as a real Cheesecake. Amazing! The Blueberry is perfectly sweet but not overpowering. I am very happy with the results.\r\n\r\nI just opened a bottle that has been steepeng for 8 weeks. I also made a fresh batch 4 weeks ago so that I could compare the two. The difference between them is very subtle. The cheesecake is a tiny bit more pronounced but still not overly cheesy.","steep_days":"30","temperature":"0","recipe_score":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-12T06:57:43.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"2700","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Blueberry Candy (pg)","flavor_id":"216","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Blueberry (extra)","flavor_id":"218","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Graham Cracker Clear","flavor_id":"325","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1500},{"name":"New York Cheesecake V2","flavor_id":"3525","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":6000},{"name":"Sweet Cream","flavor_id":"183","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"sweetener (sucralose)","flavor_id":"2313","vendor":"OTHR","millipercent":1500}],"reviews":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"27434","name":"Blueberry Cheesecake (The Real: Remix, Remixed)"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
