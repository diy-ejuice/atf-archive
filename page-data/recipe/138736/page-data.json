But was missing some of the apple flavor i desired, so i boosted it with some Fuji. \r\n\r\nRY4 base - RY4 Double, Caramel candy, vanillin, salted caramel. Learned this combo off a Facebook group in substitute for Holy Holy Grail RY4 (dyfs). Super creamy caramel, super desserty with that earthy ry4 vibe.\r\n\r\nTobacco base- Cured Tobacco, Red Burley, Tatanka Tobacco. These three bring in a nice dark tobacco with some spice. Red burley brings the leathery fresh tobacco, tatanka brings some spice that helps the Apple Filling, and Cured Tobacco is just damn tasty. \r\n\r\nBeen vaping this out of the kayfun 5 in temp controll. Loving it every time i fill my tank.
