So I am making the custards (cap v1) and the white chocolate the larger numbers to hold all this.  Well and of course the tobacco which if it's going to stand up to all this needs to be a pretty high number.  Then adding amounts coffee, chocolate, cocoa, caramel, nuts, vanilla, cardamom....  also putting in creme brulee and bavarian cream.  Maybe a ridiculous thing to do or maybe it will work like cooking would idk we'll see.
