The LB peach is not my favorite, but it sits nice with the whiskey flavorings in this recipe and it adds a depth to the TFA juicy peach that gave me the idea for this recipe. Several drops of TFA Kentucky Bourbon and a couple of drops of FA Whisky later I had a smile on my face. Kick up the LB Peach to 4% and you get a very pronounced \"baked in whiskey\" peach flavor. I've been vaping this in my Mjolnir with a .25 ohm N80 fused clapton and in my Apocalypse  25 with a .15 ohm N80 fused clapton setup. Enjoy.","steep_days":"0 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T02:17:33.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"596","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Peach","vendor":"LB","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Peach (juicy)","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":3500},{"name":"Whisky","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Kentucky Bourbon","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2000}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"182430","name":"Peach Lightning"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
