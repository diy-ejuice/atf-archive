Strain out the flowers, add real vanilla bean, and run the mix through an ice cream machine.\r\n\r\nTFA Honeysuckle infuses the cream flavors with a delicate floral perfume. It’s carefully balanced at 3% to work as a shake-and-vape recipe here. Any higher would be overdoing it – we want the just the sillage of this summery fragrance, nature’s magnet for birds and bees, left behind after steeping in the ice cream base. Failing to strain out the flowers themselves would spoil this elegant dessert.   \r\n\r\nINW Shisha Vanilla brings a sweet, creamy vanilla, very reminiscent of a homemade, non-custard vanilla ice cream. This could almost be a two-ingredient recipe with just these two flavors, but some additional creams pick up where Shisha Vanilla leaves off.  \r\n\r\nTFA Vanilla Bean Ice Cream is a tricky but essential addition. It’s tricky because it has something we don’t want, those custard notes, as this is an egg-free, AKA Philadelphia-style or American-style ice cream. Used low enough with these other ingredients, eggs can be avoided while still providing what we do want – that dense body and luxurious mouthfeel of churned heavy cream. that Shisha Vanilla doesn’t have enough of, and a more robust, truly vanilla bean flavor as opposed to Shisha Vanilla’s flavor that sits somewhere between extract and bean.     \r\n\r\nFLV Cream adds more neutral creamy body to the mix and binds and blends the honeysuckle, vanilla, and creams together. It enhances the heavy milk taste of Cream Fresh as well, but alone, it lacks enough dairy flavor to complete the milk and cream mix used to make this ice cream.   \r\n\r\nFA Cream Fresh brings the milk, but too much of it seems to react poorly to Honeysuckle in souring way, as if the ice cream had been made with milk that was a day or two past its sell-by date. To complete this ode to longing, Cream Fresh and FLV Cream need each other. \r\n\r\nAnd why \"Longing?\" Because I miss someone who isn't mine to miss, dream about someone who isn't mine to dream about, and love someone who is no longer mine to love. Moving on with anyone else is hard when they kiss me and I'm afraid all they taste is her name on my lips. Of all the sensual pleasures we once shared, it is her unique flavor I still thirst for most of all. The closest thing I've found to the taste of her body at the height of her bliss, her *amrita*, is Honeysuckle Ice Cream. \r\n","steep_days":"1 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":4,"updated_at":"2020-12-12T20:28:53.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"43211","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Honeysuckle (pg)","flavor_id":"306","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Vanilla Bean Ice Cream","flavor_id":"186","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Cream","flavor_id":"604","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Shisha Vanilla","flavor_id":"841","vendor":"INW","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Cream Fresh","flavor_id":"540","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000}],"reviews":[{"user":"Acc1079","text":"After mixing over 100 recipes on ATF, I can honestly say this is my favorite.

Very well done @ID10-T!","score":5},{"user":"NikosD","text":"Delicate and well balanced creamy flavour with a floral note. The only negative aspect (totally subjective) is that it is slightly under-flavoured at least for my setup (Guardian Vaporesso 0.5Ω at 230-250 C), thus the 4 stars and not 5. Amazing balance and roundness to the flavour though!","score":4},{"user":"Seef","text":"I don't know why this is special, but it is.

","score":5},{"user":"AlfredPudding","text":"This recipe is really something special. Every percentage has been balanced perfectly to bring great qualities to the profile, without adding anything unpleasant or unnecessary. There are no noticeable notes of egg, or bakery elements of a crust or cone. It is a simple and elegant mixture of three things: freshly churned cream, deep, rich vanilla bean, and the floral delicacy of honeysuckle. I could never create a better description than the recipe's creator so please make sure to read the notes.

Those particular creams and the extra vanilla really helps stand up to the Honeysuckle. This is definitely one of my top 5 favorite recipes.

It reminded me of summers when I was a kid, grabbing an ice cream from the ice cream van with my mum and walking back with it in hand past our neighbour's garden and inhaling the strong scent of honeysuckle from the vines creeping up their house. &#xD;\nThe Vanilla is a background companion to the star of the show, the honeysuckle. I can see this being overpowering for people that don't usually like florals, but this was exactly what I hoped it would be. &#xD;\n&#xD;\nBeautiful.&#xD;\n","score":5},{"user":"QueerYourVape","text":"The vanilla is soft and sweet, not too overpowering which is nice. The vanilla bean ice cream is a background note that makes this more elaborate but it doesn't take over. The honeysuckle is the star of the show here, and although I can tell the balance of the recipe is great and the vape is smooth, I just don't like the flavor in this one. The honeysuckle taste very green and perfume like to me which reminds me of why I can't vape strawberry vapes. It's my own fault but I can't bring myself to like this one.

Yes, this seems to be true to the profile and that is cool on its own, but there are some other things I would like to note. The ice cream is great. I may have fallen in love with INW Shisha Vanilla as well. I enjoy this recipe with coffee and heavier, darker, and sweeter beers. After a couple of weeks, the overall vape gets softer on the palate and the Honeysuckle blends through a bit more as if the ice cream has melted. The honeysuckle doesn't fade though...no, sir. The vanilla holds its own as well. Beautiful work.","score":5},{"user":"Deweysuds","text":"Nice creamy ice cream.  Honey suckle makes it very wet and gives a nice floral note.  Very unique flavor.

I was disappointed is the overall taste of this recipe. &#xD;\nThat being said, tastes are subjective. ","score":3},{"user":"juiceIQ","text":"This is an amazing recipe.  The imagery, story, and profile work together flawlessly to create a mix that stimulates my palate and mind with its sweet, creamy, floral, ethereal, and elusive qualities.  ID1O-T has created a work of art by using all mediums at his disposal (i.e. words, images, flavor) to create a cathartic experience rather than just another faceless recipe.  &#xD;\n&#xD;\nThe only reason I am giving four stars instead of five is because of the \"elusive\" part.  If I remove the back story and imagery (which I suspect most mixers will), and just focus on the mix itself, I am left with something that starts out incredible, but quickly looses flavor until you put it down for awhile and come back to it.  Maybe a longer steep will help with this (I waited 24 hours per the recipe's instructions).  Maybe ID10-T is well aware of this, and feels that this is essential to the whole \"love lost\" experience.  Who knows?

It has some heavy butter/dairy notes from VBIC and Cream Fresh especially after a bit of steeping, but always just enough to make the flavor feel dense.
