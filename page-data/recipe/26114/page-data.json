CokeCan here with another fuckin bamboozler of a recipe, a little Apricot Tobacco mix. Pull up a chair and get ready to fuck around with another bangin tobacco vape. But you know me, I like to keep them tobacco recipes friendly to people that may not actually dig tobaccos.\r\n\r\nSo first off, we got FA Apricot. If you don't have this concentrate in your possession yet, stop being a boo boo baby asshole and throw it into your cart right now or I'm going to find you and I'll pummel you into submission. Then use your unconscious body like a puppet and make you order it anyway. You can thank me later. This shit is one of the best flavours I've come across in my year plus of mixing. It is my replacement for that razor blade bullshit that is TPA Juicy Peach and basically any other peach concentrate on the market. This shit is potent. It's like pulling a ripe as fuck apricot off whatever plant those shits grow on and biting right into that juicy orb of sexual prowess. There is some slight tartness to it, like most other stone fruits, but it's so goddamn heavenly. No harshness to be found, just a perfectly accurate apricot. I guess you're fucked if you don't know what that tastes like. Welcome to Flavour Town, you fucking maniac.\r\n\r\nSo I'm backtracking but whatever, I said all peach flavours suck, and while I stand by that, JF Honey Peach is tasty. It is more mellow and works better as an accent note to something like FA Apricot. But this concentrate has some smooth creaminess to it with subtle notes of peach and citrus, almost like those peach ring candies. It adds just a touch of extra sweetness to FA Apricot that just works here. You don't necessarily need it here, but it is a nice addition.\r\n\r\nTobacco. JF RY4 Double. It's great. I know I love FA Soho, but this shit is just as good. Soho is mild and light, while RY4 Double has a deeper and darker note to it with hints of caramel and wood. Those notes play beautifully with the apricot to create something of a bakery profile. And if you know anything about me, you know I'm an impatient piece of shit, and JF RY4 Double doesn't need much steeping to be good. There's no weirdness to it straight away, and it just improves and pushes itself to the front of recipes after steeping. This concentrate is also great for both sides of the tobacco spectrum. If you like that flavour in your recipes, you'll notice it's tobacco body and be satisfied. If you aren't trying to fuck with tobacco flavours, this one will fuck your mouth with bakery notes of brown sugar and caramel.\r\n\r\nThe other flavours here, TPA Toasted Marshmallow, TPA Brown Sugar, CAP Vanilla Whipped Cream, and FW Butterscotch Ripple are all here to accent the beauty that is FA Apricot. The toasted marshmallow and vanilla whipped cream add some more mouthfeel and body to the mix, while bridging the gap between the extremes of fruit notes and tobaccos. The brown sugar and butterscotch ripple accentuate the cream notes and play off the fruit to create something similar to a poached apricot. Honestly, this whole recipe is just to showcase how fucking versatile this apricot concentrate truly is. It's like a computer program was invented that is your perfect sexual partner. A digitized creature that will fulfill every depraved fantasy at once and still tell you it loves you after you melt into a puddle of self doubt and infatuation due to how quickly you finished.\r\n\r\nFuck it, I don't want to talk anymore. Just mix this up and vape it.","steep_days":"2 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"updated_at":"2020-12-12T18:29:01.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"3100","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Armenia (apricot)","flavor_id":"507","vendor":"FA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Honey Peach","flavor_id":"4561","vendor":"JF","millipercent":1000},{"name":"RY4 Double","flavor_id":"4490","vendor":"JF","millipercent":2250},{"name":"Toasted Marshmallow","flavor_id":"340","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Brown Sugar","flavor_id":"313","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1750},{"name":"Vanilla Whipped Cream","flavor_id":"1","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1250},{"name":"Butterscotch Ripple","flavor_id":"1217","vendor":"FW","millipercent":750}],"reviews":[{"user":"Deftohms","text":"This needs to be a one shot.
