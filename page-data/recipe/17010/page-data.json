Cranberries are one of Thanksgiving's favorite fruits.  A creamy, sweet and tangy treat. \r\nBasically, it's a cranberry apple compote sitting in a bowl of vanilla ice cream swirled with white chocolate sprinkled with a bit of orange zest.\r\nMan, I hate cranberries but I love this vape!! \r\nLet this thing sit for a week, and it'll be heavenly.. It's good right after mixing though, but the apple isn't as present and of course the creams aren't nearly as delicious.\r\n\r\nNotes @ https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/5fd4w0/cranapplecreamy_a_creamy_sweet_and_tangy_treat/","steep_days":"7 (SNV)","temperature":"450","recipe_score":5,"updated_at":"2020-12-12T14:04:52.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"1563","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Cranberry","flavor_id":"224","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Cranberry","flavor_id":"2493","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":500},{"name":"Fuji","flavor_id":"4488","vendor":"JF","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Liquid Amber","flavor_id":"476","vendor":"FA","millipercent":250},{"name":"Orange","flavor_id":"500","vendor":"FA","millipercent":250},{"name":"Vanilla Bean Ice Cream","flavor_id":"186","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Madagascar (Vanilla Classic)","flavor_id":"526","vendor":"FA","millipercent":750},{"name":"White Chocolate","flavor_id":"1462","vendor":"FW","millipercent":2500}],"reviews":[{"user":"Bogey_Again","text":"","score":5}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"17010","name":"Cranapplecreamy"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
