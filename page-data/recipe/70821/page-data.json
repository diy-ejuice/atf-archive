Originally it was good but I wanted to cream it up.  So they were kind of milky like cereal would be.  Guys and Gals this is seriously amazing.  I really think I've got ahold of a winner here.  If you like cereals than this is your vape.  Good luck and vape on.  P.S If you don't like sweetener leave it out but kapn krunch berries is very sweet.  So sweeten to taste.  Best after seven days but honestly good on the shake.","steep_days":"7","temperature":"0","recipe_score":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-11T04:37:42.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"2022","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Kapn Krunch","flavor_id":"7656","vendor":"TS","millipercent":250},{"name":"Cereal 27","flavor_id":"4163","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Lemon Meringue Pie","flavor_id":"1335","vendor":"FW","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Blueberry","flavor_id":"1201","vendor":"FW","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Shisha Strawberry","flavor_id":"1711","vendor":"INW","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Raspberry","flavor_id":"667","vendor":"INW","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Super Sweet","flavor_id":"2384","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":750},{"name":"Acetyl Pyrazine 5%","flavor_id":"1709","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Meringue","flavor_id":"530","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1250},{"name":"Vienna Cream","flavor_id":"516","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Vanilla Swirl","flavor_id":"189","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2000}],"reviews":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"70821","name":"Kapn krunch berries"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
