The new SilverLine fruit circles is amazing. No pledge or off notes like all the others. Thereâ€™s a very nice balance here with loops to cream. 3 days in is great but also off the shake. Great job my friend!"},{"user":"Ebc88","score":"5","text":"Mixed with no substitutions with 3 day steep. taste like fruit loops with sweet milk should get even better over time "}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"74886","name":"RYNGZ (Froot, Cereal, Milk)"}}}
