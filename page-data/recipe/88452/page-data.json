The Year of Mixing Challenge:\r\n\r\nAs we grew up, we grew to love to hate Snape. He always seemed to do everything he could to stifle Harry, get in his way, embarrass him, or humiliate hit. He seemed to be one of the coldest people in the Magical Universe. Later in the series our suspicions were correct!!!! Snape is now working with Voldemort again! He sat idly by as Charity was killed during the Meeting at Malfoy Manor. How is this man a hero?! Well, as we find out in the last moments of his life, his whole reason for being; to keep Harry alive until the end. He was asked to Protect Harry, guide him, help him along, all while acting as if he hated him. He was asked by Dumbledore to play 007 with the Dark Lord. He played his part until the end as one of the most critical pieces in the chess game. \r\n\r\nWhat did Snape love more than anything? Lily Potter. He fell in love with her as a child and that love only grew stronger with time. In his own way, he loved Harry, though he hated him at the same time. He loved him because he reminded him of Lily, and hated him for the same reason, as well as being reminded of James. So what does Snape eat when he breaks down and wants to remember Lily? He eats an Indian (Lily's favorite food) sweet yogurt dessert called Shrikhand. It is a thick, yet creamy yogurt dessert dressed with saffron, pistachio, and spiced with cardamom. \r\n\r\nDumbledore: \"After all this time?\"\r\nSnape: \"Always.\"","steep_days":"5","temperature":"400","recipe_score":0,"total_reviews":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-06T12:55:16.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"1775","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Creamy Yogurt","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Greek Yogurt","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Pistachio","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Pistachio","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":200},{"name":"Saffron","vendor":"FA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Cardamom","vendor":"FA","millipercent":150},{"name":"Super Sweet","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":150}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"88452","name":"Always #TheYearOfMixing"}}}
