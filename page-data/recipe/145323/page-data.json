I wanted something dark and deep.\r\nSo my obvious choice was blackberry, blackcurrant and boysenberry.\r\nFA blackcurrant as it is potent like hell, so I keep it low and let VT Boysenberry do a little legwork.\r\nIn an attempt to make the \"jam\" a little more... jammy? I have set my heart in FA Maple Syrup. I feel it adds a little texture.\r\n\r\nThe FA Apple Pie has only one job and that is to bring a little crust to the croissants butter goodness.\r\nCAP Graham Cracker is there for a little texture.","steep_days":"7","temperature":"0","recipe_score":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-10T16:04:36.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"1484","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Croissant","flavor_id":"8867","vendor":"VT","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Blackberry","flavor_id":"14","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Blackcurrant","flavor_id":"545","vendor":"FA","millipercent":750},{"name":"Apple Pie","flavor_id":"551","vendor":"FA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Super Sweet","flavor_id":"2384","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":250},{"name":"Graham Cracker","flavor_id":"62","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1750},{"name":"Boysenberry","flavor_id":"8840","vendor":"VT","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Maple Syrup","flavor_id":"509","vendor":"FA","millipercent":250}],"reviews":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"145323","name":"French Mornings"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
