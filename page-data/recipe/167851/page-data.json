The blend of tobacco is perfect and not too strong and it goes very well with the caramel and butterscotch cream pie, nice choice of graham cracker here! My 30 ml is almost gone....need to make a 60 quick!"},{"user":"justjasontm","text":"Finally got the Soho and graham cracker to mix this up. It's awesome! Granted I've only let it steep 5 days so far so I'm sure it will get richer but so far it's stellar. Even though I was there when you created it and I suggested the butterscotch cream pie so maybe I'm biased lol. Either way great mix fresh.
