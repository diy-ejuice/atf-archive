Thought I would use the Holy Grail RY4 for it's caramel . . . which led to, \"Why not throw a tobacco at this waffle and see if it sticks!\"  It stuck.  Tatanka (nutty, toffee-like tobacco notes) was my first thought, and it seems to settle in nice with all the other flavors.  I ran with it . . . a nutty, vanilla, caramel RY4 with a touch of some FLV tobacco and custard . . . all this on top of a pretty decent waffle base.  Added a little AP to up the nuttiness.  \r\n\r\nLoving it right off the shake . . . mixed 60vg/40pg.  Enjoy!","steep_days":"1 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-04T21:24:16.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"1675","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Belgian Waffle","flavor_id":"1478","vendor":"LB","millipercent":5000},{"name":"HOLY HOLY GRAIL RY4","flavor_id":"5037","vendor":"DFS","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Holy Vanilla","flavor_id":"2385","vendor":"DFS","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Butter Pecan","flavor_id":"1212","vendor":"FW","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Acetyl Pyrazine 5%","flavor_id":"1709","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Tatanka Tobacco","flavor_id":"4417","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Custard Premium","flavor_id":"9118","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1500}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"86564","name":"ButteRY4Waffle (Butter Pecan Waffle RY4)"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
