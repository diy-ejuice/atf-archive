This one is the current version and I'm pretty happy with it which is why I chose it as my first official upload on here. This flavor is good as a shake and vape but really seems to shine after 3 days. The Shisha Strawberry percentage may seem a tad high but it does good work in combination with all the other fruits in the mix. The TPA Graham Crust/Graham Cracker Clear and FA Almond are the closest I've been able to get to a granola so far. I truly hate TPA Oatmeal Cookie and Rice Crunchies so this is what I'm using until I find something that works better.","steep_days":"3 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"total_reviews":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-06T20:40:12.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"1854","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Sweet Strawberry","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Strawberry (ripe)","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Shisha Strawberry","vendor":"INW","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Blueberry","vendor":"FW","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Blueberry (wild)","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Dragonfruit","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Creamy Yogurt","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Greek Yogurt","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Cheesecake (graham Crust)","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Graham Cracker Clear","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Almond","vendor":"FA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Super Sweet","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":500},{"name":"Smooth","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":250}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"64629","name":"Yogurt Slinger"}}}
