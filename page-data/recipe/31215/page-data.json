Graham Cracker comes through on the backend lending the heaviness that contrasts on the airy light start. I really like how this vapes as it goes from light to heavy throughout the inhale and exhale going from the meringue to the lemon to the graham cracker, much like eating Lemon Meringue Pie.\r\n\r\n\r\nCAP Lemon Meringue Pie: Man I love this flavoring for that Lemon Meringue. While it's not enough on its own for me, it's a perfect base to start building.\r\n\r\n\r\nFA Meringue: I know it might be a reoccurring thing for FA Meringue to be such a staple in a lot of my recipes but this flavoring is just that good for what I want it to do. In this case it helps adds a bit sweetness and light airiness that I want from Meringue on the top of a Lemon Meringue Pie.\r\n\r\n\r\nCAP Vanilla Whipped Cream: This flavoring man! It is a great light cream that helps the Meringue shine. I've been enjoying this FA Meringue and CAP VWC combo a lot lately.\r\n\r\n\r\nTFA Blackberry: I wanted to distinguish this Lemon Meringue Pie from any other and I settled on Blackberry adding to the Lemon. TFA Blackberry is a bit sweet and tart but is very potent. No more than 1% or it really gets overbearing. But for me, it is the perfect flavoring when I want to add a Blackberry note to a recipe.\r\n\r\n\r\nTFA Pear: I originally wanted to do this with FA Pear but found out I actually don't have any but you can sub it in because its main job in the recipe is to help out the Blackberry just a bit more to mix it with the Lemon better. I found 1% too much for this as the Pear started to override but at half a percent it sits back far enough to lend its help with out stealing the spotlight.\r\n\r\n\r\nCAP Lemon Sicily: I use this at 0.5% just to help boost the lemon and the blackberry a bit more.\r\n\r\n\r\nTFA Graham Cracker Clear: What's a lemon meringue pie without a nice graham cracker crust? This flavoring speaks for itself but it also does help add a heaviness that is missing and finishes off the vape nicely. Without it this would be too airy and light and would miss that bottom note that TFA GCC adds in.\r\n\r\n\r\nI mix all my recipes at 80vg/20pg but feel free to do whatever ratio works for you and feel free to let me know how it works out. <3 <3 <3","steep_days":"2","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-01T11:48:11.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"1564","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Lemon Meringue Pie","flavor_id":"84","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Italian Lemon Sicily","flavor_id":"78","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":500},{"name":"Meringue","flavor_id":"530","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Vanilla Whipped Cream","flavor_id":"1","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Pear","flavor_id":"257","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Blackberry","flavor_id":"214","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Graham Cracker Clear","flavor_id":"325","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":3000}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"31215","name":"Don't Panic"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
