I am not ashamed. I wanted that flavor fully saturated and satisfying and able to stand up to a lot of cooling for summer and here it is. \r\n\r\nIt tastes kind of like frozen blueberry pie filling topped with rich vanilla whipped cream except turned upside down because of course the cream comes in underneath, as creams do. \r\n\r\nFW Blueberry/TFA Blueberry Extra - Blueberry syrup and blueberries. \r\n\r\nTFA Dragonfruit - Blends with FW Blueberry to make it more reminiscent of that thick, shiny goop that is blueberry pie filling.  \r\n\r\nFE Lemon - A little lemon makes blueberries pop just like it does when cooking and baking. Plenty of other lemon flavors would work here at 0.25% but I wanted one that doesn't fade. \r\n\r\nTFA Vanilla Swirl/TFA Bavarian Cream - This has long been one of my favorite combinations of creams for a full mouthfeel and richness and a nice bit of vanilla in the background. \r\n\r\nCAP Super Sweet - 0.25%, just enough to really carry that sweet cream to the finish line and beyond. I chose this sweetener over others I'd usually reach for first due to its potency, to keep from going even higher than 19%. But FLV Sweetness or FW Sweetener would work just as well in the 0.35 to 0.5% range. \r\n\r\nWS-23 - It's 100+ Fahrenheit every day for the past week and for the forecastable future. I need a cold vape. Not all the time, but I need one I can reach for that's mixed up and ready to go. A different coolant will not work here. They'll rip those creams to shreds. \r\n\r\nSteep Time - I put 7 days as a minimum, but best after? Not sure. At three weeks here, it keeps getting better.

Just make it!"},{"user":"fieldgreens","text":"The only way I can describe this is disgustingly good.  Absolutely ice cold, and true to the description as a frozen blueberry pie filling with whipped cream.  The blueberry in here is so good I want to lather myself in this liquid.  It's the first recipe I've been able to vape for several days in a row in quite a long time.  Absolutely outstanding."},{"user":"Hexical","text":"Love this recipe! Blueberry is one of my favourite profiles, and its one of the rare recipes that I can tolerate creams / vanillas being used. Can't add much more other than saying what everyone else has :)"},{"user":"zenotek","text":"Something in this recipe causes the batch to turn nearly black after a few weeks."},{"user":"skineedog","text":"Definitely a good one. If you haven't picked WS-23 like me, maybe you think Koolada would work as a sub, you're wrong. Get WS-23 and try it here. You'll be glad you did."},{"user":"SeLeV","text":"This perfectly embodies what one would imagine blue ice should taste like. Once you get used to the chill, you really unravel the other layers, and there's parts of it that are deep within the recipe that things really curious. It's an ADV without a doubt."},{"user":"justjasontm","text":"This is just delightful. When it comes to the blueberry and cream it's exactly what I expected. Perfectly creamy with a nice, juicy slightly candied blueberry. It has been hot lately so the cooling is a nice touch. At first I thought there was no way cooling would go well with a cream recipe but it does! I think ws23 is the perfect fit here as menthol would be gross lol. My only thing negative to say is it's just a tad too much cooling. (For Me) . I will probably half it next time around but I'm not usually very big on cooling so I use it sparingly. All in all this is delicious and I've nearly blown through the 60ml I mixed up! "},{"user":"RinVapes","text":"I have been meaning to mix this for quite some time, mainly because of the name (love GOT and dragons) and the creator but was afraid I wouldn't like it. I don't gravitate towards cooling/mint vapes especially mixed with fruit. However, I haven't been able to taste most of my ADVS or things in general due to vaper's tongue, so I've been trying various mints and cooling type mixes. I figured now would be the perfect time to at least try it and I'm glad I did. This stuff is BOMB. I get the cooling on the inhale and a lovely blueberry cream on the exhale. I personally don't taste dragonfruit specifically but it seems that it's there mainly to boost the blueberry. It is phenomenal. I would try this even if this isn't a profile that you typically like.&#xD;\n*I did half the percentages because I mix low but I think for the average vaper, these percentages are fine*  "},{"user":"staybert","text":"Hands down the best recipie I have ever mixed, now l always keep a big bottle of this ready. This is also what got me hooked on WS-23, it really does work perfectly here together with both the fruits and creams to get that icecream feeling. 6/5."},{"user":"NikosD","text":"Yummy and cold. Super refreshing, super enjoyable! Definitely requires some days in order for the cooling to calm down and the other flavours to come in the front. I want to try it also without WS."},{"user":"coop34","text":"How did I ever forget to review this?? Easily the only BB &amp; cream mix that I have ever liked. Made 30ml at first, then 50ml, finally knew it was good enough for Gold status and mixed 250ml. Thanks for sharing!"},{"user":"MrBurgundy","text":"Delicious stuff. I love the cream base here. It’s thick and satisfying, but it leaves room for all the stuff going on up top. The blueberry and dragonfruit combo is really interesting. It’s jammy, sweet, and the dragonfruit bends it into something deeper and more mysterious. I actually liked this one more without the cooling, but it was very enjoyable either way. Great work, Dave!"},{"user":"ancient7","text":""},{"user":"AlfredPudding","text":"I'm very glad you decided to go heavy on the flavor with this one. This is easily one of the best recipes I have tried so far. The blueberry combination pairs so incredibly well with the Bavarian Cream and Vanilla Swirl, but 4% Dragonfruit is the star. It's doing so much for the blending and brightness; I can't even wrap my head around it . Normally I would suggest adding a small amount of Bilberry for the true holy trinity experience, but this changed my mind. Leaving it out really captures an amazing and complex blueberry syrup. I'm really interested in what the FE Lemon is doing here, I'll have to mix it up again without adding that and find out. Thank you for sharing this masterpiece. "},{"user":"HerrHut","text":"This is a nice cold blueberry.  The first few days I found it to be overly artificial like a bubble gum, but now (~10 days) the blueberries and cream start to shine.  It's too cold for me to vape it non stop (even though we're at 37°C (~98°F) here at the moment), but I find myself looking forward to vaping it.  Thanks for sharing!"},{"user":"Apexified","text":"This recipe makes me question everything, namely the size of my inventory. Looking over the ingredients makes me jealous of ID10-T's seemingly innate ability to take staple flavors and turn them into something fantastic. I wouldn't even call myself a huge fan of blueberry, in general, but between the way the WS-23 chills them and the Lemon makes them \"pop\" I don't think I've had a more bright, crisp and syrupy sweet blueberry experience... ever. This is ADV-worthy and I am about as far from an ADV-person as one can get. I rarely make more than a 30ml of anything and more often than not find myself moving on before finishing it, but I'm finishing off my 3rd 60ml of this recipe and wondering whether I can stop myself from mixing a 4th..."},{"user":"amouthforwar","text":"ONE CAVEAT HERE: I ran out of FW bb in the middle of making this but was still around 4-5%, just covered it with a tiiiiny bit more TFA bb extra and it came out great.&#xD;\n&#xD;\nThis is an amazing SNV and I'm excited to see how it ages for the recommended steep time. I appreciate that it's all stuff most folks would have, not exotic branded concentrates. Nice plump blueberry base with no weirdness, little zing and emulsification from the dragonfruit, blended with a really nice malty cream base. Served up ICE COLD, just the way I was hoping. Fantastic summertime mix, knocked it out of the park here."},{"user":"Exercyst","text":"I subbed Fe Lemon for Jf Juicy Lemon. I let it sit overnight. This scratches my blueberry itch. I'm not missing anything here. Keep up the good work, it's much appreciated!"},{"user":"kindground","text":"Love this mix, the common ingredients, and the balance. It's really tough to get blueberry to pop with all the vanillas. I personally added .5% HS Ice Cream to my second batch to make the vanilla a bit richer and left out the sweetener. I will definitely be making this a staple. "},{"user":"Asire","text":"Impressive how you got the flavors to taste so clear with 1% WS-23. I usually have a lot of muting going on with such a high amount of coolant. Its a really vibrant and fresh blueberry companied by a really icy inhale. The cream is just a nice round out on the exhale but not very Forward which i truely like here. What i really love is the lingering taste after each draw. Dont know if ist because of the WS-23 or the \"higher\" flavor concentration or a combination but this liquid really coats my tounge even after vaping. With that said everybody who is trying this definitively wait out the steeping time. Before 7 days the WS-23 still covers a lot of the aromas but after that the blueberry really fights its way through the coolant. Fantastic recipe for the hot days or for the start of the new GoT Season :D"}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"103899","name":"Viserion"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
