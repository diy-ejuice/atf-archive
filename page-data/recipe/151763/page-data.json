This is far from a new recipe it's just been in my recipe book for way to long. It was the lemon part that took me forever to get right as FE Lemon is so real as a flavor but I did not want it in your face.. The Lemon Squares WF is a nice custard like of a flavor with subtle lemon flavors but creamy enough for a cookie. Biscuit Base VTA along with Holy Vanilla DFS and Cookie FLV are all for the nice down home cookie taste.\r\n\r\n\r\n","steep_days":"7","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"total_reviews":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T17:35:43.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"1786","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Lemon Squares SC","vendor":"WF","millipercent":2750},{"name":"Lemon","vendor":"FE","millipercent":500},{"name":"Holy Vanilla","vendor":"DFS","millipercent":500},{"name":"Biscuit Base","vendor":"VT","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Cookie","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1000}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"151763","name":"Lemon Crack Cookies"}}}
