I mixed it and let it sit for 2 weeks. The lemonade cookie has a bit of a weird lemon flavor so next time I mix this Im going to add 1% fa lemon Sicily."},{"user":"VaperKitten","text":"I love this, I don't have Torrone (I have ordered it) I used extra Merangue in its place and put half the Inw Biscuit because I am sensitive to the flavor and a little extra Lemonade Cookie because I like strong lemon flavor..  Sooooo Good...outstanding, can't wait to try it exactly the way it is suppose to be but even with my changes it is amazing.  If you like Lemon Cookies try this recipe it ROCKS.  Love to all...Kitten"}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"57517","name":"Lemon Powdered Cookie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
