This recipe is all about Balance. Just as in real life this dense and rich cheesecake is balanced by a sweet and slightly tart Strawberry compote. This isn't your standard candied strawberry note, it draws on the deep jammy notes of OOO Strawberry Jam and WF Strawberry (Baked), making a more realistic cheesecake topping.\r\nThe cheesecake itself has Everything you could want from a cheesecake, a touch of crust, thicc ass cheesecake filling with a touch of that lactic acidity, just like mom used to make.\r\nThese flavors are perfectly balanced capturing the classic cheesecake combo.\r\nI mainly use this in boro devices, more for compact carry than anything, but have tried it in just about every device I own, and it holds up. Hopefully you enjoy this recipe as much as I and the others who have tried it do.","steep_days":"14","temperature":"0","recipe_score":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-12T17:13:26.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"592","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Strawberry Cheesecake SC","flavor_id":"10413","vendor":"WF","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Yes, We Cheesecake","flavor_id":"9272","vendor":"INW","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Strawberry Jam","flavor_id":"10274","vendor":"OOO","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Strawberry (Baked)","flavor_id":"10270","vendor":"WF","millipercent":1000},{"name":"New York Cheesecake V2","flavor_id":"3525","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Juicy Strawberry","flavor_id":"8779","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Super Sweet","flavor_id":"2384","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":500},{"name":"Sugar Cookie","flavor_id":"115","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":500}],"reviews":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"202071","name":"Strawberry Cheesecake"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
