This is the first taste off the shake... I get a light tea leaf taste... Definitely a home made sweet tea. Sweet, but not overly sweet. at 3% I think off a shake and vape recipe, this would do better at a higher % maybe around 4-5% I do not get a ethyl note from it... with that said I do believe it is ethyl based... As this is the 1st test, I cannot say what this flavor does with a steep. 1-5* ratings 5* For authenticity 1* Harshness 3* Versatility 4* Must have / If you like drink type vapes.\r\n\r\n(Notes for 5 day steep) -\r\n\r\nNot much has changed, though I'm getting a much dryer feel. Still not too sweet, the homemade tea taste is just a tad more prominent.  Check back soon. For the 10 day steep notes.\r\n","steep_days":"1 (SNV)","temperature":"1","recipe_score":5,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:49:58.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"1057","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Sweet Potato Pie â€“ Super Concentrate","vendor":"RF","millipercent":3000}],"reviews":[{"user":"SocialAnxiety","text":"What is your final conclusions? I also tested this out. Its really weird. Im from the south so my tea is 3% tea 97% sugar. This tasted to me like a lightly sweetened tea with a bit of dryness. Its very weak though because 4% felt like 1% of anything else. With as weak as it is im not sure what to do with it besides turn it up to 10-12% and add 1% super sweet though.
