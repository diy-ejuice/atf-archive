Fresh, mashed blueberries with some tart/peel is what I wanted from FA Blueberry Juicy Ripe and WF Blueberry Jam. I had to up that WF Macadamia from Yuno for it to comes across more since it’s what held the base together.\r\n\r\n***After a week steep, this mix did something that didn’t happen when I was testing it.  The blueberries and macadamia nut created a light dark chocolate note that sits right next to the berries.","steep_days":"7","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"total_reviews":1,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:51:40.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"352","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Cream Milky Undertone PG","vendor":"OOO","millipercent":2000},{"name":"New York Cheesecake","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Bavarian Cream","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Sweetener","vendor":"FW","millipercent":750},{"name":"Blueberry Juicy Ripe","vendor":"FA","millipercent":3750},{"name":"Macadamia Nut SC","vendor":"WF","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Blueberry Jam SC","vendor":"WF","millipercent":2500}],"reviews":[{"user":"rougeislander401","score":"5","text":"Phenomenal use of FAs newer blueberry juicy ripe!! This could most certainly act as an ADV for me and is definitely among some of the best blueberry mixes I've tried. The cheesecake is not super heavy which is fine with me as it allows me to be able to vape on it more frequently during these still somewhat warm months. I also love what the macadamia nut does in this recipe adding a very slight almost chocolate note on the exhale, excellent work!"}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"200452","name":"Toshiro"}}}
