Strawberries and Cream...  So in every mixers arsenal you know they have a S&C recipeand if not, that's just fucking weird because who doesn't?! I LOVE strawberries and who doesn't, unless you have an allergy to them.  Ill have to crave wanting to Vape something with strawberries for the most part, and my go to is creams like it is for a lot of people. This took a lot of tweaking and playing around to get it where I wanted, and thats how TFA White Chocolate found its place in this recipe along with lemon. Both of these flavorings gave it that special kick I felt it needed. This one took a lot of work so I hope you guys enjoy it!","steep_days":"7","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-02T07:38:40.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"1263","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Bavarian Cream","flavor_id":"145","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Carmel (caramel)","flavor_id":"503","vendor":"FA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Lemon (water Soluble)","flavor_id":"243","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":150},{"name":"Marshmallow","flavor_id":"473","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Strawberry (ripe)","flavor_id":"271","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Strawberry","flavor_id":"272","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Sweet Strawberry","flavor_id":"121","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":3500},{"name":"Sweet Cream","flavor_id":"183","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"White Chocolate","flavor_id":"194","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":3250}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"64701","name":"The Usual"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
