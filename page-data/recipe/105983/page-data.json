There may or may not also be a few slices of fresh mango as well. Sue me.\r\n\r\nIf you're still with me then its time for a few flavor notes:\r\n\r\nBavarian Cream(FW): One of my favorite creams to add to a custard. Supplies a nice thick mouthfeel without too many additional caramel and vanilla notes. \r\n\r\nCustard(INW): If you want just a thick and creamy custard without a heavy dose of vanilla than this is the one you want.\r\n\r\nMango(SC): I can't get enough of this mango lately. It's so juicy and delicious I highly recommend picking it up if you don't already have it. It's basically canned mango nectar in vape form and its the flavor that needed to be in this recipe.\r\n\r\nMango(FLV): SC Mangos best buddy in this recipe. It really brightens up the mango flavor and almost makes one believe that this is a made from scratch mango custard ðŸ˜‰\r\n\r\nVanilla Custard(CAP): This flavoring is entirely optional. I happen to love it in this recipe but it is just as tasty although a bit lighter without it.\r\n\r\nVanilla Whipped Cream(CAP): This is that little dab of whipped cream on top. It's a great flavor but if you would like a viable sub that I believe makes the recipe better, FA Whipped Cream at 1.25% will do just fine. FANA has been screwing around a bit and their whipped cream with all of that tasty diacetyl is no longer widely available to most folks or else it would have been in the recipe instead of CAP VWC...\r\n\r\nNatural Mint(INW): An amazing flavoring and the perfect mint leaf garnish for our mango custard. This flavoring is damn strong so even 0.15 would probably do just fine. \r\n\r\nSweetener is optional although it adds to the authenticity in this recipe.\r\n\r\nPretty good as a SnV or let this one steep for a couple of days if you want a bolder mango. Let it sit for a week or two for best overall results and maximum decadence.\r\n\r\nI truly love this recipe and I hope some of you folks will too!

I feel like I've found gold stumbling upon this recipe. Out of at least 6 other mango recipes I've tried this is the first that I would mix again, let alone even finish the 10ml tester. This is a wonderful sweet, bright &amp; semi-realistic mango - I 100% agree that this is a SnV and after 36hrs it's settled down and come together all juicy and Creamy-like. I do wonder how the FE/SC Mango will hold up in this mix but FLV Mango does a great job at bringing the body of the fruit. Will be nice to see how the custard develops. This here's a winner! Thanks Obi! // Update: By day 3 you can smell and taste the INW custard in this. Delicious :) (BTW I didn't add mint.)"}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"105983","name":"Mango Custard Deluxe"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
