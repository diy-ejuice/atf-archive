Poundcake is one of FLV's less strong and more forgiving flavors and it works well this high (never taken it higher though)\r\nCAP Vanilla Custard V1 is my cheat code for super sweet thick rich vanilla, I love the flavor and mouthfeel when combined with cakes and cookies. The Poundcake and Vanilla Custard create a great dense vanilla and coconut flavor that tastes like those little shreds of coconut that come in Mounds bars or the stuff you get at WinCo. With the addition of CAP Vanilla Cupcake, it's just a really good profile that you can use for just about anything that goes good with vanilla and coconut.\r\nPUR Condensed Milk is a phenomenal flavor, if you haven't tried it I urge you to get some.\r\nSBF Graham Cracker is my favorite graham cracker flavoring of them all, it's very true to it's name and you don't need much. A little goes a long way. I used it at 2% because I wanted that rough graham note to power through all the lighter cakes and to work with the CAP VC to give that DAAPy thickness we all love.\r\n\r\nInbox me and let me know what you guys think!\r\n\r\nOther suggestions: CAP Sugar Cookie, TFA Strawberry Ripe, Coconut flavors (if the coconut note in the Poundcake just isn't enough, LB Lava Cake, CAP Lemon Meringue, and a tad bit of Yellow Cake. I've tried most of those in there and it's pretty much always good (as long as you don't go overboard) but I'm most pleased with the SBF Strawberry.","steep_days":"14","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-06T22:02:23.000-05:00","best_vg":"75%","views":"1116","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Alpine Strawberry","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Butter Cream","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Condensed Milk","vendor":"PUR","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Graham Cracker","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Pound Cake","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Vanilla Cupcake","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Vanilla Custard","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":5000}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"79797","name":"America V2: Great Again."}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
