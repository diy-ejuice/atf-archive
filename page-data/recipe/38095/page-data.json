FLV Lemon Tea provides the forward tea flavor, accompanied by a warm lemon note that compliments the FA Lavender nicely.\r\n\r\nFLV Cream and FLV Milk and Honey provide a slightly creamy background to smooth out some of the dry notes in FA Black Tea and FA Lavender, while adding some body and sweetness. Overall a very simple flavor, with enough quiet complexity to keep me coming back to it.","steep_days":"3","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"total_reviews":2,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:49:13.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"2683","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Cream","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":500},{"name":"Lavender","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1250},{"name":"Lemon Tea","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Milk & Honey","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Tea Black Water Soluble","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1500}],"reviews":[{"user":"trandism","score":"5","text":"The most inspiring tea recipe so far. After trying it, I've added some florals (SA Myrtle, FLV Lemongrass) and FA Bergamot to nail a profile I was chasing for some time. I was pleasantly surprised that the micro-overdrive of Lavender did not cause any problems at all, not only in this mix but also on those I based on it."},{"user":"ConcreteRiver","score":"5","text":"Tried via Mixer's Club. Takes a couple drags to come together, but when it does this is an excellent warm herbal tea vape. Tea forward, but with just the right amount of cream to smooth the entire thing out and make it really nice and relaxing.  Good balance of floral, citrus, earthy, and creamy.
