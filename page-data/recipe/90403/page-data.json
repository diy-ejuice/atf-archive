You put three scoops of vanilla ice cream, two tablespoons of Orange Tang, and one cup of whole milk in a blender. Tang shake. Blend and drink, or shake and vape. \r\n\r\nVT Orange Tang is pretty much spot-on Tang. I don't know why they thought we needed this, since one of the common complaints about a number of orange flavors is that they taste too much like Tang and not enough like actual OJ. But sure enough, it's Tang. Thin-textured like a beverage, aggressively fake sugary sweet slightly lemony orange drink mix flavor, but specifically Tang flavor, not any old orange Kool-aid-type powder mix. They have actually emulated it that accurately, for some reason. Maybe you wanted to be a astronaut when you were growing up and drank Tang to be like your heroes, so this'll do some nostalgia stuff to you. Or you want to make an orange candy out of it and other oranges just aren't getting the job done. Bit of a throat hit with VT Orange Tang that I'd call average for a citrus, which means above average for flavors in general. Also Tang-accurate, that. Creams prove pretty helpful in soothing it. There are a couple of them here doing the vanilla ice cream + milk thing for a Tang shake. Others would probably work just as well for a simple recipe, as long as they're thick and milky. Bump the tang up to 3% if you want it Tang-ier or plan on steeping it a bit, it fades a little. \"Cold things should be cold\" folk should probably add WS-23, it works better for creamy things than Koolada or Polar Blast.
