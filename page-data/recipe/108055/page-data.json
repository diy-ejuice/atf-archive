If you ask me and smell the bottles next to each other youll be pretty amazed and probably wont tell a difference between the two at all. If this is not 1:1 it sure is insanely close.\r\nNOTES:\r\nTPA STRAWBERRY/CAP BLUERASPBERRY CC/FW BLUEBERRY- I dont know if this is what they used to make up the berries but man is it good and super close. I dont like raspberry at all and if i got any soapy ass raspberry like ive had before in juice i would probably not vape azul berries at all. These three do a very good job at being a nice berry mix that doesnt lean towards too authentic or candy. Some sort of raspberry or emulation of one being the lingering top note, the blue raspberry is there as pretty much the main flavor and to give the blue and red mix depth and keep the berries at the top while bridged together. I've tried this combo with many raspberries and everything either brightens the berries too much and the raspberry really sits at the top and takes over or it just adds soapy and perfume notes that aren't pleasant and trashes the entire profile.\r\n\r\nCAP VANILLA CUSTARD V2/VANILLA WHIPPED CREAM/FLV VANILLA PUDDING: Again i really dont know if this is what Naked uses in all of the cream line juices they have. I just know when i vape and smell it, it doesnt have the rich eggy oil from CAP VC V1. Its a dense cream, subtle on the vanilla, and very smooth. CAPS VC V2 does exactly that and for someone who does not care for too many custards out there this is a very good replacement. This combo doesn't drown out the berries and no it is not too many creams. When vaping azul you get a brightish berry front drenched in cream. Whatever they are using in it, the profile is much heavier on the cream side than it is on the berries. However or whatever, it is berry forward and cream exhale.\r\nFW SWEETENER: Optional but lets be honest its probably not the juice without it.\r\n\r\nEnjoy and please leave your honest review.","steep_days":"1 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"total_reviews":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T20:32:38.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"4629","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Blueberry","vendor":"FW","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Vanilla Whipped Cream","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Sweetener","vendor":"FW","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Vanilla Custard V2","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Blue Raspberry Cotton Candy","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Vanilla Pudding","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1000}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"108055","name":"Ozhoul Berries (Naked100 Azul Berries)"}}}
