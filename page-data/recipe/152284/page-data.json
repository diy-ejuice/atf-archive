The most iconic Aussie cough drop known to man. Get in ya jarmies, grab a box of tissues, chuck on a movie, get this recipe india and you'll be feelin top notch.\r\n\r\nThe eucalyptus & mint dies off pretty quick, just add a few drops to your bottle when this happens.","steep_days":"0 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:50:57.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"1320","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Eucalyptus With Mint","vendor":"INW","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Custard","vendor":"INW","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Shisha Vanilla","vendor":"INW","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Super Sweet","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":250}],"reviews":[{"user":"elsignor","text":"I don't know why I mixed this one, but i'm glad I did. This is surprising, full on flavor. The eucalyptus with mint is always a winner, but never used it like that before and it works so well with the vanillas . I don't know how the real thing is but this recipe is growing on me, and I think I love it. Good job!!!!&#xD;\n[EDIT] So after constantly vaping it for a month (18.5W on a 0.8ohm coil on open MTL) I love it, it is a allday, never tired of it. &#xD;\n"}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"152284","name":"butter menthol"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
