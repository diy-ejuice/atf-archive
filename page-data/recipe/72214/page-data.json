NOTE: Before you New Orleans Louisianians get upset, just do your research! The Spanish called Mobile, AL home way before they ventured down to Louisiana...  The Banana Moon Pie is a staple of Mardi Gras so I had to make this flavor perfect, especially with it being one of my favorite snacks to catch and eat at Parades. Even though it is very simple it is very good! Mix it up and let me know what you think...\r\n","steep_days":"5 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:49:41.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"5535","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Banana Cream","flavor_id":"210","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":6000},{"name":"Sugar Cookie","flavor_id":"115","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":3300},{"name":"Marshmallow","flavor_id":"473","vendor":"FA","millipercent":3300},{"name":"Graham Cracker","flavor_id":"62","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Super Sweet","flavor_id":"2384","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":500}],"reviews":[{"user":"Germ","text":"I'm so glad I found this on here I originally mixed this stuff up back when elr was still being used a lot more. 100000% banana moon pie. Awesome job man really."},{"user":"kitu5","text":"Talking as a person who normally won't touch a banana in real life, this one was always going to be iffy with me. But, i figured, with Mardi Gras coming up, hey, what the hell, right?&#xD;\n&#xD;\nSo, there's just the right amount of banana flavor in here. Not enough to gas me out, but not so weak that it's overpowered by the rest of the flavoring. For a banana moon pie, it's the right amount of banana. Doesn't hurt that the marshmallow helps mute it a touch. Speaking of that marshmallow, it's there, noticeable like the fluff is in one of those treats, and damned tasty. The sugar cookie provides the crust and tasty goodness that brings this kinda treat together. Taken in as a whole, it takes me back to the few of these I had as a kid and greatly enjoyed. Always been more of a moon pie guy tho.&#xD;\n&#xD;\nThis one's for banana lovers, sweets lovers, fans of what're largely considered southern treats (least 'round my parts), and folks who want something that's fruity and dessert, but not overpoweringly either.&#xD;\n&#xD;\nA very well crafted simple recipe that just blew my expectations away. Very well done, man!"},{"user":"corvape","text":"Thanks for sharing Cloudymotherchucker! This is nice simple recipe that packs an awesome flavor.
