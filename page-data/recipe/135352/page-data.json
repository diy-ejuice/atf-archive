I simply love it.\r\nSweetener is not necessary but if needed I would recommend you to use TFA Cotton Candy (it just tastes damn good with TFA Dragonfruit).","steep_days":"10","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T14:13:40.000-05:00","best_vg":"60%","views":"2509","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Cream","flavor_id":"604","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Dragonfruit","flavor_id":"226","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":5000},{"name":"Vanilla Ice Cream","flavor_id":"1511","vendor":"LB","millipercent":5000},{"name":"Strawberry (ripe)","flavor_id":"271","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Shisha Strawberry","flavor_id":"1711","vendor":"INW","millipercent":1000}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"135352","name":"Mephisto"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
