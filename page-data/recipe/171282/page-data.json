Simply put, pure bliss...\r\n\r\nNot much has to be said for the highly acclaimed Holy Holy Grail. It is, by far, the quintessential RY4. Period. Light on the tobacco, heavy on the  vanilla infused caramel goodness, this is the bedrock of this recipe.  Use V2 at 8% for best results. \r\n\r\nHS Caramel Toffee is my go-to caramel and further deepens the caramel layer by providing a rich and creamy true caramel flavor. \r\n\r\nLB Vanilla Ice Cream is a superb VIC and further compliments the vanillas & introduces a wonderful, rich and smooth, creamy element. Initial adaptations features custard which was good, but this bad boy/girl is just soooo much better! \r\n\r\nHS Italian cream is pure indulgence and simply adds luxurious, double cream,  oral satisfaction. \r\n\r\nGive this baby at least 7 days to stew and be prepared for oral bliss...\r\n\r\n","steep_days":"7","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T09:27:45.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"1472","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Caramel Toffee","vendor":"HS","millipercent":1500},{"name":"HOLY HOLY GRAIL RY4","vendor":"DFS","millipercent":7000},{"name":"Italian Cream","vendor":"HS","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Vanilla Ice Cream","vendor":"LB","millipercent":3000}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"171282","name":"Bliss"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
