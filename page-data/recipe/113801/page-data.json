Roasted Pecans and Cream shares the spotlight with white chocolate; bringing with it a creamy, warm, and nutty accent.\r\n\r\nBase: \r\nYellow Cake, Golden Butter, and Graham combine to make the buttery graham cracker crusted blondie base. Caramel Original is used to act as a binder and enhancer to the base; adding a sticky caramelized brown sugar and maple sweetness.\r\n\r\nSupporting Note:\r\nVanilla Ice Cream Blend 3, with its bright vanilla accents and fluffy dairy cream texture finishes off the recipe. It not only serves as an ice cream layer, it helps to add a bit more body to the white chocolate top notes; while simultaneously softening some of the sharper edges found in the blondie base.\r\n\r\nüîπOptional - Sweetener (FW) 0.25 - 0.5%\r\nThis recipe is sweet on its own however feel free to add a touch of sweetener. I would recommend to start low around 0.25%.\r\n\r\n&nbsp; \r\n\r\nMade for Mixin Vixens Ep.23\r\nhttps://youtu.be/i545HK1ahAc","steep_days":"14","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"total_reviews":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T21:32:40.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"1151","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Caramel (original)","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Golden Butter","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Graham","vendor":"HC","millipercent":500},{"name":"Love DIY","vendor":"VT","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Roasted Pecans & Cream","vendor":"WF","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Van Ice Cream OOO Blend III","vendor":"OOO","millipercent":1000},{"name":"White Chocolate","vendor":"DF","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Yellow Cake","vendor":"JF","millipercent":1500}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"113801","name":"Golden Blondie "}}}
