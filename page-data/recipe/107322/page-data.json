Was inspired to make this as my favourite juice, Handlebar, is no longer available in the UK. Think it still needs a little work, but the pineapple peach mix is pretty close. Sweet fruity inhale with a vanilla ice cream exhale. Good as a SNV but better after a couple days steep (ice cream gets better).  Can also be made without sweetener as this candies the pineapple quite a bit.
