Took the VBIC and lowered it a little to tone down the density and DAP, paired the FA Pear and CAP Fuji to create a bright apple (CAP Fuji has less of the alcoholic note than FA Fuji and is also a bit softer) and then put in a dash of Honesuckle to boost the fruit florals and a bit of Key Lime to brighten the fruits.\r\n\r\nShake and vapeable but you will probably like it best after a 3-5 day steep.","steep_days":"5 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"updated_at":"2020-12-12T15:39:16.000-05:00","best_vg":"60%","views":"1966","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Vanilla Bean Ice Cream","flavor_id":"186","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":6000},{"name":"Fuji","flavor_id":"506","vendor":"FA","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Honeysuckle (pg)","flavor_id":"306","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Florida Key Lime","flavor_id":"7699","vendor":"FA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Pear","flavor_id":"411","vendor":"FA","millipercent":2000}],"reviews":[{"user":"shyndo","text":"profile so far up my alley I'm questioning my sexuality.
