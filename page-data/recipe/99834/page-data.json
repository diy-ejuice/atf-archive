I have always tried for that perfect cheesecake and have failed everytime. I've tried cherries,blueberries,strawberries and even black currant. I  believe that this recipe is my harpoon,that I shot right in the heart of this mammoth of a beast. 1st I used a common cheesecake stone CAP NY Cheesecake and Cap Vanilla CustardI utilized the FA Meringue as a bridge for the creams and Almond, to add a little more texture. Of course the TFA Graham Cracker Clear it the crust. The CAP Caramel adds a sweet and buttery taste. Cap Super Sweet self explanatory.","steep_days":"5","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"updated_at":"2020-12-12T15:39:56.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"2691","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"New York Cheesecake","flavor_id":"90","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Vanilla Custard","flavor_id":"131","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Meringue","flavor_id":"530","vendor":"FA","millipercent":750},{"name":"Graham Cracker Clear","flavor_id":"325","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Super Sweet","flavor_id":"2384","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":500},{"name":"Toasted Almond","flavor_id":"294","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":750},{"name":"Caramel","flavor_id":"26","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":2000}],"reviews":[{"user":"MrZigglesworth","text":"I actually forgot to try this when it hit the 5-day mark as the recipe suggested and didn't get around to it until a couple of days ago (about 3 weeks now). This cheesecake is definitely different from the one's I've tried and not in a bad way. The use of CAP Caramel V1 to add that bit of buttery texture at the end has been very nice, and CAP NY Cheesecake/Cap Custard v1 always taste great after a long steep. Personally I can't really detect the Graham Cracker Clear in this but maybe that's because I let it steep too long and the creams took over. Nonetheless this is a worthy edition to your mix list if you like cheesecake.","score":5},{"user":"KylezKloudz","text":"Yarrrr! üê≥ She be a beast of a recipe!
