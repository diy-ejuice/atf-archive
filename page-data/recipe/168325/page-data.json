I was addicted to that stuff as a kid and tried to create a recipe that had a really sweet profile, but in a natural fruity way rather than sickly sweet. This is still a work in progress but I can't stop mixing this stuff so thought I'd make it my first shared recipe. It definitely has a floral note, which some may not like but is very much to my taste and the addition of LA Lemonade makes it more of a Robinsons Lemonade than a Robinsons Squash but given my new-found addiction to LA Lemonade I'm very pleased with this.
