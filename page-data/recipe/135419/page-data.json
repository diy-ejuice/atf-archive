The candies I added to this mix  went impressively well with the fruits and made this more blue than I ever expected. I got that mixer feelings of, nothing is better and more satisfying mixing than the chance of something to go right and then it does. This is so much fun to vape so I had to share this lucky roll of a recipe. I am betting that the King Pazzo FA is the main transforming flavor because without it this recipe is not nearly as good or as blue.","steep_days":"1 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-11T14:17:10.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"2114","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Berryl (raspberry)","flavor_id":"412","vendor":"FA","millipercent":3500},{"name":"Citrus Punch","flavor_id":"348","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Blackberry Raspberry","flavor_id":"707","vendor":"INW","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Pear","flavor_id":"411","vendor":"FA","millipercent":750},{"name":"Jammy/Candy Wizard","flavor_id":"9955","vendor":"FA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Jelly Candy","flavor_id":"2170","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Sweet And Tart","flavor_id":"338","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Pazzo RE (King)","flavor_id":"9907","vendor":"FA","millipercent":2500}],"reviews":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"135419","name":"Blue Raspberry Juice Roll Upz  Remix"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
