Before we get into the actual review (for all you impatient fucks), this IS a \"Mix It,\" 100%. Throughout my journey as a mixer, I've come to accept that my strength and preference comes in the form of fruit recipes. This one stood out to me because of the use of FA Pear, which is easily one of my favourite fruit concentrates. Loco uses it perfectly here, as well as expertly crafting the rest of the recipe around it. The use of CAP Lemon Lime made me hesitate for a moment, given the harshness and somewhat off notes from it, but by masking it's downfalls with TPA Meringue, we get something absolutely delicious to bring some bright citrus sweetness to an otherwise linear profile. One thing I love about FA Pear is the juicy emulsification it brings to other fruits, and by pairing that with INW Cactus, this becomes vape that assaults the tastebuds in the best way possible. A simple to mix, yet delicately complex recipe that is perfect for those hot summer days. My only suggestion would be using something like TPA Pear to bring a little bit more authenticity to the pear notes, for right now, we get more of the Fuji and citrus notes at the forefront, while the pear takes a backseat to those powerhouse concentrates. While that may have been the intent of the mixer, I believe that overhauling those pear notes would push this shit to 11. Great job, Loco, this recipe has been added to the rotation of ADVs."},{"user":"tw2k","text":"The balance between the fruits is delicious, and it's a unique flavor profile.
