I was looking for a solid cakey blueberry vape but wasn't having any luck. Thanks to the DiY-Ejuice community and /u/ID10-T for this suggestion because it hits the spot. The blueberry is perfectly balanced and the cakey flavor balances with it perfectly.","steep_days":"7","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:49:27.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"1334","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Cupcake batter","flavor_id":"2596","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":4500},{"name":"Blueberry","flavor_id":"1201","vendor":"FW","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Blueberry (extra)","flavor_id":"218","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Bilberry","flavor_id":"533","vendor":"FA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Dragonfruit","flavor_id":"226","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Meringue","flavor_id":"530","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Vanilla Bean Ice Cream","flavor_id":"186","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1000}],"reviews":[{"user":"lmhobbs","text":"I LOVE THIS! I'm going to need to buy more FLV Cupcake Batter because it's all going to go into this recipe :-) I might try it out with a bit more Bilberry to see how that affects the blueberry- maybe get it a tad more realistic.
