I took his/her use of Raspberry and Peach, to create the Blue Raspberry flavour. And gave it an extra kick with the Blue Raspberry Cotton Candy. I also changed the CAP Jelly Candy to 27 Bears as I really enjoy the flavour and the gummy mouthfeel. I have tested with CAP Jelly Candy and it is really good as well.","steep_days":"1 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T17:34:21.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"3627","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"27 Bears","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":6000},{"name":"Raspberry (sweet)","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Peach (juicy)","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Super Sweet","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":500},{"name":"Dragonfruit","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Blue Raspberry Cotton Candy","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1500}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"63149","name":"Blue Gummy"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
