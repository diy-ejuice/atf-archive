CAP CDS at 1.5% adds in the additional bread like feel with a hint of cinnamon that accentuates the crust.  \r\n\r\nFA Meringue / CAP Vanilla Cupcake\r\nI find that a mix of FA Meringue & CAP Vanilla Cupcake work together to sweeten the whole mix, but they really work well to sweeten the crust and bring a nice bakery style frosting to glaze the fruits.\r\n\r\nJF Fuji / TFA Strawberry Ripe\r\nThese fruits are the top notes and are pronounced throughout the vape.  JF Fuji builds on TFA Pie Crust / CAP CDS to give the “warm apple pie” with just a touch of bright apple fruitiness taste as well and TFA Strawberry Ripe comes through with the sweetness of a glazed/cooked strawberry note that complete this – Strapple Crisp! \r\n\r\nSteep 3-4 days \r\nDelicious!\r\n","steep_days":"0","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T11:43:11.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"834","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Pie Crust","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Meringue","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Vanilla Cupcake","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Strawberry (ripe)","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Fuji","vendor":"JF","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Cinnamon Danish Swirl","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1500}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"16747","name":"Strapple Crisp"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
