But this time, I was bored with it and I took it a few steps further.\r\n\r\nI stuck with the same percentages of fruit rings and Bavarian cream because I thought that was perfect.\r\n\r\nI added in acetyl pyrazine to add the graininess of actual ceral. Then I added cap super sweet because I think it's the perfect sweetener to give the cereal that dry dusty sweetness. \r\n\r\nI feel like this is super authentic and my wife has been vaping it non stop for around 3 months now.\r\n\r\nSimple additions made this recipe outstanding in my opinion. It took a while to get the perfect percentages down but I think this is it. Hope you enjoy it as much as I do.\r\n","steep_days":"2 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"updated_at":"2020-12-12T09:12:54.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"2527","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Fruit Rings","flavor_id":"1285","vendor":"FW","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Bavarian Cream","flavor_id":"145","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Acetyl Pyrazine 5%","flavor_id":"1709","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":750},{"name":"Super Sweet","flavor_id":"2384","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":750}],"reviews":[{"user":"Hazard15301","text":"I made this and let it steep for 6 days.
