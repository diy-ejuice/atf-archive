I never thought this one would be so easy to remix either! I never really got into buying a lot of commercial E-juice, I did but I didn't if you know what I mean, I bought A lot of my local Vape shops in house juice and a few commercial juices ! Then got right into DIY ! I was introduced by my good hometown friend / mixing buddy now! Barrett AKA (Krucial) , we had been talking about making our on juice for a while and then he started buying flavorings and making it and let me try some, then the rest is history ! Now here I am ! This was one of my go to juices when I felt like spending twenty dollars for a bottle of juice ! Now I can make it myself for maybe two bucks !!!!!!!  It's a pretty simple profile, but it was delicious! Trix cereal ! When I smelled FLV Tricks cereal I knew right away I had found the tricks cereal that they were using, its very different than the other tricks cereals and the smell just gave it away ! This is the best tricks cereal imo ! I also knew that they weren't using much flavoring because there cereal line is 90vg , I knew then that I could remix one of my favorite juices !! I mixed this one at first with just FLV Tricks and FLV sweetness and  I thought it's pretty close but missing just a little something, then  I added the FLV Milk, and I knew then it was spot on !! It's pretty simple and self explanatory! Silly rabbit this juice is not for kids !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Mix it up rate it and leave your feedback thanks SK !!!!!!! #RemixMonth","steep_days":"3","temperature":"0","recipe_score":1,"total_reviews":1,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T20:32:04.000-05:00","best_vg":"90%","views":"2236","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Tricks Cereal","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Milk","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":500},{"name":"Sweetness","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":250}],"reviews":[{"user":"Ori","score":"1","text":"Awfuly bad recipe.
