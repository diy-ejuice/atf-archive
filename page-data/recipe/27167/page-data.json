But i have to give a shout out to @rdajunkie. I started with his recepie and over time ive been tweeking a little here and there and now we have this... \r\nDont sub fw sweet cream. I know its gross and everyone hates it including me. But trust me it works here. \r\nThe only thing im thinking about is bringing\r\nThe sugar cookie to 1% and adding tpa graham clear at 1%\r\nYes also your reading it right.  Bilberry at 1%.  I know that sounds risky or also gross. \r\nBut again trust me. It works here.\r\nGive this. Atleast a week. But after that its good to go. Hope you guys enjoy this. \r\nUp and coming mixer. Been doing this for bearly 3 months and ive had a lot of help from my friends (graham/diyordies producer) (lorenzo/blackdimondvapes) and (dasmoose/liquidantlers) Like comment share follow.
