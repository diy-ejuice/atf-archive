Simply add your jam if you want bread with jam! I do not suggest vaping this by itself unless you're just looking to inhale a warm loaf.  Make sure you use the right baked bread concentrate. There is a VG one and a super concentrated version. This is the VG version.","steep_days":"1 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"updated_at":"2020-12-12T20:29:22.000-05:00","best_vg":"69%","views":"3646","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Cereal 27","flavor_id":"4163","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Baked Bread","flavor_id":"7384","vendor":"RF","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Toasted Marshmallow","flavor_id":"340","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":200}],"reviews":[{"user":"Lulzor","text":"Used this to make a PB&amp;J with shisha strawberry/tfa pear/tfa PB/red touch and this is exactly what it states.

Definitely not for solo use except as a novelty or if you are a complete weirdo, but it tastes like a thick slice of homemade white bread and this wizardry has fully revived what had been a dying effort to create a Goober Grape vape. https://www.reddit.com/r/GooberGrapeVape/","score":5}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"57854","name":"Bread Stone"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
