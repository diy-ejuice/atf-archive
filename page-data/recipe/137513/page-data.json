You should, hopefully, if I did it right, see a link to his original recipe below. To be 100% honest I pulled part of his base as a cheesecake stone some time ago and totally forgot where I sourced it from for a good long while. It is absolutely beautiful and is one of the most accepting plug and play stones that I have encountered. Slap some strawberries, lemon, lime, guava, pineapple, chocolate, etc in to the base, wait a week, and it will be damn good. We omit the French Vanilla merely because I don't have it. Feel free to throw it in if desired. Now back to our regularly scheduled program:\r\n\r\nI am a blasphemer and have only recently gotten my hands on one of the most ubiquitous blueberries, not to mention flavors in general, FW Blueberry. I will not repent. At 5% it sits front and center in this mix, as it very well deserves. We get a lovely, almost warm and syrupy blueberry glaze here to the point that it almost suggests blueberries IN the cheesecake as well as a blueberry sauce drizzled over the top of your generously portioned (not so) diet friendly slice. \r\n\r\nA sizable dash of CAP New York Cheesecake gives us our cheesecake tone. It fills the gap nicely and in my humble opinion is one of the most forgiving cheesecakes out there, not to mention one of the most accessible. If you must you may sub TPA Garbage Fire CGC here, but this author humbly requests that you don't do that.\r\n\r\nOne of the worst aspects of CAP New York Cheesecake is the inherent lack of a graham cracker crust. A mild dosage of INW Biscuit resolves this effectively. A mere 1% is a sufficient amount to remedy this gap in our mix, and it adds a nice crispy finish in combination with FA Meringue. \r\n\r\nSpeaking of which, I love FA Meringue. It is my life blood. It goes in nearly every dessert type recipe that I concoct. It smells like Lucky Charmsâ„¢ milk and tastes like rainbows after a solid steep. We inject a decent 2% into our slice of cheesecake for a nice hard meringue topping. Meringue is effectively what ties the blueberry to the cheesecake. If you don't believe me, try mixing this up and omit the Meringue. See what you did? You wasted VG is what you did, you silly goose.\r\n\r\nFinally we dribble a little milk over the whole thing for some reason. 0.5% FA Creme Fresh (or Fresh Cream, or whatever) is the final jagged piece of cardboard that completes the overdone puzzle that is a blueberry cheesecake. Why do we add Creme Fresh you may be asking yourself? Well I'll be glad to explain. I saw Coop34 do it and that guy is way smarter and more experienced than I am, so here we are. I have tried leaving it out and the main aspect that I noticed was a thinner mouthfeel. I only vape cheesecake when I want a nice fat mouthfeel, so we must ensure that 0.5% Creme Fresh makes its way into our bottle prior to filling and shaking. This is of utmost importance. \r\n \r\nA grueling ONE WEEK MINIMUM steep is the final tear shed over our now bubbling bottle of goodness. It hurts, I know. You may be tempted to dip into your bottle a little early. You will be greeted with a greasy mouth coating layer of ick from the Fresh Cream, Meringue, and NY Cheesecake. It's unavoidable, truly. I found my tester bottle after about 20 days and that is what inspired me to throw this recipe up for you all, so the longer the better. I immediately threw together a 120ml bottle to stick in the deep dark dungeon that is my steep cabinet, only to be touched when temperature outside starts with a seven.","steep_days":"7","temperature":"0","recipe_score":4.7,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:50:42.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"4142","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"New York Cheesecake","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Meringue","vendor":"FA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Biscuit","vendor":"INW","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Cream Fresh","vendor":"FA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Blueberry","vendor":"FW","millipercent":5000}],"reviews":[{"user":"reprisal3","text":"OK...this recipe is awesome.  100% blueberry cheesecake with a big mouth feel.
