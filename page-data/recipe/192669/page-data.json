The biscuit crust backs it up very nicely and encapsulating the whole thing is the satisfying and dark RY4\r\n\r\nIn this day and age the amount of flavouring might seem a lot but but each one is here for a reason and the recipe (for my pallet) really works. I took some inspiration from Brian Rileys “Cannoli Be One Rmx” and “John Nathan’s Pesonal RY4” which I really love. These recipes push the levels of flavouring to a luxurious level which I really enjoy\r\n\r\nThe contrast between the RY4 and the creams is so stark that IMO it needed a lot of blending to bring them together to smooth out the hard edge of the RY4 and make it work with the Ice Cream/cheesecake. All of the different elements in this recipe work together to achieve this\r\n\r\nDevelopment\r\nI’m the early days of its creation I started out with something very different so I made some drastic changes and Suddenly hit on something which made me jump up and down with excitement. After that I made many variations on this until I went full circle and came right back to first “good version”  and found with a few small tweaks it really needed nothing more. I experience a full bodied experience with a beginning, body and finish with a dense mouth feel\r\n\r\nSteep/Maturation \r\nI put the steep at 10 days which it absolutely needs, before that it is watery and flat but after 10 days the transformation is night and day. It gets superr thick, heavy and full with a really prominent and pleasing mouth feel. Also the RY4 blends and mellows into its true form. It really is surprising how much it changes in this time so if you mix it please don’t get disheartened before giving it the full amount of time\r\n\r\nTesting/Equipment \r\nTo test I used a Single coil flavour RDA (Hussar RDA 2.0) with a tri core alien on a mech squonker at 0.24 ohms\r\n\r\nThanks ","steep_days":"10","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"total_reviews":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T07:01:41.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"715","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Cheesecake (graham Crust)","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Graham Cracker","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":500},{"name":"Love DIY","vendor":"VT","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Funnel Cake","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Ry4 Double","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":5000},{"name":"Super Sweet","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":500},{"name":"Vanilla Ice Cream","vendor":"LB","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Biscuit","vendor":"INW","millipercent":1000}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"192669","name":"Loco Mountain (Frozen Cheesecake with RY4 & Biscuit crust)"}}}
