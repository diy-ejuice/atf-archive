(https://redd.it/5azrq8)  With his permission, I made a couple tweaks and posted it here.\r\n\r\nI'm typically not a huge peach fan, but this mix of fruits blends together very well to make a very nice authentic peach flavor and irresistible cream combo. The peach flavor becomes smooth and relatively mellow after a 5 day steep.","steep_days":"5","temperature":"475","recipe_score":3.5,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:48:55.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"2778","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Peach (juicy)","flavor_id":"254","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Peach White","flavor_id":"543","vendor":"FA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Bavarian Cream","flavor_id":"1187","vendor":"FW","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Dragonfruit","flavor_id":"226","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Sweet Strawberry","flavor_id":"121","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Cinnamon Danish Swirl","flavor_id":"35","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Sweet Coconut","flavor_id":"605","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":500}],"reviews":[{"user":"CriticalVape","text":"This is a solid recipe. Easily of commercial quality. I'm not a big fan of TFA Juicy Peach, as I prefer JF Honey Peach. Nevertheless, it plays well here. It's a nice rounded peach with the help from the strawberry. No bready note detected, and not overly creamy. A rounded peach, and lightly-spiced cream. Best after about 4 days imo. Well done, thanks for sharing."},{"user":"triangulatethisdick","text":"I was trying out some peach recipes after trying mathewkocanda's whatever forever recipe, which I didn't expect to like as much as I did. Unfortunately this recipe didn't play nicely w/ my taste buds. The cds dried out the recipe while the strawberry added a competing sickly sweet note with the peach that just didn't sit well the dry bready cinnamon. I like the vapes in theory tho. So I'll probably play around with Cinnamon and peach. So thanks for that man. That being said it wasn't horrible. I vaped 15mls if it before deciding against it"}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"21829","name":"Peachy Creamy"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
