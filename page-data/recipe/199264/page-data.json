This was seen as the first big introduction to the world of this delicious dessert. Apparently she didn't mind the odd cigar either. She was well known for not only bringing both sides of politics together in a socially positive way but also for the quote, \"I would rather fight with my hands than my tongue\".\r\nI think if she was around in this era, she would of said \"I will fight for the right to vape and to taste with my tongue again\"\r\nJust maybe if history was different, 207 years later she would have been enjoying this lovely combination in a vape.\r\n\r\nThis is my 2020 version of the classic Strawberry Ice-Cream in a vape with the best known vape flavours known to our industry right now.\r\n\r\nA delicious, juicy and jammy strawberry ice cream layered with a little marshmallow and vanilla in a serene experience that will tantilise your taste buds with texture and flavour.\r\n\r\nA short 3 Day plus steep is well worth the wait after a good shake as it will allow that little bit of time for all the ingredients to layer and meld nicely.\r\n\r\nWhy I did what I did ?\r\nLB Vanilla Ica Cream - Is simply the best creamiest and smooth easy to work with ice cream flavours that acts as a lovely base here.\r\n\r\nWF Buttercream Frosting - assist the ice cream so the ice cream has a better mouthfeel rather than the usual melted ice cream mouthfeel, it tastes more authentic.\r\n\r\nFLV Marshmallow Vanilla - Fills out the body of this vape very nicely offering some delectable tones of vanilla as well.\r\n\r\nOOO Strawberry Jam - Is in my opinion the most authentic tasting, full flavored strawberry jam flavour on the market today. It brings the depth of the strawberry through out this recipe.\r\n\r\nFA Red Touch Strawberry - Is such a delicious and round, full flavoured strawberry that contrasts and accents wonderfully here.\r\n\r\nA little super sweet helps to make it shine a little.\r\n\r\nYou can treat this with a little extra if you like.\r\nadd a little white choc (I suggest 0.5-1% FLV White Choc or 1.5% FW White Choc), maybe a little coconut (I suggest for texture 1.5% VTA Desiccated coconut or creamy coconut FLV Coconut 1%) , or maybe you would like a bit of that ice cream cone by adding a little WF Sugar cone and/or WF Crispy Wafer if you like (up to around 2% of either).\r\n\r\nAdvocacy:\r\nYou aren't going to steal my Ice-cream Mr Hunt!\r\nNot on my watch Mr. Hunt!\r\nAustralia is currently in a massive battle to save our industry from planned legislation that would effectively make nicotine almost inaccessible.\r\nWe only have til January 1, 2021 leaving us only a few moths to try and turn this around.

In your notes you suggest adding sugar cone or crispy wafer. Although I do have crispy wafer I decided to try a new flavor I got in the same order as the jam, SSA crisp waffle at 1.5. WOW, Im thinking about translating this into a new recipe cause I really enjoy a top flavor heavy ice cream which your recipe hits every one of those notes and the addition of that SSA cone at that percent blew my mind. Thanks for sharing this, I will also try messing around with your other suggestions in the future!!!","score":5},{"user":"Screwdriver","text":"Really tasty and smooth ADV recipe. Great mouthfeel too.
