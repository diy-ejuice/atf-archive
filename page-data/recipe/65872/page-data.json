I posed the question in Discord on what to do about this other than taking a vapecation. I received a lot of suggestions ranging from switching up my eliquid, blasting my palate with high %'s of lemon and menthol ejuices  and gargling with pickle juice. I also did a bit of research on what the food industry uses to cleans palates. Many high end restaurants use a tangy sorbet to cleanse palates between courses and some wine tasters will inhale coffee bean aromas. I decided to go with the sorbet route and am asking mixers to try this recipe to see if this will help with vaper's tongue. I personally think that it helps but would love to know your thoughts on this matter. \r\n\r\nTechnically, this is not a sorbet because a sorbet is mostly a fruity ice mixture and not an ice cream. However, going on what other mixers have suggested I created this \"Palate Reset\" recipe to mimic a sorbet by using LB Vanilla Ice Cream with Cap Peppermint. In many instances, a sour aroma was used to cleanse the palate, so that's where the FE Lemon comes into play. A touch of sweetener was used to liven things up a bit. \r\n\r\nI wanted to make this recipe to help mixers overcome Vaper's Tongue but, as it stands, this recipe is very good as an ADV.\r\nIf you mix this, please post your comments on if, and how this recipe works as a palate cleanser or palate reset. \r\nVisit Freedom To Mix on Discord https://discord.gg/SmSc8Ef\r\nVisit Freedom To Mix on FaceBook https://www.facebook.com/groups/415341418920740/ \r\n\r\nPlease comment, mix, and or rate,....it makes us all better mixers. Enjoy :)\r\n","steep_days":"1 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"total_reviews":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T20:32:14.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"3117","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Lemon","vendor":"FE","millipercent":500},{"name":"Peppermint","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Vanilla Ice Cream","vendor":"LB","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Super Sweet","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":250}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"65872","name":"Palate Reset"}}}
