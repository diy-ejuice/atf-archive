This recipe was another attempt but looking outside the box. I was at nic rivers purchasiing nicotene and noticed there new strawberry biscuit flavor. I thought the biscuit might hold on to the strawberry longer and make the sweet cream taste more like a rich milk. The results where a nestle quik strawberry flavor and most of all I could taste the strawberry. This was huge for me and is my ADV now. Vaping on a tesla nano 120 with a vaporesso pro tank .5ss ccell 35 watts. Regards all.","steep_days":"5 (SNV)","temperature":"540","recipe_score":0,"total_reviews":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-05T20:49:47.000-05:00","best_vg":"80%","views":"1285","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Strawberry Biscuit","vendor":"NR","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Strawberry (ripe)","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":5000},{"name":"Shisha Strawberry","vendor":"INW","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Dragon Fruit","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":150},{"name":"Super Sweet","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1250},{"name":"Cream Fresh","vendor":"FA","millipercent":3500}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"60829","name":"Quik fix üçì"}}}
