The yoghurt part does add some creamy-gooey-good stuff to this flavor, to make it work perfectly in my recipe here.\r\nNext up, I needed some strawberry as banana and strawberry go very well together and is a thing most people can get along with - please note, I didn't want to go down a weird rabbit hole with this recipe. My first choice was 4% TFA Strawberry Ripe, but both Zany and I agreed (as he chipped in a little with advice) that 4% wasn't strong enough. So Zany suggested 1.5% JF Strawberry sweet and I decided to bump TFA Strawberry Ripe up another 0.5%. It worked! The strawberry is now there, but not so much it'll overpower the 3% CC Banana Yoghurt.\r\nFA Cream is just playing a tiny supporting role here to smoothen the whole mix up and lending some back-up to CC Banana Yoghurt. I find 1.25% to be just perfect - not too much and not too little.\r\n\r\nFor your own preference, please feel free to add a little sweetener to this mix if it's not enough. I myself find 2 drops of CAP Super Sweet in a 30ml done mix to hit the spot.\r\nWhich and how much if any sweetener, I'll leave that up to you, dear mixer.\r\n\r\nCC Banana Yoghurt is really best at 3 days steep, but hey... this works perfectly great as a SNV!\r\n\r\nEnjoy!","steep_days":"3 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-10T19:01:28.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"1051","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Banana Yoghurt","flavor_id":"4256","vendor":"CC","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Strawberry (ripe)","flavor_id":"271","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":4500},{"name":"Cream Fresh","flavor_id":"540","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1250},{"name":"Strawberry Sweet","flavor_id":"4745","vendor":"JF","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Vanilla Swirl","flavor_id":"189","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1750}],"reviews":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"175397","name":"Strawnana Smoothie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
