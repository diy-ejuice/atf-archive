The beer is actually HS but could not find in drop down menu. This is a nice Thick and Creamy Vanilla, Chocolate, Coffee Stout with a bit of hops. Steep this about 10 days to make all the flavors burst. I added .5 of FLV sweetness as I like my mixes sweet. Mixed this at 70/30 to give a more thicker mouthfeel that you get from a nice Milk Stout.
