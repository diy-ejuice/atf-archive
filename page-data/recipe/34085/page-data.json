I found the recipe online and after making the doughnuts for my family and myself, I really wanted to transfer that taste into a vape. \r\n\r\nI used FA Zeppola, FW Cake Batter Dip and FW Bavarian Cream as my doughnut base.\r\n\r\nFor the snickerdoodle I used CAP Sugar Cookie and CAP Cinnamon Danish Swirl.\r\n \r\nI used the TPA Carmel in this recipe to blend the two together. \r\n\r\nThe cinnamon danish swirl can be adjusted depending on your preferences. I found that using it at 1.5 was a good balance and did not make it overpowering. \r\n\r\nThe sucralose is optional in this mix and can be left out if preferred.
