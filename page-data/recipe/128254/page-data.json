I’ve gone through many versions before finally settling on this one. The percentages are high and the flavor is strong but that’s exactly what she wanted so feel free to dial down anything that you feel is too much. If you mix this up, I hope you enjoy it as much as she has. Let me know what you think!","steep_days":"5 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":4,"total_reviews":1,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:50:34.000-05:00","best_vg":"80%","views":"2575","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Blue Raspberry Slush","vendor":"OSD","millipercent":8000},{"name":"Sour Blue Raspberry Candy","vendor":"WF","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Strawberry (ripe)","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":5000},{"name":"Strawberry","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Juicy Lemon","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Super Sweet","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":500}],"reviews":[{"user":"Chefswannie","score":"4","text":"Really good shake and vape!
