Another Take on a Bar or Casual drink .. it consist of Grey Goose Vodka and Cranberry juice topped with Sprite ( i do not have a sprite like flavor so tried my best to emulate one):\r\n\r\nSo what we have are the basics Cranberry and Russian vodka, then i added some pomegranate to enhance the cranberry and add some berry sweetness to the mix, next i  tried to work on a sprite like soda  hence where the Pink Lemonade and Morning Mimosa  come into play.. i then added some sweetness to the end to tame the mix . \r\nThen cooled it down with WS-23 \r\nHope yall Enjoy.....
