Mixed around cream flavors, added marshmallow.\r\n\r\nBavarian Cream/sweet cream/cream fresh - milk base. very dairy without being TFA Dairy/milk.\r\n\r\ncereal 27 - the star of the show. Honey grain cereal. Great for creams, cereal... I can't think of much this wouldn't fit in apart from straight fruits, menthol, alcohol, drinks, or anise.\r\n\r\nmeringue/marshmallow - cereal staples, KIX itself does not have marshmallow in it but here marshmallow is used with meringue to boost the sweet honey sugar glazed corn/grain cereal and overall sweetness.\r\n\r\nPossible additions:\r\n.25% TFA Cotton Candy (Ethyl Maltol). Used to take any harsh edges off, I tend to prefer it with it in the mix.","steep_days":"7","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T17:34:14.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"3260","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Cereal 27","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Sweet Cream","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":750},{"name":"Cream Fresh","vendor":"FA","millipercent":650},{"name":"Meringue","vendor":"FA","millipercent":750},{"name":"Marshmallow","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Bavarian Cream","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":500}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"55849","name":"Kix Cerealmilk V2"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
