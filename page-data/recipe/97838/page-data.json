Even better possibly would be the OOO Vanilla custard cheesecake as this tastes like LA cream cheese icing but better apparently the original is still the best.

About 7 years ago I vaped this Custard called Custards Last Stand. Since that time for 7 years now I have been looking for a Vanilla Custard as good as that. My search is over thanks to you. It's only on a 4 day steep and I can already tell this is going to be my go to Vanilla Custard. I want to sincerely thank you. You ticked all the boxes perfectly. 5+ stars for you and this recipe. I assume your name is Luke. Well the force is definitely with you, young Skywalker","score":5},{"user":"EyeM2sRus","text":"I saw Dave's review and couldnt resist mixing this up. Granted i homogenized this, bit even with that a 2 day bloom brought this into a whole new appreciation for a deep, sticky, delicious vanilla custard with all the DAAP i could want. I mixed a 60ml of this and it was gone in those 2 or 3 days, something i rarely do. Top notch luke you killed it","score":5},{"user":"tw2k","text":"","score":5},{"user":"ID10-T","text":"It's Saturday afternoon and I'm waiting for the results of my COVID-19 test. I had to get tested 24 hours ago, because this lady at work gots the Rona. I don't think I have it. I don't have any symptoms, I haven't been within six feet of our own Typhoid Lisa, I always wear a mask outside of my closet-ass excuse for an office, I've used buckets of hand sanitizer. I'm not worried about the Rona. I'll tell you what I am worried about:  Vanilla Custard Lung Disease. Maybe it's a real thing. Maybe it's like that Black Lung Disease that coal miners get, but waaaaaay tastier. Anyway, I go get the Rona test. They do an oral swab test. For that, you have to cough five times and then don't swallow until they're done with the swabbing. The whole time this woman in a hazmat suit is jabbing me in the tonsils with what feels like a sharpened stick, all I can think besides, \"ouch!\" and \"hey, watch the gag reflex, lady!\" is \"holy fuckin shit, my phlegm tastes like vanilla custard, that can't be good.\" It's been at least 45 minutes, probably closer to an hour, since I last had the extreme pleasure of the finest vanilla custard recipe that has ever been created, Yellow Matter Custard, and my coughed-up lung gunk still tastes like delicious vanilla custard. That can't be good, right? I want everyone to know that if I turn up dead soon, it probably wasn't the Rona. This dude most likely killed me by making the custard to end all custards so irresistibly decadently wonderful that I couldn't resist continuing to indulge in it, even to the point of my lungs turning into sweet buttery eggy creamy vanilla goo and drowning me. If I die, Luke killed me. Punish him accordingly.     ","score":5},{"user":"Joe73353","text":"Absolutely delicious and it hasn‚Äôt even been steeped 24 hours!

But on the exhale i get the dryness from Yellow cake and its lingering on my tongue.&#xD;\nEdit: After 3 Weeks, that dryness is going. Top Recipe! Changed from 4 Stars to 5 Stars.&#xD;\nHowever, good Recipe.&#xD;\nEdit: Made a version with OOO Vanilla custard cheesecake. is also not bad, but by far not same good, like with  LA CCI.&#xD;\nLA CCI gives this recipe the zing, the thing what makes it special. My tip: Mix the recipe how it is!&#xD;\nEdit: Today i have used 1% VTA Vanilla Buttercream Frosting, instead of CCI.&#xD;\nEdit2: Works very well with VTA Vanilla Butter Cream Frosting. And also with WF Butter Cream Frosting. Its not better, but nice variations.&#xD;\nƒ∞ will give Feedback.

It is SOO well balanced, silky dense and it is CUSTARD not a pudding or some wanna be custard   -  yeah  it is a steeper   but honestly worth it .   I can see where each ingredient has a role in this mix  for sure  and makes for the whole ,    On a side note:     I am interested in seeing what    VTA butter cream   would do in its place of CCI   - and  if  CCI  is really  a lynch pin for the mix   since that is what probably needs the long  steep -  would be nice to see if  it can be replaced  with something that works but  has a shorter steep.    With that said  -  I am fine waiting for this  and make a big old bottles! ","score":5},{"user":"stevenv84","text":"Wow folks what a wonderful custard and a great mix.

Unsure how CAP SC has eluded me for so long, but I've mixed this many times subbing FW Sweet Cream, TFA Sweet Cream, FLV Sweet Cream, and CCW Cream with all good results, but now that CAP SC has arrived, I'll see what the creator truly intended.

Great body. The Fa premium paired with the holy vanilla work there magic where the inw custard brings that egg appeal creeping up to the texture and sweetness of the yellow cake. I can see why you used the tpa sweet cream and the cream cheese icing. need something to stand up to those bold custards and vanillas. Great choice.

I love how CCI gives a super slight sour note, while giving sweetness and mouthfeel here. It plays well with the sweetness of everything else. Holy vanilla is one of my favorite vanillas and I think the almost natural vanilla does a great job here. It doesn‚Äôt take over; it competes with the yellow cake and custard very well and lends to a great balance of everything. Great mix!
