Little research on the liquid and it looks like it's been discontinued ðŸ˜” which means I can't buy a bottle to compare My remix to but from what I remember this is incredibly close.\r\n\r\nSuper concentrate cappuccino- hands down best coffee flavoring I have come across so far. Really excited about this one recommend picking it up going to be using it in a few upcoming recipes that are in the works. Not to be confused with real flavors super concentrate.\r\n\r\nWhipped cream and sweet cream- these two come together for a great cream flavor, the perfect compliment for this coffee.\r\n\r\nButterscotch Ripple and caramel- using butterscotch because most caramels are lacking in that candy category. Adding an accent flavor of flavor art caramel helps give this combination of boost.\r\n\r\nSuper sweet and vanilla bourbon- both accents to help boost the candy profile and finish out this recipe. \r\n\r\n hope you enjoy.","steep_days":"14","temperature":"420","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-05T09:51:15.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"2726","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Cappuccino","vendor":"SC","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Whipped Cream","vendor":"FW","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Butterscotch Ripple","vendor":"FW","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Sweet Cream","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Super Sweet","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":500},{"name":"Bourbon (vanilla Bourbon)","vendor":"FA","millipercent":750},{"name":"Carmel (caramel)","vendor":"FA","millipercent":500}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"48952","name":"GQ Caviar remix"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
