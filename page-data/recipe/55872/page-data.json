It's undeniably strawberry, but strawberry and what is the question? Best I can describe it after a week steep as recommended is if someone took those strawberry candies that you get at grandma's (calling that the CAP strawberry taffy), dump em into a milkshake (the CAP VBIC), and then somehow turned it into a hybrid of custard and cheesecake (the rest of it). It's chock full of strawberry, dairy, and that pastry/bakery taste that says custard, but the slight sour note that screams cheesecake.&#xD;\n&#xD;\nWhile it is tasty and grows on you, it does leave a slightly muddled taste on my tongue. It...shifts, for lack of a better term between the four main tastes, leaving candy fake strawberry in sour custard with crust as what I take away overall. It's a shift from the normal strawberry and ____ profiles, and in a good way, but it does take getting used to.&#xD;\n&#xD;\nThis one's for people who really like the sour bite to their strawberry cheesecake, or want something that's familiar but different.&#xD;\n&#xD;\nNice one!"},{"user":"lmhobbs","score":"4","text":"Definitely a solid strawberry recipe but personally I'd leave the Super Sweet out- Just my .02. I think the percentages on the strawberries could all be toned down a little as well but thanks for putting this together :-)"}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"55872","name":"Strawtastic"}}}
