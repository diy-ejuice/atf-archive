I let it steep for 1 week and after 1 day of rda testing its going in a rta. I love this recipe. Very smooth, not too sweet, and the lemon flavor is just perfect. ","score":5},{"user":"VaperKitten","text":"This is an excellent recipe if you love Lemon Meringue Pie.  I didn't have everything so I substituted FA Biscuit for JF Biscuit and instead of Lemon Sicily I added extra CAP Lemon Meringue Pie and for the Vanilla Pudding I used TFA Meringue all at the same percentages.  Delicious, the flavor is strong enough to use in my Icare mini and I find that the coils are flavor poor but this taste great in it.   Love to all...Kim","score":5}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"47674","name":"Lemon Meringue Pie [Flavor Talk]"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
