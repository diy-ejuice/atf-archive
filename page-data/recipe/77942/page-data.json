There are so many different ways to play with this idea... Heavy on the banana, heafy on the raspberry? Light banana, with a touch of shisha strawberry for a syrupy feel to the raspberry?? I don't know.... I need your help. This one is going completely public use. Who cares if some sh***y company decides to rip it, they would either way. \r\n\r\nLet me know what you do with this. Let me know if you hate this, love this, or sold this recipe to a candy shoppe for a fat check. :) I hope you all get something from it.
