Also to ID10-T for being a sounding board for me when I got this going.  Yes there are a million ingredients, but that was necessary to maintain that complex mango profile and then introduce the rest of the ingredients in an attempt to turn it in to a parfait style dessert.  I think I have achieved that and what I experience is a nice fruitful mango inhale with a cream finish.  The bakery element is \"just\" there in the background for me and I will experiment with bringing this a little more forward, but I don't want it to be prominent.  The combination of CAP VC1 and Creamy Yoghurt makes for an exceptional light and creamy base that leaves a really creamy finish on my lips.  I really struggle with creams in vaping, I usually just get a dry Styrofoam sensation so if this is creamy for me, it should be great for other people.  The Creamy Yoghurt really cuts through the heaviness of the VC1 and masks the slight egginess of that flavour.  Could it be simplified... probably.  But I am really enjoying it the way it is right now.  Koolada is optional of course.  I hope that anyone who tries it enjoys it.","steep_days":"10","temperature":"0","recipe_score":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-12T03:44:17.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"1333","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Mango","flavor_id":"247","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Mango","flavor_id":"3516","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Sweet Mango","flavor_id":"120","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1250},{"name":"Costarica Special (mango)","flavor_id":"579","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Lime Tahity Cold Pressed","flavor_id":"581","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Vanilla Custard","flavor_id":"131","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Creamy Yogurt","flavor_id":"5","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Cookie","flavor_id":"490","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Sugar Cookie","flavor_id":"115","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Brown Sugar","flavor_id":"313","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":250},{"name":"Shisha Strawberry","flavor_id":"1711","vendor":"INW","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Koolada 10 Pg","flavor_id":"280","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":250}],"reviews":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"12573","name":"MOPAR"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
