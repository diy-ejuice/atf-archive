Fresh ideas and a better stash.\r\n\r\n(To anyone who suffered my old strawberry delight recipe, this is my apology)\r\n\r\nTo be begin with, I made a 10% dilution of FLV Alpine Strawberry with pg. Added 0.1g of that 10% dilution which equals out to 0.01% of actual flavor into my 10ml tester.\r\n\r\n4% tfa strawberry ripe really fills in the rest of the strawberry notes. It's also still my single favorite strawberry.\r\n\r\nNow, as for the cream and body, I went with a 1:1 FLV Cream and Marshmallow Vanilla which is good by itself but I found that it needed a bit of heaviness. Something to fill in the bottom. Custard really brought the more pudding-like cream that I really wanted for this.\r\n\r\nTime: To be honest, after mixing this up I forgot about it on the shelf. I finally remembered 12 days later. Protip: always write the date it was mixed up on the bottle because otherwise I wouldn't have known how long it had been there.","steep_days":"12","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"total_reviews":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T23:38:13.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"981","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Alpine Strawberry","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":10},{"name":"Strawberry (ripe)","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Cream","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Marshmallow Vanilla","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Vanilla Custard","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1500}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"170644","name":"L♡ve Trip"}}}
