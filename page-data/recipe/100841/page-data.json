The result is a deliciously creamy flan, topped with caramel.\r\n\r\nFA Fresh fig is by far the best FRESH fig flavor and is exactly what is says on the label - a freshly picked, ripe, fresh fig. This, slightly sweet, figgy goodness is given a little indulgent kiss by a drizzle of honey. The honey accents the fig and elevates its natural deliciousness to make you want more... \r\n\r\nAs FA Honey is more potent than kryptonite, I recommend ONE DROP per 30ml. Any more and it will overpower the mix. \r\n\r\nGive this baby 5 days to settle...\r\n\r\n*EDIT* I added 1% Liquid Amber to enhance the fig.\r\n","steep_days":"5","temperature":"0","recipe_score":4.8,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:50:09.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"2321","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Creme Brulee (yc)","flavor_id":"894","vendor":"INW","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Custard","flavor_id":"4210","vendor":"INW","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Fig Fresh","flavor_id":"518","vendor":"FA","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Honey","flavor_id":"531","vendor":"FA","millipercent":10},{"name":"Liquid Amber","flavor_id":"476","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000}],"reviews":[{"user":"NIL8","text":"I specifically made this as my FA Fig Fresh single test since I am super familiar with the other ingredients.  I had a feeling the amount of Custard and Creme Brulee were high for the concentration of Fig Fresh. Turns out, The balance for me is better with a third less Custard(2%) and Creme Brulee(1%) which helps the Fig from getting so lost.  Overall, the flavor was good and a change from the typical fruity custard types."},{"user":"NikosD","text":"Wow. This is not the flavour that i was expecting :) It has a very warm and smooth feeling and the fig feels like it is more in the background than the primary note. There is almost a maple/tree like feeling to it but in a very smooth way (this is the honey and the liquid amber I guess?). Very very enjoyable but I would like the fig to be more prominent."},{"user":"StormyParadise","text":"Just mixed, it tastes awesome right away, but in a few days I reckon it will taste even better, was looking for a fig flavor and found the best, I did not use the honey since I couldn't find it anywhere. But Overall a very balanced recipe and a delicious one for sure."},{"user":"MrZigglesworth","text":"I've been dabbling with FLV Fig myself and seeing this made me want to try out Fig Fresh. I have to say that I enjoy the flavor but like what wh1skeyk1ng said it's really the texture that makes this recipe. It's smooth, creamy, and the fig really just brings it all together in my opinion. Thanks for sharing this!"},{"user":"wh1skeyk1ng","text":"I enjoy this a lot better after a couple weeks when it comes together.  I bumped the honey up closer to 0.2% and it works well there.  I will say it isn't exactly a knockout in the taste dept, but what it lacks in flavor, it makes up for in mouth feel.  This is a well balanced recipe and true to its name.  The overall profile is light enough for ADV, not too sweet or rich, just enough to keep you coming back for more!"}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"100841","name":"Fab Fig Flan"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
