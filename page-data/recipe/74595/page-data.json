CAP Juicy Lemon for a deeper lemon flavor. Mixed RF Raspberry to TPA Raspberry Sweet to cut the candy raspberry a bit. TPA Dragonfruit and TPA Champagne for more dimension and wetness. FA Arctic Winter for the smooth mint flavor. CAP Super Sweet to of course make it sweeter and pull the fruits. WS-23 30% for that frozen effect. It is a great of the shake but better after a few days.  Came up with this one when I was sick and wanted a sweet/tart/fruity/cold/mint flavor that was easy on my throat.","steep_days":"2 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T23:36:05.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"1861","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"WS-23","vendor":"OTHR","millipercent":250},{"name":"Lemonade","vendor":"LA","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Juicy Lemon","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Raspberry (sweet)","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Raspberry â€“ SC","vendor":"RF","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Champagne Type (pg)","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Dragonfruit","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Aroma Arctic Winter (menthol Artic)","vendor":"FA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Super Sweet","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":500}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"74595","name":"Frozen Raspberry Mint Lemonade "}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
