FW Yogurt, CAP Creamy Yogurt and FA Madagascar Vanilla provide the backbone for a perfect yogurt base here. Feel free to change the fruit up in the recipe. In fact, I encourage you to experiment and come up with some wonderful versions of the yogurt. Here, I used my go-to combo of TPA Strawberry Ripe and JF Sweet Strawberry to achieve my desired fresh, but just sweet enough strawberries. Give the mix two weeks to fully steep.","steep_days":"14","temperature":"0","recipe_score":4.5,"total_reviews":2,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:49:10.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"1716","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Creamy Yogurt","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Madagascar (Vanilla Classic)","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Strawberry (ripe)","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Sweet Strawberry","vendor":"JF","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Yogurt","vendor":"FW","millipercent":4000}],"reviews":[{"user":"Zany","score":"4","text":"This recipe got me through a week of being sick ..&#xD;\n&#xD;\nSomehow this was the only thing I could vape that didn't taste weird - Only got better as I got better!&#xD;\nStrawberry does fade a little, but that's just what TPA Strawberry (ripe) does.&#xD;\n&#xD;\nHad to order FA Madagascar specially for this, and I'm glad I did!"},{"user":"thefogvlog","score":"5","text":"YAASSSSS - Banger! This is the best Strawberry Yogurt I have tasted, also has one of my favorite strawberries in - it just works. CAP Creamy Yogurts does not have such a heavy tang to it, so its a good introduction into yogurts. This reminds me of a High End Strawberry Drinking Yogurt - Great stuff. Thanks for this one!"}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"34948","name":"Strawberry Yumgurt"}}}
