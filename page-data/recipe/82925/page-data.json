My suspicion was the EM had a lot to do with it, so I set out to make this recipe without any EM and minimal Marshmallow flavoring added\r\n\r\nAs it stands this is a very refreshing, creamy, smooth, Peppermint forward eLiquid recipe that I can easily vape all day\r\n\r\nTPA Peppermint is a much stronger and better tasting Peppermint IMHO - I tried different levels and settled on this as the best, but YMMV\r\nFW Creme De Menthe reinforces and brings longevity to the Peppermint flavor\r\nCAP Simply Vanilla adds a very light vanilla creamy note to the recipe\r\nCAP Vanilla Whipped Cream, FA Meringue, and CAP Sweet Cream produces a very full, creamy, and smooth initial exhale to the vape.\r\nTPA Marshmallow is used for sweetness with little to no Marshmallow flavor\r\n\r\nI found steeping this for 5 days minimum works the best to smooth out the peppermint and raise the cream up","steep_days":"5","temperature":"0","recipe_score":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-10T16:00:30.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"1101","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Peppermint","flavor_id":"283","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Marshmallow","flavor_id":"332","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Meringue","flavor_id":"530","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Vanilla Whipped Cream","flavor_id":"1","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Simply Vanilla","flavor_id":"111","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Sweet Cream","flavor_id":"117","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Cr√àme De Menthe","flavor_id":"1266","vendor":"FW","millipercent":1000}],"reviews":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"82925","name":"P V & C V2"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
