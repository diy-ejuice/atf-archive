Steeped it for a week. It is very well balanced some recipes i have tried with FLV Yam the yam is alittle too powerful but this one the cream and yam ratio is about perfect been vaping on it for 2 days straight and still havenâ€™t got tired of it which is pretty rare for me excellent job and thanks for sharing.
