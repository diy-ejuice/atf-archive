The flavorings in this recipe work wonderfully to create this profile, HS Hazelnut Coffee and FA Up are the stars of this show and work really great in creating that authentic hazelnut coffee base. If you like your cream and sugar like I do, with a little bit of coffee in it lol then this is your new coffee vape. Thats why I have the combo of FW VBIC, CAP Horchata, and FW Creamy Hazelnut. These flavors work so well with the coffee base pumping in that super creamy and really sweet aspect that I love so much in the reference. If you like hazelnut coffee then this recipe nails that perfectly and you will definitely love this vape. So mix it up,(60/40) enjoy, post your thoughts and please rate.

The horchata adds the cinnamon and creaminess, the creamy hazelnut helps with this, and the vanilla bean ice cream adds an extra bit of sweetness with heavy cream. The hazelnut coffee gives the flavor I'd expect out of my coffee pot, and the up adds in the strong as hell dark damned near espresso-like coffee that makes this the good stuff. None of that underwhelming sucky after taste like you get at the joint with the mermaid on the cup.&#xD;\n&#xD;\nDamned good with my morning cuppa, or just at those times of day when I want coffee, but the caffeine would keep me up too long. This is a vape for those who love their coffee strong as hell, but still want some extra flavor, cos screw drinking it black. Easily an ADV, even with as decadently rich and bold it is.&#xD;\n&#xD;\nHoly freakin' Hannah, this is the good stuff!"}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"23523","name":"KRUCIAL HAZY COFFEE"}}}
