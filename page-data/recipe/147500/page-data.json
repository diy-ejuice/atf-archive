Topped with powdered sugar. \r\n\r\nTo create the sponge cake, i use **FW Creamy Sponge Cake** and **WF SC Angel Cake**. \r\nThe FW sponge cake is a great start, but needs more cake to help it out, as it is heavy on cream filling itself, so Angel Cake is a great addition to add that needed cake texture.\r\nTo really help with the cream inside theis roll, i use **VT Vanilla Cream**.  This flavor offers the perfect cream filling for this type of profile. \r\nThe jam/jelly is made with **FLV Jammy Berry** and **FLV Boysenberry**. These 2 combined create a delicious dark berry jam. \r\nTop this off with **OOO Powdered Sugar**\r\nJust yummy. Easily an all day vape. \r\n\r\n\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/user/frank1360","steep_days":"3","temperature":"475","recipe_score":5,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:50:52.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"2232","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Vanilla Cream","vendor":"VT","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Creamy Sponge Cake","vendor":"FW","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Angel Cake SC","vendor":"WF","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Powdered Sugar","vendor":"OOO","millipercent":500},{"name":"Jammy Berry","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":500},{"name":"Boysenberry","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":250}],"reviews":[{"user":"rougeislander401","text":"Excellent work!! Grabbed a few missing ingredients to make this and was glad I did. After about a 10 day steep I'm not getting a heavy sponge cake but I'm getting a nice creamy jammy berry/boysenberry with a light fluffy cake adding a bit of texture. I can certainly see myself mixing this again, thanks for all your work on here as I've enjoyed several of your recipes!"}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"147500","name":"Rolling in the Deep"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
