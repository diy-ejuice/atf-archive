At lower temperatures, it's a delightfully spicy tea with nutmeg and cinnamon, with the barest hints of creamer and green tea. At around 380F/40 watts, it's a very mellow chai tea with the barest hints of cinnamon with a splash of green tea and a goodly portion of vanilla creamer. Anything higher is a more watered down tea, so didn't enjoy that. That said, this is one hell of a tasty tea for those of us who like chai.&#xD;\n&#xD;\nNicely done!"}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"50608","name":"Turtle Hermit Tea"}}}
