Which just made it taste like citrus dishwasher soap with a shot of heavy licorice in it - NOT GOOD!\r\nSo I ended with the following:\r\n\r\n- CAP Licorice: 3.5%\r\n- TPA Marshmallow: 1.5%\r\n- FE Lemon: 1.5%\r\n- FA Meringue: 1.25%\r\n- FA Blood Orange: 0.75%\r\n\r\nI was very much against using sweetener in this, as I know CAP Licorice and sweetener doesn't always tango that well, plus I wanted to see if I could make a candy without any sweetener in it.\r\nI dropped the FE Lemon a bit to avoid the soapy flavor it potentially can add and brought in FA Blood Orange to help it. The Blood Orange also brings some of the sweetness I felt would fit a candy and 0.75% seems to be just right.\r\nBoth the marshmallow and meringue serves is the texture for the filling and helps the candy flavor on its way too.\r\n\r\nI feel this profile fits people who don't like black licorice that much, but also works as a great entry into the world of licorice vapes.\r\n\r\nI like it as SnV, but some people think it only gets better and better with some steeping - so it's up to you!\r\n\r\nFeel free to give it a mix and a review - even if you're a licorice hater <3\r\n\r\nEnjoy!","steep_days":"0 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"total_reviews":1,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:50:58.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"958","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Licorice","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":3500},{"name":"Marshmallow","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Lemon","vendor":"FE","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Meringue","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1250},{"name":"Blood Orange","vendor":"FA","millipercent":750}],"reviews":[{"user":"nowar","score":"5","text":"This is amazing. Yes, you have to like licorice a little. Off the shake, you get so much competition from the lemon and the licorice. I waited 3 weeks after that first week and boy have things changed! The orange now is prominent and my fear of curdled citrus is gone. It's as advertised: a citrus filled licorice rod. Simple but not plain. There's some creaminess that carries the citrus very well up front and the licorice just hangs around the whole thing to give a nice finish. This is a very pleasant vape if you even think you might like licorice at all. I might start here as your first foray if you've even considered it at all. High five stars for an enjoyable vape!"}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"153453","name":"Citrus Filled Licorice Rod"}}}
