I'm doing the jam monster thing and releasing this with the strawberry jello, let's call it the jello monster, if you will. I was playing around with the custard layer and found that quite a few fruits worked with this layer.  \r\n\r\nFA Custard = FA Custard Premium\r\n\r\nThe Custard:\r\nI wanted more if a dairy custard and TFA Vanilla Swirl was perfect to bring in a milk like quality into the mix with the vanilla notes that I needed. FA Custard Premium is perfect for the buttery quality of custard and INW Custard adds the richness and egginess that I needed.\r\n\r\nThe Peach Mango Jello: \r\nJF honey peach is the king of peaches and works perfectly with FLV the king of mangos to create a really great candied peach and mango. Swedish fish is used low to help create a jello sensation and doesn't add too much to the taste of Swedish fish.\r\n\r\nSuper sweet is optional. What can I say, it tastes commercial now.\r\n","steep_days":"10","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-06T22:02:24.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"2027","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Custard","vendor":"FA","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Custard","vendor":"INW","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Vanilla Swirl","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Swedish Fish Type","vendor":"FW","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Honey Peach","vendor":"JF","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Mango","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Super Sweet","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":500}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"80974","name":"Peach Mango Jello Custard"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
