Creamy and sweet. This is flavor-bending in action, mind-blowing execution from a master on ELR. Amy is on point, as usual.\r\n\r\nThis was my ADV for many months. Needs 24 hours to bloom and homogenize. The timeframe is about 3 weeks before the FLV ingredients start to fade. All credit to the BRILLIANT mixer \"Amy***\" from ELR. Hope to see her posting on ATF soon.","steep_days":"1 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"total_reviews":2,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:48:41.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"3985","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Ethyl Maltol","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Marshmallow","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Meringue","vendor":"FA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Pink Candy","vendor":"RF","millipercent":5450},{"name":"Strawberry","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1250},{"name":"Strawberry (ripe)","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Strawberry Milkshake","vendor":"RF","millipercent":2900}],"reviews":[{"user":"BigRed","score":"5","text":"this is more of a pink starburst the red ones are cherry .."},{"user":"CavemanOu2","score":"none","text":"Just mixed this and it's pretty good on a shake and vape give you another shout out in a day or two"}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"3934","name":"Pink Starburst (by ELR Amy***)"}}}
