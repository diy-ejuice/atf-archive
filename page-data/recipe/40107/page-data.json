Also bumped the BNB up a percent because the custard and cheesecake tend to overpower it as steeping progresses.\r\n\r\nWunderbar means wonderful in German. \r\n\r\nThis recipe was developed by me and one of my coworkers who does not use any website to post recipes, but I should state that this was originally her idea, so credit goes to the both of us. \r\n\r\nThis is a Banana Nut Bread Pudding recipe. \r\n\r\nNotes: \r\n\r\nTPA Banana Nut Bread 2.5% - obviously with this being a banana nut bread pudding recipe, we needed a good banana nut bread to do so. We landed on 2.5% because we wanted enough of this flavor to be prominent without stealing the entire show, with this also being a pudding. \r\n\r\nLA New York Cheesecake 5% - This does most of the \"pudding\" aspect of the recipe. Honestly we only had LA at the shop and I originally wanted to go with CAP but this still works very well. \r\n\r\nLA Creamy Caramel 1% - This is a VERY dark flavoring and when used at higher percentages it tends to turn the recipe into tasting like a burnt coil. However, at 1% it almost acts as the \"crust\" on banana nut bread - slightly sweet and carmelized. Could sup for FA Carmel. \r\n\r\nSuper Sweet - we both have a sweet tooth so obviously this is subjective and can be omitted if necessary, but SS is my favorite sweetener to use so that's why we used it. \r\n\r\nTFA VBIC 4.5% - This just kind of adds to the \"pudding\" aspect. I find that it helps to add a little more \"dairy\" to the pudding and just helps to make the pudding more creamier. I don't get the \"pepper\" taste from TFA VBIC, but you could totally sub for CAP. \r\n\r\nCAP Vanilla Custard 2% - This is what completes the \"pudding.\" I didn't want so much of it so that the pudding wouldn't taste \"eggy,\" but I knew it had to be there for it to be more think and provide the body for this recipe. I am using v1 in this recipe and I wouldn't recommend you to use v2 and it tends to make recipes taste more \"buttery\" and we don't want butter in our pudding. \r\n\r\nSo there you go! This is the first iteration of this recipe and I do plan on tweaking it in the near future with more familiar ingredients, but please let me know what you think, I'd love some feedback! \r\n\r\nI am currently vaping this after a 4 day steep but we did shake and vape and it was still good, just obviously needs some time for those creams to meld together.

But this is very nice. Nice and rich. And the banana is just subtle enough in there that I don't taste the fake banana taste in BNB. Really enjoying it and mixed up a bigger batch to keep in rotation. Thanks a million for sharing the recipe! And it's great with coffee, which is a must."},{"user":"TheJuiceJackBuilt","text":"Really tasty banana puddingy goodness. Been in my rotation for a month now, love it. "},{"user":"horizonism","text":"Awesome work. It works as a SNV, but a two week steep really hammers it home. Tastes scary accurate to the picture. I get a perfectly sweet banana nut bread, drowned in a caramel-vanilla ice cream sauce. The caramel adds a dark sweetness that marries beautifully with the BNB. In future mixes, I might consider scaling back the NYCC and VBIC just a touch, as there's some very slight off notes that I catch every few pulls. Regardless, this is an awesome recipe. Wunderbar! "},{"user":"piggymonster","text":"Mixed on 7/4/18 and just vaped this week. This is one of, if not the, best recipes I've made from ATF. Really amazing after a good steep. Thanks for sharing it, I'll definitely be keeping it in rotation. "},{"user":"Deftohms","text":"This recipe is absolutely delicious. Amazing off the shake and somehow better over time. Thank you for this!!!"},{"user":"Cmnderb","text":"Mixed this 3/11/18 and just broke it out today.  Mixed recipe without any substitutions.   It is wonderful.  Smooth, creamy and BNB is right on point.  Moist and delicious. Thanks to you both for sharing this 5 star recipe!!!!!  A keeper for sure."},{"user":"QueerYourVape","text":"I really enjoy this recipe. Compared to all the other recipes using TPA Banana bread that I have tried, it i not dry and that makes it so good. I love the idea of the caramel and the ice cream taking this back to a pudding. You nailed this profile and made it such a lush, smooth banana bread vape, I enjoy it a lot and it's really hard to wait 2 weeks to vape this recipe. Thank you and your colleague for such a good recipe and all your hard work."},{"user":"cdaniell30","text":"This is easily a fall/winter ADV for me.  Great use of other ingredients to take the edges off the BNB to enhance rather than screw up its flavor profile."},{"user":"Highwind","text":"My man killed it with this one! The description is spot on, I mixed with the updated ingredients and I actually had to sub in TFA Caramel Original but I don't think it messed with the integrity of the recipe because I'm still getting that caramalized banana bread crust feel. &#xD;\nThe pudding aspect is definitely on point, I love pairing VBIC and NYCC, throw in Vanilla Custard and you have the trifecta of awesome creams and at these percentages the pudding texture and flavor and mouthfeel are on point, AND THATS JUST ON THE SNV!!&#xD;\nKiller recipe, 5 stars, much love to you and your coworker! ✌️"}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"40107","name":"Wunderbar"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
