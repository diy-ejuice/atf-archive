Nice work gentlemen."},{"user":"Slushy","text":"I'm really enjoying this recipe it's well executed and thoroughly thought out I watched the episode of this recipe because I wanted to learn more about mixing on a elevated level.  Well done I did make one minor change of adding FA premium custard in substitute of TPA and added Flavorah butterscotch @ .5% to boost up the Recipes butterscotch note on a second batch.."},{"user":"Deftohms","text":"Vaping MTL on a Kayfun lite 2019, around 3.8v. This recipe is really good. It’s a great base to build on and tastes great by itself. I don’t get pepper or anything off tasting at all, but I’m vaping it MTL. I add 1.5% VT Chocolate Mousse to this for a delicious and balanced chocolate tobacco. I’ve also had really good, if not better results from using ID10-Ts chocolate trio from raven in this. Now I have to buy a huge bottle of native tobacco, because this recipe proved that was the solution to most of my desert tobacco problems. I believe Max said that FLV native in conjunction with other flavors will tend to stay a lot dryer than the other flv tobaccos, which keeps the recipe from being too “moist”, which is 9/10 times the problem. Thank you all for this awesome mix!"},{"user":"ID10-T","text":"Adding to what others have already said about this one, I'm one of those who gets some pepper taste from TFA Vanilla Custard. Not as much as their Vanilla Bean Ice Cream or White Chocolate, but still, pepper. But I decided to mix this one up anyway; I needed something I could shake up Saturday morning and take to a wedding Saturday night, and couldn't decided whether I wanted tobacco or custard. I still get the slightest bit of pepper from this, but rather than ruining the mix, it fits right in with the Turkish tobacco. I love the bolder tobacco on top, the vanilla coming in and building, the very rich and thick creamy vanilla custard inside, and then the caramel-coated tobacco finish, and so did everyone at the wedding who asked to try some. Thanks for giving me a use for that TFA Vanilla Custard! "},{"user":"nowar","text":"I mixed up a 30 of this and easily killed 15 in the first week. And I'm glad I did. at around one week it starts to change and gets a spiciness to it that isn't bad at all but is just different. if you do mix this up, I highly recommend mixing enough for you to vape straight away lasting to at least one month. This was my experience and I preferred it with less strong tobacco taste (which is weird for me since I prefer strong tobacco tastes usually) and feel like the creaminess balanced with the tobacco was spot on from the beginning. The fact that it changes is a total plus also because it becomes a sort of contemplative vape where you will be returning back to over and over rather than it fading or slowly shifting off balance. "},{"user":"Bonezmcnasty","text":"I'm really digging this one! I ordered what I was missing to mix this, and was not disappointed. The Native, and Turkish are spot on in this mix; while the Vanilla Ruyan Custard, and Vanilla Custard bring a nice thickness. I plan on mixing another 60ml bottle very soon! Thanks guys!"},{"user":"MECH_MOD_RN","text":"New to mixing with  tobaccos so excited to give this tobacco  introduction type mix a try.   on the inhale I get a lovely sweet thick cream   with moderate  middle vanilla notes    that moves to  sweet  slightly dry  peaty / earthy tobacco note   on the  exhale finish .  I did  not pick up  much in the way  of any butterscotch / caramel  notes I  was looking for .    I  am really enjoying this as it is well balanced  but  for my personal  taste  I would like  would like a little more of that caramel note on  the finish for a ry4 themed mix.  I tasted this in a drop  with tri core aliens at 60 watts  and in a  Citadel tri core  allien at 50 watts ...  week steep   well done   all    "}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"134966","name":"RY4 Custard | Developed"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
