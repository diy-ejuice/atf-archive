The yoghurt isn’t entirely necessary but it adds an additional layer of complexity to take the base from good to magnificent...\r\n\r\nMB Panna Cotta is described as a “Creamy and soft panna cotta dessert with soft cream and hint of raspberry and a touch of vanilla” which perfectly surmises this gem. I picked up an unexpected nutty/malty note which keeps this from being flat but may take some by surprise. Although the malty note is not unpleasant, it may not fit into delicate recipes where a true, plain panna cotta is the desired profile. In this recipe however, it adds depth and marries beautifully with the dark & earthy berry layer. \r\n\r\nI added a smidgen of FW Yoghurt to cut through the creaminess and add a bit of ‘zing’ to the Panna cotta base. This can be omitted if you prefer a fuller, creamier vape but I  believe the two compliments one another perfectly.  \r\n\r\nThe fruit layer is not a new revelation, but this combo just works so stunningly, that it was the obvious choice as the crowning jewel to adorn our lionheart. \r\nThe hint of raspberry in the panna cotta is just enough to compliment the fruit combo and sits nicely in the background. \r\n\r\nWS23 optional at 0.25% to emulate a cold version, and works a treat here.\r\n\r\nThe cream needs at least 7 days to find its happy place. 2 weeks is better...\r\n\r\nRecipe development video here: https://youtu.be/VmDya_URceM\r\n","steep_days":"7","temperature":"0","recipe_score":4,"updated_at":"2020-12-12T17:12:35.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"1784","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Panna Cotta","flavor_id":"1561","vendor":"MB","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Yogurt","flavor_id":"1471","vendor":"FW","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Forrest Mix (forest Fruit Mix)","flavor_id":"453","vendor":"FA","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Harvest Berry","flavor_id":"69","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":2000}],"reviews":[{"user":"rougeislander401","text":"So I dont even remember the last time I had panna cotta (or if ever) so I cant really speak to the authenticity, what I will say is this is a nice change up on my typical favorite mixed dark berries and cream advs, this is a nice simple recipe that I believe accomplishes what it's set out to do.
