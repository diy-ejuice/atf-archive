This one is just a simple Cornish vanilla ice cream, served in a wafer cone. I suppose you could add some ws-23 for some added authenticity, but I've never really been one for cold vapes.\r\n\r\nThis recipe also serves as a great base to add your favourite toppings. Got a favourite strawberry combo? Pop it in. Mint choc-chip anyone? Sure why not.
