In all my recipes I tell everyone to tweak it to there liking , but please do not do that to this one, it is perfecto, any tweaking might not get what is here. It is not HEATH bars, as you might think, but does give a heath note on the back end. The banana plays so well with caramels and toffee. After you try this, it will open the doors for other good recipes to tweak, add on, blend etc. ","steep_days":"3","temperature":"0","recipe_score":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-12T01:41:55.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"1106","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Banana Cream","flavor_id":"210","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Caramel Candy","flavor_id":"1233","vendor":"FW","millipercent":750},{"name":"Creamy Caramel","flavor_id":"8788","vendor":"PUR","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Sweetness","flavor_id":"4413","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":150},{"name":"Toffee","flavor_id":"4425","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":150},{"name":"Toffee Ice Cream","flavor_id":"8987","vendor":"VT","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Vanilla Swirl","flavor_id":"189","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1000}],"reviews":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"136194","name":"MELT"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
