Real Flavors Bread Pudding is an awesome concentrate and perfectly replicates the dessert. At 2.25% with 3% Capella Vanilla Custard make a really thick mouth feel and the .5% of Hangsen Caramel Toffee sweetens the mix beautifully. I know the custard lovers will be loving this. Mix it, enjoy it, rate it, and mash that star to follow ya boy. \r\n                                         ,Thanks KRUCIAL ","steep_days":"7","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T23:35:33.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"2778","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Bread Pudding 2 â€“ SC","flavor_id":"7462","vendor":"RF","millipercent":2250},{"name":"Vanilla Custard","flavor_id":"131","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Caramel Toffee","flavor_id":"2121","vendor":"HS","millipercent":500}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"41014","name":"{{{Bread Pudding Custard}}}"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
