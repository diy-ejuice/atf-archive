This flavor adds a good amount of sweetness so I didn't feel I needed to add any more. What it lacks is a bit of density. I used FLV Vanilla Pudding at 1% to fill out the maple bar with some rich buttery goodness that I would expect from a doughnut.\r\n\r\nI initially thought I might put a little dilution of FLV Rich Cinnamon in here but decided against it as I thought it would distract from the mix. Its great the way it is, its nice and delicate and I didn't want a bold flavor like that in there. Let me know what you think. Should I have added the cinnamon?\r\n\r\nWatch the Video here:\r\n\r\nhttps://youtu.be/BhV_3z_Ncuk","steep_days":"7","temperature":"0","recipe_score":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-12T10:16:35.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"715","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Eggnog","flavor_id":"4396","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1700},{"name":"Cream","flavor_id":"604","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Maple Bar","flavor_id":"4378","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1200},{"name":"Vanilla Pudding","flavor_id":"4433","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1000}],"reviews":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"206141","name":"Holiday Cheer #DevelopedFLV"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
