This, slightly sweet, figgy goodness is given a little boost with the help of Liquid Amber. This just accents the fig and elevates its natural deliciousness to make you want more...\r\n\r\nINW Sesame adds that little something something which makes this truly special.  The Sesame is lightly sweet and brings a earthy and nutty element to the mix which perfectly compliments the fig. Sesame is a departure form the traditional nut variants - a bit more sophisticated and refined nut accent.\r\n\r\n***FA Custard is FA Custard Premium\r\nINW Creme Brulee and FA Custard Premium is the foundation here and combines beautifully to create a thick, dense custard finished with a decadent layer of caramized sugar. I have chosen FA Custard Premium as the new \"cap killer\" contender, and rightfully so! This stuff is amazing and I'm afraid I do not have enough descriptive words other than that it is a f*&ing awesome custard!!!\r\n\r\nGive this at least a week to steep, 2 weeks better...\r\n\r\nEnjoy!\r\n","steep_days":"7","temperature":"0","recipe_score":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-10T16:00:25.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"1568","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Fig Fresh","flavor_id":"518","vendor":"FA","millipercent":3500},{"name":"Sesame","flavor_id":"2202","vendor":"INW","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Liquid Amber","flavor_id":"476","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Creme Brulee (yc)","flavor_id":"894","vendor":"INW","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Custard","flavor_id":"484","vendor":"FA","millipercent":4000}],"reviews":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"77933","name":"Figaro #DMC Challenge"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
