If the pallete needs a break from peppery or harsh strawberry creams. you'll absolutely adore this mellow velvety mix. It's a soft, subtle, light velvet strawberry vanilla cream. \r\n\r\nJF Strawberry Sweet and FA Red Touch make up a bright bold strawberry that after a week, blends into the cream giving a slight toffee note. \r\n\r\nBy sheer coincidence, the strawberry cream in this recipe tastes exactly like the strawberry on a pocky stick. Hence the name, Strawberry Pocky Cream.\r\n\r\nThis recipe ticks all the boxes so get stuck in and indulge! \r\n\r\nP.S.  FA Meringue and FLV Cream were added to the original recipe.  \r\n","steep_days":"3 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T22:32:29.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"1537","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Cream","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Cream Fresh","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Vanilla Whipped Cream","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Vanilla Ice Cream","vendor":"LB","millipercent":4500},{"name":"Meringue","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Red Touch (strawberry)","vendor":"FA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Strawberry Sweet","vendor":"JF","millipercent":3500}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"71164","name":"Strawberry Pocky Cream"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
