My first public shared recipe. In its current state, it has taken me over 13 revisions. Nothing should be subsituted. \r\n\r\nI have always steeped the recipe for 2 weeks. I prefer all my recipes 30/70 pg/vg because it gives a certain sweetness and thick mouth feel. Some times I have added no more than 1% tfa sweetener, but it is still very sweet for me without. \r\n\r\nIf you give this a try, I appreciate all feedback.","steep_days":"2","temperature":"0","recipe_score":4.3,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:48:44.000-05:00","best_vg":"80%","views":"2452","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Cinnamon Danish Swirl","flavor_id":"35","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Cinnamon Roll","flavor_id":"1249","vendor":"FW","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Sugar Cookie","flavor_id":"115","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Vanilla Custard","flavor_id":"131","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Vanilla Bean Ice Cream","flavor_id":"186","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Bavarian Cream","flavor_id":"145","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Shisha Vanilla","flavor_id":"841","vendor":"INW","millipercent":750},{"name":"Brown Sugar","flavor_id":"313","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":750}],"reviews":[{"user":"KenWhitfield","text":"Very nice, clean vape. It's light easy to vape without over stimulating the taste buds."},{"user":"ghweiss","text":"this smelled so good after mixing, it was almost impossible to wait 2 weeks to vape, but i'm glad i did. absolutely delicious and decadent, very well rounded. the grainy brown sugar really brings out the cinnamon, and the soft cookie really brings out the \"roll\" (of the 2 cinnamon roll flavorings). beneath that layer is creamy melted vanilla ice cream. excellent job!"},{"user":"Mixepic","text":"I'm unfamiliar with Sopapilla casserole so I don't know what the reference tastes like. However, this is a well put together recipe. After 2 weeks it blends into a nice creamy cinnamon with the cream being dominant. On the exhale I get dough or bakery notes. Being unfamiliar with the reference I have no suggestions, as is it's a really good vape. Good work.    "},{"user":"ID10-T","text":"This tastes terrific! It's like a fresh sopapilla tossed in cinnamon &amp; brown sugar and then topped with vanilla ice cream. Very complex and hits all the right notes after steeping for 15 days. I wouldn't suggest changing a thing. I've been meaning to try to make a sopapilla cheesecake vape that would be a simpler profile (based on a culinary recipe that's just canned crescent rolls, cream cheese, vanilla, cinnamon, and sugar) and will probably steal liberally from this when I do. But in the meantime, I need to get some more of this in the steeping drawer because it is delicious. Thanks Myztik!
