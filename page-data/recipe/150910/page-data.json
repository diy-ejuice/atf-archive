It is indeed a strawberry pina colada gummy candy. I did not really think all four of those notes (strawberry, pineapple, coconut, and especially gummy candy body) would play well at 25mg nic salt 50/50 VG/PG in my Caliburn but they absolutely do, perfectly. I'm a little worried that 1% CAP Super Sweet is going to tank my pod very fast and thinking maybe I should have used a little less instead of following the recipe exactly, but I haven't gone through enough yet to have regrets. Just had to go ahead and leave a review about how well this fairly simple recipe delivers the flavor.
