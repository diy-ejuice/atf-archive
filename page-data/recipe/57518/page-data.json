For me, it's a very satisfying vape . . . sweet, savory, warm, and slightly floral.  I mixed up 30mL, shook it like hell, and let it rest for 24 hours before trying it.  It will be interesting to see what happens as this continues to age . . . as it stands, I'm thinking I should mix up another because this bottle may not last long enough to find out. \r\nMuch respect to ENYAWREKLAW and ID10-T for the exceptional resources they provide to the DIY community!\r\n\r\nGreen Hummingbird quick notes . . . dropped honeysuckle and Holy Vanilla percentages . . . switched FA Coco' to TPA Coconut Candy.  Added Basil and Green Tea . . . will probably adjust both a bit higher.","steep_days":"1 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:49:30.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"1371","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Sweet Rice","flavor_id":"7727","vendor":"FE","millipercent":5000},{"name":"Meringue","flavor_id":"530","vendor":"FA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Vanilla Swirl","flavor_id":"189","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Honeysuckle (pg)","flavor_id":"306","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Cream","flavor_id":"604","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Holy Vanilla","flavor_id":"2385","vendor":"DFS","millipercent":750},{"name":"Cream Fresh","flavor_id":"540","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Green Tea","flavor_id":"1640","vendor":"FE","millipercent":600},{"name":"Coconut Candy","flavor_id":"223","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Basil","flavor_id":"4387","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":500}],"reviews":[{"user":"Seef","text":"Unfortunately I don't have basil, but I couldn't wait to try it out. And it is already awesome. I guess the basil would brighten the green tea, so I will try that next month with my next order. But do try this one out. It is creamy, slightly floral, and a nice rice base and green tea accent. I love it. Thank you for sharing this recipe.
