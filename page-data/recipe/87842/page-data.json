After that, I thought a bit of FA Custard Premium creaminess would pair well with the earthiness of the yam and tobacco, as well as, thickening up the butter pecan pie flavor.  Added a little Holy Vanilla to give it next level holiness . . . finished off with a sprinkling of Rich Cinnamon.  \r\n\r\nThis has become a rich, baked, sweet potato custard with a little bit of cinnamon sugar to spice up the earthy tobacco undertones.  Mixed at 60vg/40pg . . . aside from Shyndo's Black Forest Bacco in the morning with coffee (seriously . . .go mix this stuff up: https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/87014#black_forest_bacco_by_shyndo ), this is all I've been vaping since I mixed it.","steep_days":"1 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-05T05:16:39.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"1177","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Yam","flavor_id":"8575","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Butter Pecan Pie","flavor_id":"6044","vendor":"WF","millipercent":3000},{"name":"HOLY HOLY GRAIL RY4","flavor_id":"5037","vendor":"DFS","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Native Tobacco","flavor_id":"4393","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Holy Vanilla","flavor_id":"2385","vendor":"DFS","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Rich Cinnamon","flavor_id":"638","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":200},{"name":"Custard Premium","flavor_id":"9118","vendor":"FA","millipercent":2000}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"87842","name":"Holy Yam"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
