I've been mixing for RTAs recently, so this is made to be used in a single coil RTA (I use a HotCig Centaur). Sub FA cookie in for PUR Cookie if you want, I just ran out. \r\n\r\nI like using FA Torrone and Marzipan in lighter cookie recipes because the nougat and slight nutty notes they bring definitely help add a bit of a crunch/snap no matter how light your cookie base is. Here, my cookie base is PUR Cookie (FA Cookie is also an excellent one to use, probably my favorite for any wafer profile) and TFA Graham Cracker. I went with the tried and true TFA Strawberry + Strawb Ripe combo, even though it's difficult for me to taste sometimes. It's just a good strawberry flavor. In order to help keep it apparent in the mix I kept everything else low. Dragonfruit is simply there for its emulsifying properties and to help the strawberry from disappearing on me. I debated using Toasted Marshmallow because I didn't want to introduce too much EM into the mix but it's almost necessary to keep a nice airy wafer profile and fluff up that filling. FA Vienna Cream is also fantastic if you're after a nice fluffy cream filling.\r\n\r\nHonestly it's vapeable after about 7-10 days, but for some reason I can't taste strawberries for shit unless they steep for like a month. After about 3 weeks it comes together perfectly and the strawberries and creams turn into that gooey strawberry cream inside of a wafer.\r\n\r\nIt's a profile that's been done a million times over but nothing ever really hit the spot for me. Although in the ballpark, this still isn't 100% what I want. But that could just be down to how difficult it is for me to taste strawberries. \r\n","steep_days":"21","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-05T19:50:21.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"1079","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Torrone","flavor_id":"550","vendor":"FA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Marzipan","flavor_id":"467","vendor":"FA","millipercent":750},{"name":"Cookie","flavor_id":"7752","vendor":"PUR","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Graham Cracker Clear","flavor_id":"325","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Strawberry (ripe)","flavor_id":"271","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Strawberry","flavor_id":"272","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Toasted Marshmallow","flavor_id":"340","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Dragonfruit","flavor_id":"226","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":300},{"name":"Vienna Cream","flavor_id":"516","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"107520","name":"Gastronomical Proportions"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
