While I have tried many versions of this profile over the years I was yet to slice open the perfect combination to suit this princess warrior. It was worth the fight though.\r\n\r\n-Molinberry Cookie Bite has recently changed the game for cookie profiles and this recipe simply isn't worth anything without it. It offers the perfect cookie with just a hint of chocolate that makes the base of this profile amazing. \r\n\r\nMolinberry Glamour Chocolate coats the cookie perfectly here because it is a full chocolate that not only offers brilliant flavor and texture, it also helps to fill out the vape a lot here where as a lot of other chocolates seem to thin and need support in my experienced opinion. \r\n\r\n- Nailing down the perfect mint creme center is not as easy as it seems because it needs to balance and come through the middle of the cookie and chocolate. Thank you to Simon aka WOFTAM for suggesting to me to try Cap Cool Mint because I never would of thought to try that flavour in this profile. When paired with the LA CCI and a kiss of FW Creme De Menthe it totally works and to my palette it is amazingly authentic. \r\n\r\nCreating a profile like this that is seemingly simple yet challenging while also getting maximum definition of flavour with a small amount of ingredients here is the key here for sure. It's a battle that this little princess warrior is proud of and hope you all enjoy the success from this fight that has finally been won !\r\n\r\nSlice open your concentrates, mix this up and let me know what you think! Most of all, enjoy the journey and the battles of mixing because the victories are well worth it in the end! \r\n\r\n\"Together, Let's Discover!!!\"\r\n\r\nFacebook - https://www.facebook.com/groups/diydownunder/\r\nDiscord - https://discord.gg/kH4Fqbc\r\nYoutube - https://www.youtube.com/c/diydownunder\r\nWebsite - https://www.diydownunder.com/\r\nInstagram IGTV : @diydownunder\r\n\r\nI enjoyed this at 65W on a WOTOFO Recurve RDA\r\n\r\nMinimum Steep 3 days, best after 5 days yet shake and vapable.","steep_days":"5","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T02:17:03.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"1447","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Cookie Bite","vendor":"MB","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Cool Mint","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Cream Cheese Icing","vendor":"LA","millipercent":250},{"name":"Cr√àme De Menthe","vendor":"FW","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Glamour Chocolate","vendor":"MB","millipercent":5000}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"147551","name":"Sliced"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
