Apparently I nailed it on the first attempt and this is now my most requested juice by friends and colleagues.  I never liked the candies... because I don't like candy, never have, but I like this juice :-)\r\n\r\nThe base is provided by the Vanilla Swirl, Butter Cream and Sweet Cream.  It's kind of a creamy/fruity candy.\r\n\r\nThe main profile is and always has been a pineapple and raspberry blend.  I borrowed the core of this profile from another recipe on reddit, but apologies, it was so long ago I don't remember who it was to be able to give credit to.  Something to do with bubblegum maybe?\r\n\r\nTo round everything off and give it that juicy vibe, Cactus is doing what it does.\r\n\r\nSweetened up and making things pop is CAP Jelly Candy with a little EM.\r\n\r\nI hope you enjoy this refreshing fruity vape as much as my friends do.","steep_days":"5 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T00:06:59.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"1572","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Vanilla Swirl","flavor_id":"189","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Butter Cream","flavor_id":"3","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Cactus","flavor_id":"647","vendor":"INW","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Golden Pineapple","flavor_id":"61","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":600},{"name":"Pineapple","flavor_id":"809","vendor":"INW","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Pineapple","flavor_id":"259","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":400},{"name":"Raspberry","flavor_id":"667","vendor":"INW","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Raspberry (sweet)","flavor_id":"267","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Ethyl Maltol 10%","flavor_id":"2311","vendor":"OTHR","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Jelly Candy","flavor_id":"2170","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":250},{"name":"Sweet Cream","flavor_id":"183","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1000}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"19257","name":"Homecoming"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
