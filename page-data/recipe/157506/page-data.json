The cornbread works in a similar way and has the extra pro of adding a touch of dried/cooked corn to the whole thing really twisting it in the direction of a cereal... the meringue gives the “frosting” element here and finally FA milk and WF pastry cream provide the sweet silky milk.\r\n\r\nOptional dependant on taste: 0.3% AP (5%) for a more grainy cereal.\r\n\r\nAs always sweetener is subjective and is there purely for my tastes but I recommend it for a nice sweet cereal vape.\r\n\r\nIf you like this recipe and what I do then please rate and review.","steep_days":"7","temperature":"0","recipe_score":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-10T17:58:22.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"2251","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Meringue","flavor_id":"530","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Cream Filling SC","flavor_id":"10260","vendor":"WF","millipercent":750},{"name":"Cobbler (Berry) SC","flavor_id":"10258","vendor":"WF","millipercent":6000},{"name":"Lemon Squares SC","flavor_id":"10263","vendor":"WF","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Super Sweet","flavor_id":"2384","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":500},{"name":"Milk","flavor_id":"523","vendor":"FA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Corn Bread","flavor_id":"2007","vendor":"OOO","millipercent":2000}],"reviews":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"157506","name":"Super cereal"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
