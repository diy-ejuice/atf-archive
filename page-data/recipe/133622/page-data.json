This juice however is not harsh at all.  At 6% the mango is just right and the lemon lime is just there to enhance the profile.  No sweetener is needed.  The menthol and koolada are more on the exhale, if you want more coolness I would bump up the menthol, not the koolada.  This is not a shake and vape, I would give it at least 2 days to start coming together.","steep_days":"2","temperature":"0","recipe_score":4,"total_reviews":2,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:50:39.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"1740","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Sweet Mango","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":6000},{"name":"Menthol","vendor":"LB","millipercent":500},{"name":"Lemon Lime","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Koolada 10 Pg","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":500}],"reviews":[{"user":"RipAL","score":"none","text":"Good &amp; refreshing simple recipe.

I was pleasantly surprised by how fruity and well balanced this is, the lemon/lime isn't overpowering, it sits well in the mix as a foil to the sweetness of the mango.&#xD;\n&#xD;\nDay 3 this is much more well rounded, as the fruits have the edge taken off"}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"133622","name":"Simple Mango Menthol"}}}
