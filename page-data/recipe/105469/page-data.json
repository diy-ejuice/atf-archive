The fact that he is a great guy who is highly respected around the area of DIY as one of the founders was truly and honor to take up his suggestion. To suggest this to me with some sort of confidence that I could pull off a profile like this on the spot was daring to say the least lol. It;s Addy Tuney though, so I had to have a go. I'm actually really happy with this and how it came together. Look up my previous recipe \"MMM Maple Syrup\" as you will see this is what is included here in this recipe.  I really like the way WF Crepe at 1% supports the TFA Pancake here and as a base to work off, works well. I chose deeper/darker versions of the Strawberry and Blueberry here to really give a warm cooked feeling. To accent and add depth to the fruit was the VT Boysenberry that works so well.  The Caps Cinnamon Sugar really helps to add a little something to the pancake and compliments the overall recipe well with out taking over the recipe as some cinnamon flavors do, rather it sits at the back nicely. What an honor it was to create this, thank you Addy for laying down this challenge. I hope that not only you enjoy this but many people enjoy this recipe and maybe add a little cream,custard or ice-cream of your choice. Enjoy! :) \r\nsee it being created here: https://youtu.be/u-mdjAkuTP8?t=50m41s","steep_days":"7","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:50:14.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"3131","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Pancake","flavor_id":"4190","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Crepe SC","flavor_id":"8365","vendor":"WF","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Cinnamon Sugar","flavor_id":"8741","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Strawberry Sweet","flavor_id":"4745","vendor":"JF","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Blueberry Jam","flavor_id":"8837","vendor":"VT","millipercent":500},{"name":"Boysenberry","flavor_id":"8840","vendor":"VT","millipercent":500},{"name":"Carmel (caramel)","flavor_id":"503","vendor":"FA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Butterscotch","flavor_id":"495","vendor":"FA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Maple Syrup","flavor_id":"509","vendor":"FA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Golden Syrup","flavor_id":"8887","vendor":"VT","millipercent":1000}],"reviews":[{"user":"TamVapes","text":"This is just delicious!  The combination of the blueberry/boysenberry with your maple syrup stone added to the pancake base you did here. Is just delicious!  You did Addy Tuney Justice for sure.

Well done PIPPA well done!  "}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"105469","name":"Uncle Addys Pancakes "}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
