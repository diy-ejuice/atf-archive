I must say that I'm loving this one. Goes great with coffee and I've been enjoying this one throughout the day. Simple, rich, delicious. Works as a S&V, but obviously gets better with time. \r\n\r\nLB Belgian Waffle: Clearly the star of the show here. This one is absolutely legit. I knew I had to work with this one as soon as I smelled it. Great waffle flavor, certainly the best one that I've tried to date. \r\nFLV Milk & Honey/FA Maple syrup: Work together to create the syrup note. The FA maple syrup gives the authentic maple note. Milk & Honey has a certain dark sweetness that I can only describe as molasses. It lends some body and a dark base that fits perfectly. \r\nJF Bavarian Cream: One of my favorite creams to add a slightly dark sweetness, round out harsh edges and really pull flavors together. This one has become my Swiss Army knife. \r\nTfa Butter: I mean, c'mon. Who doesn't want butter on their waffle? Are you a communist? \r\n","steep_days":"3","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"updated_at":"2020-12-12T09:12:31.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"4454","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Belgian Waffle","flavor_id":"1478","vendor":"LB","millipercent":4500},{"name":"Milk & Honey","flavor_id":"609","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Maple Syrup","flavor_id":"509","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Bavarian Cream","flavor_id":"4466","vendor":"JF","millipercent":1250},{"name":"Butter","flavor_id":"147","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Sweetener","flavor_id":"339","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1000}],"reviews":[{"user":"MrBurgundy","text":"Bravo, McFly! I really like this one. What you did with Milk &amp; Honey and Maple Syrup is super interesting. It definitely added that syrup like consistency to the vape that is always missing with the maple flavors. I like how you let each flavor shine. It’s layered really well, and all of the aspects come through clearly. Thanks for sharing!","score":5},{"user":"CheebaSteeba","text":"Very nice waffle vape! It's got all the things I love and am looking for in this type of profile. LB Belgian Waffle carries that toasty savory bready base while the bav cream and milk &amp; honey bring in a decadent unctuous creamy base. Then add a touch of maple to your delicious breakfast treat. The sweetener I could have done without but I see why it's incorporated. Give this one a good steep as the flavors will mend together well over time.
