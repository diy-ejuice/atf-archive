I took the blue note of the sour blue raspberry and added my fav. Blueberry duo with a dash of lavender to add some depth.  I use a slash of lemon to make the bluberry pop.  It's excellent as a snv!!  It has a hint of flavor like those lavander candies.  This one is so delicious I can't put it down!!! Just give it a mix and you'll see why","steep_days":"1 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T19:15:27.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"1716","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Blue Raspberry Cotton Candy","flavor_id":"15","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Blueberry","flavor_id":"1201","vendor":"FW","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Blueberry (wild)","flavor_id":"215","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":5000},{"name":"Juicy Lemon","flavor_id":"79","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1250},{"name":"Lavender","flavor_id":"510","vendor":"FA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Sour Blue Raspberry Candy","flavor_id":"6061","vendor":"WF","millipercent":2000}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"93239","name":"Blue Lava"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
