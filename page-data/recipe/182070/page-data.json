It works wonderfully as a non-descript soft tropical flavor. It also makes great desserts (although I've seen it paired with fish before). It's creamy with a raw/ earthy sweet flavor. This is not a pastry sort of pie but more like a fruity custard pie in a graham cracker crust that was hand pressed with butter and sugar into the pan.\r\n\r\nIt's the wrong time of year for this fruit that naturally grows in the American Applachia as it's far too DISMAL outside ;).\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nVT Paw paw is nearly spot on for a real paw paw but far too soft so in order to bring it forward and make it a richer flavor over the creamy bit of the pie I brought in it's incomplete cousins to bolster it: Flv mango and wf cherimoya. The mango is sweet and bright whereas the cherimoya brings the rind and edge of the fruit with a slight bit of pineapple sweetness. To keep the smooth creamy flavor/texture a touch of flv vanilla pudding was used.\r\n\r\nThe crust is mostly flv graham cracker for the crust with a tiny bit of TPA CC (graham crust) that ties it in with the paw paw rather than sitting completely separate from the rest of the pie.","steep_days":"7","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"updated_at":"2020-12-12T20:31:30.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"654","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Paw Paw","flavor_id":"8936","vendor":"VT","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Mango","flavor_id":"3516","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":500},{"name":"Cherimoya SC","flavor_id":"10123","vendor":"WF","millipercent":250},{"name":"Vanilla Pudding","flavor_id":"4433","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":500},{"name":"Graham Cracker","flavor_id":"8554","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Cheesecake (graham Crust)","flavor_id":"152","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":250}],"reviews":[{"user":"ID10-T","text":"I don’t know why this is called Dismal. Nor why it is called pie. I don’t taste dismal or pie. I taste only intriguing tropical yumminess that does seem like it might be a little cooked, like the guts of a fried island pie, but not any actual pie crust. It tastes like mango and something else, like a guanabana and papaya maybe? Something really interesting and more-ish. Just funky enough. Sweet and dark with a little brown sugaryness or caramelization. Very thick and full, with a smooth creamy mouthfeel. Deeply satisfying vape.   ","score":5},{"user":"nowar","text":"This is a very unusual recipe I was fortunate enough to get to try in Mixer’s Club. I don’t really know how to describe the flavor as I’ve never actually had a paw paw, but this frankly has me dying to try one. The vape itself has a deep creaminess to it that backs up a tropical fruit vibe. Which fails completely to describe it, of course. There wasn’t a lot of actual ‘pie’ crust as much as a really interesting blend of flavors that creates a toasty (not the best word) background for the paw paw and the supports to play together. It’s an unusual mix that isn’t ‘weird’ for weird’s sake. It simply was unlike anything I’ve ever tasted. If you’re looking to try something new, this is it. Definitely no disappointment here kind of took me a sec to really get a grasp on it. By the time I did, 10ml was gone from this earth!","score":5}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"182070","name":"Dismal Pie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
