ADV!"},{"user":"mike369","text":"Fantastic!!! I've always been a fan of the original. This is even better."},{"user":"onimodaekil","text":"Absolutely love this, it's smooth and soft and sweet and everything I want from these flavorings"},{"user":"NikosD","text":""},{"user":"YippYo","text":"Just fantastic. Easily one of my favorite fruity recipes I've ever tried."},{"user":"ianerb","text":"And another good one, read reviews they are all correct on this profile"},{"user":"Ebc88","text":"Tasty stuff the citrus is balanced nicely. I don’t get any harshness, its just sweet enough not to get overbearing. Next time i mix this i am gonna add some ws-23 I believe the coolness would go great with the rest of the recipe"},{"user":"Deetzz","text":"I make sure I ALWAYS have this one around or at least steeping. To me personally its better than the OG. I think I am enjoying it more and more every time I mix it up, Very easy to vape all day long with each puff as good as the last. I also like to add some WS-23 to cool down those Hot summer days giving it a more Beach holiday vibe!"},{"user":"Seef","text":"It's more a remix than a clone. But it's better, because it's not as sweet. I could drink this. Give it 5 days to steep though. It goes to the next level. "},{"user":"Opalvapes","text":"It's amazing. I've never had the original from naked, but with this mix I don't need it. "},{"user":"Mr-G","text":"not too bad"},{"user":"Kudo","text":"Had the original Naked juice and I think this one is much better. I like to add 2% WS-23 to make it nice and refreshing, this is going to be an excellent summertime vape."},{"user":"QueerYourVape","text":"I love this recipe. I have a 120ml of it at all times, it's on of my ADV.  I love passion fruit in this mix, the guava shines, the tangerine supports the guava and the juicy orange perfectly. The dragonfruit is here to make this mix juicier, so is the orange, and I just can't stop vaping this thing. My favorite fruit/tropical recipe of all times. It might be a tad sweet in the beginning, but with time, that just become a smoothing agent. I really love this mix on its own, I've never had the original and I don't feel like I need to, now that I've had this."},{"user":"reasonably_dan","text":"love this recipe and its so very close to the original juice. i know you are about to do a remix again of this but people, dont let that stop you from mixing this one up. its a tropical blast! so refreshing and unique. a little harsh because of the orange juice aspect but i wouldnt change anything about this. it seems to have the sane acidity as a real glass of POG. 5/5 and more if i could give!"},{"user":"Jthectic","text":"Really juicy orange and passionfruit, guava as a background note that is boosted after a couple weeks steep. It's like taking a fresh swig of a tropical juice. Solid."},{"user":"KenWhitfield","text":"A very nice and refreshing vape. I can not do a comparison to the original, but I can give my thoughts on this particular recipe. For me, the orange is very prominent in this recipe and would like to taste a little less orange and a slight more dragonfruit and guava: very small tweek. I would recommend giving this recipe a try for any fruit and citrus fan. "},{"user":"Asire","text":"Tested in Hadaly with SS316 Fused Clapton 40AWG/28AWG:&#xD;\nNever had the original Hawaiian POG so no comparison here as well. Nevertheless this mix really brought me into fruity vapes. Upfront you get a sweet and vibrant Passion fruit flavor. If i pay more Attention to taste you really get how the orange and guava flavors blend into the Passion fruit and support it to a Point where you just cant stop vaping it. What impresses me the most is how two very harsh flavors for me (FA Passion fruit &amp; CAP Sweet Tangerine) are tamed here. Im really sensetive to throat hit but really NO harshness in this recipe. Thanks Wayne for making me able to vape FA Passion Fruit "},{"user":"iCGM","text":"I've never had the OG Hawaiian POG so I can't comment on how authentic it stays true to the OG, but this remix is da bomb, it really captures what I would imagine this flavour profile would taste like and is exactly what a REMIX should be! Such a delightful fruity vape, perfect for summer. Wayne, how you get so little reviews for some of your work is beyond me.  I felt the need to put a review up as I'm starting to make it a habit to review every recipe I mix, because reviews on any recipe are so crucial for the mixers and for the community.  Keep doing what you're doing, this recipe is bangin'.  "}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"51670","name":"Hawaiian POG Remix [#REMIXMOTNH]"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
