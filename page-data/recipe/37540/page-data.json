I then added a variation of @EdibleMalfunction 's blueberry holy trinity and a dash of FLV Rich Cinnamon.  It's quite a bit fuller than Dogma solo, and those blueberries do a great job of tasting like a baked in part of the pastry.\r\n\r\nStill 100% S&V certified, although if you let the AP settle in for a couple days the danish base gets a little more solid.\r\n\r\nIt's 10 ingredients, yes. But 5 of those ingredients are currently available [RIGHT HERE](http://www.bullcityflavors.com/dogma) from Bull City Flavors in one super convenient and dare I say, sexy, package.","steep_days":"3 (SNV)","temperature":"420","recipe_score":5,"updated_at":"2020-12-12T10:33:20.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"3709","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Marzipan","flavor_id":"1708","vendor":"INW","millipercent":500},{"name":"Catalan Cream","flavor_id":"483","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Hazel Grove (hazelnut)","flavor_id":"417","vendor":"FA","millipercent":250},{"name":"Zeppola","flavor_id":"6312","vendor":"FA","millipercent":750},{"name":"Whiskey","flavor_id":"1461","vendor":"FW","millipercent":750},{"name":"Acetyl Pyrazine","flavor_id":"1709","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":250},{"name":"Bilberry","flavor_id":"533","vendor":"FA","millipercent":250},{"name":"Blueberry","flavor_id":"1201","vendor":"FW","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Blueberry (extra)","flavor_id":"218","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Rich Cinnamon","flavor_id":"638","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":100}],"reviews":[{"user":"Philosaphucker","text":"This one wasn't on my radar at first, as I am not too into bakery vapes.

Phenomenal stuff, man.","score":5},{"user":"ID10-T","text":"Excellent recipe. Legit intricate cinnamon danish that comes together in just three days? That's a neat trick. Seems like it could even be a CAP Cinnamon Danish Swirl killer with just another 0.05 to 0.1% more Rich Cinnamon, without out the blueberries. But the blueberries are the star here. They really do taste deliciously baked into a fresh pastry. ","score":5}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"37540","name":"Loup Garou"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
