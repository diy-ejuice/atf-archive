I know this is a complex recipe. In fact, it's far more complex than I set out to make, but I am very pleased with the result. \r\n\r\nI wanted to make a vape that tasted like I was inhaling the heaven-bound soul of a cookie that had lived a fantastic life, and I feel like this is pretty close. \r\n\r\nWord of warning; avoid using sweeteners in this - it is sweet enough already, and the Cookie Butter, though amazing can gunk up your coils. Both together would probably make it even worse! \r\n\r\nYou can S&V with this, but I would give it a couple of weeks for it to be at its best. \r\n\r\nPlease mix, enjoy, and let me know what you think ðŸ˜Š.
