The apple filling by Flavorah is amazing giving you a cooked almost cinnamon apple.  The Red Apple by Flavorah boosts the apple filling because it needs support.  The cinnamon danish swirl is the crumb topping and at the same time lending a hand to the Butterscotch for the iced topping to seal the deal.  Off the shake the mix is a bit muddled but give it about 4-5 days and the apple fights it’s way to the front of the mix.
