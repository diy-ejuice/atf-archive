This is my tour de force, my ADV. I have been working on this recipe for about two months now, and I think that I've finally nailed it. \r\n\r\nFlavor Profile to Hit: A fresh NY Cheesecake topped with cinnamon glazed blueberries. \r\n\r\nFW Blueberry: A very sweet blueberry. This blueberry is bright and fresh.  In my opinion, this is the best blueberry to hold up to all of the creamy components of this recipe. FA Bilberry could probably also be used for it's darker blueberry notes, in a super low percentage. \r\nFA Bilberry: This blueberry is a little bit darker than most of the blueberry aromas out there, and it's addition in this recipe would add just a little bit more depth to it's FW cousin. The percentages have to be kept very low when working with this flavor, as it will completely drown out EVERYTHING in a mix. \r\nFLV Rich Cinnamon: I made a 1/10 dilution of this flavoring, but .05 is the percentage for the undiluted concentrate.\r\nCAP NY Cheesecake: The only cheesecake that came to mind during my initial planning phases, and this one is a complete winner! The thickness and mouthfeel are just right, while not completely overpowering the mix with it's sweetness. \r\nTFA Cheesecake (Graham Crust): This is being used to add a little more creaminess and mouthfeel to the CAP NY Cheesecake, as well as add to the graham notes of the TFA Graham Cracker Clear.\r\nCAP Vanilla Custard v1: At just one percent, this flavoring \"thickens\" up the entire mix. Anybody that knows me, knows that I absolutely love this flavoring, and it fits nicely into the mix. \r\nTFA Graham Cracker Clear: This flavoring, of course, is the base of our beautiful cheesecake. The crust of a cheesecake is something that has to be sweet, buttery, and crunchy. This component hits all of those marks for me, with flying colors. \r\n\r\nMany thanks to the members of the DIYorDIE Discord chat for helping me finish this recipe!","steep_days":"5 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-10T19:59:38.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"1181","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"New York Cheesecake","flavor_id":"90","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Graham Cracker Clear","flavor_id":"325","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Vanilla Custard","flavor_id":"131","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Blueberry","flavor_id":"1201","vendor":"FW","millipercent":3500},{"name":"Rich Cinnamon","flavor_id":"638","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":50},{"name":"Cheesecake (graham Crust)","flavor_id":"152","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Bilberry","flavor_id":"533","vendor":"FA","millipercent":350},{"name":"Super Sweet","flavor_id":"2384","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":500}],"reviews":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"29865","name":"Images and Words"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
