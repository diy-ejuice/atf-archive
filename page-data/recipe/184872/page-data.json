This recipe has 2 of Noted's [top flavors of the year](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cyA_-M791c&feature=emb_logo) . . . WF Strawberry Cheesecake and OoO Strawberry Jam.  It also has the #1 worst flavor of the year, TFA Strawberry Yogurt.  The reason for the TFA Strawberry Yogurt is simple . . . I was reaching for INW Yes We Cheesecake and, instead, grabbed the Strawberry Yogurt.  Happy accidents, and what not!  This has turned into a spectacular strawberries and milk/cream.  I guess the various layers (Lord knows there's a lot going on) cover up whatever note the Noted crew disliked.\r\n\r\n","steep_days":"3 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-06T20:52:25.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"904","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Strawberry Cheesecake SC","vendor":"WF","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Frozen Yogurt SC","vendor":"WF","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Yogurt","vendor":"FW","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Strawberry Jam","vendor":"OOO","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Sugar Cookie","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Strawberry â€“ SC","vendor":"RF","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Sweetener","vendor":"FW","millipercent":500},{"name":"Graham Crust","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Strawberry Yogurt","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1500}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"184872","name":"Cheeky Strawberry"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
