I mixed this as a V1 without the currant and it was a bit tart... but I think it could be a tad heavy in this version and will likely drop it to 1% on the v3 mix. I have also been playing with a touch of FLV White Chocolate in my cheesecakes and think this recipe could benefit from a touch of that as a binding agent to smooth out the berry and accent the cheesecake.\r\n\r\nPastry Dough\r\nAlong with the cobblers makes the bakery/crust note in this and is spot on to how I wanted it to feel on the mouth and the richness of that crumb topping and bits of soft gooey cobbler funk that I love so much.\r\n\r\nPudding, Ice Cream, Cheesecake - WOW... this was a winner and works really well to soften the berry and add that thick mouth feel and rich creamy after note. The LB imparts some butter and almost a thick rich cream to add to the cheesecake.\r\n","steep_days":"7","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-05T15:44:35.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"594","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Cranberry Cobbler","vendor":"LB","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Deep Fried Pastry Dough SC","vendor":"WF","millipercent":1000},{"name":"New York Cheesecake","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Super Sweet","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":500},{"name":"Sweet Currant","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Vanilla Ice Cream","vendor":"LB","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Vanilla Pudding","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":750},{"name":"Wild Berry Cobbler ala Mode","vendor":"FW","millipercent":3000}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"177678","name":"Cranberry Cheesecake Tart"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
