If you've never heard of him . . . google it!  Sutton Beauty is a type of apple.  Thus, Sutton's Beauty . . . my attempt at an apple pie moonshine.  \r\n\r\nINW Two Apples/CAP Cinnamon Sugar/WF Caramel Butter/FA Vanilla Bourbon makes up the \"apple pie\" side of this recipe.  I wanted a subtle cinnamon mixed with a buttery caramel layered with the apples.  I knew I wanted some vanilla, but nothing overly creamy.  I opted for FA Vanilla Bourbon . . . I thought it would play nice with the moonshine side the recipe.\r\n\r\nI used Liquid Amber to add a little cooked/fermented layer to the apples.\r\n\r\nI went with the combo of Kentucky Bourbon and Whisky for the moonshine aspect, though moonshine is typically a white, or clear, whiskey produced and sold without any aging.  This does a good job of bringing a subtle booziness to the caramel/cinnamon apples.  \r\n\r\nI'm really enjoying this as a SNV . . . mixed it up 60vg/40pg.  Enjoy!","steep_days":"1 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T22:32:38.000-05:00","best_vg":"60%","views":"2812","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Two Apples","vendor":"INW","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Kentucky Bourbon","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Whisky","vendor":"FA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Cinnamon Sugar","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Caramel Butter","vendor":"WF","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Bourbon (vanilla Bourbon)","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Liquid Amber","vendor":"FA","millipercent":500}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"84540","name":"Sutton's Beauty (Apple Pie Moonshine)"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
