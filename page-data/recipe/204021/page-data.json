I chose to release it now because while I may still play around with percentages I feel the heart of the mix is where I want it to be.\r\n\r\nOriginally I was going for a simple butterscotch ice cream. TFA Vanilla Bean Ice Cream and FW Butterscotch Ripple got me that but there was alot of room to improve. After a myriad of different creams I settled on LB Vanilla Ice Cream and FA Fresh Cream (panna fresca) as they brought some great flavor on their own and complimented each other as well as the Butterscotch Ripple nicely. LB Vanilla Ice Cream at 4.5% does all the heavy lifting as a base layer while FA Fresh Cream fills in some gaps with extra butter and cream notes. \r\n\r\nFeeling like this needed some bakery support I tried CAP Sugar Cookie as well as INW Biscuit which were fine but in the end FA Cookie just worked better. At 1.25% it definitely has a presence but does not overtake or dry the mix.\r\n\r\nFinished product is a super smooth cream/bakery vape with massive flavor.\r\n\r\nSweet to taste, can be vaped off the shake for a super creamy butterscotch ice cream flavor, or give it a couple days steep for that bakery to develop. I mix this more frequently in smaller batches as I like this mix fresh, after a month or so the profile is still there but loses a bit of vibrancy.\r\n\r\nPlease rate and/or comment if you mix this.","steep_days":"2 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"total_reviews":4,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:51:43.000-05:00","best_vg":"75%","views":"2540","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Vanilla Ice Cream","vendor":"LB","millipercent":4500},{"name":"Cream Fresh","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Butterscotch Ripple","vendor":"FW","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Super Sweet","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":250},{"name":"Cookie","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1250}],"reviews":[{"user":"finsamson","score":"5","text":"This is fantastic. Only steeped over night but I can't put it down either. The Cream Fresh makes this what it is I think, adds the perfect cream note. The butterscotch is a little light and I may have a play with a different flavour. But as it is, this is perfect. Thank you very much."},{"user":"ChooseGod","score":"5","text":"Awesome recipe.
