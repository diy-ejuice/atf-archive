It works well to add a fried taste to this mix. \r\n\r\nHS Banana: brings a great authentic banana to the mix. \r\n \r\nVT Banana Custard: really doesn’t taste like a Banana Custard, but more like a creamy banana. \r\n\r\nFLV Rich Cinnamon: brings an excellent bakery style cinnamon for this recipe. \r\n\r\nNeeds 10-14 day steep. Please rate and review if you mix. \r\n","steep_days":"10","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T11:44:18.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"1010","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Banana","vendor":"HS","millipercent":500},{"name":"Banana Custard","vendor":"VT","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Deep Fried Pastry Dough SC","vendor":"WF","millipercent":500},{"name":"Rich Cinnamon","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":150},{"name":"Vanilla Pudding","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Pudding Base","vendor":"VT","millipercent":750}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"129193","name":"Fugly Butters"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
