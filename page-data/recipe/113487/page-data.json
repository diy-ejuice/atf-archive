Donâ€™t think the 50 ml will make a steep. May adjust later\r\n\r\nShow was discussing how to use flavors for more than their taste. Ie marshmallow for sweetness and mouthfeel\r\nApricot for brightness and juiciness for the strawberry\r\nAs well as lemon to push the strawberry more forward. \r\n\r\nHope you enjoy.
