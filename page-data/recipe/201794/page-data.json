The OOO Cream Milky Undertone really makes the FLV Milk Chocolate stand out. My favorite Milk base for any recipe is VT Milk Fresh and it didn't disappoint. The VT Sweet Cream gives a thicker creaminess to the recipe and gives it that cohesiveness. Sweetener is optional but I prefer a little sweetness to round out the recipe.","steep_days":"3","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T04:41:44.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"482","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Cream Milky Undertone VG","flavor_id":"6541","vendor":"OOO","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Milk Chocolate","flavor_id":"4389","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":500},{"name":"Milk Fresh","flavor_id":"8926","vendor":"VT","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Sweet Cream","flavor_id":"8979","vendor":"VT","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Super Sweet","flavor_id":"2384","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":400}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"201794","name":"Chocolate mmmmmmmMilk"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
