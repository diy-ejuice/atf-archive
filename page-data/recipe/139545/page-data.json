No runts or candy here. \r\n\r\nI got the idea of adding buttercream frosting to my ice cream base from a suggestion from @diydownunderpippa - frosting episode. Love this idea!\r\n\r\n*If your a pepper taster, sub your vanilla Ice cream and adjust the %. I tried LB in this recipe and for me, it gave too many off notes.\r\n\r\nThe mango is layered with FE mango and CAP sweet mango. Sweet mango rounds out the layer and aids in emulsifying the recipe.\r\n\r\nThe banana layer uses my favorite banana, VT banana custard. I added a touch of LA banana cream to round out the layer.\r\n\r\nWS-23 (30% solution), was added to chill the recipe creating an ice cream, opposed to a warm cream. \r\n\r\nA splash of super sweet was added to give it a little extra sweetness. Adjust it to your liking. \r\n\r\nI enjoy this in a Rebirth rda using a single N80 quad core fused clapton coil (.34 ohm) @ 40 - 55 watts.\r\n\r\nThis recipe is in my everyday rotation, I refuse to run out.\r\n\r\nIf you mix this, please give your feedback.
