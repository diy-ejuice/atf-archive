FLV-Apple Filling and INW-Two Apples are intertwined with FW-Brown Sugar, LA-Butter Rum, FLV-Eggnog and a hint of VT-Bakery Spice to make my apple filling and add savory spices for the tart.  I am really happy with how this turned out.  If you do not have the WF-Oatmeal Cookie you can trade it for CAP-Sugar Cookie and have a very similar recipe.  The VT-Bakery Spice is optional but it is a really nice addition if you have it.  You are welcome to add some sweetener if you prefer sweeter vapes but I did not feel that this one needed any.
