MB Nut Banana will add some of the awesome MB soft banana notes to counter any slight fading as well as adding some welcomed extra hazelnut.\r\nYou could play around with percentages to suit your tastes but this combo should get you there. At 12% of flavoring I found this gold enough to share as a quick and \"deliberately\" and carefully consolidated  3 flavor mix. \r\n\r\nI use a single coil RDA , 0.28 Ohms 50 Watts.","steep_days":"3","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T20:33:03.000-05:00","best_vg":"75%","views":"1573","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Banana Nut Bread","flavor_id":"144","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":7500},{"name":"Carrot Cake","flavor_id":"9279","vendor":"VT","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Nut Banana","flavor_id":"1576","vendor":"MB","millipercent":2000}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"152550","name":"12 carrat banana nut bread"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
