This is my take on a Gingerbread Ice Cream Sandwich.\r\n\r\n**Lorann Bavarian Cream, CAP Butter Cream**\r\nButtery smooth creamy mouthfeel, Vanilla.\r\n\r\n**CAP Gingerbread**\r\nNot the time of year, I know. Self explanatory ingredient though.\r\n\r\n**FA Maple Syrup**\r\nA little softening to the gingerbread, darkness and a little sweetness for the mix.\r\n\r\n**FA Meringue, FA Vienna Cream, CAP Vanilla Bean Ice Cream**\r\nIce cream obviously. This is one of my favorite ice cream bases to build on. CAP can be subbed for TFA if you prefer.\r\n\r\n**FA Zeppola**\r\nA light dough contribution to represent the \"sandwich\" part of the profile.\r\n\r\n**CAP Super Sweet**\r\nOptional, But for my taste buds .4% felt right.","steep_days":"7","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"updated_at":"2020-12-12T15:39:16.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"2820","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Vanilla Bean Ice Cream","flavor_id":"4","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":3500},{"name":"Meringue","flavor_id":"530","vendor":"FA","millipercent":800},{"name":"Gingerbread","flavor_id":"58","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Zeppola","flavor_id":"6312","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Maple Syrup","flavor_id":"509","vendor":"FA","millipercent":300},{"name":"Bavarian Cream (vanilla)","flavor_id":"917","vendor":"LA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Butter Cream","flavor_id":"3","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":500},{"name":"Vienna Cream","flavor_id":"516","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Super Sweet","flavor_id":"2384","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":400}],"reviews":[{"user":"gravi-tea","text":"dude! I totally forgot this was in my cupboard from like months ago. I didn't think I'd love it but holy shit bro this stuff is BETTER than gingerbread man! props!

This is definitely a keeper, a very creamy gingerbread vape and that hint of maple syrup at the end is killer. The ice cream is there but, at least in my opinion, is more in the background. Definitely give this a try.","score":5}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"48570","name":"Ginger Cakes | Ice Cream Sandwiches"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
