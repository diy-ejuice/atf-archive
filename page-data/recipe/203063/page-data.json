It's a satisfyingly bold flavor with the cheesecake adding some smoothness and a touch of creaminess.   Great as a Shake and Vape flavor!  \r\nThe effect of steeping is as of yet unknown. I'll be updating this description later once I've had a chance to let a bottle or two steep for a while.","steep_days":"0 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-11T19:43:16.000-05:00","best_vg":"80%","views":"274","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Cheesecake","flavor_id":"4430","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Black Licorice","flavor_id":"1192","vendor":"FW","millipercent":4000}],"reviews":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"203063","name":"Black Dragon's Drool (Soft Licorice Candy)"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
