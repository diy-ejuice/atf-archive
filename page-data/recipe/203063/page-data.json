It's a satisfyingly bold flavor with the cheesecake adding some smoothness and a touch of creaminess.   Great as a Shake and Vape flavor!  \r\nThe effect of steeping is as of yet unknown. I'll be updating this description later once I've had a chance to let a bottle or two steep for a while.","steep_days":"0 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"total_reviews":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T23:39:14.000-05:00","best_vg":"80%","views":"267","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Cheesecake","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Black Licorice","vendor":"FW","millipercent":4000}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"203063","name":"Black Dragon's Drool (Soft Licorice Candy)"}}}
