As DataNotAnecdotes himeself has pointed out, it's a good base to build upon and experiment, even though I haven't done so myself yet, I'm thinking cherry. Either way, the recipe stands very well on its own. &#xD;\n&#xD;\nFor the record, I would recommend at least a week of steeping myself, preferably 2.

It's not only an amazing on its' own, but it's a fantastic base for other tobacco recipes. I've added fruits, nuts, all sorts of flavors to it, and it's just absolutely fabulous.
