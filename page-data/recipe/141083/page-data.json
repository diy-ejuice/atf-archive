It really helps amp up the flavor profiles of the FA’s. I can’t live without using TFA Dragonfruit. \r\n\r\nFA Marshallow, TFA Whipped Cream and TFA Vanilla swirl are a common trio i like to use with fruits as they add a great base to the fruit by making the vape dense in the mouth while lending their individual creaminess and sweetness to further accentuate the overall feel and flavor. \r\n\r\nCAP SS is totally optional depending on your view towards the inclusion of sweetener in a mix. I used it here because to me it presented an almost “sugar covered” feel to the overall recipe. Sugar coated strawberries and kiwi. It helped blend the fruits and smooth over any potential harshness from the rind flavor of FA Kiwi. I never go above .25% as that seems to be the sweet spot.","steep_days":"3","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:50:45.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"2005","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Red Touch (strawberry)","vendor":"FA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Kiwi","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Dragonfruit","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Marshmallow","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Vanilla Swirl","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Whipped Cream","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Super Sweet","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":250}],"reviews":[{"user":"Jthectic","text":"A nicely balanced creamy kiwi strawberry.
