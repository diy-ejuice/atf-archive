Whether this is your thing or not, this is a completely accurate representation of a creamy tomato soup, seasoned to perfection with a bold dash of black pepper and the crisp freshness of basil. Definitely better suited to a dripper than a tank, but surprisingly pleasurable to vape. Recipes like this beautifully illustrate the kind of innovation possible with rigorous single-flavor testing and meticulous note-taking. Very exciting stuff, Chrisdvr1!"}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"7876","name":"Creamy tomatum soup"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
