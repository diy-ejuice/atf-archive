I didn't think it was very good but I thought I would try to add some koolada to make it more lemonade-like. The koolada completely changed the recipe for me, made everything pop and much crispier where I found it dull and undefined/swampy - I can't state enough how much of a difference it made and I really didn't expect it to.\r\n\r\nI hated menthol with a passion when I smoked and have not enjoyed cooling much in vaping either which is why I was so surprised about this, I couldn't get enough of the recipe and vaped nearly 30ml in two days and it is now my first adv (I usually change flavours after every 2ml tank) . So if you don't like cooling agents maybe give that one a try, it has changed my vaping world drastically.\r\n\r\nAfter this seemingly simple adaption I decided to try one myself. I have been wanting to use lychee up in a recipe for a while as I haven't been keen on it so far, and I have read mentions of using tangerine in lemonades on here a few times. There was no development involved at all, I made the recipe, steeped it and it tasted fantastic to me.\r\n\r\nINW Cactus - I added this to make it juicier tasting\r\n\r\nTPA Dragonfruit - This was to add some juiciness but also to blend it all together and add a bit more depth to the taste. I don't think you can taste it but I like that it gives an (perhaps) unidentifiable background layer. I've discovered that it goes well with koolada as well.\r\n\r\nTPA Koolada 10% - Obviously to make it colder but it also lifts the flavours considerably, gives them a cleaner taste, and makes them pop. This could go down or up a bit, I like it with about 1% but 0.5% seems to be enough to do what it needs to without being very cold. I think it also makes a big difference to the lemonade aspect of the recipe, it seems to bring it slightly closer to being fizzy somehow.\r\n\r\nLA Lemonade - Don't have much to say about this, it's the only lemonade I have and it seems to work well with the other flavours.\r\n\r\nCAP Sweet Lychee - As I mentioned before, I wanted to use up this flavour because I haven't been keen on the taste of it so far, especially in cold recipes. I like it here because the floral side isn't too strong and the other flavours round it out in the areas it needs it. The other flavours back it up enough that isn't a very obvious lychee but certainly is there.\r\n\r\nCAP Sweet Tangerine - In this recipe I think it adds a sweetness and bottom end to the lychee in combination to the lemon(ade) and background of dragonfruit. It's not particularly obvious that it is there but it does have a job.\r\n\r\nI like this recipe because it's not very forward in any one flavour, they all blend together to form a surprisingly complex whole, to me at least. The tangerine could be higher but I enjoy it just lifting and boosting things in the background.\r\n\r\nAfter a shake and vape I found the lychee to be strong and not that pleasant but I left it for a week and everything evened out nicely. So I would recommend steeping for a week","steep_days":"7 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T10:44:00.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"1655","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Cactus","flavor_id":"647","vendor":"INW","millipercent":250},{"name":"Dragonfruit","flavor_id":"226","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Koolada 10 Pg","flavor_id":"280","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Lemonade","flavor_id":"951","vendor":"LA","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Sweet Lychee","flavor_id":"119","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Sweet Tangerine","flavor_id":"123","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":2000}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"105253","name":"LycheeTang Lemonade"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
