So I got her a vape with zero nic to puff on while she is writing, and it has satisfied that urge.).  I let her poke around ATF, and she liked the way both of those sounded.  I remixed them into one recipe, and every time I fill up her tank I'll take a few pulls off of it.  I've also been intermittently working on a pineapple upside down cake.  The two ideas began to coalesce into one, and I began thinking about how coconut milk and pineapple would go with a rice base.  I did some quick research that led me to a Mexican dish that had all of that with cinnamon sprinkled on top.\r\n\r\nI took part of my rice pudding base from [Thrice Pudding Twice](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/90785#thrice_pudding_twice_by_lonesomerhodestn), threw a little bit of Leche de Coco and If You Like Piña Coladas at it, added a touch of FLV Rich Cinnamon, and mixed it all up 60vg/40pg.  Off the shake, it is pretty darn good.  It's a sweet rice cooked in coconut cream with a touch of pineapple baked in and sprinkled with cinnamon.

It’s tasty, but the pineapple doesn’t taste “baked in.” The rice and coconut cream is lovely and works well with the sprinkle of cinnamon, but it’s heavy on the pineapple and the raw pineapple tastes odd against creamy rice. I don’t know for sure how to make pineapple taste cooked in a way that won’t clash with coconut cream and rice, but make just some kind of brown sugar or caramel flavor will lend it that caramelization. Maybe removing the FLV Pineapple that’s so much brighter and fresher and just relying on the Golden Pineapple for all the pineapple flavor. &#xD;\n"}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"113573","name":"Arroz con leche de coco y piña"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
