DO NOT...I REPEAT...DO NOT USE FA HONEY AT .5%, IT MUST BE DILUTED TO 10% BEFORE YOU USE IT! ALSO, FA VANILLA ICE CREAM IS ALSO CALLED GELATO VANIGLIA.\r\n\r\nWith that said, \"What the hell is Honey Butter Ice Cream?\". Well, it was an idea that came to me on one of those sleepless nights. I don't think it's even a real thing but I thought the pairings of honey and butter with a rich ice cream would make for a delectable, decadent, desert. So, I went for it.\r\n\r\nRecently I mixed a recipe by The eJuice Fairy(Jennifer Winstead) where she used FA Vanilla Ice Cream. I had never used it before but was very surprised how rich, creamy, and \"clean\" or \"bright\" it was. I chose this flavoring because I wanted a \"bright\" ice cream to make some separation from the buttery honey notes and it was the perfect choice.\r\n\r\nWF Caramel Butter is such a rich flavoring. It adds both butter and a complimentary caramel to bolster the FA Honey. Please note: I DID NOT USE 0.5% FA HONEY. I used a 10% dilution of FA Honey, so please don't use it straight from the bottle at .5%, it's way too strong.\r\n\r\nThe CAP Vanilla Custard is there to give a bit of a mouth-feel and \"compress\" the ice cream, much like a home-made ice cream, not like a soft-serve ice cream. The FLV Cream is there to add a bit of vanilla and body as well.\r\n\r\nJust a bit of CAP SS to lift up things a bit.\r\n\r\nIt was a lot of fun creating something that doesn't really exist in real life and I hope you will enjoy it as much as I do.\r\n\r\nThis can be a shake and vape but it's best to steep it for 2-5 days.\r\nI hope you will mix, comment, and or rate, it make us all better mixers. :)\r\nVisit Freedom To Mix on Discord https://discord.gg/cMUjtPf\r\nJoin our Freedom To Mix FaceBook group https://www.facebook.com/groups/415341418920740/ \r\nVisit https://freedomtomix.com/ for resources and information on DIY mixing!

The pairing of diluted FA Honey and WF Caramel Butter is just such a brilliant rich, yet light sweetness...they were made to go together. Add in the light but thoroughly flavorful mixture of FA vanilla ice cream (Gelato Vaniglia) and Flv Cream...just wow. The Gelato makes it a light fluffy ice cream, and the added cream give the right amount of texture and extra cream without weighing things down. The subtle touch that Vanilla Custard makes to bring everything together...this is a fabulous recipe that I wish existed in the real world, because this is so good. &#xD;\n&#xD;\nOn the other hand, this is the perfect argument for vaping your calories. Wonderfully done!"},{"user":"FuriousMixer","score":"5","text":"Folkart this recipe is worthy of a cuddle!! I love love love this concoction it‚Äôs layered perfectly,I‚Äôll 2nd,3rd and4th the others on the great pairing with WF caramel butter! Thank you for all your hard work brother I‚Äôll definitely have a bottle of this on lockdown at all times. üëåüèªüíØ"},{"user":"Zugmaschine","score":"5","text":"Its really great, how WF Caramel Butter and FA Honey work together. (But only if you amke the 10% Dilution, how is decribed in the recipe notes)&#xD;\nMine has been steeping for 3 days and it was very good. But i think also it will get better over time."},{"user":"MaxSavage","score":"5","text":"This is a go to for me when I want to take a break from working or recipes. It's full flavored but not going to assault me with a ton of different things going on. As Alfred's said, the dilution of FA honey and how it pairs with WF Caramel Butter is genius and something a lot of people would over look. Dilutions? Who the fuck has time for that? I never personally thought FA Honey needed to be diluted but they way it's used here and being dialed in so well makes me a believer. Everything is layered perfectly, great work."},{"user":"AlfredPudding","score":"5","text":"This recipe is absolutely phenomenal. It caused a bit of an existential crisis for me, because FA Honey at .5% of a 10% dilution is perfect even at such a low amount. The way it blends perfectly into WF Caramel Butter is beautiful, and I'm going to remember that duo for my future honey ventures. Then you have FA Vanilla Ice Cream and FLV Cream to make an awesome, but mild ice cream base, and a tiny bit of CAP Vanilla Custard to add a hint of egg richness. Mine has been steeping for 5 days as a beta test for folkart, but I imagine it will only get better over time. "}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"134228","name":"Honey Butter Ice Cream"}}}
