Cap sweet has a sweet syrupy/sugary/juicy vibe but It lacks some of the tropical spice I love in a lychee. To cure this I have added 1% TFA Lychee. That's as much as I could do without the mix sliding off the florals cliff, TFA Lychee tends to go floral on your ass after a steep..\r\n\r\nTFA Jack Fruit. \r\nIts such a wonderful tropical flavor with notes of cactus, feint banana and I even get a little pineapple in there somewhere. I like the creamy quality and I just had a feeling this may go well with the lychee. I used Dragon fruit initially, but contains too much triacetin so it melds the flavors too much and ended up muting all the flavors.\r\n\r\nFA Fuji & FA Lemon Sicily\r\nFuji was added to give the mix a nice fruity body and FA lemon Sicily really helps brighten the profile as a whole and really makes the profile pop.\r\n\r\nCAP Sweet Strawberry\r\nSweet strawberry lends depth and sweetness whilst not being prominent in the flavor profile. I would have much rather have used strawberry ripe but I am fresh out. Ripe mutes significantly on the steep which would have been ideal for this recipe. \r\n\r\nTFA Koolada\r\nKoolada and lychee in my view does not play well. But at this low percentage it has a negligible effect and it just cools the mix down enough to keep it from tasting warm and soggy.\r\n\r\nFW Spearmint\r\nLychee and Jackfruit doesn't stand up to mints very well in general. I feel they both have have light nuisances which is easily masked by additives and I want those to be present in this recipe. At 0.15 it sit lightly on the profile and just adds a nice complexity and summery vibes to the mix. \r\n\r\nThere is a slight waxiness - it is characteristic of TFA dragon fruit and TFA Lychee. It dies down after a short steep (1 day)\r\n\r\nI'd love to hear your thoughts","steep_days":"1 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"total_reviews":1,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:49:16.000-05:00","best_vg":"65%","views":"3459","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Sweet Lychee","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Lychee","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Sweet Strawberry","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Jackfruit","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Fuji","vendor":"FA","millipercent":250},{"name":"Lemon Sicily","vendor":"FA","millipercent":150},{"name":"Koolada 10 Pg","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":250},{"name":"Spearmint","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":150}],"reviews":[{"user":"111111jack","score":"5","text":""}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"41869","name":"Jackshit"}}}
