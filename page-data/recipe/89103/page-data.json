(Only a little fine tuning)\r\n\r\nAfter 10 days, the Butterscotch was a little to strong.\r\nSo I decrease the Caramel, what works as a Butterscotch-Backup, to 0,75% to be more near\r\nto a German Butterscotch Ice Cream.  Thats it!\r\n\r\n\r\n##01.May.2018##\r\nSaw that the Butterscotchtaste mutes after a few weeks. \r\nSo I increase the Butterscotch Part, lower the Cream Part and also increase the Hazelnut,\r\nto be more prominent. Als switched from TPA Caramel to FA Caramel, because it works better with the Buterscotch.\r\n\r\n\r\nTell me what u think about and write to the comments what i can make better\r\n","steep_days":"10","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T09:44:16.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"2790","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Vanilla Bean Ice Cream","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":3250},{"name":"Butter Cream","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":750},{"name":"Bavarian Cream","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":500},{"name":"Milk & Honey","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Butterscotch Ripple","vendor":"FW","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Butterscotch","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Hazelnut","vendor":"FW","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Golden Butter","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":500},{"name":"Carmel (caramel)","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"89103","name":"Deutsche Butterscotch Ice Cream"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
