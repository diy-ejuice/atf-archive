I definitely recommend a minimum of a one day steep. Fairly sharp throat hit immediately after mixing, but that's completely gone after a day. I get the grape fruit and passion fruit up front with the peach supporting it all with a juicy sweetness. Great recipe all around, I'll definitely be mixing up more of this one."}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"106232","name":"Grapefruit Peach Passion (Flavorbook Entry Recipe)"}}}
