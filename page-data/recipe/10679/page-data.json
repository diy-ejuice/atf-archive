TFA Marshmallow sweetens, softens, and helps take enough of the edge off of the CDS that you shake and vape this, but the vanilla custard really blossoms and everything is so much smoother after just a week's steep.

I too found the cinnamon a little high and my possibly reduce it next time.&#xD;\n&#xD;\nFor my sweet tooth I needed to add sweetener and after 1% of FW Sweetener it was perfect for me&#xD;\n&#xD;\nOne of the best cookies Iâ€™ve tried"},{"user":"onimodaekil","score":"5","text":"Honestly wasn't expecting this to be so true to flavor. I'm not a huge cookie vape fan but this hit the mark and then some. Cinnamony, sugary, buttery cookie that I want to eat two dozen of and pretend the dog did it. Well done, man."},{"user":"Gordo","score":"5","text":"Just before I made this I spilled 150 ml of vg ...I was so angry, so angry, ... then I made this, I know it should steep but if you like snickerdoodles,  its tasty right off the shake. The best thing right now, ...aged three minutes, ... its smooth and creamy, nothing harsh,  Man I hate vg on my elbows......"},{"user":"Kittybit","score":"5","text":"Considering the age of this recipe, it still goddamn works! Maybe a bit heavy on the cinnamon, but I don't have issue with that. It has some serious nice buttery goodness going on and that vanilla note from CAP Vanilla Custard is very welcoming. I very much enjoy this."},{"user":"RainbowDragon","score":"5","text":"Definitely a banger. ADV"},{"user":"diesel223","score":"5","text":"I love snickerdoodle cookies and I think this is a great accurate recipe. So rich and full of great cinnamon flavor. After the 7 day steep the cinnamon blends into the cookie base beautifully and becomes exactly what you want it to be. If you love snickerdoodle try this, if you haven't liked cinnamon vapes because they come off as red hots make this and it will show you the light,  if you like vaping awesomeness make it!!"},{"user":"NaCHeF","score":"5","text":"Great recipe! Simple to make and delicious. The Cinnamon is a little to high for me to be a real snickerdoodles but I am sensitive to cinnamon."},{"user":"cdaniell30","score":"4","text":"You know how you refer to some mixes as an IQ test?  I'm not a huge cinnamon person but I made this anyway.  It's good enough that I'm going to cut the CDS in half and try it again :)  It was good as published, just too much cinnamon for me."},{"user":"Ebc88","score":"5","text":"Excellent recipe one of the best cookie vapes ive had "},{"user":"MrZigglesworth","score":"5","text":"Sometimes it's the simplest recipes that are the best, and this is a damn good snickerdoodle cookie."},{"user":"louiesquared","score":"5","text":"Great recipe!

Little rough on the coils but I can live with it."},{"user":"Kriswk","score":"5","text":"Very tasty, reminds me almost of Cuttwood Sugar Drizzle, just a tad less sweet and milky.
