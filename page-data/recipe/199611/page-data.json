Such a nice Vanilla and creamy sweetnes. Its more a Marshmallow Cream than a real Marshmallow.\r\nI also love OOO Strawberry Jam its not only the nice fruity jammyness, also the strawberry is with a little help wonderful.\r\nThe whole recept is to bring the spot on this two flavours.\r\n\r\nThe Marshmallows gives this mix a nice sweetnes, but add sweetener, how you like.\r\nYou can vape it S&V but taste better if you give it 3-5 days, that the flavours can melt together.","steep_days":"5 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:51:39.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"1544","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Marshmallow (Vanilla)","flavor_id":"1798","vendor":"OOO","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Marshmallow","flavor_id":"473","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Vienna Cream","flavor_id":"516","vendor":"FA","millipercent":2750},{"name":"Strawberry Jam","flavor_id":"10274","vendor":"OOO","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Red Touch (strawberry)","flavor_id":"421","vendor":"FA","millipercent":2750},{"name":"Biscuit","flavor_id":"642","vendor":"INW","millipercent":750},{"name":"Cake Batter","flavor_id":"22","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":500}],"reviews":[{"user":"Stephanierenee63","text":"I tried this today and it's delicious!
