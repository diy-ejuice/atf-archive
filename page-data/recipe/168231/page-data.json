This beverage got me me very excited. The depth of flavor was delicious AF! \r\nRight away I was inspired to try and bring this to life in a vape. \r\nWhile it appears by the label this beverage is meant to be based on red grapes there is very little grape flavor in this (if any). As described on their website it is described as a \"Crafted to an authentic recipe, this red berry brew is one of a kind\". I have to agree with that. This is a lovely blend of deep berries in a vanilla like enriched soda base that would satisfy even the most discerning of palettes. \r\nThis had me excited to get mixing! \r\n\r\nI am familiar with the soda base required here using VT Creaming Soda (with that lovely vanilla), with the VT Fizzy sherbet working well together. However the slight lemony note on the back if the Fizzy sherbet was a concern but rather it really assisted the blend of the berries and compliments this profile beautifully. \r\n\r\nI went to work to create a lovely Berry Syrup to add to the base and the blending of FLV Boysenberry, FLV Jammy Berry, & FA Blackcurrant is the right mix here to provide that lovely deep deliciousness. \r\n\r\nHowever to add a little more depth of vanilla through the middle a few drops of FLV Smooth Vanilla were used with delicate finesse.\r\n\r\nA little VT Golden Syrup & a little Cap Super sweet offers a lovely rich dark sweetness here in this profile. \r\n\r\nAfter just 3 days steep, this is just as delicious as the wonderful experience I enjoyed with the excellent beverage I was inspired by. \r\nOff the shake it was wonderful but the berry blend gets way better after the short steep. \r\n\r\nI enjoy this at 65W on a Single 0.2ohm SST coil on a Recurve RDA. \r\n\r\nI hope you enjoy this just as much as I enjoyed creating this recipe, but let me know what you thought in the comments below.\r\n\r\nSeriously if you like a solid recipe that works give it a go!\r\n\r\nCheers for reading this far, now go and get mixing!\r\n\r\n\"Together, Let's Discover!!!\"\r\n\r\nFacebook - https://www.facebook.com/groups/diydownunder/\r\nDiscord - https://discord.gg/kH4Fqbc\r\nYoutube - https://www.youtube.com/c/diydownunder\r\nWebsite - https://www.diydownunder.com/\r\nInstagram IGTV : @diydownunder","steep_days":"3","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"total_reviews":1,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:51:09.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"1161","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Golden Syrup","vendor":"VT","millipercent":500},{"name":"Super Sweet","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":500},{"name":"Creaming Soda","vendor":"VT","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Blackcurrant","vendor":"FA","millipercent":250},{"name":"Jammy Berry","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":500},{"name":"Boysenberry","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":250},{"name":"Fizzy Sherbet","vendor":"VT","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Smooth Vanilla","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":200}],"reviews":[{"user":"savage","score":"5","text":"Very impressive.
