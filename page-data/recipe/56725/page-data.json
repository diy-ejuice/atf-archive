The Blood Orange and Peach Juicy pairs with that citric note and adds some sweet fruit to the cocktail. \r\n\r\nI hope you enjoy it and feel free to play with it and give your most honest opinion and suggestions!!\r\n\r\n(English is not my mother tongue; please excuse any errors on my part)","steep_days":"3","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T17:34:15.000-05:00","best_vg":"50%","views":"1457","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Pink Lemonade","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Almond Amaretto","vendor":"FW","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Blood Orange","vendor":"FW","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Peach (juicy)","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Black Tea","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2000}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"56725","name":"Sunset Girl"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
