Grown-up fat kids rejoice.\r\n\r\nCustard Premium and Vanilla Buttercream Frosting make a thick, creamy, and sweet base with a hint of vanilla. Zeppola adds a touch of donut and some spice lingering throughout. It’s loaded with Super Sweet for the sugary sweetness you’d expect from donut filling.\r\n\r\nIt’s pretty good fresh, but everything is better steeped.\r\n\r\nHappy mixing. 👽","steep_days":"14 (SNV)","temperature":"8008","recipe_score":5,"total_reviews":3,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:50:46.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"3846","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Custard Premium","vendor":"FA","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Vanilla Buttercream Frosting","vendor":"VT","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Zeppola","vendor":"FA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Super Sweet","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":500}],"reviews":[{"user":"Ayvaluv11","score":"5","text":"This is the best custard:donut blend I’ve had.

Knocked this one out of the park. If you like custard donuts and havent tried this one yet you are really cheating yourself. I love it as is and also with a a drop of rich cinnamon per 30 ml added to go more in the cinnamon direction. Mix this one up guys and gals.
