Mostly because Shisha Strawberry is my only Strawberry and Wera Garden Watermelon (btw, it’s Wera Garden Watermelon, not just regular ol’ INW Watermelon!) is the only Watermelon I have.\r\n\r\nThe trouble came with the Bahraini Apple Gold. It’s a sweet apple flavor, but the sweetness comes from anise. I don’t much care for anise, so I wanted to find a way to tame it a bit. That’s when I figured I’d give FLV Wood Spice a go. It’s a strange combo, but it works really well in my opinion. Once a non INW flavor was introduced, I figured what the hell and added some FA Fuji just to give the Apple a bit more of a tart top note. \r\n\r\n","steep_days":"7","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"updated_at":"2020-12-12T15:39:35.000-05:00","best_vg":"60%","views":"2208","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Apple Fuji","flavor_id":"4886","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Tobacco Bahraini Apple Gold","flavor_id":"702","vendor":"INW","millipercent":500},{"name":"Watermelon","flavor_id":"674","vendor":"INW","millipercent":750},{"name":"Shisha Strawberry","flavor_id":"1711","vendor":"INW","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Wood Spice","flavor_id":"4447","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":300}],"reviews":[{"user":"Loonicorn","text":"Wow! Yum! This smells and tastes fantastic!! Sweet strawberry, juicy apple, hint of watermelon, and just this exotic heady mouthful of yum!&#xD;\nI can’t believe how good this is. This is my first strapon. The profile never interested me so I never bought or mixed one. This is seriously so delicious. I can taste the individual fruits if I force myself to think about them. But the magic here is how they all blend together into something delightfully sweet, fruity, and exotic. I don’t taste layers; I don’t taste the flavors in any particular order. I just get a single mouthful of wonderfulness! I am loving the Wood Spice in this. In nestles in perfectly with everything else. The watermelon is coming through a bit more now that everything is nice and warm. &#xD;\nGreat job!","score":5}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"75302","name":"Spiced Up Strap On"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
