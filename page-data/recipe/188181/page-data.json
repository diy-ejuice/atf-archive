I got a free bottle of it and it was enjoyable, but at almost $30 for a 30ml, I was not going to buy it again.

This is my attempt to remix it without that off note.\r\n\r\nFA Forest Fruit:  The core flavor of what makes Betty.\r\nTPA Blueberry Extra: To round out the fruit notes.\r\nCap Super Sweet:  It's got to have the sticky syrupy sweetness.\r\nINW Lemon Mix:  A little bit of tart to make the berries pop.","steep_days":"1 (SNV)","temperature":"410","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T12:48:12.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"623","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Forest Fruits","flavor_id":"4890","vendor":"FA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Super Sweet","flavor_id":"2384","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":500},{"name":"Lemon Mix","flavor_id":"698","vendor":"INW","millipercent":250},{"name":"Blueberry (extra)","flavor_id":"218","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":250}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"188181","name":"Pinning Up Ms. Bee (A Betty Remix)"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
