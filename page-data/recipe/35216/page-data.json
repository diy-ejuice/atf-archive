The flavors meld together beautifully in a similar fashion of Grack Juice. Not too sweet but sweet enough to be a ADV; well done!","score":5},{"user":"ID10-T","text":"Weird tart grapple up front, juicy melon finish, with sweet strawberry throughout. There seems to be just a bit of that Grack magic going on here in the way it grew on me. At first it was frankly painful, that grape seemed to have a medicinal quality and I was taken aback. But I kept coming back to it and as my palate stretched, I began to become accustomed to the way it fits in here, and then pretty quickly started to really enjoy it. Now I don't see myself stopping until the whole bottle is empty!","score":5}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"35216","name":"Polish Member Emulator"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
