Best in an RDA at 60 - 70 watts  (4.0V) \r\n\r\nThis was made for Daytime Franks mixin in the kitchen episode on coffee\r\n\r\n**Bazillian Coffee** is a a robust dark roast coffee with no off notes or cream added. if you are looking for just coffee with no additional flavors that you can build around this is the flavor you want. I used it at a mid range to contrast the sweet syrup raspberry notes and still be present.  See notes below for other coffee subs and changes \r\n\r\n**raspberry Jam** and **strawberry Gummy** create the bright sweet syrup that is needed to pop out against the darker coffee and chocolate notes  ( if you want more of a brighter  realistic raspberry note you can sub the strawberry  gummy for  FLV red raspberry or  INW raspberry)\r\n\r\n**Devon Cream** is a moderate body cream with a chocolate finish that works perfect in mocha coffee blend. \r\n\r\n**Honey Comb** add some additional chocolate notes and inherit darker type sweetness \r\n\r\n**Whipped Cream** is used to blend this mix into a frappuchino \r\n\r\n**Vanilla Ice Cream** I wanted a really full dense body that you get from a custard but I did not want an egg note. FA vanilla ice cream does this , it is used to create the full creamy dense vanilla base. The vanilla is a bright top note type of vanilla that works here because it does not get lost into the coffee\r\n\r\n**NOTES** Sweetener  not  needed but works to bring out some of the top notes.  I love  **Stixx mixx** coffee but many do not have them  so i used WF brazilian -  but for my personal taste I like to   use (SM) Chock full of nuts at 6%  for a solid  medium roast coffee and  (SM) Italian roast  for that extra shot of  espresso shot   at 2%   INW coffee can also be subed it leans to a dark bean espresso   as well   and has very minimal off notes   use between 1 - 1.5% ","steep_days":"5","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"total_reviews":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T21:32:53.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"1273","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Brazilian Coffee SC","vendor":"WF","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Devon Cream","vendor":"VT","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Strawberry Gummy Candy SC","vendor":"WF","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Raspberry Jam","vendor":"VT","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Honeycomb","vendor":"VT","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Vanilla Ice Cream","vendor":"FA","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Whipped Cream","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Sweetness","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":500}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"137578","name":" Mocha Raspberry Frappuccino "}}}
