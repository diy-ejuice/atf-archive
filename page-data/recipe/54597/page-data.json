I added a little more sweet strawberry to keep this recipe more on the dessert side. It's the main profile playing in the recipe, upfront and the initial flavor of the vape.\r\n\r\nSugar Cookie/Biscuit\r\nThis is the shortbread cookie part of the recipe. Both of these flavors have a buttery note that pairs excellent with strawberry. The Biscuit really helps add some texture to the recipe, while the sugar cookie is most of flavor profile. \r\n\r\nVBIC/Bavarian Cream\r\nThis is the ice cream portion of the recipe. Based more around the VBIC, but Bavarian cream helps with sweetness and mouth feel. The cream notes are full and rich. Having the heavy creams rounds out the recipe, giving more saturation and richness.\r\n\r\nHope you guys enjoy! Please rate and comment, tell me what you think even if it's a con.
