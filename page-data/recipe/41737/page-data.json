This reminds me of a candy I had as a child, although I can't place it, maybe taffy.  The mouthfeel of this mix is unusual, and picks up on that waxy feel you were shooting for, and is pleasant to vape.  I tried this as a low wattage vape, but I got much better flavor with DL at higher wattage.  The strawberry is present, but subtle, so I wouldn't recommend this for someone looking for a strong strawberry, but it makes it a great ADV.  It does get better as it steeps, so give it time."},{"user":"G8RH8R23","score":"4","text":"Mixed this up just as posted. I don't get much taffy at all from this but it's still a tasty vape"}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"41737","name":"Pink Wax Candy"}}}
