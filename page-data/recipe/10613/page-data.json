I have never seen it used this high before, and was interested to see how it would work out. I thought it seemed ham fisted but somehow it works. Why is there 1% TPA VBIC? I don't know but it just works. I'd be  interested to see how FA Liquid Amber would affect the mix. Great job.","score":4},{"user":"YippYo","text":"Absolutely fantastic recipe that matches the profile perfectly. Every element is present and balanced. Definitely benefits from a long steep.","score":5},{"user":"SeLeV","text":"God, that was a painful wait for 2  weeks. But so worth it! It's amazing. The apple sits right on top of that cinnamon danish. So satisfying.","score":5},{"user":"koldfusion","text":"This is so good.

It was one of the first profiles that really hooked me when I started vaping and nothing has changed. /u/ID10-T 's recipe is absolutely delicious, and I'm glad I finally got around to mixing it. Not everybody like's the taste of Dragonfruit, but man it really makes Apple/Cinnamon Combo's sing, and this recipe is no different. It's sitting in my U-Well Fancier right now and I can't get enough of it.","score":5},{"user":"Mr-G","text":"nice","score":5},{"user":"Ebc88","text":"Solid recipe after a 2 week steep everything blends together nicely ","score":5},{"user":"tasosetsi","text":"just fantastic......","score":5},{"user":"Evilin","text":"I remember not liking the juice in the beginning, even after 3 weeks steep time.&#xD;\n&#xD;\nThe other day I found a 30ml bottle that I've mixed almost 3 months ago in one of my boxes. Gone in 2 days.&#xD;\nI Mixed another 100ml straight away. Can't wait for it to be done steeping. :D&#xD;\n&#xD;\nThis juice really needs time to come together, give it that time and it will blow your tastebuds. So, so, so good.

Very light on the cream note, it just sort of smoothes out the apple component. Light enough to be an all-day liquid, but the flavor does not fade after repeated vaping. Great recipe!
