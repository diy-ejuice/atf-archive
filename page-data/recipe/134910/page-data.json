I combined WF Glazed Donut SC, and FA Zeppola for a donut base. I threw in FLV Pound Cake for a more \"cakey\" feel. I added LA Cream Cheese Icing and FLV Milk And Honey for kind of a \"Yin and Yang\" sweetness; cream cheese icing being the light, and milk and honey being the dark for a flavorful sweetness. The CAP Super Sweet is something that can be discarded, but I used it for a glazed effect.\r\nSteep for at least 7 days, but I recommend 10-14.","steep_days":"10","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T10:44:18.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"1662","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Glazed Donut SC","vendor":"WF","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Zeppola","vendor":"FA","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Pound Cake","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Cream Cheese Icing","vendor":"LA","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Milk & Honey","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Super Sweet","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":500}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"134910","name":"Glazed And Infused"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
