It has a little bit of texture but we're going to add OOO Marshmallow Vanilla to get some texture in there and a nice base note for our vanilla. Good Ol' TFA Vanilla Swirl works really well with creams and fruits and candies and it's kind of exactly what we need in here. \r\n\r\nSweeten to taste.\r\n\r\nWatch the Video Here:\r\n\r\nhttps://youtu.be/JdASYdyLKaY","steep_days":"7","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T17:36:35.000-05:00","best_vg":"80%","views":"487","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Blueberry Gummy Candy SC","flavor_id":"10405","vendor":"WF","millipercent":5000},{"name":"Vanilla Swirl","flavor_id":"189","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Marshmallow (Vanilla)","flavor_id":"1798","vendor":"OOO","millipercent":3000}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"207964","name":"Blueberry Vanilla Gummy Candy"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
