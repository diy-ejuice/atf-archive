Vanilla Swirl and Caramel OG boost the best properties of both the RY4 and the Custard, and a touch of Butterscotch Ripple helps tie it all together. Due the high concentrations of the stars of the show, this one is a long steeper. I give it 2 weeks minimum before I break into it, but at a month the real magic happens, and you have the best damn RY4 I've ever tasted.\r\n\r\nOptional - I like to add 0.5% of CAP Super Sweet to appease my sweet tooth. I've also added 1 drop per 15ml of MTS Vape Wizard to enhance mouthfeel, but neither is needed for this recipe to be delicious.","steep_days":"30","temperature":"0","recipe_score":4,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:49:55.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"8458","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Ry4 Double","flavor_id":"379","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":5000},{"name":"Vanilla Custard","flavor_id":"131","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":5000},{"name":"Vanilla Swirl","flavor_id":"189","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Caramel (original)","flavor_id":"149","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Butterscotch Ripple","flavor_id":"1217","vendor":"FW","millipercent":1000}],"reviews":[{"user":"bjorama","text":"I like a good Ry4 from time to time and I always end up comparing them to Capone by villain vapor.
