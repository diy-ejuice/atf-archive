Recently I went back and rewrote it, and I think I nailed it. Vaping this is like shoving a handful of lifesaver gummies into your mouth, it's sweet and fruity. It needs a couple days for the FW Hard Candy to settle in, as well as the CAP Sweet Tangerine to die down. Vaping it at lower wattage can bring out the cherry and pineapple as well as the tangerine a bit, I feel like it changes every puff into a new flavor. Higher wattage you can taste everything pretty well, its a very fruity mix. The watermelon isn't so prominent in the recipe, but it gives a nice sweetness. Meringue was just to sweeten it up without Sucralose or EM.
