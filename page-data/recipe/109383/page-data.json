This can be vaped right away but is best after 3 days. Those 3 days allows the low % of LA Watermelon to add its mouth watering candy affect without turning this into a candy mix. People weren't kidding when they said that FLV Alpine Strawberry was strong. I used only 1 drop in 60ml bottle and can definitely taste it. At that low dose, it doesn't over power the other sweeter strawberry but instead helps balance it out. The watermelon to strawberry ratio is pretty balanced with the apple as more of a note. Enjoy!","steep_days":"3 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T12:46:56.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"1783","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Cactus","vendor":"INW","millipercent":250},{"name":"Watermelon","vendor":"LA","millipercent":750},{"name":"Alpine Strawberry","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":40},{"name":"Sweet Watermelon","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":3000},{"name":"WS-23","vendor":"OTHR","millipercent":750},{"name":"Strawberry Sweet","vendor":"JF","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Fuji","vendor":"JF","millipercent":1500}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"109383","name":"Episode 17: ExclusiveGirl's Frosty StrapOn #MixinVixens"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
