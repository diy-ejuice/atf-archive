I started out with the idea of doing a Strawberry/Whipped Cream topping on a waffle, but one look at all the flavors and that had to change as 90% of the recipes were one way or another that. Then I realized one of my favorite vapes are always the simplest things. So this mix is simply put a Strawberry Vanilla mix. It took me about a month to perfect it, but these percentages are by far the best outcome. Hope you like it! Let me know any suggestions or comments please. Thanks!!","steep_days":"3","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T12:45:44.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"2498","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Strawberry Sweet","vendor":"JF","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Whipped Cream","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Vanilla Swirl","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":3500}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"36033","name":"Strawberry-Humble"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
