I started out with the idea of doing a Strawberry/Whipped Cream topping on a waffle, but one look at all the flavors and that had to change as 90% of the recipes were one way or another that. Then I realized one of my favorite vapes are always the simplest things. So this mix is simply put a Strawberry Vanilla mix. It took me about a month to perfect it, but these percentages are by far the best outcome. Hope you like it! Let me know any suggestions or comments please. Thanks!!","steep_days":"3","temperature":"0","recipe_score":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-10T15:59:56.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"2507","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Strawberry Sweet","flavor_id":"4745","vendor":"JF","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Whipped Cream","flavor_id":"193","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Vanilla Swirl","flavor_id":"189","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":3500}],"reviews":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"36033","name":"Strawberry-Humble"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
