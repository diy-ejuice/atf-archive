Then I filled it with Fuzzy Love... \r\n\r\nThe dimensional crack for the haters is stuffed but just for mentioning love, that fuzzy love. For the moments we lost and the fuzz we forgot.. Keep it FULL MIGHTY.. Much FUZZ.\r\n\r\nI also have a Pineapple and Cherry version of this as well.. \r\n\r\n\r\n","steep_days":"5","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-06T20:49:33.000-05:00","best_vg":"80%","views":"1290","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Fuzzy Navel","vendor":"FW","millipercent":1700},{"name":"Peach White","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Blood Orange","vendor":"FW","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Juicy Orange","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1170},{"name":"Strawberry Taffy","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":2700},{"name":"Super Sweet","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":170}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"38262","name":"Full Mighty Fuzz"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
