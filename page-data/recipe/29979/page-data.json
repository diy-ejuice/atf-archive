I also have a friend who has gotten rather tired of custards and creams. She wanted something with a good citrus punch. So I figured I'd have a go at a berry lemonade. I have a bit of a obsession with FA Blackcurrant, and I thought the mix between it and the wild raspberry would be interesting. \r\n\r\nThe Lemonade base - Lemon Sicily mixed with the Cactus, Super Sweet and the Sour give it a nice juicy, sweet, and slightly tart flavor. It's not in your face tart like most lemonades but I enjoy it.\r\n\r\nBerries - Blackcurrant can come off a bit musty if not used correctly, and Wild Raspberry is extremely potent. I added the Blue Raspberry Slush to meld the two and avoid either being overbearing.\r\n\r\nSpring is coming up. Give it a mix and let me know what you think.
