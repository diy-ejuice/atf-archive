Since it is the holiday season now, I decided to take a holiday twist on the recipe.  This is a peach pie thrown into a milkshake, as I wasn't able to get the separation that I wanted.\r\n\r\nIn the winter, my peach pies are usually made from peach pie filling canned during the summer, so I add a seasonal fresh fruit, persimmon, to the filling.  I also add warm spices to the filling.  I followed that path with this mix.  I chose the INW and Hangsen as they give me more of a cooked peach flavor.\r\n\r\nI wanted a soft, greasy pie crust, so I added JF Churro to OOO Pie Crust.  I may adjust this later, as after a 1 week steep, it is not where I want it.  It needs a little more browned crunch, and it does stand out quite enough.  If you have a suggestion, please leave a comment.\r\n\r\nI love dark sugar flavors with peach, so I used VTA Toffee Ice Cream, and to add a holiday touch, FLV Eggnog.  \r\n\r\nTested on Pixie SS 0.29 Alien @ 40 watts.  I do not recommend vaping this at low wattage.\r\n","steep_days":"7","temperature":"0","recipe_score":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-11T17:21:44.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"731","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Churro","flavor_id":"10292","vendor":"JF","millipercent":750},{"name":"Eggnog","flavor_id":"4396","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Juicy Peach","flavor_id":"2086","vendor":"HS","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Peach","flavor_id":"804","vendor":"INW","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Persimmon","flavor_id":"4420","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":250},{"name":"Persimmon Spice","flavor_id":"4424","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":250},{"name":"Pie Crust","flavor_id":"2010","vendor":"OOO","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Super Sweet","flavor_id":"2384","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":150},{"name":"Toffee Ice Cream","flavor_id":"8987","vendor":"VT","millipercent":3000}],"reviews":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"174643","name":"Peach Pie Nog"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
