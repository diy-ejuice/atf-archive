Both are slightly spicy. Turkish has a hint of creaminess to me, and Native has a hint of honey. Due to the spice of each, I feel like darker flavors would mix well, possibly woody type tastes. I went with Fig and Raisin rum here. Raisin rum is more of a rum flavor, and less hints of the fruit but the raisin is there on the back; sweet fig is more textural than it is taste for me, but its there. The fig comes in at the end of the exhale.. I think it all melds extremely well, and a great tobacco vape.
