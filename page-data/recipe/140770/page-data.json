A few drops of mts vape wizard can help round and blend the flavors if you don't want to cut the sweetness with bitter wizard.\r\n\r\nMenthol is very light. Mix at 0.4-0.5% or add 0.5% spearmint for more of a menthol cig flavor\r\n\r\nDepending on how sweet your VG is the bitter wizard may need to be increased. Using Essential Depot Palm VG I had to up it to 2% to cut the sweetness enough.

I saw the ingredients and thought to myself: This could be really close to a regular cigarette if I leave out the menthol. Ordered the flavors, mixed it up and what can I say? It's really good. Even I like it, and I usually detest tobacco flavorings. My Dad is also very happy with it, since the last store-bought tobacco liquid he had was goddamn atrocious. A well deserved 5 star rating."}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"140770","name":"Marlboro Menthol v3 "}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
