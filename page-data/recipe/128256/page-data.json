I like that FE Lemon is more of a natural lemon and I think it stands out a little better over the Juicy Lemon and it doesn’t fade as much. I chose LA Lemonade mostly to add some tartness but I also like that sweet, slightly candied taste that it brings. \r\n\r\nI left the percentages the same as the original flavors I was using in the recipe. Those numbers may be adjusted in time but for now, I think it’s pretty good.
