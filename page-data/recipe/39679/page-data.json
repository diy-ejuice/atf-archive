I thought it was amazing at the time. Revisiting it, I decided that the two main flavours were TFA Banana and TFA VBIC, followed by a metric fuck-tonne of sucralose.\r\nHonestly this juice could just be 10% Banana, 4% VBIC and 1% Sucralose. I can't be certain but that would be my guess. \r\nBut anyway we can keep the essence of it and tweak/improve it without going overboard with extra flavourings/complications.\r\n\r\nTFA Banana is the main note so I used a substantial amount and gave it a little Banana Cream to stop it from being too linear. \r\nTFA VBIC is the main Cream used, smooth and creamy with a vanilla kick. A little TFA Dairy Milk to add to the milkshake and keep it from getting too heavy.\r\nLastly TFA Cheesecake (GC) just enough to thicken, not enough to turn it to into a malted milk. \r\nAnd don't forget that Sucralose! Enough to be somewhat sweet, can be dropped a little but it is necessary to capture the essence of the original.\r\n\r\nThe original reminded me of a McDonalds milkshake, pretty straightforward and linear.\r\nI started this cloning process a couple of months ago, trying to make it too complicated, trying endless combinations and in the end it boiled down to two flavourings really. The extra flavourings just round it out, it is very close to 1-1.\r\nLet me know what you think if you mix it!
