For an S and V it is pretty good.  The lemon is present, but mostly in the back.  The crepe pairs well with it.  Not overly sweet.  Could definitely be an all day vape.  The flavors are very well balanced and not over powering.  Good job.  &#xD;\n"}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"128591","name":"Nice lemon sugar pancake"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
