I added FLV Jammy Berry to make it stickier and add other berries and sweetness. CAP NY Cheesecake creates the slightly cheese-y inside and OOO whipped cream and vanilla custard are there for body and creaminess. Zeppola is giving the pastry effect with NR Sugar crunch to add a \"crunch\" or fried note. You can nix the berries and add whatever fruit/etc of your choice or none at all.
