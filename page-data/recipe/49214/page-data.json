It is usually the cornerstone of any recipe it joins, as it is highly potent and hard to subdue. Thus, we use it here at a careful 0.3%. Shisha Punch also blends famously well with the oily, zesty nature of FW Blood Orange, used here at 2.5%. Once again, the two are joined successfully for a light mulled-orange spice.\r\n\r\nHere, we blend the subtly-spiced orange base together with the fragrant fruit combo of the amazing FLV Persimmon, and our old reliable pal, TFA Pear. A simple recipe sure to set your olfactory system right again. (A great cure for olfactory fatigue, a.k.a: Vaper's Tongue, as well) \r\n\r\nWorks great as a shake-and-vape. Allow 48 hours for the Shisha Punch to back down a bit for a nice balance.\r\n\r\nI do hope you enjoy!\r\n\r\n(INW Shisha Punch also works best as a dilution. When using a 10% dilution, one can add more to a given recipe. This achieves a higher accuracy with a flavoring where ONE SINGLE extra drop can be the difference between awesome and offensive.) \r\n\r\n(The 0.3% noted here is the full-strength, non-diluted commercial flavoring.)","steep_days":"2 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"total_reviews":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-06T07:15:02.000-05:00","best_vg":"60%","views":"1057","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Persimmon","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":700},{"name":"Blood Orange","vendor":"FW","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Pear","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":4500},{"name":"Shisha Punch","vendor":"INW","millipercent":300}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"49214","name":"Summer Spice: A Marriage Of Persimmon & Pear"}}}
