The angel cake and whitw cake blend to make a wonderful white cake and the flv cup cake batter give it that inner moist cake flavor.  The cake is surrounded by layers of flaky delicious croissant crust.  Sugar orchid gives the cake a wonderful pop of deliciousness!  Of course the flakey cake needs a drizzle of powdered sugar frosting.  \r\nI have been searching cakes for the past col years and this one is by far my favorite so far!  Give it a try you'll love it!  It turned out absolutely delicious!! Not too light not too dense but just right!  I cant put it down its so good!","steep_days":"5 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-06T22:02:53.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"1377","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Angel Cake SC","flavor_id":"9014","vendor":"WF","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Cake (White)","flavor_id":"8470","vendor":"FW","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Croissant","flavor_id":"8867","vendor":"VT","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Cupcake batter","flavor_id":"2596","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Frosting","flavor_id":"4412","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Sugar Orchid","flavor_id":"8571","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":500}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"112731","name":"Le'Croissant Mille Frulle Cake"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
