Mixed on SaturDIY'ing with Fresh03 & Friends with a Michigan theme to protest the flavor ban initiative. I like this one, the bakery is well rounded and rich with the buttery syrup complementing the cornbread and the muffin, and the sweet, hot and blistered blueberry gorging this treat. It vapes really well at high wattages and the SolubArôme elderberry is just the right twist.\r\n\r\nFLV Blueberry Muffin/OOO Corn Bread/FLV Cream = The soft, moist, well-baked muffin. No bakery ever suffered from 1% of FLV Cream. Do you like a lush, fresh baked good? Add some crème fraîche in it.\r\n\r\nFW Blueberry/WF Boysenberry/SA Baie de Sureau = A good, blue, hot and baked blueberry. The elderberry really gives it personality and that sensation of a baked dark berry with a little twist on the exhale, I like it a lot.\r\n\r\nVT Golden Syrup/FA Mapple Syrup/FA Butterscotch =  I like this combo, I just change the percentages according to the flavor profile I want in my syrup. Here I wanted the buttery brown baked sweetness of golden syrup to help the cornbread, just a little brightened by that maple that compliments blueberries so well.\r\n\r\nThis is a gooey, lavish, warm and syrupy cornbread muffin that you'd love to eat and will like vaping.\r\n\r\nEnjoy, be queer & vape on!\r\n\r\n[Photo Credits: TINA JUI for www.theworktop.com ]","steep_days":"5","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"total_reviews":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T07:01:24.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"898","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Blueberry Muffin","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Boysenberry Raspberry SC","vendor":"WF","millipercent":750},{"name":"Blueberry","vendor":"FW","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Baie de Sureau","vendor":"SA","millipercent":750},{"name":"Corn Bread","vendor":"OOO","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Golden Syrup","vendor":"VT","millipercent":500},{"name":"Maple Syrup","vendor":"FA","millipercent":250},{"name":"Butterscotch","vendor":"FA","millipercent":250},{"name":"Cream","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1000}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"165935","name":"Kindground Blues (Blueberry Cornbread Muffin)"}}}
