The already fruity notes of it blended well with strawberry and kiwi, then finished off with a light floral note.

I ordered black tea from flavorah for another couple recipes, and Bryson threw red tea in as a bonus and I found this...and I'm glad I did.  I could easily carry this to work with me and bust through the whole bottle in a couple days.","score":5},{"user":"MECH_MOD_RN","text":"this is a nice  easy  all day  vape the red tea  sits at the base and the  fruit  come through in the top.   the cucumber is very subtle for me and noticeable on the exhale but definitely there .  A nicely balanced mix &#xD;\nOkay    hot day and found this again  and vaped the WHOLE dang 30  ml.. and now need to mix MORE and MORE.. think I may add a touch of mint  or even that sorbet     this is soo   dam good  and simple!!!!
