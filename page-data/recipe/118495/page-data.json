I like the sweet tea as the main flavor with a small amount of green tea to give it some more body. Koolada is added because , this is after all a cold beverage. I want to keep it as authentic as possible in that realm.\r\n\r\n“Tea Syrup” - INW and FLV Raspberry with FA White Peach. I’ve used either of these raspberry’s separately in the past, I wanted something that tasted both real and candy-like. I put in a small amount of FA white peach to give the raspberry something to pop off of. I also like the harshness of white peach and feel like it gives me a nice bit of TH.\r\n\r\nFinally, I’m using stevia in this mix for now. I haven’t tried it but will often reach for CAP super sweet when I need sweetener. \r\n","steep_days":"2 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-06T20:44:15.000-05:00","best_vg":"30%","views":"1334","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Green Tea","flavor_id":"1640","vendor":"FE","millipercent":500},{"name":"Sweet Tea","flavor_id":"369","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":5000},{"name":"Raspberry","flavor_id":"667","vendor":"INW","millipercent":500},{"name":"Raspberry","flavor_id":"606","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Koolada 10 Pg","flavor_id":"280","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":250},{"name":"Stevia Solutions (10% PG)","flavor_id":"5559","vendor":"NN","millipercent":250},{"name":"Peach White","flavor_id":"543","vendor":"FA","millipercent":250}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"118495","name":"Instant satisfaction"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
