Its a strawberry cake batter flavor and believe it or not i cant even begin to come close to making it like they do. But then again it has been around 3 years since i was buying this e juice so maybe i am closer than i think. So because i dont think my spoon licker is as good as the original i have never released one of my spoon licker remixes. So instead of going after spoon licker i decided to go after a different yet close profile. I went with a strawberry cake batter and and wowzer is it good.  I mean it is just an over glorified strawberry cream so how can it be bad?\r\n\r\nSweeten to taste with your preferred sweetener.","steep_days":"5","temperature":"420","recipe_score":4.5,"total_reviews":3,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:50:22.000-05:00","best_vg":"75%","views":"4455","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Strawberry Gelato – Super Concentrate","vendor":"RF","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Strawberry (ripe)","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Cupcake batter","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":750},{"name":"Cake Batter","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":750},{"name":"Vanilla Cream Extra SC","vendor":"WF","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Frozen Yogurt SC","vendor":"WF","millipercent":2000}],"reviews":[{"user":"Wildgypsy","score":"none","text":"This is one of my favorites right now. I usually have a hard time with Caps Cake Batter, but you’ve managed to tame it. Very nice, creamy, buttery vape.  Definitely made me happy that I bought Strawberry Gelato. Super yummy! Thank you for this one!!!"},{"user":"fcomputerg","score":"5","text":"I agree to a point with a steep of 10 days for the ccb to loose it's nasty... but then it starts to come into a adv for me. the rf gelato is such a nice different strawberry that makes this nice and different."},{"user":"ooooNaSuGamisoooo","score":"4","text":"i tried it after a 7 days steep and i wasn't impressed. today... 25 days later is indeed a full creamy/buttery vape! although a touch of dragonfruit TPA will help the strawberries in this long steep time"}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"113863","name":"Battered Berry \"Strawberry cake batter gelato\""}}}
