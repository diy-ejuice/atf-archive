Derived from many of the available Heisenberg clones, tuned towards the VE version. It's close enough that I'll settle.\r\n\r\nTFA Blueberry Candy - The base blueberry. Works great here at 5%. \r\nTFA Raspberry Sweet - Adds another dimension to the blueberry candy. More of a dark, fuzzy berry background.\r\nCap Bubble Gum - There is a clear bubble gum note in Heisenberg, cap at 4% is weak enough but closely resembles the bubblegum undertones.\r\nCap Double Apple - Slightly crispy, bright apple note necessary in the mix.\r\nSour - Pumps up the blueberry.\r\nKoolada/Menthol - Cold, icy finish. Clears out the sinuses, even at this low % (yes it's low, I'd even hazard upping menthol to 2%, but that's just me being a fuckwit).\r\nSweetener - Nothing to say here. Pretty much add this to everything, ties in a sweetness to the other flavours that is vital (imo). \r\n\r\nMixed @ 40/60. Great as a S&V. I wont lie and say it's exact or anything, but it hits the same satisfying notes of the original with some different intricacies. The OG has anise of some sort, and no raspberry. However this will do me fine until VE makes some one shots ðŸ‘Œ","steep_days":"1 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:49:53.000-05:00","best_vg":"60%","views":"5352","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Blueberry Candy (pg)","flavor_id":"216","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":5000},{"name":"Raspberry (sweet)","flavor_id":"267","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Sour","flavor_id":"336","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Koolada 10 Pg","flavor_id":"280","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":600},{"name":"Sweetener","flavor_id":"339","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Bubble Gum","flavor_id":"21","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Double Apple","flavor_id":"45","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":500},{"name":"Aroma Arctic Winter (menthol Artic)","flavor_id":"514","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000}],"reviews":[{"user":"Tomaccoboy","text":"Thanks for posting this, it's pretty close to the profile of the retail juice."}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"85940","name":"Blueberry Ice [Vapoureyes: Heisenberg remix]"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
