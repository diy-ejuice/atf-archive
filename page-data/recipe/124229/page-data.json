It also had Croissant for the little bakery I was looking for instead of cookies and cream. This version is the winner!\r\n\r\nReally enjoying this one! First vape with chocolate that I can vape all day.\r\n\r\n\"Together lets discover\" :)\r\n\r\nI prefer this recipe with a small % of sweetener.it really helps the chocolate come thru in a more realistic way.\r\n\r\n","steep_days":"5","temperature":"0","recipe_score":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-10T14:52:56.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"1191","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Banana Custard","flavor_id":"8825","vendor":"VT","millipercent":3500},{"name":"Chocolate Mousse","flavor_id":"9371","vendor":"VT","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Cookies and Cream","flavor_id":"10008","vendor":"VT","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Devon Cream","flavor_id":"8869","vendor":"VT","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Pudding Base","flavor_id":"8948","vendor":"VT","millipercent":1500}],"reviews":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"124229","name":"Choconanna Puddin #diydownunderallaboardchallenge"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
