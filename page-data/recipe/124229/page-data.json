It also had Croissant for the little bakery I was looking for instead of cookies and cream. This version is the winner!\r\n\r\nReally enjoying this one! First vape with chocolate that I can vape all day.\r\n\r\n\"Together lets discover\" :)\r\n\r\nI prefer this recipe with a small % of sweetener.it really helps the chocolate come thru in a more realistic way.\r\n\r\n","steep_days":"5","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"total_reviews":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-01T07:51:54.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"1183","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Banana Custard","vendor":"VT","millipercent":3500},{"name":"Chocolate Mousse","vendor":"VT","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Cookies and Cream","vendor":"VT","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Devon Cream","vendor":"VT","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Pudding Base","vendor":"VT","millipercent":1500}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"124229","name":"Choconanna Puddin #diydownunderallaboardchallenge"}}}
