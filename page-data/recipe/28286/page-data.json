Helps smooth out the horchata.\r\n\r\nCap horchata.\r\n\r\nAt 3% it's perfect for blending with the other ingredients. Stands out over the vanilla custard and CDS but doesn't over power the cream fresh and really feels like a  creamy milk with horchata.\r\n\r\nCap cinnamon danish swirl.\r\n\r\nThis is to just give the horchata a slight boost to make it a little more complex and the feel of a touch of cinnamon.\r\n\r\nI'm proud of this recipe and I hope you like it.\r\n\r\n","steep_days":"14","temperature":"0","recipe_score":4,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:49:02.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"1868","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Horchata","flavor_id":"74","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Cream Fresh","flavor_id":"540","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Cinnamon Danish Swirl","flavor_id":"35","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Vanilla Custard","flavor_id":"131","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":3000}],"reviews":[{"user":"bjorama","text":"Frustrating when a recipe you post gets mixed 500+ times and theres no reviews..  SMH..  &#xD;\nI mixed this up exactly 2 weeks ago and waited for the recommended steep.  You wrote it was milk forward with a Horchata back note and thats exactly what I'm getting.  At first taste, I was thinking it was a little light on the Horchata but now I realize that was the plan all along.  Pretty good vape all around, could use maybe just a touch of sweetener for my liking to have that sweet note linger a little longer, but it's good the way it is written.  If you have variations of the Horchata being more forward, I would definately give that one a mix too.  Thanks for posting!
