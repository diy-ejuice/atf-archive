I wanted to use Shisha Strw, but I thought that with a cherry flavor we might end up entering syrup territory. With the addition of FA Fuji, and Cap Golden Pineapple it really thins it out. Let me know what your thoughts are, I honestly haven't even vaped this. She said she was pretty happy with it though. \r\n\r\nThanks\r\n\r\nPS. AKA some late shit, the reason that this is still in the title: My fiance's friend said she wanted to try some juice, and like a month and a half later I got it to her. It wasn't renamed Medley until the night I gave her a bottle.
