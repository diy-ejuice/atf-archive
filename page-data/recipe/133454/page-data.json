This is a simple mix that somehow has loads of complexity. Notes below.\r\n\r\nTHE CIGARETTE\r\nFLV Kentucky Blend/FLV Virginia Tobacco - After months of testing different tobaccos to create IPA Smoke, I realized that these two work really well together to create a pseudo-cigarette profile. The Kentucky Blend is earthy, dark, dirty, and deep. It has smokey notes in it, some subtle sweetness, but overall, it's just a delicious dark pipe tobacco that really gives some \"ash\" on the back end after a few days of steeping. Virginia Tobacco, is light and dry. It has more of that light cigarette tobacco feel to it. There's some bitterness that plays really nicely with the sweetness of Kentucky Blend. In this mix, using Virginia Tobacco at a higher percentage helps fight the overt sweetness we get from the strawberry and brown sugar. Back in college, I made a friend that rolled his own cigarettes using a blend of cherry pipe tobacco with some full bodied cigarette tobacco. I fell in love with those smokes. To me, the mix of FLV Kentucky Blend with FLV Virginia Tobacco is almost a perfect emulation of those cigarettes I used to bum from him.\r\n\r\nTHE STRAWBERRY\r\nINW Shisha Strawberry/TPA Brown Sugar - When working with profiles like tobaccos, custards, ice creams, etc, I've found that INW Shisha Strawberry works incredibly well. I typically rock the FA Strawberry/CAP Sweet Strawberry combination when I'm creating full fruit profiles. But in this mix, using that combination was pretty disgusting. Which isn't too surprising. Who wants a candied strawberry profile with a dirty cigarette? Probably no one. Or maybe a fucking coward. Who knows. But with INW Shisha Strawberry, we get a nice blend of a deep, slightly overripe, authentic strawberry with a touch of sweetness. I've read before that mixing INW Shisha Strawberry with things like caramel and dark sugar doesn't really work. While that may be true for typical application, we can see that this is not your standard strawberry recipe. In this, the addition of TPA Brown Sugar not only amplifies the nuances within the tobaccos, but also nearly exaggerates the overripe sweetness of the strawberry.\r\n\r\nSTEEP TIME\r\nShake and vape is definitely good, but after 3 days, the strawberries and tobaccos blend together into something special. Before the steep, the two stay fairly separate, but after a few days, they meld together and we get, truly, a strawberry cigarette.\r\n\r\nThis is a weird profile, I admit. It's strange, not an ADV by any stretch of the imagination. However, I find myself constantly wanting it for a few hits. It's really odd, really tasty, and a good way for ya boy to start off 2019.","steep_days":"3 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"updated_at":"2020-12-12T20:30:39.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"2288","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Kentucky Blend","flavor_id":"4362","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Virginia Tobacco","flavor_id":"623","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Shisha Strawberry","flavor_id":"1711","vendor":"INW","millipercent":2250},{"name":"Brown Sugar","flavor_id":"313","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1000}],"reviews":[{"user":"praotec","text":"","score":5},{"user":"Xist","text":"I absolutely love this strange ass juice.
