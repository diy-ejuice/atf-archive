VT Sweet Cream and NYCC make up the filling, while WF cannoli Shell and Biscuit Base make a delicious spicy wrapper.  Subbing VT Sweet Cream with VT Creme Brulee at the same percentage is also a tasty combination.  I also like to add 0.25% FA Meringue for added sweetness. Anyways, itâ€™s good.  Hope you enjoy!","steep_days":"3 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"total_reviews":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T22:33:44.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"945","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Pistachio","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Toasted Almond","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":500},{"name":"Persian Lime","vendor":"VT","millipercent":500},{"name":"Cannoli Shell SC","vendor":"WF","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Biscuit Base","vendor":"VT","millipercent":1000},{"name":"New York Cheesecake","vendor":"FA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Sweet Cream","vendor":"VT","millipercent":1500}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"163737","name":"Pistachio Lime Cannoli"}}}
