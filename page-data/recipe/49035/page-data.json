I had so many different strawberry and banana flavors that I had ordered during sales and tossed in the flavor box but none were sounding appetizing. Once I found the Delosi huckleberry I knew what to do. Surely I couldn't go wrong with some SA Doughnut AKA Beignet, some custard, french vanilla and a fruit. But based on the notes I had read for SA Doughnuts and RF Deep Fried Twinkie I knew the two had to meet. The SA Doughnut and the RF Deep Fried Twinkie give me that greasy doughy sweet dense doughnut flavor and texture I love so much. The TPA Vanilla Custard (my CAP VC1 is still packed away somewhere) and CAP French Vanilla create the creme filling and the Delosi Huckleberry give it a nice sweet huckleberry note that is just delightful. Surprisingly great as a shake and vape and will only improve with at least 5 days of steeping.","steep_days":"5 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T02:15:14.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"1366","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Beignet","flavor_id":"5640","vendor":"SA","millipercent":5000},{"name":"Vanilla Custard","flavor_id":"188","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":3000},{"name":"French Vanilla","flavor_id":"56","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Deep Fried Twinkie Type â€“ SC","flavor_id":"7491","vendor":"RF","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Huckleberry","flavor_id":"6211","vendor":"DF","millipercent":1000}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"49035","name":"HBCD - Huckleberry Cream Donut"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
