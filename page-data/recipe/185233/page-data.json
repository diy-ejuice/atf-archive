At the time I had not tried it though. This is two months later and I got my hand on some of it. I tried it and instantly knew that tfa honeydew and tfa watermelon candy were the crux of this one. I couldnt in good conscious not use the better ingredients we have available. So I guess this is technically a remix but either way enjoy. Sweetener is not optional here. Made a couple adjustments, lowered the big watermelon to 5% and upped the tfa hd2 to 3%.","steep_days":"2","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:51:23.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"2122","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Big Watermelon","flavor_id":"1518","vendor":"MB","millipercent":5000},{"name":"Wild Melon","flavor_id":"619","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Super Sweet","flavor_id":"2384","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":500},{"name":"Honeydew II","flavor_id":"9930","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":3000}],"reviews":[{"user":"morencyam","text":"Well done. Honeydew Chew is one of my favorite juices. While it's not a 1:1 clone, it's pretty close. Pretty tasty SNV. I imagine it'll get better after a couple days of steeping. Probably going to add this to one of the regular mixes. Nice work"}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"185233","name":"Honeydew Melon Chew (clone/remix)"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
