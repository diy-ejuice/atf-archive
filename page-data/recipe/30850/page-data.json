With only 4 flavors to work with one from each vendor. I had to make this as tasty as possible. So here is what I used\r\n1.BLUEBERRY FW- This is a great blueberry and at 5% gives off a great flavor of blueberry but not to overpowering in the recipe. \r\n2. Cap Sugar Cookie- I used this as the texture that would give this Milkshake the Malted Flavor feel. Honestly might have used Cream fresh instead but like I said limited to 1 flavor from each company I felt this would give the body needed to make the recipe without sacrificing flavor. \r\n3. TFA VBIC at 4% gives off that nice vanilla ice cream taste that you need in a Milkshake. \r\n4. FA Vienna Cream- to me this is the star of the show at 1.5% really brings in that creaminess as well as the nice vanilla Cream flavor,\r\nEnhancer - FW Sweetner at .75% adds to the sweetness to make this recipe stand out. It really makes the blueberry pop. \r\n@MatthewKocanda this is my recipe for our little comp.
