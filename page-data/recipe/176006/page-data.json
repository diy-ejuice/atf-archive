Pumped up by:\r\n- Dx Peanut Butter - the most realistic, but little bodied\r\n- Peanut Butter - brings it out forward, not letting it fade\r\n- INW Shisha Vanilla - the base, rounds it off giving body and a touch of sweetness.\r\n\r\nClear as water - will not gunk your coils, which is a great plus!\r\nNeeds little steep, 2 days to come together, but can be S&V.\r\n","steep_days":"2 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"total_reviews":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T14:14:15.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"772","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Tobacco Tobacco Symphony","vendor":"INW","millipercent":1200},{"name":"Shisha Vanilla","vendor":"INW","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Dx Peanut Butter","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Peanut Butter","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":500}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"176006","name":"Nutty Pleasures"}}}
