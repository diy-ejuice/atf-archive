The key with  using these flavors  is creating a dairy note that provides a  sweet creaminess with out  being overtly  a bakery cream. \r\n**Catalan cream and Devon cream** add some of the additional notes  of dark chocolate, caramel and spice.\r\n**Holy vanilla ** adds a creamy milkiness and come vanilla bean notes .\r\n**FLV milk and honey** add that thick  dark sweetness that I wanted  as the base.  \r\n**VT bourbon** is slightly fruity sweet  bourbon which brings some  boozzie notes .  The alcohol note falls off after a steep with the cream.  **TPA Kentucky Bourbon** adds some of the bourbon body that is lacking in the VT bourbon\r\n\r\n\r\n**Looking to learn more about how to make your own mixes - Check out what DIY Downunder has to offer:**\r\nhttps://www.facebook.com/groups/diydownunder/\r\nhttps://discord.gg/kH4Fqbc\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCTCwb7ULyfJALQlehomZZQA\r\nhttps://www.diydownunder.com/\r\n","steep_days":"14","temperature":"0","recipe_score":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-10T13:45:38.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"1197","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Bavarian Cream","flavor_id":"4466","vendor":"JF","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Holy Vanilla","flavor_id":"2385","vendor":"DFS","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Bourbon","flavor_id":"8839","vendor":"VT","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Catalan Cream","flavor_id":"483","vendor":"FA","millipercent":750},{"name":"Devon Cream","flavor_id":"8869","vendor":"VT","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Milk & Honey","flavor_id":"609","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Kentucky Bourbon","flavor_id":"361","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Sweetness","flavor_id":"4413","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":300}],"reviews":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"113453","name":"Buckhead Bourbon Cream "}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
