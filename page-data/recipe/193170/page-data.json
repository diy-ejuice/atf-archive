WF Strawberry Gummy, MB Blue Rock Candy, Flavorah Vanilla Marshmallow............\r\n\r\n(insert cartoon skid sound effect here)\r\n\r\nHang on a minute, this is a legit cocktail recipe?\r\nBased around this cocktail üçπ\r\nhttps://mixthatdrink.com/loco-unicorn-loconut-cocktail/\r\n\r\nI began research like a wide eyed unicorn does and realize this is far more complex than I thought this was going to be at first, gulp üò≤.\r\n\r\nThis is based around Captain Morgan LocoNut which is made with Caribbean rum and coconut liqueur. Then I see that there is Cura√ßao which is a blue colored liqueur flavored with the dried peel of the bitter orange laraha. The mind thinks omg I don't even know how to pronounce this, but I need to get down to the liqueur shop and try this.\r\n\r\nI thought better than to rush on down to the shops then come home and get plastered on this, as it would only cloud my brain even more.\r\nRather, I took the route of doing some \"hangover free\" online flavor research.\r\n\r\nWith that and a few other fancy sparkles popping off in my head I got to work and mixed the following recipe that I think could be not only my most unique work, but technically my best yet in 4 years of mixing.\r\n\r\nWhile I understand that not everyone will have the flavors here, I highly recommend in getting them all. From a technical aspect there are no subs. Each ingredient here is spectacularly balanced to create what I think here is magical‚ú®.\r\n\r\n- The DV Parma Violet is magical and really brings the sparkles here.\r\n- The Euro flavors Blue Raspberry is the most rounded, smooth and full\r\nflavored version on the market right now in my opinion.\r\n- The Molinberry Pineapple Lassi has essential notes of flavor that totally\r\nfit here.\r\n- The base milk of OOO Coconut Milk & WF Coconut Rum is linear and\r\nis essential to the body of this profile.\r\n- The SSM Orange Liqueur brings a level of mild complexity yet\r\nauthentic notes to help emulate the Cura√ßao liqueur.\r\n- OOO Powdered Sugar helps to give that fine dusting of magical\r\nsweetness overall.\r\n\r\nAnd just like that BOOM !!! ‚ú®üåàü¶Ñ\r\nThere are unicorn Sparkles off the shake!\r\nA day later I taste again and the rich body of flavor with all the sparkles around the edges are still present. Most of the experience is on the exhale and the lingering notes left on the palette after going on a magical journey through a few clouds is just lovely.\r\nThe rum notes are definitely present, not to heavy or not to light. They balance and play well in with the blend of the Blue raspberry and Pineapple Lassi.\r\n\r\nThis has been a fun mix to create!\r\nI hope you enjoy mixing this as much as I have enjoyed this creative process. Let me know what you thought in the comments below.\r\n\r\nSimply mix and enjoy off the shake but allow 3 days for best results!\r\n\r\nI enjoy this at 60W on a Single 0.2ohm SST coil on a Recurve RDA.\r\n\r\nSeriously if you like a solid recipe that works give it a go!\r\n\r\nCheers for reading this far, now go and get mixing!\r\n\r\nMake your Magic Happen! ‚ú®üíñ\r\n\r\n\"Together, Let's Discover!!!\"\r\n\r\nFacebook - https://www.facebook.com/groups/diydownunder/\r\nDiscord - https://discord.gg/kH4Fqbc\r\nYoutube - https://www.youtube.com/c/diydownunder\r\nWebsite - https://www.diydownunder.com/\r\nInstagram IGTV : @diydownunder\r\n","steep_days":"3","temperature":"0","recipe_score":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-12T14:08:01.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"1279","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Blue Raspberry","flavor_id":"10230","vendor":"EUR","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Coconut Milk","flavor_id":"1965","vendor":"OOO","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Coconut Rum SC","flavor_id":"10012","vendor":"WF","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Orange Liqueur","flavor_id":"8345","vendor":"SI","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Parma Violet","flavor_id":"5410","vendor":"DV","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Pineapple Lassi","flavor_id":"10397","vendor":"MB","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Powdered Sugar","flavor_id":"6522","vendor":"OOO","millipercent":1500}],"reviews":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"193170","name":"Unicorns ü¶Ñand Rainbows üåà "}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
