I'm avoiding any chocolate aspect for the moment because I think it would overpower the whole mix and power over the caramel and coconut, which are the main flavors I like to taste in a samoa.\r\n\r\nTPA Graham cracker clear: Help out the fa cookie. Bring some sweetness and a little vanilla/spice \r\n\r\nTFA bavarian cream: Sweeten up the mix. Thicken up the mouthfeel. Bring some fullness to the dryness of the cookie.","steep_days":"10 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T19:15:47.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"1633","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Cookie","vendor":"FA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Carmel (caramel)","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Coco' (coconut)","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Graham Cracker Clear","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Bavarian Cream","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Super Sweet","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1000}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"124367","name":"Samoa"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
