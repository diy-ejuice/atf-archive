Enjoy chasing the Lepershawn!\r\n\r\nThe Irish make it queer without me having to look too far. Enjoy the pistachio, the lucky marshmallow, and the butter rainbow cookie all at once!\r\n\r\nTo be fair, this thing is a monster, but I'll try to explain the idea. I know it looks like I through a lot of stuff together and got fairyfied, but there's a logic to the madness.\r\n\r\nFA Marshmallow/FA Meringue/ TPA Lucky Leprechaun =  That your marshmallow fluff. FA Marshmallow is my favorite marshmallow and I also find that it fades the least. TPA lucky Leprechaun is a marshmallow cereal and I think the dryness of it works well to support the pistachio and sobber up the cookie.\r\n\r\nWF Almond Cookie/TPA Pistachio/FLV Pudding = that's your pistachio pudding, and if you want this thing to taste like pistachio, don't hesitate to go nuts! WF Almond Cookie also supports the rainbow cookie deal in this mess.\r\n\r\nCAP Sugar Cookie/CAP Buttercream = That's your rainbow buttery cookie that liaise decently with the pudding and the marshmallow.\r\n\r\nAnd there you have it, my March madness. Oh and steep it, it's absolutely weird on the shake.\r\n\r\nEnjoy, be queer & vape on!\r\n\r\n[Photo credit: www.sugarhero.com ]","steep_days":"14","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-06T12:56:03.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"1228","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Vanilla Pudding","flavor_id":"4433","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Marshmallow","flavor_id":"473","vendor":"FA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Lucky Leprechaun Cereal","flavor_id":"141","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Butter Cream","flavor_id":"3","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Almond Cookie SC","flavor_id":"9013","vendor":"WF","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Meringue","flavor_id":"530","vendor":"FA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Pistachio","flavor_id":"293","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":6000},{"name":"Sugar Cookie","flavor_id":"115","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":3000}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"142850","name":"Queerstacio Lucky Pudding (Pistachio Rainbow Cookie Marshmallow Pudding)"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
