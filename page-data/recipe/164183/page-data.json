He created such an amazingly simple and authentic cheesecake base, who was I not to use it. \r\n\r\nTPA Banana Cream: This flavor doesn't lend to much to cream in my opinion, but it has one of the best banana flavors out there. I didn't want anything too nutty so this seemed like the best/only option for what I was going for.\r\n\r\nTPA Coconut Candy: I can't imagine a banana cheesecake with out a touch, just a touch, of coconut flavor. While there are plenty of good coconut flavorings out there, I find this one lends a helping hand to the banana while also providing that smidgen of coconut flavor that I was aiming for. Subtle, as I imagined.\r\n\r\nFA Cookie: Crust. What is a cheesecake or a pie without a crust, right? Some will argue that there are better concentrates to emulate a crust out there, but this one has a FEEL that others don't. I chose this flavoring for that reason alone. I'm glad I did.\r\n\r\n","steep_days":"0 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T20:33:10.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"818","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Yes, We Cheesecake","vendor":"INW","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Yogurt","vendor":"FW","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Banana Cream","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":5000},{"name":"Coconut Candy","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Cookie","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Super Sweet","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":500}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"164183","name":"Platanomas"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
