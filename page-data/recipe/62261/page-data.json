You're home alone. You worked hard all day. Hell, all week. You deserve a nice night to yourself. Some \"you\" time. You know just what you want. No...just what you need. \r\nAs you glide across the kitchen floor wearing only your socks, you press the button which preheats the oven as you ease perfectly in front of the refrigerator. You open it with your right hand, spinning with the left to caress and lift that which you've come for, finishing the spin as a method to shut the refrigerator door, all in one smooth flourish. \r\nYou crack open that beautiful pack of cinnamon rolls and butter cream icing, so, so beautiful...you turn to prepare and grease a baking pan but something's wrong...you can't. \r\nYour eyes, fixated on the rolls, they see more than just a pastry. Your nose, sniffing their delicious cinnamon and..is that nutmeg?? It smells more than seasoning. Your mouth, connected to your nose, dripping with saliva to ease the passage of the sacred goods, it makes you swallow audibly. Your hands begin to tremble, your muscles twitching. \r\nYou can't take it any fucking more!\r\nYou dive in, pure adrenaline, a primal animal, massacring the bounty which you've been blessed with. There are chunks ripped and torn. Your eyes burn because of all the cinnamon in the air. Your fingers are stained red below the dripping coagulation of icing that has become somehow everywhere. \r\nSlurping and cackling like a mad man, you finally fall to the ground, content, rewarded, seduced and subdued. \r\n~Fin~\r\n\r\nThat's what I want his vape to do for you guys. I want this to be the fucking king of all cinnamon vapes because I've been searching and hunting and tracking this flavor profile since I started mixing.\r\n\r\n I didn't discover cinnamon danish swirl until very late/recently in my mixing game so since I found it I've been very excited to play with it. While I totally enjoy the serious snickerdoodle presence it offers, I don't want it to make just another cookie vape, nothing against cookie vapes but the mouthfeel never really gives me a \"cookie\" vibe in anything I've mixed, so I decided to combine this with another more preferred flavor profile/mouthfeel of mine that I've been working on for a good while too: milk.\r\n\r\n I drew inspiration from the  Snickerdoodle Custard recipe on ATF, it got me thinking in the right direction for this vape so shouts out to @CenCalVape for sharing this one üôè\r\n\r\nA good SnV, mostly cinnamon on the inhale but the creams are very much present in the exhale, that nice dairy milky aftertaste that I do love. To do her justice she really needs to steep for at least a few days, the longer the better, the creams just settle in and fill out their milky profile while blending with cinnamon so well, honestly I could've named this Cinnamon Toast Crunch milk, and I probably should've! But as that wasn't my intended profile, I didn't. \r\n\r\nPlease let me know what you think, any suggestions, comments, questions, criticisms, shouts of rage, anything at all and I've got the ears to hear it. \r\n\r\nThanks so much for all of the love so far ATF family, between advice via messaging and previous reviews and comments and other helpful feedback, this has just been an awesome experience so far and if anybody is on the fringe of posting recipes but is worried about not being \"good enough,\" this has been such a welcoming and learning experience, I would really urge any and all to share the knowledge and hone your skills because the more info/recipes that get posted, the more tasty the recipes will become and informed we all will be! \r\n\r\nBesides, a wise man once told me if you aren't a little embarrassed by your first attempt at something, you waited too long to try it ‚úåÔ∏è","steep_days":"7 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":4.5,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:49:34.000-05:00","best_vg":"80%","views":"2405","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Cinnamon Danish Swirl","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Sweet Cream","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Cream Fresh","vendor":"FA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Butter Cream","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1000}],"reviews":[{"user":"ParkusMaximusIII","text":"Occam's Razor at its best. I find that sometimes when I am creating a recipe I tend to overthink it and add too much when it is not needed - as I'm sure all of us mixers do at some point in our DIY career - and this recipe is a great reminder of that. That being said, I don't get much horchata from this mix, instead I get that \"Cinnamon Toast Crunch Milk\" vibe you stated in the description. By no means am I disappointed - I fucking love CTC - but I do believe that using a different cinnamon - perhaps FLV Rich Cinnamon - would help you achieve the profile you set out to achieve. This is a good SnV and does get better with a few days age. To better suit my tastes I added .5% CAP SS but it is still delicious without it. This is a bomb recipe and I would highly suggest mixing it up! I'm excited to see what you do with this recipe if you decide to go further with it.
