Hope you all can dig it. I loved the original juice. I just couldn't nail it one for one. So I tried to take it's characteristics and make one I could settle with. And honestly it taste pretty close to the original. It's good after 4-5 days but I let it sit for about a week or two. \r\n\r\nI've been vaping this stuff for about 2 months now. And well it being remix month I'd figure I'd share it\r\n\r\nI also use cap super sweet. 1 drop per 15 mls.
