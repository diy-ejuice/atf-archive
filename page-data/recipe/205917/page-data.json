Make it sweeter if you want by adding flv sweetness at .5%, or leave it as is (the caramel adds some already). Want this warmer?? Add .2 flv heat. Want it colder? .2 flv ice. \r\n\r\nBoozier? Bump bourbon to .5% (it'll be real boozy there)\r\nSpicier?? Bump Pumpkin Spice to .75%\r\nCreamier? Take cream to 1%\r\n\r\nThis recipe is so easily tinkered with, making it a big winner in my book.\r\n\r\nTested on a pixie drop with some sort of clapton with a .32ohm at 50w. I did not add sweetener to this because it is delicious without it. However you may feel that a little bit of sweetener helps coat your mouth with flavor. But flv caramel is essentially brown sugar and butterscotch and marsh vanilla are already sweeter flavors so. It isnt necessary here :)","steep_days":"7","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"total_reviews":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:51:45.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"851","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Eggnog","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1250},{"name":"Marshmallow Vanilla","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Pumpkin Spice","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":500},{"name":"Cream","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":750},{"name":"Caramel","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":500},{"name":"Butterscotch","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":750},{"name":"Bourbon","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":250}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"205917","name":"Slobb Nogginz #DevelopedFLV"}}}
