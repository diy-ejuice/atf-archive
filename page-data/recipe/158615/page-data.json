Connecticut Shade's chocolate/coffee notes lend well to blending with the chocolate mint of CdM, and they all work with cinnamon. Added some Australian Chocolate to make the chocolate the predominant non-tobacco flavor, and then the Red Burley and Native tobaccos to make it clear this is a tobacco vape.\r\n\r\nBonus for anyone who thinks they deciphered the acronym. And as always... use PEG or PDO if you're gonna mix at the suggested ratio, I don't need to end up on a Throat Offenders Registry because someone thought I meant they should vape that much PG.","steep_days":"0 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T14:14:04.000-05:00","best_vg":"60%","views":"1053","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Red Burley","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Connecticut Shade","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Rich Cinnamon","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":200},{"name":"Creme De Menthe","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":800},{"name":"Australian Chocolate","vendor":"HS","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Native Tobacco","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1000}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"158615","name":"ICatBfaSnVDTaiFGEtREJLtCMK(FCFMFYTWFHatHhRio)"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
