Tried with 0.5% WS-23 at first, but I found the coolant was overshadowing the other flavors too much.","steep_days":"1 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-12T05:50:58.000-05:00","best_vg":"65%","views":"636","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Cactus","flavor_id":"647","vendor":"INW","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Dragon Fruit - Pitaya","flavor_id":"652","vendor":"INW","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Dragonfruit","flavor_id":"226","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Elderflower","flavor_id":"3518","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":750},{"name":"Wintergreen","flavor_id":"285","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"WS-23","flavor_id":"8085","vendor":"OTHR","millipercent":250}],"reviews":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"199301","name":"Elder Dragon"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
