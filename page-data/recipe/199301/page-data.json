Tried with 0.5% WS-23 at first, but I found the coolant was overshadowing the other flavors too much.","steep_days":"1 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:51:39.000-05:00","best_vg":"65%","views":"623","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Cactus","vendor":"INW","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Dragon Fruit - Pitaya","vendor":"INW","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Dragonfruit","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Elderflower","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":750},{"name":"Wintergreen","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"WS-23","vendor":"OTHR","millipercent":250}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"199301","name":"Elder Dragon"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
