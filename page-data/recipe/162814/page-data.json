I decided to revisit the OG recipe and publish this version with one or two minor tweaks. \r\n\r\nThe hunt for a smooth, slightly sweet, caramel coffee has been, as any DIY’er will know, one of the most difficult feats to pull off. Enter Cafe Napoleon... this baby has none of the skunky coffee off notes and delivers, as per the DFS a ‘sweet and satisfying caramel infused coffee” - and they weren’t twisting the truth... This is not an in-your-face shot of espresso but rather a homage to coffee, highlighting its delicate flavours. The coffee note is moderately boosted with a touch of VT Arabica coffee, to provide a fuller coffee note, absent in the OG recipe. \r\n\r\nThe Cafe Napoleon lays the foundation here and is deservedly given a loving embrace by Holy Holy Grail which adds a delectable, but subtle, RY4 note which instantly propelles it from great to freakin fantastic! \r\n\r\nVanilla, in my opinion, is essential for a morning pick-me-up and gives this baby the legendary Holy Vanilla treatment...yuminess!\r\n\r\nThe biscuit adds a touch of texture without detracting from the protagonist and sits very well here at 1%.\r\n\r\nThe custard enrobes the ensemble of flavours and ads a velvety smoothness and mouth feel to thrust this baby into atmospheric proportions! \r\n\r\nFA Fuji is the undisputed king of apples and here, it does all the heavy lifting on the apple front. Sweet, crispy and uber realistic, FA Fuji précis a Fuji apple uncannily. The INW apple brings a sweet apple juice type vibe to the party and boosts the Fuji’s sweetness to create a stunning apple combo.\r\n\r\nA week will be enough for all the flavours to rise to the occasion but 2 will give you a morning glory, and then some...\r\n\r\n\r\n","steep_days":"7","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-02T10:29:40.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"1291","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Cafe Napoleon Flavoring","flavor_id":"5122","vendor":"DFS","millipercent":6000},{"name":"HOLY HOLY GRAIL RY4","flavor_id":"5037","vendor":"DFS","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Holy Vanilla","flavor_id":"2385","vendor":"DFS","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Custard","flavor_id":"4210","vendor":"INW","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Biscuit","flavor_id":"642","vendor":"INW","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Apple Fuji","flavor_id":"4886","vendor":"FA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Two Apples","flavor_id":"671","vendor":"INW","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Arabica Coffee","flavor_id":"8822","vendor":"VT","millipercent":250}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"162814","name":"Morning Glory: Apple of my eye"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
