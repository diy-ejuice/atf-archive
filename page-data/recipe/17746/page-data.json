Not too harsh on the throat or heavy.  Sorry if you have to buy the Funnel Cake, but it really gives this recipe the authentic crispy turnover flavor.  \r\n\r\nCAP Funnel Cake - 5% - While Reddit seems to think this is a nasty flavor, I disagree.  It gives a fatty, flaky, state fair kinda bakery taste. It's pretty rich and accurate to me. At 5% is a the main component of the recipe, but leaves room for the other flavors.\r\n\r\nCAP Cinnamon Danish Swirl - 3% - Adds a bit more cinnamon sugary taste, softens and combines with the Funnel Cake to make the \"turnover\" for the recipe.  At 3% this is there to fill out but not take over the recipe.\r\n\r\nJF Fuji - 2% - A bit less sharp than FA, 2% is definately enough to be present and noticable, but not harsh your throat or be too in-your-face.\r\n\r\nTFA Strawberry Ripe - 3% - Purely a supporting player for the Fuji.  Here it is to more candy sweetness and and brightness to the recipe, rather than actual strawberry. \r\n\r\nFA Liquid Amber - .5% - Lifted this idea from Apple Buttah, this turns the Fuji and Strawberry into the gooey fruit filling of the turnover. \r\n\r\nMixed at 70/30, gets better with a steep but is a decent shake and vape as well.
