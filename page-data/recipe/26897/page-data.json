The pineapple is one of those fruits that tend to pop after a 12-24 hour steep, and I dont think I have that long for this to set so I made some adjustments to where it was good on the shake. Upon vaping of it I am getting the tart and sweet combined from the fruit combination. I am sure in time it will turn out to be pretty good in some other blends, but for now this will have to work. Exhaling slowly will undoubtedly give you the sensation of the pineapple. Vaping this on my SMPL tube mod, parallel dual sitting at .10 ohms in an alliance rda. \r\n\r\n ","steep_days":"1 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-11T17:19:25.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"2877","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Golden Pineapple","flavor_id":"61","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Kiwi","flavor_id":"522","vendor":"FA","millipercent":2000}],"reviews":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"26897","name":"Pineapple kiwi"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
