That being said his interest was still peaked. The basis for this creation was to develope a taste/aroma that was like nothing else. This required pairing concentrates that you would typically not see side by side in any other recipe out there. I believe this was accomplished, with the outcome being an extremely sharp menthol lemon lime top note with a sweet and sour vodka candy body. So if this sounds like a profile that you would be interested in, then go ahead, mix her up and let us know what you think.

As close as i can describe it...imagine a martini with flat 7-up as the body, and an equal mixture of tequila and vodka adding in the boozy sting, with the rim dusted with confectioners sugar. And that dab of koolada just ads a hint of chil and a little extra sting. I rather like it!","score":5}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"134393","name":"NUCLEAR FUSION"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
