This smoothie makes me FEEL like I’m somewhere on a tropical island. A man can dream, right?\r\nIf there was ever a smoothie vape that tasted like summer, this one is it for me. I’m calling it “tropical” because this smoothie mix is based on the wonderfully new flavour from Flavorah 'FLV Smoothie Base' and is packed with bold and flavourful fruits and a little sweet cream.\r\n\r\nAll FLV\r\n\r\n• FLV Smoothie Base, a slightly lemon-ish fruit smoothie base, a perfect base to start with as the main building block for this smoothie recipe.\r\n• FLV Banana, fresh candy like taste at the early days of steep, once steeped out it grows to a fully ripe banana.\r\n• FVL Blood Orange, a sweet orange with a slight flesh hint and some juiciness to it.\r\n• FLV Honeydew, It's a great honeydew flavour with a sun ripe melon, very smooth and bold giving the recipe a light with a soft rind aroma. Perfect in this mix.\r\n• FLV Jackfruit, has ripe melon-like notes with a tropical punch baseline, it taste like a pineapple without been a pineapple.\r\n• FLV Sweet Cream, milky with a hint of coconut milk, a milk note that perfectly adds creaminess to the whole recipe. The cream will bring out the smoothie taste even more.\r\n• FLV Wild Melon, a candy-like melon flavour with a tropical pallet, perfectly for this recipe, use in small quantities because its a strong aroma!\r\n• FLV Sweetness, is a flavourless sweetness enhancer. It will not gunk coils like other sweeteners.\r\n\r\nSteep: 4 to 7 day's to blend the aromas, 14 day's or more and it just get smoother and seems to change into a fuller and smoother and rich smoothie.\r\nBeen on the shelf for almost 2 months, no degradation in taste.\r\n\r\nStart your day by vaping this delicious tropical smoothie mix.\r\nThis is my al-day vape for weeks now, really wanted to share this.","steep_days":"7","temperature":"0","recipe_score":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-10T17:58:15.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"3770","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Smoothie Base","flavor_id":"10153","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Wild Melon","flavor_id":"619","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":500},{"name":"Sweetness","flavor_id":"4413","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":750},{"name":"Banana","flavor_id":"603","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Blood Orange","flavor_id":"4407","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":800},{"name":"Honeydew","flavor_id":"10089","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Jackfruit","flavor_id":"4359","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Sweet Cream","flavor_id":"4402","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":500}],"reviews":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"151001","name":"Smooth Moves"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
