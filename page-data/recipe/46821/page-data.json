It can be vaped without it but i don't think it is as good. I didn't test it with just mint (i don't have any), that could work too.\r\nIt is meant to be refreshing for the hot summertime.\r\nIf you like it, please leave a rating.\r\n\r\nCAP Cucumber has a nice fresh cucumber salad flavor which is refreshing on it's own. same goes for\r\nTPA Watermelon. it's not a candy like watermelon but a more authentic and fresh one\r\nGolden Pineapple is meant to enhance the freshness and juicyness. I tried different things here but liked this the most. you can switch it for FA Fuji @ 0.5% which works well also (but of course a little different).\r\n\r\nEdit New Version: I added a little Flavorahs Cucumber and Wild melon to boost the flavors without making it much drier. To make up for it i raised Golden Pineapple.\r\n\r\n\r\nOld Recipe:\r\nCAP Cucumber 5%\r\nTPA Watermelon 2.5%\r\nCAP Golden Pineapple 0.75%\r\nMenthol: 0.33%","steep_days":"1 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-06T09:36:43.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"1436","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Cucumber","flavor_id":"43","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Watermelon","flavor_id":"276","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":3500},{"name":"Golden Pineapple","flavor_id":"61","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Menthol Crystal 10%","flavor_id":"5556","vendor":"NN","millipercent":330},{"name":"Cucumber","flavor_id":"4384","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":500},{"name":"Wild Melon","flavor_id":"619","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":500}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"46821","name":"Europa (Cucumber Watermelon)"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
