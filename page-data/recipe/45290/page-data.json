Simple 4 flavor recipe, but still big on warm tobacco flavor.  If you're a fan of RY4 style vapes, this one is sweet and creamy but at the same time it has a deep rich tobacco notes throughout. \r\n\r\nFLV Tatanka has a smooth, rich, leafy tobacco note with a backdrop of coffee notes.  This flavor on its own is already a rich RY4 style tobacco and is simply enhanced by the addition of extra caramel and smooth creamy vanilla notes. The Butterscotch is a brighter note that works well with the coffee rich back notes. \r\n\r\nOverall I have enjoyed nearly a full 30mls of this recipe in just one day. This was actually just a random recipe I threw together for myself to have a tobacco to vape, but I'm going to have to mix more of this for myself just have a larger amount on hand. It went so well with my morning coffee that will need to save myself a few ml just to have in the morning before I mix more.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFor More Mixing Tips and Info Visit my Site and Youtube Channel: \r\nhttp://flavor-pro.com/\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCA6gV-5vxieuG2_TcIKpYCg\r\n","steep_days":"3 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:49:18.000-05:00","best_vg":"75%","views":"4295","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Tatanka Tobacco","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":450},{"name":"Caramel","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":280},{"name":"Butterscotch","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":300},{"name":"Vanilla Pudding","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":370}],"reviews":[{"user":"horizonism","text":"Beautiful. This is nuanced. I like the subtlety here, whilst still retaining complexity enough to keep you wanting more. Pairs beautifully with a Bordeaux.

Holy smokes this may be the best ry4 style vape I've ever had. Thank you Jen! I'll be vaping the hell out of this with morning coffee for a while. 5 stars.
