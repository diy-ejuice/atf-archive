I didn’t have any Pistachio flavors on me at the time, so I jumped on BCF and ordered TFA Pistachio and WF Pistachio Cream.  At the same time that I had whipped up a V1, @ID10-T messaged me asking how I felt about making a Pistachio Ice Cream. Apparently along with being a flavor Guru he’s a mind reader too. Now the pressure is on to get this right.\r\n\r\n**Version 1** – I started with The Ice Cream Trinity as the base. My SFTs of TFA Pastachio and WF Pistachio Cream were promising. I went with 5% TFA Pistachio and 2% WF Pistachio Cream. This was a really solid starting place but the dairy side of WF Pistachio Cream was drowning out all the work TFA was putting into the mix. \r\n\r\n**Version 1.2** – With some bullshitting with @staybert about this, he said after talking to @shyndo he went balls to the wall 8% TFA Pistachio and it worked out gloriously. It just needed something to round out the flavor being that high. TFA Vanilla Swirl already being in the Trinity covered that nicely. I dropped the WF Pistachio Cream to 1% hoping to still be able to grab the awesome flavor from it but not bring to much dairy to the table. Still, drowning under cream.\r\n\r\n**Version 2** – I took a new approach with this one and dropped the WF completely. Can it be that simple? 8% TFA Pistachio plus the Ice Cream? Not so much, it was a big improvement from V1 but I still wanted more of a pop from the nut. \r\n\r\n**Version 2.1 & 2.2** – Next attempt was to focus on the actual nut aspect. I went two different ways with this one. One version with .25% TFA Acetyl Pyrazine and one with .5% FW Hazelnut. Obviously FW Hazelnut has a bit of a milky/dairy side to it, but I was hoping keeping it down low enough would bring the nut with out the milk. V2.1 was just what I was looking for! V2.2….meh. Was good, but back to square one with too much dairy. Acetyl Pyrazine was they key for this for sure. .25% wasn’t doing exactly what I wanted so I bumped it up .5% and set it aside to steep. Came back to it a week later and it was fantastic!\r\n\r\n\r\n**Version 2.1 Tweaks** – I was super happy with where the recipe was at but just for shits and giggles I wanted to throw a couple things at it and see what happened. \r\n\t \r\n- WS23 @ .5% - It was good, mimics the cold punch you get when you take a bite of ice cream. However, I agree with @ID10-T the cold is funky with the nut, and I feel it distracts from everything else. So scratch that.\r\n\r\n- FA Pistachio @.5% - Nope nope nope. Took this in a weird, dry, almost roasted direction. \r\n\r\nSo instead of going insane, and trying to fuck with something that was already delicious I settled on Version 2.1. The only other thing I’m possibly going to try is adding a bit of FLV Pistachio because I’ve heard its dead on authentic Pistachio which should work really damn good here.\r\n\r\n\r\n**LB VIC, HS FVIC, and TFA Vanilla Swirl** - These make up the delicious Ice Cream Base. The Vanilla Swirl also helps round out the high percentage of TFA Pistachio.\r\n\r\n**TFA Pistachio** - Well, this is kind of a given. A purely delicious and versatile Pistachio flavor. The absolute star of the show.\r\n\r\n**TFA Acetyl Pyrazine** - I used this to boost up the nut aspect of TFA Pistachio up and over the Ice Cream.\r\n\r\n\r\nAll and all, give this a good week steep and enjoy!

It's funny I was attempting a similar profile trying to make a Pistachio Gelato with coconut. Turned out pretty good but I think this'll probably be better.
