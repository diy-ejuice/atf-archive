It's more of\r\nan homage to the profile. It works great as a shake & vape. The sweetener is entirely optional, because\r\nthe French Toast actually adds a brown sugar, molasses sweetness by itself.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIt is a version 1 recipe, but I've had enough experience with all the flavors in the recipe that not much, if any, fine tuning was necessary.","steep_days":"0","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-01T15:11:44.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"3117","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Bavarian Cream","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":3500},{"name":"Holy Vanilla (DIYFS)","vendor":"OTHR","millipercent":500},{"name":"Cinnamon Crunch","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Cinnamon Danish Swirl","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":3000},{"name":"French Toast","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Meringue","vendor":"FA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Sweetener","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1000}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"8186","name":"French Toast Crunch"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
