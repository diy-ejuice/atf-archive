It's pretty tasty and definitely gets me in the Christmas mood. The White Chocolate gets kind of drowned out by the Peppermint, so I'm considering dropping it down to .75%, but it seems to die down on it's own after a few days. I'm going to let it steep for about a week before I make my final version, but I feel like it's in a good spot to share right now.  I may not change anything, but I don't know right now. It's definitely super pepperminty with some creaminess mixed in. It goes great with coffee!","steep_days":"5","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-01T03:14:20.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"1547","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Peppermint","flavor_id":"283","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Almond","flavor_id":"528","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Torrone","flavor_id":"550","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Bourbon (vanilla Bourbon)","flavor_id":"420","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Acetyl Pyrazine","flavor_id":"1709","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":250},{"name":"White Chocolate","flavor_id":"1462","vendor":"FW","millipercent":4500}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"20917","name":"White Chocolate Peppermint Almond Bark"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
