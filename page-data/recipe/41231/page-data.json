This is a coffee tobacco vape that's delicate and doesn't beat you over the head with it's pungency. INW's Cappucino Tobacco is best in smaller amounts, it's a strong sweet coffee that has rich roasted coffee bean/fancy ass cafe vibe to it- it's got a teensy bit of creaminess to it on it's own but not much, and isn't super nutty. The throat hit is a 3- 4 out of 10 and can be a bit dry solo. \r\n\r\nPaired with fresh cream/Bavarian Cream it gets a better mouthfeel and overall coffee flavor is improved- just like your normal cup of coffee, really. Unless you're a black coffee person, in which case...sigh. \r\n\r\nHoly vanilla is an accent; it's strong to me, in a good way. Again, not trying to bash your head in with anything here. Balance and subtlety seem to be a lost art in almost everything these days, but that's what I'm aiming for.  \r\n\r\nThe Soho is meant as an accent to the CT because both are fairly weak on the tobacco spectrum- Soho is even sweeter than RY4 and has roastyness to it, but again, not super nutty. It acts as a caramel flavored creamer to your fancy ass coffee. Great with breakfast, of course.

I put it away and opened it up again after two weeks and something totally changes and I'm having a hard time putting it down.  I think a 'normal cup of coffee' is really accurate. I don't really get too much tobacco with it, but I assume thats because the capaccino tobacco, like the soho isnt very tobacco forward. Been vaping this all day for the past few days. I think I'll try a batch with some INW Dark for Pipe and see how that goes."}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"41231","name":"Fancy"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
