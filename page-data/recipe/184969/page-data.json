Â \r\n\r\nThe pistachio layer is made up of Green Joy (INW) + Pistachio (TFA) to add more depth. Both are pistachio pudding type flavors and if you do not have Green Joy, do yourself a big favor, get it! I got it directly from Inawera. \r\n\r\nThe cream layer consists of Buttercream Frosting (WF) which is a fluffy, sweet, and slightly buttery cream. This was chosen over (VT) vanilla buttercream frosting because that is far too buttery for this recipe. A little Sweet Cream (VT) helps give it wonderful mouthfeel.\r\n\r\nA small touch of Butter Base (VT) was used after I tried @Developed Samoa Sammies recipe. I've been hooked on this flavor, it's incredible. That butter note is delicious with this pistachio. \r\n\r\nTorrone (FA) coats your palate with sweetness and fullness. A light touch of Beer Nuts (FLV) works great with this recipe.\r\n\r\nSweeten to your liking.\r\n\r\nI primarily use this in the Rebirth, Jenna, and Reload S rda.
