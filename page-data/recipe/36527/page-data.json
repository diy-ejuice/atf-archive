While remaining candyish. \r\nThe cream base is brought together by HS ice cream and blooms nicely after 1 week. Though this can be SNV. \r\n\r\nFW blueberry. \r\nA strong non fading blueberry. Tastes reminiscent of the original Rocketman while adding much needed body. \r\n\r\nTpa bb wild. \r\nThis adds candy to the blueberry mix without taking it over. \r\n\r\nTpa Quince. \r\nAdds a nice tartness and wetness to the vape. \r\n\r\nTpa CKGC. \r\nA great supporting cream and light pastry. \r\n\r\nTpa Greek yogurt. \r\nThe main body of our cream base. Lightly tart, and nicely textured. \r\nBlends perfectly with our blueberry base. \r\n\r\nTpa GCC. \r\nA hint more Graham. I felt this recipe was lacking in the pastry department. \r\n\r\nHS ice cream. \r\nThe show stopper of creams. \r\nThis adds a thick richness missing from the original while not altering the flavor. \r\n\r\nShameless shilling below. \r\n\r\nJoin the best Facebook group around! \r\nhttps://www.facebook.com/groups/eatsleepmixrepeat/\r\n\r\nOur official website. \r\nHttps://www.Esmrdiyvapes.com \r\n\r\nLive mixing located here. \r\nhttps://youtu.be/GrJQYrINTxo\r\n\r\nI need your help! \r\nSupport me on Patreon! \r\nEvery dime go to bring you more content and recipes! \r\nhttps://www.patreon.com/ChefJohnWK","steep_days":"14","temperature":"525","recipe_score":5,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:49:11.000-05:00","best_vg":"100%","views":"4496","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Blueberry (wild)","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Blueberry","vendor":"FW","millipercent":2150},{"name":"Cheesecake (graham Crust)","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Greek Yogurt","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Ice Cream","vendor":"HS","millipercent":500},{"name":"Graham Cracker Clear","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Quince","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":250}],"reviews":[{"user":"MopHead","text":""}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"36527","name":"Major Tom - A ground control breaking blueberry"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
