The pumpkin pie was delicious. Apple pie filling added in some sweetness and body, gingerbread cookies gave crust, and vanilla whipped cream made for an extra tasty later. The hell was the drink? &#xD;\n&#xD;\nAnd almost 5 days later later, here it is.&#xD;\n&#xD;\nThe whipped cream has melded with the slightly watery nature of the pumpkin pie to become a lush vanilla milkshake, the gingerbread has melted down into some lovely spice notes that go great with the pumpkin. The apple pie filling adds to the overall mouthfeel (hence fast food milkshake thickness rather than heavy vanilla cream), and the whole deal tastes like some slice of winter heaven.&#xD;\n&#xD;\nHoly hell, mls...this stuff is just straight up awesome. Nicely done!"}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"173953","name":"mlNikon Pumpkin Drink"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
