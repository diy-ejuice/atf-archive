You won't really notice it other than \"hey this biscuit has layers\". Added some joy for a little extra breadyness and that minor sweetness it has mixes with:\r\n\r\nThe inside... I chose the shisha for it's jammy qualities (3%) but felt it needed a little more realistic strawberry to help it out so 5% ripe. Throw in a little vienna and cream fresh for that sweetness and (believe it or not the vienna helps the biscuit here because it is naturally \"fluffy\") you have a biscuits and jam.","steep_days":"14","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:48:59.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"2428","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Biscuit","vendor":"INW","millipercent":1800},{"name":"Butter","vendor":"FA","millipercent":200},{"name":"Cookie","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Cream Fresh","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Joy","vendor":"FA","millipercent":300},{"name":"Strawberry (ripe)","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":5000},{"name":"Shisha Strawberry","vendor":"INW","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Vienna Cream","vendor":"FA","millipercent":500}],"reviews":[{"user":"KAUZ514","text":"Can't believe there are no reviews for this yet, I mix a large bottle every time I'm out. This recipe is exactly what it is supposed to be. A buttery, flakey biscuit topped with strawberry jam.  The flavour and sweetness of strawberry ripe and the syrupy note from the shisha make a perfect jam. The the biscuit is just the perfect balance of butter and flake. When I ran out of fa joy I subbed in zeppola and it works great too. Highly recommend mixing this up. Great job Joe"}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"26765","name":"Biscuits and Jam by: Boogenshizzle"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
