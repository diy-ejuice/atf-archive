Moving Sucks!\r\n   https://youtu.be/H3AqSJwIZW8\r\n\r\nThis is my take on a   7  - 11  sour patch watermelon Slurpee, that you would pick up for that  long  ride\r\n it is nice bright sweet candy  watermelon on the inhale and a   sweet tart watermelon on the back. \r\nTested  in the BSRK v1.5  at 25 - 35 watts on a .30 braided coil     -  this also woks in an RDA very well  and it is full flavored  in your  face sourpatch watermelon slurpee with some  light lemon/lime  notes that are additionally picked up  \r\n\r\n**WF sour watermelon** is  a great candy flavor and perfect for this mix , it is a big old sweet  candy watermelon with a light  tart note similar to a jolly rancher\r\n**The big watermelon**  helps add some of that juicy body that a slurpee needs  and works well here\r\n**Lemon lime soda** is needed for some contrast to  all that sweetness of the watermelon   and really helps  add some  wetness and vibrancy to the watermelon   \r\n**Sour gummy candy** adds some  volume and body to this mix along with more of a nice tart note on the back   \r\n**Polar Blast**  is optional  but for a slushie  really works  and for my liking I would take it up to 1.5   in a pod set up   \r\nAdd sweetner to taste, but this is really sweet on its on,  with the cotton candy .  But slurpees are SWEET so I added .3% of cap super sweet ","steep_days":"3 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"total_reviews":1,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:50:58.000-05:00","best_vg":"60%","views":"2101","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Big Watermelon","vendor":"MB","millipercent":5000},{"name":"Cotton Candy","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Lemon Lime Soda SC","vendor":"WF","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Polar Blast","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Sour Gummy Candy SC","vendor":"WF","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Sour Watermelon Candy","vendor":"WF","millipercent":6000}],"reviews":[{"user":"CygnusY1","score":"5","text":"I don't know why you don't get more rave reviews for your inventive recipes.
