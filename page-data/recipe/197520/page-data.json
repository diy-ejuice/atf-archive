He also named it. So all I did was to use the Strap-On and my own licorice blend.\r\n\r\n--\r\n\r\nNotes for this are in /r/DIY_eJuice's May 2016 Recipe Thread, but basically it's a fruity framework to build on. I love adding one ingredient to this, and that one ingredient varies depending on my mood. FA Kiwi, TFA Dragonfruit, and INW Cactus are some of my favorites to add to it.
