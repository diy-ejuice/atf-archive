Sounds good right??? I am sorry about the price tag on some of these concentrates this mix uses quite a few pricey flavors $$$$.I will say the reason I used these flavors is because they are absolutely delicious. Flavorah cookie is probably my favorite cookie flavor available to me and I have a lot of cookie flavors.. A 15ml bottle goes a long way because you can use it at low percentages and still have a great cookie. Anyway enough justifying the use of expensive  flavors and on to my description.\r\n\r\nThe graham cracker cookie:\r\nThe main star is Flavorah graham cracker. I used flavor west graham cracker to help with the body of the graham cracker. To me at this point it almost seems like a moist graham cracker if you will and I wanted a crispy graham cracker cookie so I added just a little of flavorah cookie but that little bit goes a long way in making the graham cracker crispy and cookie like. I then added Capella sugar cookie  and do I really need a reason I could take a shower in capella sugar cookie it smells and tastes so good but using capella sugar cookie adds a two day minimum steep because its made with alcohol. So now I have the graham cookie but I wan this graham cookie dusted with cinnamon sugar so I used flavorah pastry Zest and  .15 % of rich cinnamon. If you don't like cinnamon then just don't use it the pastry zest does good jib by itself but I like it with a little extra cinnamon!!! I also added TFA brown sugar to complete the dusting of my graham cookie. Now let's make the crust so it can be dusted and crusted!!!!\r\n\r\nThe toppings: \r\nWell on top of this graham cookie dusted with cinnamon sugar there is a layer of smooth butterscotch that is made with a combination of flavor west butterscotch  which adds an almost hardened candy type of butterscotch taste and feel. The second butterscotch is flavorah butterscotch this isn't candy like at all its a smooth creamy butterscotch. When the two atr mixed you get the best of both worlds and a great butterscotch topping. Then sprinkled on top of this delicious masterpiece is so!e candied almonds that I made with a combination of flavor art almond and flavor art marzipan at a low percentages. The flavor west butterscotch also helps pull off the candied almond affect.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnyway I think this recipe is amazing like I said drop the rich cinnamon if you don't like cinnamon heavy recipes then just don't use it because this shit is delicious anyway you shake it and after a minimal steep I can't wait to see how this blends after a long steep. Either way I am loveing it now. All I can say is Graham Wow!!!!!! \r\n\r\nI used .35% flavorah sweetness in this mix. Sweetness is a sweetener you can use it or not use it its up to you and what you want....","steep_days":"3","temperature":"420","recipe_score":5,"total_reviews":1,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:49:42.000-05:00","best_vg":"75%","views":"3384","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Sugar Cookie","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Graham Cracker","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Graham Cracker","vendor":"FW","millipercent":1250},{"name":"Brown Sugar","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":750},{"name":"Pastry Zest","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Butterscotch","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Butterscotch","vendor":"FW","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Almond","vendor":"FA","millipercent":750},{"name":"Marzipan","vendor":"FA","millipercent":250},{"name":"Rich Cinnamon","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":150},{"name":"Cookie","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":500}],"reviews":[{"user":"mlNikon","score":"5","text":"This is a very tasty mix, I should have known I would like it, our palates are very similar.
