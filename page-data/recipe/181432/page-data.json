It's weird, it's unusual, it's tasty af. Can be SNV but is best after a 3 day steep.\r\n\r\nFA Papaya: The main star of the recipe. To me, it kinda tastes \"pink\" in a way and pairs very well with floral notes, that's why...\r\n\r\nTPA Cherry Blossom: ...is in here, same as FA Rose. Those two in combination with the Papaya really give it that sort of \"weirdness\" that's making this so addicting for me. If you don't have FA Rose, you could get away without it, but there would be something missing.\r\n\r\nFW Blueberry & TPA Boysenberry: These two combined in here bring the sweetness of the FA Papaya down a bit and add a bit more texture and juiciness. Especially the TPA Boysenberry brings out a certain sort of \"bite\".\r\n\r\nFA Fuji: Tbh, it's in here because I'm addicted to it and sneak a little bit into most of my fruity mixes. Also fits surprisingly well in here.\r\n\r\nTPA Koolada: I like my recipes to be very cold. Adjust the percentage to your liking.","steep_days":"3 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-11T04:39:51.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"699","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Blueberry","flavor_id":"1201","vendor":"FW","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Boysenberry","flavor_id":"219","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Cherry Blossom (pg)","flavor_id":"221","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Fuji","flavor_id":"506","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Koolada 10 Pg","flavor_id":"280","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Papaya","flavor_id":"584","vendor":"FA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Rose","flavor_id":"511","vendor":"FA","millipercent":250}],"reviews":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"181432","name":"Serial Experiments Lain"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
