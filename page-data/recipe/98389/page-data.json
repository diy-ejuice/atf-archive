It mutes the shit out of the mix for me. 2% cotton candy seems insane IMO, on top of how light and fickle Strawberry ripe already is, I just didn't get any flavor whatsoever out of the juice. If you want a denser strawberry flavor, I'd suggest JF Sweet Strawberry or FA Red Touch instead of Strawberry Ripe, and replace EM/Cotton Candy with a bit of INW Cactus or INW Cactus Lime to add some juiciness, maybe a sucralose/stevia based sweetener like FW sweetener or CAP super sweet instead of ethyl maltol.&#xD;\n&#xD;\nI was in a bit of a pinch and just wanted some strawberries, but on a triple core clapton in a hadaly at 40w or massive series build in a kennedy 25 at 100w I barely tasted any strawberry at all. If it works for you, I can't knock it! But I think there's ways to improve upon this profile."}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"98389","name":"FA Juicy Strawberry (FlavorBook Entry Remix)"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
