The jam effect is pretty on point in my opinion, however, it has a very citrus like top note to it, and almost an apricot taste and aroma. This makes it slightly difficult per se to pair with other fruit flavors when making a really convincing jam. However, if youre like me, you spread butter AND jam on your toast, and when you pair that with strawberry jam, it almost gives it that light citrus kind of flavor that I get from VT Jam It. Check this flavor out if you dont have it, its pretty fun to mess with. \r\n\r\nWF Croissant - This one is an interesting one. WF is probably my favorite flavor company right now, and thats not because im a Canadian. I actually love the way this one tastes, and after a week to two week steep, it tastes like those oily buttery flaky croissants you get by the dozen at the supermarket. This isnt the \"jam monster\" toast taste that you might be hoping/expecting, however, give it a try. I find it to be a really nice almost 'lite' version of the commercial juice but with a unique twist to it. \r\n\r\nTPA Butter - what can I say, its fuckin butter. Tastes like butter. Dont use too much or youll be drinkin butter. Butter butter butter. \r\n\r\nChemnovatic Strawberry - Im still on the fence about Chemnovatic. Their Lemon Cream Wafer is out of this world amazing, so I had to order their whole lineup. Chemnovatic Strawberry is nice and flavorful but not too dense. Lacking a bit in mouth feel but I dont want to press it higher and get a candied strawberry taste, so thats where FA Juicy Strawberry comes into play. \r\n\r\nFA Juicy Strawberry - helps give some body to the red touch and make it an overall nice strawberry jam. Helps overpower the citrus notes of Jam It. \r\n\r\nYou can essentially swap out the strawberry flavorings for any fruits that you wish. Thats the beauty of Jam It and this recipe. Go ahead and try it and feel free to let me know what you think. I wouldnt go too high on the fruits, and be careful, as some dont pair too well with butter. \r\n\r\nEnjoy \r\n\r\n\r\nadjust sweetener to taste. Going for that dirty dangles commercial sweet here with 1% SS. \r\n\r\n","steep_days":"14","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"total_reviews":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T10:44:54.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"1019","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Jam It","vendor":"VT","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Croissant SC","vendor":"WF","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Super Sweet","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Butter","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Red Touch (strawberry)","vendor":"FA","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Juicy Strawberry","vendor":"FA","millipercent":2000}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"197603","name":"Le Confiture Monstre : A Jam Monster Remix - Bubbaz LIVE Mixing 6/13/20"}}}
