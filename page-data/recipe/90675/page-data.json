Also my first time using the Sweetleaf Stevia Clear sweetdrops and I'm quite impressed as well, very nice sweetener (yet I used it at 1.5%, no off-tastes for me). This one is S&amp;V and ADV certified in my book. Thx Wayne for yet another learning, I appreciate it bro. ;)"}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"90675","name":"Strawberry Kiwi Banana ( Live Mixing )"}}}
