The juicy peach isnt very distinct despite the high percentage, but it alters the blueberry flavour quite nicely and rounds out the profile.\r\n\r\n- For more lemon, up to 1%. Can probably sub with another lemon of your choice, just keep the % low-ish.\r\n- If you have it, add Hangsen blueberry at 0.25%\r\n- Erythritol at 2% is a good idea as well","steep_days":"1 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:49:04.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"2647","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Blueberry","vendor":"FW","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Pomegranate","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Juicy Lemon","vendor":"JF","millipercent":500},{"name":"Peach (juicy)","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":6000}],"reviews":[{"user":"CatWillMew","text":"I subbed in Cap Juicy Lemon for this.
