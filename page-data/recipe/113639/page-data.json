Its a blondie with nuts and a maple sauce. I left out the butterscotch and white chocolate because having so much going on is super hard to balance and not turn into a muddled mess. If you want some butterscotch as well, this mix is really good with 2% fw butterscotch added to it. As always sweetener is optional, I have added 1% fw or ecx sweetener to this mix with much success.
