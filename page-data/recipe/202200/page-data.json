The billberry is upped a bit in percentage to pull the blueberry a bit more to the natural side. \r\nFW blackberry is added here for a bit more depth and help the blueberry flavor not to get lost in the yoghurt and the WS-23.\r\n\r\nYoghurt: \r\nFW yoghurt is great as a base cream here for the thicker mouthfeel and creamyness. FLV greek yoghurt adds that little zingy slightly sour undertone of a natural yoghurt, which i wanted in this recipe. At last the little bit of VTA milkshake base added really well to that natural yoghurt taste to make the cream consistent even when adding WS-23 (Ran into muting issues with cooling agents and creams in the past a lot)\r\n\r\nAdditives:\r\nFE Lemon is not really noticable as a lemon flavor in the recipe more there to boost and help seperate the blueberry from the yoghurt to make it taste like whole blueberrys in a yoghurt more than blueberries blended into a yoghurt. \r\nWS-23 for cooling obviously can also be taken higher or left out completely. Tweak to your likings ;) \r\nSuper Sweet, \"only\" 0.25% because i dont like my recipes overly sweet and the prominent blueberry already brings a good bit of natural sweetness by itself","steep_days":"1 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"total_reviews":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T02:17:54.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"377","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Blueberry (extra)","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Blueberry","vendor":"FW","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Blackberry","vendor":"FW","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Bilberry","vendor":"FA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Greek Yogurt","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Milkshake Base","vendor":"VT","millipercent":200},{"name":"Yogurt","vendor":"FW","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Lemon","vendor":"FE","millipercent":200},{"name":"WS-23","vendor":"OTHR","millipercent":300},{"name":"Super Sweet","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":250}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"202200","name":"Blueberry Fro-Yo"}}}
