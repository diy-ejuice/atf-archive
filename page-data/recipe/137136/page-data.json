Well 3 days steep really. Didn't mean for this to be a 1-2-3 recipe. I think the VT Sweet Cream brings it all together\r\n\r\nEDIT: I changed the sweet cream to 1.25% from 1%. I rarely change a recipe after posting, but I think it makes a difference. Also this is a good SNV and  short steeper, but It is ton better at 1 week and 2 weeks.  Even though this is way better at 2 weeks I feel no regret in vaping this before that time.  I vape this and another recipe no all day now. If you mix a lot of recipes sometimes your ADV being simple is a super nice thing.","steep_days":"3 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"total_reviews":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T23:37:19.000-05:00","best_vg":"60%","views":"1678","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Custard","vendor":"INW","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Hazelnut","vendor":"FW","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Sweet Cream","vendor":"VT","millipercent":1250}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"137136","name":"1-2-3- Hazelnut Custard Simple Mix"}}}
