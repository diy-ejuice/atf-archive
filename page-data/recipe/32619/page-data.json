A happy accident then occurred. The first version didn't taste like toast at all, but much more cornflake-y. However, I found it to be incredibly delicious. Inspired, I poured a bowl of Frosted Flakes and sprinkled some cinnamon in there. I found my new favorite cereal! I immediately abandoned the CTC idea and focused on honing this into what it already was. Now, it's my absolute favorite vape.\r\n\r\nFlavor Notes:\r\n\r\nCAP Cereal 27 is flaky, grainy, and crunchy. It has that cornflake cereal essence. It's used here as the body of the cereal. It's kind of bland and corn-y by itself, but it's a great place to start. 3% definitely makes this the base.\r\n\r\nFA Cream Fresh is a favorite of mine. It's simple cream with no egg or vanilla. I use it to boost the milk profile. 1.5% keeps Meringue smooth without adding too much weight. It's a light flavor that doesn't drown the flaky cereal.\r\n\r\nTPA Graham Cracker Clear emphasizes the graininess of Cereal 27. It helps mold the cornflake flavor of C27 into something more substantial and crunchy. 1% is enough to do that without turning this into a Golden Grahams vape.\r\n\r\nFA Meringue is my sugary cereal milk. I pushed it to 2% so it will break through the cereal ever so slightly. I also want some of the more complex flavors to emerge so it can help the texture of the cereal. The creaminess combines with Cream Fresh to make a solid, sweet milk. They sit on the bottom of the recipe, but they smooth things out. Both creams are light and work well with the grains without making the cereal soggy.\r\n\r\nFLV Rich Cinnamon is the king of kings. This might be the most delicious god damn flavoring out there. I don't use it much because I'm not huge on cinnamon. However, when I need to bust out the spices.. RC is always the one I go for first. It takes me back to baking with my mom as a kid. It's just like those sticks of cinnamon she always had in little mason jars. This stuff is wildly potent though. I have a 10% dilution that I use for more subtle applications. This recipe, on the other hand, can handle the real deal, undiluted, undisputed champ. Only 2 drops per 30ml though! Using a dilution will of course be easier. Don't go over and don't go under on this one. It will overpower absolutely everything or it won't bring out enough cinnamon-nutmeg-warm-bakery-essence spice. Uh.. Yeah.\r\n\r\nTPA Toasted Marshmallow darkens the milk a little bit. Malts it up some. We don't want super bright milk competing with this darker, spicy cereal flavor. It also lends that Toasted quality ever so slightly to the cereal. Adds depth to the entire recipe.\r\n\r\nCAP Super Sweet is a great sweetener. It's strong as fuck, it's sweet as fuck, and it's coming to murder your coils. Seriously. Right now. It's on it's way. We're vaping cereal here. We could use some sugary sweetness. I might not be trying to vape on old people cereal. It livens up the flavors and gives it all some more sticky sweetness. The recipe is still great without it, but SS turns it up a notch. 2/3 times I mix this with sweetener. Just about 2 drops of this heavy shit in a 30. If you over shoot a little it won't be the end of the world, but be delicate. You don't need much. If you doubt me try a back of the hand test. I think I caught a buzz..\r\n\r\nThis is a great shake and vape. The creams do come out after ~10 days, but it's never super milky. It's delicious, crunchy, spicy goodness that goes down silky smooth.\r\n\r\nHappy mixing! ðŸ‘½","steep_days":"3 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":4.9,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:49:07.000-05:00","best_vg":"80%","views":"25297","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Graham Cracker Clear","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Rich Cinnamon","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":200},{"name":"Cereal 27","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Cream Fresh","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Meringue","vendor":"FA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Toasted Marshmallow","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Super Sweet","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":250}],"reviews":[{"user":"lolneur0","text":"I mixed 60ml after i read the reviews after 3 days i vape about 3ml in my rta and it was good and i forgot about the bottle in the closet. After 4 months i found the bottle and tried again and now this tastes like nothing at all very ultra light flavour. So i suppose this dont steep or age very well or something is wrong with me!"},{"user":"Johnny2Vapes","text":"Mixing this up again after quite a hiatus from it. Best dang CTC mix out there and by far the most accurate, I like how it's not overpowering like most CTC types out comercially. Plus it's not terribly sweet either for the profile. It even nails the minor malty/creamy notes the actual cereal has and makes me feel like I am having a bowl full of it. Definitely a mix and vape right away type to have in rotation if you like cereals. "},{"user":"humanpuck","text":"I loved this recipe so much that I decided to remix it with newer flavors.  What an absolute gem of a recipe.  Its not cinnamon toast crunch, but that's clearly not what he was going for.  I was a little leery of FLV RC that high, but its nice amount spice.  Well done."},{"user":"KaptenUtbrott","text":"Taste exactly like cinnamon cereal, loving it. Slight hint of milk balances the mix. Love it :)"},{"user":"mike369","text":"So good!!!

Mr.B a wizard in the mix lab. Well rounded, thick and heavy mouthfeel. By far the best cereal I've had the pleasure of trying. Don't sleep on the remixes either, strawberry, banana, and apple variations are equally as dope."},{"user":"horizonism","text":"holy macaroni this is jesus level mixing. could happily vape this eternally. "},{"user":"gravi-tea","text":"going in I was hesitant because cinnamon, but it's enjoyable. the only thing I think missing to make it perfect is the milky finish. not something I would personally keep on hand but I can see the appeal."},{"user":"AlfredPudding","text":"This is the first recipe that I actually wanted to vape for an entire day. It is wonderfully balanced without being too rich or sweet. When you first mix this up the combination of toasted marshmallow and meringue sticks out a bit more in the profile, however after the three recommended days it calms down and this recipe finds itself. It has the perfect amount of rich cinnamon that doesn't stick out from the mix and creates an awesome cinnamon sugar taste. The combination of Cereal 27 and GCC is a brilliant cereal body; every so often I will find the graham cracker note and it works fantastically with the puffed corn cereal. There is absolutely nothing I would change about this recipe and I highly suggest you try it out. "},{"user":"SheckJuarez","text":"So gd good.."},{"user":"RedWagonVapes","text":"This is a wonderful mix absolutely delicious. I made a 30ml bottle and let it sit for a few weeks after opening it up I made another 2 60mls and a 30ml for a coworker to try who is still trying to find a juice to help her fully quit smoking cinnamon vapes are up her alley aswell as mine. "},{"user":"amouthforwar","text":"Just delicious. The milk base here is pretty perfect, adds the right amount of sugary silkiness to the cereal notes. Skillful mix, dying to try some of your other cereal recipes!"},{"user":"BigCloud","text":"Well I finally know what all the fuzz is about. Really delicious. I'm not really into cinnamon vapes but this one is really good and well ballanced. I'm really digging that toast flavor in this recipe. I'm planning on using it for a strawberry toast. Really well done ;)"},{"user":"corvape","text":"Me Burgamdy nailed it with this recipe!&#xD;\nI mixed this about 3 months ago and forgot about it.  This is a tasty spot on cinnamon Frosted Flakes. Awesome job! Thank you for sharing."},{"user":"Ebc88","text":"Good stuff. Cinnamon is just right for me. Milk and cereal is coming through.

Not something I can vape non stop though."},{"user":"jyroe","text":""},{"user":"ID10-T","text":"If this were called Cinnamon Toast Crunch, I'd consider it a failure. But it promises Frosted Flakes with cinnamon and a splash of milk instead and it hits that mark more deliciously than any accurate CTC could, because Frosted Flakes with cinnamon and milk is just better than CTC. And it can be vaped all day, which is an accomplishment for any cinnamon vape. The only drawback I see here is that now I have to try all of Mr. Burgundy's breakfast bowl series.

That other CTC recipe that is getting a bit of notice is good but this one is more of an ADV for me. The creaminess is perfect and picks up the cinnamon sugar really well. Great Job!"},{"user":"hyperlite310","text":"I love CTC vapes, and this is my new favorite! Usually when I'm vaping CTC it's Rage's Sadlad Toast Crunch, but this is a lot less taxing on the pallette.
