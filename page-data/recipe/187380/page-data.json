This award-winning flavor can be best described as the King of Tobacco. A caramel vape-uccino with subtle tobacco on the exhale.\r\n\r\nIf you haven't got the DIYFS Holy Grail and Vanilla V1s you should do well with V2s, although it wouldnt have the same complexity it will still be pretty tasty and sure will be creamier.( mind that some % tweaking might be needed due to flavour muting and intesity of the concentrates)\r\n\r\nI can't remeber the sweetness on the original Django but 0.25% super sweet or a low amount of other sweeteners will make the flavour more sarurated and full so it wont hurt feel free to adjust.\r\n\r\nThis ejuice has so much story behind .. Long story short,\r\nTPD, Changed the eliquid flavour, NETs.\r\n\r\nSo if you enjoyed the original Django this is a Tribute to that eliquid trying to emulate every aspect we all enjoyed from it and sure you will enjoy now.\r\n\r\nI have to give a special mention to @horizonism on ELR for all the effort put to recreate the original Django over the years, \r\nhope you will enjoy this one.\r\n\r\nAdditional notes:\r\n•Capellas Vanilla Custard V1: im using v1 instead of v2 mostly for the steep time( pretty sure v2 was in the original mix), v2 needs over 4 weeks to get rid of the butiryc acid note. If you want to avoid DAAP use v2.( be ready to let it sit at least for a month)\r\n\r\n•Stixx Mixx Kentucky Virginian:\r\nThis is not in the original mix but is the closest i could find and it resembles quite well the kentucky tobacco used in Django with dark woody notes.\r\n1% is pretty low for a NET concentrate but OG Django wasn't really a full tobacco vape and it will be very present in the vape.\r\n\r\nMix & Steep:\r\n\r\nThe original Django was a 60VG/40PG but this mix will also do well in 70VG/30PG.\r\n\r\nI Suggest at least a week of steep but its better after 10-15 days. \r\nBest results  after 20-30 days.","steep_days":"7","temperature":"0","recipe_score":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-10T16:01:45.000-05:00","best_vg":"60%","views":"1013","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"HOLY HOLY GRAIL RY4","flavor_id":"5037","vendor":"DFS","millipercent":8000},{"name":"Holy Vanilla","flavor_id":"2385","vendor":"DFS","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Vanilla Custard","flavor_id":"131","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Dark Fire","flavor_id":"7280","vendor":"SM","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Carmel (caramel)","flavor_id":"503","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Super Sweet","flavor_id":"2384","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":250}],"reviews":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"187380","name":"Django 13th TRIBUTE"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
