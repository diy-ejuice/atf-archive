This is my  twist on a traditional  Asian fried  dough desert with sesame, and dang .      It is usually made with  a rice flour and  filled with red bean paste.   In this case I wanted to use a starchy  sweet filling and used  banana puree.     The dough is made with the WF  sesame and FL sweet dough and the FE rice.  While you do not get the overt fried oiliness -  you do get a nice dense dough with the rice.  The WF candy just brings out a sweet sesame note. along with the Kinako soy.   The honey  and milk helps bring  the sesame and banana banana together and fill in the middle a bit  by adding some body to the mix .
