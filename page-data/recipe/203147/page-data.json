However, once I finished the Apple Cider Pudding  I didnt think adding any more flavors would improve on this awesome taste. So I figured I should just stop here. \r\n\r\nAs for the Pudding, I used Chemnovatic Vanilla Pudding, but ATF did not recognize it so I put in FLV Van Pudding, and its OK if you use FLV .   Actually at that point in the recipe you can use 4% of Chemnovatic Van Pudding, or FLV Van Pudding, OR  ...  CAP Vanilla Custard V2.  They all work well here at 4%.\r\n\r\nI hope you enjoy this, it is an amazing Fall Flavor.... also refreshing in the heat....Thoughts and comments welcome....Enjoy","steep_days":"2 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:51:42.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"423","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Apple Cider","flavor_id":"4368","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Apple Pop","flavor_id":"4380","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1250},{"name":"Pudding Base","flavor_id":"8948","vendor":"VT","millipercent":800},{"name":"Vanilla Bean","flavor_id":"8573","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":500},{"name":"Vanilla Ice Cream","flavor_id":"1511","vendor":"LB","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Vanilla Swirl","flavor_id":"189","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Vanilla Pudding","flavor_id":"4433","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Super Sweet","flavor_id":"2384","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":500}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"203147","name":"Apple Cider Pudding"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
