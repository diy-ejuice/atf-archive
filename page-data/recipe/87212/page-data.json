Cheesecake, lightly infused with vanilla bean, topped with a sweet apricot/brandy compote, fresh sliced almonds, and drizzled with cream cheese icing.\r\nThe end result is a sweet, slightly topping forward cheesecake with a rich and creamy base and a soft and buttery graham crust.\r\n\r\nINW Apricot: One of the stars in this recipe. A strong flavoring and quite apparent even at 0.5%. This provides a nice, ripe apricot flavor with some slightly floral top notes that combine beautifully with almond.\r\nSC Apricot: If you love apricots and peaches, this is a must have for your flavor arsenal. A bright and slightly candied apricot with notes of yellow peach. I used this to help bring INW apricot down to a more \"cooked\" level for the compote.\r\nFA Almond: At 0.75% this was enough to imitate a few sliced almonds on top of the cheesecake. \r\nFA Bourbon Vanilla: This brings a nice rich vanilla to the cheesecake, while lending some of its darker character and warmth to the compote.\r\nFA Brandy: At 0.5% this provides the compote with a bit of warmth and a light dose of brandy flavor.\r\nTPA Brown Sugar: The base of the compote. 0.75% is enough to soften up the apricots and provide a cooked/caramellized nature. Also contributes to the soft graham crust.\r\nLA Cream Cheese Icing: This provides the drizzle of icing on top of the cheesecake and lends a bit of tanginess to help authenticate the cheesecake body.\r\nFW Graham Cracker: Combines with the sugar cookie to create the soft graham crust.\r\nCAP New York Cheesecake: The rich and creamy cheesecake base. I pushed this up to 5% so it could hold up better against the bolder toppings.\r\nCAP Sugar Cookie: This mainly helps to lend a bit of weight to the graham crust and cheesecake body, while also providing some texture and sweetness to the recipe.\r\nCAP Super Sweet: Optional, however I feel that this recipe benefits from a small addition.\r\n\r\nSo there you have it, a rich and decadent cheesecake that is full of flavor and hard to put down.\r\nHopefully some if you will love this recipe as much as I do. I feel that this recipe is good enough after a shake but 5-7 days will let everything come together fully. Take care and keep mixing!\r\n\r\n","steep_days":"5","temperature":"0","recipe_score":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-11T15:02:35.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"1518","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Apricots","flavor_id":"751","vendor":"INW","millipercent":500},{"name":"Apricot","flavor_id":"8418","vendor":"SC","millipercent":1150},{"name":"Brown Sugar","flavor_id":"313","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":750},{"name":"New York Cheesecake","flavor_id":"90","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":5000},{"name":"Cream Cheese Icing","flavor_id":"2380","vendor":"LA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Sugar Cookie","flavor_id":"115","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Super Sweet","flavor_id":"2384","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":200},{"name":"Almond","flavor_id":"528","vendor":"FA","millipercent":750},{"name":"Brandy","flavor_id":"493","vendor":"FA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Graham Cracker","flavor_id":"1297","vendor":"FW","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Bourbon (vanilla Bourbon)","flavor_id":"420","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1250}],"reviews":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"87212","name":"Apricot Almond Cheesecake"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
