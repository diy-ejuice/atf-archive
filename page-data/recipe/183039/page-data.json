The chocolate isnt quite as pronounced and the graham just kind of makes the ice cream seem like they used a heavier cream but it's tasty either way.\r\n\r\nFor him I used some of the precious lb lava cake v1  but I can see v2 working in it's place because its just to bend the graham a bit into a chocolate graham direction.","steep_days":"0 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T17:36:10.000-05:00","best_vg":"50%","views":"500","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Lava Cake","vendor":"LB","millipercent":5000},{"name":"Graham Cracker","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Vanilla Ice Cream","vendor":"LB","millipercent":5000},{"name":"Vanilla Swirl","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1500},{"name":"French Vanilla Icecream","vendor":"HS","millipercent":750}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"183039","name":"Choco-graham ice cream"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
