Is so promising I think ill post up\r\nCan't imagine anything terrible happening during the steep. \r\n\r\nCAP funnel cake -imo this flavoring is really accurate I like using it at 4%but I wanted it to shine in this recipie so i did 5% with 2%\r\n\r\nCAP sugar cookie. This is just a great bakery flavoring for any bakery imo. It's pretty darn versitile. I used it hear because i didn't want to take the funnel cake any higher. So my thinking is sugar cookie will really add to and round out the funnel cake. Add a little shugarness and take the final mix more into the bakery profile. Because who doesn't like blue bakery. \r\n\r\nLA CCI - why the fuck not. \r\n\r\nTTA/Fw- I chose tpa bb extra at 4% because imo blueberry extra is a little dry and i think that might translate well is this profile. I added 3% FW blueberry because......... It's FW BLUEBERRY why the fuck not \r\n","steep_days":"999999 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"total_reviews":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T11:43:35.000-05:00","best_vg":"80%","views":"758","recipe_flavors":[],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"54490","name":"What the fuck did I blue"}}}
