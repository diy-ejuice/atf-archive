I am not very good at explaining myself or how flavors do or dont work together. So I will tell a story instead.\r\n \r\nI told a more experienced mixer what I wanted to create. So she shot me a recipe. A pretty dam good one I might add. The first version was a little to strong for me but i like it enough to try and make it suitable for me. I tryed many versions and this one came out just right for me.
