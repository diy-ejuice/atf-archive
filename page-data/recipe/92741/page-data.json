The fruit combination is very sweet and bright, with just a hint of tartness. The Sorbet is a really interesting flavor. It adds a full mouthfeel, almost creamy, and a cooling to the vape. This is my first time using any kind of cooling in a recipe since it isn't really something I vape, but this sorbet I had to make an exception for.","steep_days":"3","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"total_reviews":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-06T01:08:14.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"1255","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Sugarloaf Pineapple","vendor":"VT","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Dragon Fruit","vendor":"VT","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Snake Fruit","vendor":"VT","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Sorbet Base","vendor":"VT","millipercent":1000}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"92741","name":"Tropical Train (all VTA)"}}}
