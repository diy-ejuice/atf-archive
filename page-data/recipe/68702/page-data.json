I grew up watching the original trilogy on VHS with my father and even broke my arm after falling while dueling him with those Target/WalMart lightsabers. Star Wars has been one of my greatest influences in my life. If a moisture farmer can go on to be a bad-ass Jedi and save the galaxy, what can I do?\r\n\r\nAnyways, my favorite movie is The Empire Strikes Back and my favorite scene from that movie is obviously the Vader and Luke fight on Cloud City from the planet, Bespin. When I was a kid, I thought that Cloud City was a real place, (as a childish mind would make you believe) and I always wanted to visit there. Obviously, as I grew up, I learned that Bespin is a planet of fiction and my dreams were ultimately destroyed. However, I learned that in the movie, Cloud City is actually a large painting with the actors digitally placed in the scene. Mind=blown. \r\n\r\nI've always loved the colors in the painting and love the atmosphere it brings to the movie. So in preparation for The Last Jedi, I have created a recipe that I believe perfectly captures what I feel when I think of Cloud City.\r\n\r\nWith this recipe, I set out to make a Toasted Vanilla Marshmallow. Perhaps people are tired of marshmallow vapes or believe that it is a novice profile geared towards those who are just getting into DiY, but this is my recipe so I don't give a fuck.\r\n\r\nI set out to create a recipe that gave you a dense, chewy marshmallow with a nice vanilla accent that made you feel warm in the upcoming winter. So I worked on this recipe with some new (to me) concentrates and I was pleasantly surprised with the outcome. Makes me feel like I'm up in the clouds.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nTPA Toasted Marshmallow and TPA Marshmallow - These two concentrates combine to give us our marshmallow base. TM is the main note of the recipe and it brings a decent marshmallow flavor with some light toasted notes. One of my biggest gripes with this concentrate is that it almost has no mouthfeel whatsoever, it has SOME, but not enough for what we are trying to achieve. At too high of a %, TM can bring some nutty notes and I didn't want those to be present in the recipe, so I opted to go for 3% as a starting point. Marshmallow does what you'd think it would do: add some more marshmallow flavor and helps in boosting that mouthfeel that we are trying to achieve. With these two concentrates, I had my marshmallow base.\r\n\r\nCAP Sugar Cookie - we all know why this one is here: \"chewy\" texture, sweetness, helps with the bakery aspect of the recipe. Keeping it at a low % gives us what we need without overpowering the entire profile.\r\n\r\nTPA Bavarian Cream - to me, this concentrate almost has a \"dark vanilla\" flavor to it, so it is used here to add some vanilla while also adding some toasted aspects to the profile. Keeping it at a low % allows this one to be a SnV as well as not taking over the marshmallow aspect.\r\n\r\nTPA VBIC - this is one of my favorite concentrates and I utilize it here just to add some vanilla flavor. 1% was all that was needed to add that flavor without turning this recipe into a weird mess. Can substitute for CAP but I'd suggest bumping up to 1.5%\r\n\r\nINW Shisha Vanilla - so this is my first recipe in which I've utilized this concentrate. I can't believe it took me this long to pick this one up because this is such a delicious and versatile flavoring. This goes well with ANY creamy/bakery recipe you are trying to achieve. When I twisted the cap off, I immediately knew this would work well with my marshmallows; it almost smells like a marshmallow just by itself. Enough rambling, this is used to boost the vanilla flavor and I believe is crucial to the recipe.\r\n\r\nINW Creme Brulee - this is a weird flavoring and a potent one too. Initially I had solo'd this flavor at 2% and tasted something similar to a burnt clearomizer coil from back in the day. Yuck. At 1%, I got a light custard with some burnt sugar on the exhale. Yum. At .5%, I got a slightly \"burnt\" flavor with some light vanilla. Honestly in this recipe I don't use it for its \"egginess\" or vanilla components, but more for its burnt sugar aspects. When vaping this recipe without the flavoring, I felt that it wasn't \"toasted enough\" and almost released it as-is, but when I received this concentrate it literally completed the recipe. You can leave this flavoring out as I know there are folks out there who just CAN NOT use this flavoring, but I would highly suggest mixing with it. You won't regret it.\r\n\r\nSweetener is weird on this one. Some days I like it with .25% just to make it I guess more authentic, but honestly I think it is even better without any. The sweetener masks some of those toasted notes that I have implemented into the mix and I find myself vaping this recipe without sweetener nine times out of ten. \r\n\r\nSo there we have it, folks. I've been working on this recipe for almost two months now and have just recently deemed it worthy of posting to the website because of the addition of the Creme Brulee. This is a fantastic SnV, if you can hold off until 5 days, the creamy concentrates meld into the marshmallow base a bit more and its like you are taking a bite out of those golden clouds from Cloud City. But hey, I can't even make it that far half of the time.\r\n\r\nI think this recipe is perfect as-is, I've worked on it for a long time and am pleased with where it is right now. But if you think you can make it better, I'll be more than happy to vape your adaptation.\r\n\r\nI hope you guys enjoy this recipe as much as I do, may the force be with you. Always.","steep_days":"5 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":4,"total_reviews":2,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:49:39.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"2281","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Toasted Marshmallow","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Marshmallow","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Creme Brulee (yc)","vendor":"INW","millipercent":500},{"name":"Sugar Cookie","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Vanilla Bean Ice Cream","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Bavarian Cream","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Shisha Vanilla","vendor":"INW","millipercent":1000}],"reviews":[{"user":"bjorama","score":"3","text":"Had this one book marked and finally got the creme brulee to make it.
