I wanted this to have an ry4 type of light sweet tobacco flavor where the tobacco is light and nutty with a good caramel, butterscotch, brown sugary type of sweetness and or flavor. I went with flavor west hazelnut well because its the king of nuts of coarse and i threw in a little creme brulee becauseits just good lol. No i put creme brulee in  because of its carmalized creamy texture and it just works here. k My tobacco choices were purely based on smell i was looking for the nuttiest smelling flavorah tobacco thats where oriental came in because to me it smells really nutty. Then i was looking for another tobacco to slightly back up the nuttyness so i smelled the other Flavorah tobacco's looking for the one that smelled the best with oriental and i came to choose tatanka. I really like this combination and i dont like tobacco's but i like these in this!! Now the tobacco is super light if you vape this on day 3 the tobacco will be much more prominent than say after two weeks. If you like your tobacco's more prominent you can just bump up each .25% at a time and you should be able to find where you prefer it best. But for me the level of tobacco is perfect just enough to know its there with some flavors that blend perfectly with a light tobacco.  The rest of the flavors i feel are obvious to the reasons i used them. I used them to bring out a nice caramel, brown sugar, butterscotch style of sweetness mixed with a prominent hazelnut with a touch of vanilla. I think you might really enjoy this mix and if you like a stronger tobacco you can easily bump them both up until you find the amount for you. Enjoy!!!!","steep_days":"5","temperature":"420","recipe_score":5,"total_reviews":2,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:50:08.000-05:00","best_vg":"75%","views":"2075","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Hazelnut","vendor":"FW","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Brown Sugar","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":750},{"name":"Butterscotch","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Caramel","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Creme Brulee (yc)","vendor":"INW","millipercent":750},{"name":"Madagascar (Vanilla Classic)","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Oriental Tobacco","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":750},{"name":"Tatanka Tobacco","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":500}],"reviews":[{"user":"Deftohms","score":"5","text":"This stuff is delicious man! I love that combination of FLV tobaccos! I used them at .25% higher than this recipe in place of red burley and Kentucky blend in cardinal and I liked that version much more than the original cardinal. Thank you for this!"},{"user":"SlashaLO","score":"5","text":"Just wanted to drop by and leave you your first review! I mixed this up and enjoyed it quite a bit. The tobacco choices played well with the sweet/nutty/creamy vibes you threw in there, and made a more bold RY4 type feel. That is one complaint I have had. Most RY4's dont have enough tobacco for me, and this hit the spot. The hazelnut comes through quite a bit, almost takes the top note for me here, and I love it. The brown sugar plays with butterscotch and caramel to make a sweet, thick, dark taste. The vanilla just slides underneath all that, kind of kissing you in the back. The creme brulee almost feels like it hugs everything together, and makes it all play nicely. Very good job here. Will surely be making more of this.
