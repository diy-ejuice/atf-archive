I wanted the shortbread to come thru heavy with this so I went with the inw biscuit and butter. I needed creamy but not a heavy custard profile so I went with whipped cream and elevated it with tpa milk DX (not on atf so I just had to select tpa dairy milk). I put 2 different strawberries in it to elevate each other without being too overpowering. Topped it off with some supersweet to make it a little more “commercial”","steep_days":"3 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:51:29.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"608","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Dx Bavarian Cream","flavor_id":"161","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Biscuit","flavor_id":"642","vendor":"INW","millipercent":3500},{"name":"Butter","flavor_id":"147","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Dairy/Milk","flavor_id":"2164","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Sweet Strawberry","flavor_id":"10286","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Strawberry (ripe)","flavor_id":"271","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Whipped Cream","flavor_id":"193","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Super Sweet","flavor_id":"2384","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1000}],"reviews":[{"user":"Jonnycoldcutz","text":"I had to substitute regular tfa Bavarian cream instead of dx but it came out wonderful man.
