So I came up with this recipe to scratch that itch when I can't have the real thing. It has quickly become part of my regular rotation of flavors that I ADV. It is fairly close and accurate to what I remember the cookies themselves tasting like.\r\n\r\nTFA Butter: ....Because butter. It's my favorite butter next to VT Butter base and if you're going to make these cookies, you need butter. And this certainly provides that.\r\n\r\nCookie Butter: This is a great flavor and just works great with all bakeries, but especially cookies. At the recommendation of Fresh03, I put this with almost any bakery of cookie I am making. It is just great. It also adds some buttery aspect to this mix because I remember these cookies being very soft and buttery so the more butter the better.\r\n\r\nJF Cookie/CAP Sugar Cookie: Equal parts of my favorite two cookie bases make an exceptional base for any cookie, really. But especially a straight up blonde sugar cookie. I love this combination and I first saw it used in Golden Oreo Pudding by DeeJayMills and it really is a good combo.\r\n\r\nGraham Cracker Clear: Basically this exists in the mix just to accentuate the cookie base. This recipe works for me kind of like cookie butter, but for crusts and cookies as a \"dryness\" instead of butter. So basically I put it in everything where some kind of bakery crust is present as well.\r\n\r\nShisha Vanilla: A bright vanilla note that this kind of soft buttery cookie benefits from. I also remember these cookies having that vanilla note in the outer crust where there wasn't any jam.\r\n\r\nStrawberry Jam: This was a no brainer. This is my favorite jam and certainly my favorite strawberry jam. So it was an obvious choice, and at 3% it's high enough to be the main note without being too buttery.\r\n\r\nStrawberry (baked): This is present to act as the finished \"crust\" or baked top of the dollop of jam in the middle of the cookie. And seriously, this stuff is great. If you don't own any, go get some. It's the only flavor like it, it's definitely one of a kind.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","steep_days":"10","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T12:48:28.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"814","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Butter","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":650},{"name":"Cookie","vendor":"JF","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Cookie Butter SC","vendor":"WF","millipercent":750},{"name":"Graham Cracker Clear","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Shisha Vanilla","vendor":"INW","millipercent":750},{"name":"Strawberry Jam","vendor":"OOO","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Sugar Cookie","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Strawberry (Baked)","vendor":"WF","millipercent":250}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"201069","name":"Strawberry Jam Butter Cookie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
