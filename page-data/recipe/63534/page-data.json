In my eyes, it tastes exactly like Funfetti Cake Dip, as if you were to dip a graham cracker into it and take a bite. \r\n\r\nFW Cake Batter Dip - So this was one of the flavorings from that donation, and when I smelt it, it reminded me just like the funfetti dip. It gives that frosting like consistency, and sweetness that is desired alone.\r\n\r\nTFA Vanilla Swirl - So this I just wanted to add a little bit more of consistency with the cream, and the hint of this flavoring really did the trick in giving it just a smidge of volume and breakup, that makes everything within this recipe shine on its own.\r\n\r\nTPA Cheesecake Graham Crust - I'm sure you could substitute any graham cracker flavoring and get the same or similar results with this percentage base. 1% does just enough that it stands out on both the inhales and exhales. You may be able to get away with using a smidge bit more to liking, but this percentage seemed to make sense in my eyes.\r\n\r\nJF Biscuit - This one I would consider to be an optional flavoring. I put this in just to attempt to give the cracker a little bit more of a crunch and just \"cracker-like\" feel to it. But again, optional and very interchangeable. \r\n\r\nTPA Strawberry Ripe - This flavor was additive 1 of 3 basically, in that I used this to give some life to the funfetti, and to just give it overall more flavor. Going any higher would just make this more of a strawberry cream recipe, which would probably be pretty good also with this mix set up.... (mental note)\r\n\r\nFW Sprinkles - This was another flavoring I purchased from that fund, and this really surprised me on how effective this really was. I think this is probably the most important flavoring for this recipe, in that this gives the ultimate \"funfetti\" feel, and really sugars things up, but not overwhelmingly.\r\n\r\nCAP Super Sweet - This is another optional additive to use, I personally like my flavorings on the sweeter end, so I typically put between 2 to 3 drops per 15ml. But with everything going on in this recipe, you could remove sweetener from this, and still get the fun times. \r\n\r\n\r\nSo as mentioned in the headliner, I would consider this Shake and Vape quality, in that it only requires 3-5 days for it to fully shine, but is rather complete right out the gate.
