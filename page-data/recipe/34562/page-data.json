The LA Watermelon sub works very well in a mouth-watering way and I'm kicking myself for not trying Jackfruit before now. Tropical mystery vibe, indeed! Thanks for this!

I mixed this 5 days ago and have been dripping it anytime i want a smack in the face of tasty, tangy and sweet fruit with a tropical twist! I don't have FA Strawberry, so I subbed CAP sweet strawberry and TFA Strawberry @ 2% each. Thanks for the recipe, and congrats on getting the approval of the heavyweight champ himself! Keep slinging:P"}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"34562","name":"Jack my Strap-On"}}}
