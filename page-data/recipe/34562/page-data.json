I mixed this 5 days ago and have been dripping it anytime i want a smack in the face of tasty, tangy and sweet fruit with a tropical twist! I don't have FA Strawberry, so I subbed CAP sweet strawberry and TFA Strawberry @ 2% each. Thanks for the recipe, and congrats on getting the approval of the heavyweight champ himself!
