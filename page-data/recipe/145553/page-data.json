I feel it adds exactly what a licroice should add. A little salty, not just another word for an anise flavor. It's exactly what licroce in Europe kinda taste like.\r\nTo assist the licorice and add some texture and boost the sweet and salty flavor, I decided on VT Salted Caramel. It was either that or FW Salty Caramel, but FW Salty Caramel has a habit of turning everything into a sweet mess, so choice here was VT.\r\nThe ice cream part is basically LB Vanilla Ice Cream. It's assisted by TFA/TPA Vanilla Swirl to give it some smoothness and FLV Cream to give it a more round flavor.\r\n\r\nTo make the creams blend in well, I suggest a 5 day steep, but this mix can be used as snv as well. It'll get creamier over time, but don't leave it for too long as the licorice will start to fade slightly.","steep_days":"5","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"total_reviews":2,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:50:49.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"957","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Vanilla Ice Cream","vendor":"LB","millipercent":3500},{"name":"Vanilla Swirl","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Licorice","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Salted Caramel","vendor":"VT","millipercent":750},{"name":"Cream","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":750}],"reviews":[{"user":"Zany","score":"5","text":"There once was a boy.. The boy was very fond of licorice. His parents would always stuff his face with these black treats..&#xD;\n&#xD;\n--&#xD;\n&#xD;\nThen one day, while the boy was out for a walk - a wild Kitty appeared.&#xD;\n\"I shall grant you three wis.. *cough* ahem .. sorry about that. You like licorice, yeah? I have a recipe for you, dear boy .. a thing called 'Black Swirl' .. it's like licorice ice cream!\" the Kitty said..&#xD;\n&#xD;\nThe boy was frightened by the Kittys proposal .. He did like licorice. But not combined with other stuff .. his parents had forced that stuff upon him before, and he didn't like it very much.&#xD;\nBut the Kitty was persistent - \"Try this once, and you'll be hooked for life! It's like crack!\" said the Kitty..&#xD;\n&#xD;\n&#xD;\nThe boy thought to himself .. \"Well .. I do like crack\" .. &#xD;\nHe agreed to try it out.&#xD;\nThe Kitty then looked at him, and uttered \"Five days you must wait! Five days, my dear boy - Then you will be able to enjoy ..\" under his breath he whispered \"'The Black Swirl'\"..&#xD;\nAnd then *poof* .. the Kitty was gone.&#xD;\n&#xD;\nThe boy was confused, where'd the Kitty go? .. After a while, the boy walked on home, eager to give this recipe a try.&#xD;\n&#xD;\n--&#xD;\n&#xD;\nWhen the boy got home, he was anxious .. The Kitty had given him hope.. Hope that licorice and ice cream, could indeed be put together, and create something good.&#xD;\n-&#xD;\nHe mixed it up - Shook the bottle violently - Gathered up all of his patience .. and waited .. and waited .. and waited .. staring at the bottle, as the liquid transformed.&#xD;\n&#xD;\n-&#xD;\n&#xD;\nOn the fifth day, the boy was excited. He had waited, and waited, and now it was finally time - He filled up his vape, and took his first draw .. his heart turned black ..his mind .. black .. every fiber in his body .. black.. &#xD;\n&#xD;\n- &#xD;\n&#xD;\nHe was now in love .."},{"user":"Apexified","score":"5","text":"If you don't like licorice, you probably don't need to know much more about this recipe.&#xD;\n&#xD;\nBut then again, I've never liked it in real life and here I am, enjoying the hell out of it. I was actually on vacation in Astoria while trying this recipe so when I saw a place called Schwietert's Cones &amp; Candy I decided to go in, in the hopes of finding some authentic euopean-style licorice candies (and maybe even the ice cream) After trying some from Germany, Australia, and The Netherlands I learned a lot about what I’d been missing, only ever having things like Good &amp; Plenty and Red Vines to set up my expectations. Most importantly I learned the difference between sweet and salty licorice and that there’s more variety than even that... but enough about my licorice adventure--If you do enjoy licorice in any of its many permutations then give this recipe a shot. It nails salted licorice and the cream here seems to knock down the sharper edges of the licorice notes, which blends it perfectly into the ice cream rather than it being sprinkled with chunks of licorice candy. &#xD;\n&#xD;\nIt’s a well balanced recipe that has me excited at the prospect of trying the real thing some day. &#xD;\n"}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"145553","name":"Black Swirl"}}}
