The Purilium watermelon is very candy like and a great flavor on its own. FA watermelon to me gives more of that authentic watermelon taste. FLV wild melons adds a bit more of all melon flavor without being to overpowering at .75%. Added the Vanilla swirl to give it some creaminess as well as juiciness so the recipe is not dry. The FA Custard adds just a bit of citrus to the mix and really blend well with these flavors. No added sweetness is necessary as ITS ALREADY PRETTY SWEET. Good off the Shake steep 3 days for best results. \r\n","steep_days":"3","temperature":"0","recipe_score":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-11T19:41:03.000-05:00","best_vg":"60%","views":"1447","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Watermelon","flavor_id":"7797","vendor":"PUR","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Red Summer (watermelon)","flavor_id":"471","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Wild Melon","flavor_id":"619","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":750},{"name":"Vanilla Swirl","flavor_id":"189","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Custard","flavor_id":"484","vendor":"FA","millipercent":2000}],"reviews":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"59983","name":"Sweet Juicy Melons "}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
