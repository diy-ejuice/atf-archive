I was on my sixth beer and standing over the Toilet doing my business when I thought  I want something fruity and tarty to vape. So I threw a 15 ml of this together. It was so good after a quick shake, or that could have just been my drunkenness! I wasn't so sure so this afternoon I said let me taste that recipe I made last night again. oh my god was my first impression, the flavors mixed together were outstanding; just bursting Onto my palette with such and intense feeling of fruit, melons and tart. This truly was just the perfect vape I've been searching for. Made at 65/35Pg.  Steep time 1 day, HOPE YOU ALL ENJOY IT AT MUCH AS I DID. Feedback would be appreciated.
