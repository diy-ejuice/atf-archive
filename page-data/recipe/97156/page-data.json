Slightly green. I get an unexpected spice note that really shines. Right amount of sweetness. Tested on a Profile RDA, 40 watts .18ohm kanthal mesh."},{"user":"catwood","text":"This is quite possibly the smoothest and creamiest banana combination I have ever tasted. It has a light sweetness that is balanced very well. The crepe is a light back note and where it should be when you smother a crepe with lovely creamy sweet and moist banana's. I like how you held the custard back and let the banana's and the creams be the hero on the crepe. Well done and thank you for a delicious recipe.
