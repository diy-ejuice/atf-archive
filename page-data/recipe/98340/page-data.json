This was a recipe based on one of my guilty pleasures. I love Little Debbie Oatmeal Cream Pies! The fluffy sweet cream smashed between two soft, chewy oatmeal cookies takes me back to one of my simple pleasures as a child.\r\n\r\nWhen thinking about this profile, one would think the starting point would be some sort of oat or oatmeal flavoring. But as some of you may know from some of my other recipes, I rarely go the traditional route.  As I was doing research,(after a empty box of Little Debbies) I realized that one of the main notes I was getting was ginger.  So, that's where I started.  This profile is best described as a chewy, ginger spiced, oatmeal cream pie.\r\n\r\nThe oatmeal cookie:\r\nI wanted to see if I could bend CAP Gingerbread into a soft, chewy oatmeal cookie. Now I'm not sure if it's 100% authentic, but it's pretty damn close! I'm also relying on the power of suggestion in this recipe. And believe you me, the power of suggestion is real!\r\n\r\nCAP Gingerbread is one of the most underutilized flavorings in my opinion. It has a very slight cinnamon note that fades to the background pretty quickly. It absolutely has a ginger spice that holds through the entire vape. It has a wonderful soft, chewy texture that reminds me of a soft oatmeal cookie and that's why I used it in this mix. I added FA Cookie at .5 % to add a bit more of a dark cookie note and add some texture and slight brown sugar notes. FA Cookie is good if you want to add darker notes to your cookie unlike CAP Sugar Cookie, while it's a wonderful flavor, it's more of a bright sugar cookie.\r\n\r\nThe Cream:\r\nAnytime I want to add a fluffy cream to my profiles, TPA Bavarian Cream is my go to. Now it can be a little heavy in a recipe and that's why I added FA Cream Fresh at 1% to lift it up a bit and add some bright, fluffiness to the cream, just as the cream is in a oatmeal cream pie. I also added 1% TPA Vanilla Swirl to help cut through the creams and give it a more vibrant feel.\r\n\r\nThe CAP Super Sweet at .5% may be a little high for some people, but that's where I find it works the best for me(I do like my sweets). Feel free to use a lower percentage if you prefer a lower sweetness.\r\n\r\nThis can be a shake and vape, but if you let it set for just a few days the slight cinnamon dies down and the ginger settles in. Recommended steep time is 5 days.\r\n\r\nI hope you will mix this up and see if it takes you back to your childhood memories of this delicious snack!\r\n\r\nVisit Freedom To Mix on Discord https://discord.gg/SmSc8Ef\r\nJoin our Freedom To Mix FaceBook group https://www.facebook.com/groups/415341418920740/ \r\nVisit https://freedomtomix.com/ for resources and information on DIY mixing!\r\n","steep_days":"5 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":4.5,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:50:08.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"5823","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Gingerbread","flavor_id":"58","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Cookie","flavor_id":"490","vendor":"FA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Bavarian Cream","flavor_id":"145","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Cream Fresh","flavor_id":"540","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Vanilla Swirl","flavor_id":"189","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Super Sweet","flavor_id":"2384","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":500}],"reviews":[{"user":"RUG_ly","text":"This recipe is great folkart. This is an ADV for me. Creamy, Bakery, Buttery yeah I love it. TFA Bavarian Cream is one of my favorites. Will definitely mix this again. "},{"user":"Grfxman","text":"This is a great recipe, but it is more of a gingersnap cream pie. A really great gingersnap cream pie. The ginger is very mild after a 10 day steep, the pie and cream notes are spot on - this recipe is very well balanced and dreamy to vape. Still searching for a true oatmeal vape..."},{"user":"finsamson","text":"Fantastic recipe, I purchased CAP gingerbread just to try this, it's a strange experience vaping ginger. Definitely a chewy gingerbread taste, not so much oatmeal, but I've never had a Little Debbie so I can't compare to the real deal. Thanks so much for sharing this one! It's given me some great ideas getting this flavouring"},{"user":"Demonic_Mixer","text":"This stuff is really tasty.After a shake the ginger is a bit too much but after a couple of days it fades away and you get a really nice and creamy vape.I can see the resemblance between and oatmeal cookie and the gingerbread cookie combo.And as tootall says with a bit power of suggestion you could sell this as an actual oatmeal cookie juice.The cream is spot on.I just went with 0.25% super sweet which is more than enough for me.The next batch will have even less sweetener. Thanks for the great recipe!"},{"user":"Untitled","text":""},{"user":"Ebc88","text":"This is good i was gonna give it 5⭐️, but it doesn’t remind me of an oatmeal cream pie. The ginger in it is fairly strong to me and taste more like a soft gingerbread cookie with some cream sandwiched between, but it is a tasty recipe"},{"user":"R2ME2","text":"Another great recipe from a fantastic mixer and a very inventive way to use Cap gingerbread.  I got it based on his recommendation for this recipe and I’m so glad I got it. As a SNV it gingerbread forward, which is very pleasant.  I took a queue from Trevorgage and added 0.25% FA Almond, WF oatmeal and cream and FW hazelnut to give it more texture and because I just love nutty stuff. Excellent job dude!"},{"user":"Trevorxgage","text":"Woah, very impressive man. This is really good. I've actually been working on this profile myself and picked up CAP Gingerbread just a couple weeks back, so I gave it a mix. The cream filling is on point for sure. The gingerbread does a great job at bringing that soft cookie and ginger taste that the actually lil debbie's carry. The only thing it lacks is a bit of the oat flavor and texture, but that has been very difficult to come by in vape form. &#xD;\n&#xD;\nI've already mixed a couple bottles of this as is, I'll probably be trying out with a little RF oatmeal cookie and maybe a touch of FA almond to bring some texture out. "},{"user":"Woody0707","text":"Man, I was a little skeptical about the gingerbread for this. Mixed it up 2 days ago and just filled my tank. This stuff is pretty spot on IMO. Awesome job with this one! Gonna need a bigger batch! I too am obsessed with that damn Lil Debbie. "},{"user":"CygnusY1","text":"Really solid looking recipe using staple flavours.  I like the way you use accessible flavours in your recipes too; It demonstrates you don't need  trendy or flashy flavours to make a great juice.
