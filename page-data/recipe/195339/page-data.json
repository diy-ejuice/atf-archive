As a Shake'n'Vape you won't notice much of it as it takes some time to settle in the mix.\r\nBanana Cream is a strong, candy like flavor. At first I had it at 3% which was way too much.\r\nButter Pecan fits in between the banana and the doughnut, adding some nutty flavors.\r\nFrench Vanilla is also an addition I added later on, it rounds up the whole mixture, without it something felt missing.\r\n\r\nCan be used as a SNV, good after 3 days, best at 7.","steep_days":"7 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T12:48:21.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"560","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Banana Cream","flavor_id":"210","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Butter Pecan","flavor_id":"8740","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Glazed Doughnut","flavor_id":"59","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":3500},{"name":"Super Sweet","flavor_id":"2384","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":500},{"name":"French Vanilla","flavor_id":"56","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1000}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"195339","name":"Banana pecan doughnut v 0.2"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
