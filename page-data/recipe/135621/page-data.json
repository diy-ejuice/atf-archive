A failed marriage, Alcohol dependency, and now being forced to watch his life's work suffer to the likes of Tony the Tiger.\r\n\r\n\"That fucking animal,\" he mutters. \"That half breed asshole thinks he's won, well...\" He takes a long pull from his beer bottle, smacking his lips with a crooked evil grin. \"I've got news for him\".\r\n\r\nHe rises, grunting from the years of wear on his decrepit bones. He lumbers across the room.\r\n\r\nSliding newspapers across the kitchen table reveals a corded home phone. With little hesitation he snatches it from it's cradle. He immediately plucks away at the numbers on the keypad with moderate intensity, the same wry crooked smile pursed on his lips.\r\n\r\nThe line rings but perhaps half a second when the other side of the line answers with little more than a breathing sound.\r\n\r\n\"Hello\", mutters Cap. \"Are.. Are you there?\"\r\n\r\n\"Old man.\" The voice on the line states, void of any sign of emotion.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" continues Cap. \"I would.. Like to place an, an order.\"\r\n\r\n\"Sure.\" The other line states coldly. \"What sort of infestation are you referring to?\"\r\n\r\nThe old man smiles broader now, seething with malicious glee.\r\n\r\n\"A tiger.\" Cap says with entirely too much satisfaction.\r\n\r\nThe line goes dead. Cap stares at it blankly for a moment, the same malicious expression stuck to his face. Placing it back into it's cradle he lifts a paper from the table and brings it closer for further examination.\r\n\r\nAn article displaying a smiling Tony the Tiger is sprawled across the front, Cap's smile tranforms into a face taut with hatred.\r\n\r\n\"Say Goodbye,\" Cap seeths, \"This is going to be grrrrrr-eeaaaaat.\" He laughs maniacally.\r\n\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n**Milk** // OOO Cream Milky Undertone, FA Meringue, LA Cream Cheese Icing, FW Hazelnut\r\n\r\n**Cereal** // TFA Berry Crunch, CAP Cereal 27\r\n\r\n**Fruits** // TFA Blueberry Extra, JF Strawberry Sweet","steep_days":"14","temperature":"420","recipe_score":5,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:50:40.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"5891","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Berry Crunch","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":4500},{"name":"Blueberry (extra)","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Cereal 27","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Cream Cheese Icing","vendor":"LA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Cream Milky Undertone PG","vendor":"OOO","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Hazelnut","vendor":"FW","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Meringue","vendor":"FA","millipercent":2250},{"name":"Strawberry Sweet","vendor":"JF","millipercent":1250}],"reviews":[{"user":"elsignor","text":"One of the best cereal vape I had so far.
