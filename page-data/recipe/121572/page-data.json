This is a shake and vape, you will find it starts off a bit more Grape forward, but then as time goes by you will taste the strawberry coming through. These two fruits just \"jel\" well together - I wont call it blending ;)\r\n\r\nThis is a sweet sugary soda...... yeah, I have a crazy sweet tooth. \r\n\r\nTFA Strawberry Ripe & CAP Strawberry Sweet &  TFA Strawberry = My syrupy strawberry stone\r\n\r\nCAP Jelly Candy = Adds a bit of texture, also adds some candy vibes to the soda. \r\n\r\nWS23 = Closest thing to a cold fizz you going to get.

When I am looking for a sweet soda type soda, this is great, simple flavors most of us probably all have. I found an older bottle I  thought I lost must have been couple months old, and what I did find, the flavors are not as intense as snv or fairly fresh, is it turns into a nice grapey/strawberry gum, and that\"s not a bad thing :). Need to start a new trend, as we have the trinities now, well, we could call this 2in1 vape, nice soda, then eventually turns into a gum(not sure when it did that as have vaped it upto 3 weeks before and wasn't like that, so guessing monthish maybe?. anyhow, thanks for the share and nice recipe"}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"121572","name":"Missionary (Grape & Strawberry Soda)"}}}
