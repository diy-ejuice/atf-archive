I’ve been really enjoying FA zeppola lately, and using to make a more doughy biscuit/cake/pastry type base. This is like a doughy frosted pineapple tart, whatever that is, and definitely one of the best recipes I’ve come up with. Originally I wanted a cooked or darkened pineapple profile, and was tempted to start adding in TFA brown sugar or FA caramel to find it, but somehow came out with both hints of fresh and cooked fruit which I liked, so I decided to keep it that way. This recipe came together the quickly and easily, which for me has often been a sign that the recipe will see frequent orbits in my DIY rotation. Unlike many of my mediocre recipes that have many subtle ingredients everything in this recipe (except the meringue) stands strong and confidently, which is probably why it works well and is definitely something I will take with me into future recipes. I'm quite proud of this, hopefully some others can enjoy this mix as much as me.\r\n\r\nINW Pineapple / FA Kiwi\r\nWell I can’t say I “selected” these as using these was the brief I set myself. The pair make for a nice juicy pineapple++ layer with lots of punch and some nice accents. I left the percentages at the original 3/3 strengths as this strength is very versatile, and I didn’t want to play with the ratio as this would change the profile too far from the original recipe.\r\n\r\nFA Apple Pie / FA Zeppola \r\nThis is the pastry component, and is way more interesting than the common biscuit/cookie/graham combinations we've all seen before. It's by no means realistic to any real foods, and I chose these simply because I was looking for new and interesting ways to build this layer. If I had TPA Pie Crust I would have tried it here, but I don't so I didn't. I don't get much apple from FA Apple Pie but I guess the apple accent is in there somewhere, and probably what is giving me an hint of stewed fruit.\r\n\r\nFW Whipped Cream / LA Cream Cheese Icing / FA Meringue \r\nThis is a fairly lightweight cream layer from FW, and it's probably not the best whipped cream available, but adding LA CCI gives it a much fuller body and a slightly pungent thickness. I love the way CCI smells and I think the aroma accurately represents it's purpose in the recipe. The meringue is there to sweeten the deal and remind you this is a dessert. It still works without the meringue but it definitely helps round this layer out. I wanted the creams to be just enough for a full mouth feel and smooth exhale, but kept it minimal and light as the fruits in this recipe won't stand up to very heavy creams.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n ","steep_days":"14","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:49:38.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"2026","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Pineapple","vendor":"INW","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Kiwi","vendor":"FA","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Apple Pie","vendor":"FA","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Zeppola","vendor":"FA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Cream Cheese Icing","vendor":"LA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Whipped Cream","vendor":"FW","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Meringue","vendor":"FA","millipercent":500}],"reviews":[{"user":"fcomputerg","text":"after watching the show and how dave described what he tasted i decided to give this a try. i didn't have the fw whipped cream so i subbed in tfa vbic at 2.5% as this is a very close sub and .50% caps vwc. right of the mix as a snv this is Amazing recipe. the zeppola is transformed into what to taste like a very good crust flavor. I'm not even going to wait for steep and mixed up 240ml.. because that's all i have enough flavoring left to make. "},{"user":"ID10-T","text":"This came out lovely. I get clearly defined layers of juicy kiwi, unique pastry reminiscent of a doughy pie crust, and a sweet-but-slightly tangy cream. I'm not really tasting pineapple but the kiwi definitely seems improved - moistened, sweetened, tarted up - by it. Something is giving it a cooked feel as if baked in a tart and I dig it. Other than it being described as a pineapple tart and the pineapple having faded into merely a kiwi modifier after a long steep, I can't find anything to complain about here. Lots of recipes promise layers but actually just taste like most of the flavors are blended together. This one, however, delivers. And there's something special about that Apple Pie/Zeppola tart crust combo. "}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"67279","name":"Raincoat"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
