I will sound like a slight broken record, after ID10-T. The chocolate note was almost perfect, and it is a very accurate cookie dough. I feel it is more of a creamy cookie dough, over a cookie dough ice cream, which saddens me a little bit. I think I will increase the VBIC or try another ice cream and see where that takes me. If you have a chance, mix this up though, its very good. "},{"user":"Chewymidget","text":"This is a really good mix. Like others said, lacking a little in the ice cream department but doesn't hold it back any. I don't think you can source TS Cookie Dough anymore but if you manage to get some give this recipe a shot!"},{"user":"MattDGTL","text":""},{"user":"ConcreteRiver","text":"Tried this via mixer's club. This is an excellent cookie dough vape, which is something I never though I'd be typing out in a review... but here we are. I like the level of chocolate, the heaviness, the vanilla, the buttery notes from the VBIC, and the wax from the VBG.  What I'm missing is the ice cream here. I know the concentrates are in there, and it should totally taste like ice cream, but that cookie dough base just soaks up all that richness that you've thrown at it.  I feel like the \"correct\" way to rate this would be to bitch about that, and leave something other than a 5.  But with that said, I'm just impressed as hell with the cookie dough here, and I'm rating this more by how tasty this is, and not strict accuracy to the description."},{"user":"ID10-T","text":"This is delicious. The chocolate chip cookie dough chunks part of this is wonderful. I get a startlingly accurate cookie dough that's maybe a bit heavy on the chocolate, not quite chocolate cookie dough with chocolate chips but more like the chocolate chip cookie dough ice cream with extra chocolate chunks. I like the vanilla flavor, it reminds me of the way I like to add extra vanilla to homemade cookie dough. But the 4 instead of 5 stars, despite the great flavor here, is because seems to be seriously lacking in the ice cream department. I wouldn't have guessed it was supposed to be an ice cream recipe if I hadn't read the description. I think I'd like to try this with more VBIC in it and maybe some other ice cream ingredients like HS French Vanilla Ice Cream, if those could be increased/added without messing up this tasty cookie dough.

It's a very accurate cookie dough ice cream, Great job!"}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"40863","name":"COOKIE BRO DOUGH"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
