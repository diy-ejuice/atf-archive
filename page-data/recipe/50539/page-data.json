There is no caramel flavours in this as none of the ones i have seemed to fit as i didn't want a candy style, just melted sugar in butter, so i went with the butterscotch ripple as i feel this has a caramel flavour at low percentages, plus it helps with the creaminess of the vbic. Apple pie and CDS in low percentages are there just to add a light spice to the fruit. Needing a light alcohol backnote i went with 1 percent kentucky bourbon which for me is just the right amount to give it some warmth ( you may like it a little higher but for me this is perfect )\r\nNo sweetener as such, that's what the meringue is for, to give a light sugary sweetness to the fruits.\r\n\r\nAfter a 3 day steep the profile is just what i was aiming for.\r\n\r\nQuite a lot of flavours but nothing unusual.\r\n","steep_days":"3","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-05T09:51:17.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"1463","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Peach (juicy)","flavor_id":"254","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Fuji","flavor_id":"506","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Vanilla Bean Ice Cream","flavor_id":"186","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Butterscotch Ripple","flavor_id":"1217","vendor":"FW","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Kentucky Bourbon","flavor_id":"361","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Cookie","flavor_id":"490","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Cinnamon Danish Swirl V2","flavor_id":"36","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":500},{"name":"Meringue","flavor_id":"530","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Peach","flavor_id":"804","vendor":"INW","millipercent":1000}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"50539","name":"Caramelized Peach / Apple a la mode"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
