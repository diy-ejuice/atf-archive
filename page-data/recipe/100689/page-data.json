Needs to steep but then doesnt disappoint. It is very sweet, juicy and gives more the feel of a fresh sherbet ice cream than a heavy ice cream. The butterscotch fills the gap between the juice and the cream and adds nice sweetness. Fits the picture imo but could also imagine a popsicle with a white light vanilla ice cream core surrounded by juicy orange water ice, slightly melted already. Will try some variations with LB Vanilla Ice Cream, FW Salted Caramel and so on.","steep_days":"7","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T02:16:15.000-05:00","best_vg":"80%","views":"1542","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Blood Orange","vendor":"FW","millipercent":1250},{"name":"Royal Orange Juice","vendor":"FA","millipercent":750},{"name":"Shisha Orange","vendor":"INW","millipercent":500},{"name":"Vienna Cream","vendor":"LB","millipercent":2000},{"name":"French Vanilla Ice Cream","vendor":"VT","millipercent":5000},{"name":"Butterscotch","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1250}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"100689","name":"Lucky-O-Cream"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
