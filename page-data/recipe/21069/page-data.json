It turned out differently than expected It tastes like a very strong cinnamon bun with almost a caramel flavor backing it. I really enjoy this recipe, and I hope you do too! Everyone is free to edit this recipe and change it!\r\n\r\nIt turns out that this actually makes for a great shake and vape! 3 days later is when it is best though.

This is delicious man!! The cinnamon is strong but not harsh or spicy and the mouth feel is full, dense, with that creamy pastry making all very well balanced. The only thing I would change is to lower the Cinnamon Roll to 7% but only as a personal taste to make it more ADV. Congratulations, you have an incredible recipe! (PD. Sorry for my bad english)"}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"21069","name":"Cin-Custard"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
