Creamy and fatty with subtle hints of citrus from the Catalan.\r\n\r\nCinnamon Roll: Imparts a cinnamon roll taste without adding much pastry note at 1.5%. \r\n\r\nCaramel: Cooked sugar taste for the hard topping. \r\n\r\nHoney Flue Cured: I added this after the whole crème brûlée steeped almost two months. SC flavors seem to be enjoyable right away, so in fear of it possibly fading, I added this afterwards. It throws some honey into the mix and finishes off the whole recipe with a comforting hug of pleasant tobacco leaf. A few days to get settled in and it's Flavortown!\r\n\r\nI find this to be much better in a tank due to the richness factor.","steep_days":"45","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"total_reviews":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-06T03:08:46.000-05:00","best_vg":"50%","views":"1047","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Vanilla Custard","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Catalan Cream","vendor":"FA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Cinnamon Roll","vendor":"FW","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Caramel","vendor":"INW","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Cream Fresh","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Butter","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Honey Flue Cured","vendor":"SC","millipercent":2000}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"64557","name":"Spoon Lickin' Good"}}}
