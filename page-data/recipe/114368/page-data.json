This is super simple and authentically delicious. Tastes good as a shake and vape, and is great after an overnighter. 5 to 7 days for perfection. I haven't tried it but a smidge of ws-23 may drive home an authentic cold and milky bowl of Apple Jack's. So mix it up and enjoy, thanks KRUCIAL...","steep_days":"7","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"updated_at":"2020-12-12T10:34:22.000-05:00","best_vg":"75%","views":"2384","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Apple Snacks","flavor_id":"9903","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Apple Stark","flavor_id":"4887","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1250},{"name":"Cinnamon Danish Swirl","flavor_id":"35","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":750},{"name":"Ethyl Maltol","flavor_id":"1710","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":250}],"reviews":[{"user":"Deftohms","text":"Geeeez, this is so spot on and delicious.
