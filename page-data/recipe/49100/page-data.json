An excellent vape for those hot summer days* \r\n\r\n**Flavor Notes**  \r\n\r\n*INW Shisha Bilberry* -- Immediately I noticed a eucalyptus note with this one. It was off-putting at first but quite juicy and the blueberry flavor is well pronounced. Props to /u/SkiddlzNinja for suggesting a Tea recipe when reviewing this flavor on [Noted](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSITYZYzGa0&t=93s) \r\n\r\n*INW Eucalyptus w/ Mint* -- The eucalyptus and cooling aspect of this flavor is wonderful. Very potent, realistic, and super chilly.\r\n\r\n*FLV Lemon Tea* -- This is my first time trying this flavoring, but it does provide a very nice tea base (I get green tea?) with a bit of lemon accent. I don't particularly notice any dryness. Fairly weak for FLV, had it at 1.5% initially but the tea note was not coming through enough, though it is trying to overcome strong flavors like eucalyptus.\r\n\r\n*INW Shisha Lemon* -- I like the way this one offers a sweet sort of lemon syrup flavor. It manages to really accent the lemon, reinforce the 'sweet tea' aspect, and is sublte enough to let the other flavors penetrate the lemons.\r\n\r\n*FA Summer Clouds* -- So this is an interesting flavoring. The first thing that comes to mind to describe this one is \"Mist.\" I wouldn't say it's \"wet,\" but it certainly isn't dry. It has a slight floral note to it though it's difficult for me to pick out; if I had to guess I might say lavender. It does something pretty wonderful to this mix here playing off of the floral and earth notes. I get maybe a little bit of grapefruit too from it, but it's hard to say since I only SFT @ 1% and it's a fairly mild flavor.\r\n\r\n*FLV Sweetness* -- Recipe wasn't quite as sweet as I wanted it to be so here you go! This one is certainly less concentrated than CAP Super Sweet, and I feel it's more of a rounded sweetness instead of just sucralose, very nice sweetener.\r\n\r\nThis recipe yields a cool, wet vape with earth, floral, and citrus notes. I wasn't sure if I was going to like this profile, but after mixing it up it is extremely satisfying. Great during the hot day and very soothing on a tired throat.","steep_days":"1 (SNV)","temperature":"400","recipe_score":0,"total_reviews":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:49:21.000-05:00","best_vg":"80%","views":"3210","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Eucalyptus With Mint","vendor":"INW","millipercent":250},{"name":"Shisha Bilberry","vendor":"INW","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Shisha Lemon","vendor":"INW","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Lemon Tea","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Summer Clouds","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Sweetness","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":300}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"49100","name":"Summer Tea"}}}
