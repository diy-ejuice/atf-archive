Not a cooked banana per se, but not the raw banana slices you'd get from PUR banana either.\r\n\r\nCinnamon danish swirl does what it does best and adds a little bit of sweet cinnamon to the mix. the amount of richness and body of the other flavors ensures that this doesn't overwhelm the mix.\r\n\r\nthe crepe is a delightfully effective soft bakery note to hold it all together, just like it would at the breakfast table.","steep_days":"1 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"updated_at":"2020-12-12T14:07:13.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"3673","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Crepe SC","flavor_id":"8365","vendor":"WF","millipercent":3500},{"name":"Cinnamon Danish Swirl","flavor_id":"35","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Banana Cream","flavor_id":"210","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Caramel Toffee","flavor_id":"2121","vendor":"HS","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Dx Peanut Butter","flavor_id":"288","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Hazelnut","flavor_id":"1312","vendor":"FW","millipercent":1000}],"reviews":[{"user":"UnappreciatedRobot","text":"If I am being completely honest, I thought I would hate this. Breakfast vapes and peanut butter vapes have always been very off-putting to me, but I decided to give this a shot. I was very surprised to find that this was the first breakfast AND peanut butter recipe that I didn't hate. I vaped the entire 15ml bottle I made up and even made another one after that. It still is not my favorite profile and definitely not an ADV, but this definitely deserves 5 stars as I think people who like this type of profile to begin with will absolutely love it.","score":5},{"user":"humanpuck","text":"If I'm being completely honest I don't under stand how TPA Banana Cream is not runts in this.  I don't get any candy at all and I want to know how you hacked the matrix.   This is tastes to me like a nice smooth creamy natural PB with about 20% Nutella added to it.  This is a good use of the cinnamon danish swirl, but I wonder if more authentic cinnamon like rich cinnamon would taste in here.  I actually want to find this crepe somewhere I can order it for breakfast and I think that's an indication of how good this recipe is...I actually want to find a place that can make me something like it to eat. ","score":5},{"user":"AlfredPudding","text":"I was lucky enough to try this one early. It's an absolutely delicious peanut butter and banana filled crepe. Something about the combination of HS Caramel Toffee, TPA DX Peanut Butter, and FW Hazelnut creates the best peanut butter filling I've tried. It also helps the TPA Banana Cream avoid being a completely artificial banana flavoring. Then you toss in a hint of cinnamon and the light, fluffy crepe from WF Crepe and you have yourself a winner.
