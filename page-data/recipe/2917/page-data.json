I went back to the drawing board realizing I thought I wanted a maple donut but all of my attempts still had me going back to the original Deputy recipe. I decided to do a remix instead. I added .5% of tpa dragonfruit to brighten the raspberry, .5% of fa meringue, .5% of tpa Bavarian cream, .5% of Vienna cream and .5% la cream cheese icing. Wanted to go all out with a cream filling for the donut.
