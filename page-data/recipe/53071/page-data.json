Enjoy!\r\n\r\nMixed this up last August and realized I forgot to post it here when I went to re-mix it.","steep_days":"3 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:49:25.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"6774","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Cactus","flavor_id":"647","vendor":"INW","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Guanabana","flavor_id":"4427","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Pink Guava","flavor_id":"637","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1000}],"reviews":[{"user":"Denske","text":"This is a phenomenal fruit mix...great use of some very complex flavors"},{"user":"staybert","text":"Wow, I have a hard time describing this. It's fantastic. Usually INW Cactus will be a bully, esp at 1%, but here it just blends in perfectly with the sweetness of the guanabana and zesty citrusy notes from pink guava to end up in a very fresh summertime vape. I tried it without any coolant, but I'll definitley be mixing more of this, feels like a given in this kind of mix. Well done!"},{"user":"ID10-T","text":"It took me way too long to get around to mixing this up. I love the way these ingredients work together, the mouthwatering citrusy pink guava and cactus with that weird but wonderful sort of tart strawberry-pineapple from the Guanabana on top and then the rich, creamy, funky banana-coconut base of the Guanabana with added depth and juiciness from the cactus. Just three ingredients, but so complex and full of flavor.  "},{"user":"Ebc88","text":"This is absolutely delicious had to mix another batch. Perfect vape for summer "},{"user":"gianmarcopc","text":""},{"user":"corvape","text":"Excellent simple summertime recipe. I was looking for a recipe to try Guanabana for the first time cause I did not feel like single flavor testing it.&#xD;\nThis was a perfect fit.&#xD;\nWith guanabana being the star of the show, the supporting flavors of pink guava and Inw cactus to make it interesting.&#xD;\nThis mix went excellent with a Corona in the sun.&#xD;\nThank you for sharing, its coming to Florida with me next week. Cant wait to see what else I can do with Guanabana.. So tasty"},{"user":"wadeyloops","text":"Stunning, complex and dreamy. This takes me away to a tropical paradise. I know you said \"If you don't see any new recipes from me for a long time, you can rest assured I ran out of INW Waffle and died of sorrow\" but please come back to the mixing world. We miss you Runt."},{"user":"CheebaSteeba","text":"Such a lovely combination of flavors. I am a big fan of all of these individually but this mix is greater than the sum of its parts. A delectable and refreshing summertime mix. I love it! Tried both with and without the ice; both are great but ice wears on my lungs a bit so I've got it mixed up again without and am thoroughly enjoying it. Thanks Runt! An easy new ADV for me. Glad you posted it up!"}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"53071","name":"Kawayan"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
