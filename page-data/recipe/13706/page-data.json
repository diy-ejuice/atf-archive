This recipe  must have at least a 1 week steep, at 2 weeks it is amazing. It can be mixed at whatever ratio you like but I think it's best at Max VG. The only difference between version 1 and version 2 is I added .5% butter pecan and .5% of caramel to sweeten it up version 1did not carry the sweetness that I had gotten from the reference. I was also considering raising the sugar cookie another .5% but I did not want to affect the cream negatively. So here it is feel free to make changes to suit your taste and enjoy.","steep_days":"0","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"updated_at":"2020-12-12T14:04:48.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"5360","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Butter Pecan","flavor_id":"1212","vendor":"FW","millipercent":3500},{"name":"Carmel (caramel)","flavor_id":"503","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Sugar Cookie","flavor_id":"115","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Vanilla Bean Ice Cream","flavor_id":"4","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Vanilla Bean Gelato","flavor_id":"185","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2500}],"reviews":[{"user":"MrColdOne","text":"I made this about a month or so ago and have been vaping this nonstop for a few days!

This juice sat as I had quite a bit in rotation already.  I just started vaping it yesterday after about a month of steeping.  Very tasty and great mouth feel","score":5},{"user":"Burritoclock","text":"HAd version 1 and it is another profile nailer, delivered what you expect/want from a Butter Pecan Gelato. The sweetness adds sound perfect and I'll be mixing this one up too.","score":5},{"user":"Aquaneo","text":"Well I forgot about this one so it ended up with a month steep and it is very accurate to a pecan gelato. It is sweet but has a slight throat hit I didn't expect. It is a very authentic gelato and I enjoyed this vape very much. The more I vape the more I love it. Its subtle but satisfying.  I will definitely make this one again. Great job on this one Krucial","score":5}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"13706","name":"Southern Butter Pecan Gelato V2"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
