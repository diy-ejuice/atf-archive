It is a good blend of flavors leaving a green accent behind to keep you guessing. It's a little weird a bit strange and a lot berry but that's what I wanted something different for my palate. It is Berrylicious!!!!!! What do you think???? I realize this is a rather pricey $$$$$ mix. It is nothing like my normal recipes and I wouldn't rush out to buy the ingredients but it is a good use of these somewhat weird flavors. I hadn't been able to use alpine strawberry up to this point. I was more or less trying to utilize alpine strawberry in a mix.","steep_days":"1 (SNV)","temperature":"420","recipe_score":5,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:49:20.000-05:00","best_vg":"75%","views":"3926","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Acai","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Boysenberry","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Berry Blend","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":500},{"name":"Alpine Strawberry","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":500},{"name":"Sweetness","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":250}],"reviews":[{"user":"CheebaSteeba","text":"As the name suggests, this recipe is Berry Berry good! If you're looking for a pleasant berry vape then look no further. This is more along a dark berry flavor, though you do have the Alpine picking up a lot of the bright notes you need here and the touch of sweetness is delicious. A wonderful use of Alpine Strawberry"}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"46918","name":"Berry Berry Good "}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
