Any flavors I had that matched the dough character I added at around the normally used percentages. What cake out of it was shake and vape goodness that will only get better. To me it tastes like a full bodied old fashioned buttermilk doughnut with that thick sugar glaze coating. Precisely what I wanted it to taste like. I may revisit this and add either cap custard at 2% or fa custard at 2% or maybe even a Bavarian cream at 2% would suit this nicely. If you decide to add some custard to this one I would feel you could safely omit the marshmallow and meringue.
