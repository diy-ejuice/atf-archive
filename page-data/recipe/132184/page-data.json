Removed the WF pistachio, upped TFA to 3.5% and upped Holy Grail to 7%. Give it a try. It definitely upped the sweetness a bit with more caramel coming through from the Holy Grail. I wont be changing this original recipe though as I worked pretty hard on it and I still think it's great as is. Both versions are worth vaping to me üëçüèª\r\n\r\nThis came about from 2 things: My love of Charlie Noble's Pistachio RY4 , and my newfound love for Fear's Cardinal \r\nCharlie Noble Pistschio RY4 was my first ADV. I loved it. When I started mixing I was stoked to find DiYorDie had a somewhat close clone of it. His one shot was my first foray into mixing. So this profile holds a special place for me. \r\nFast forward a couple years and I haven't messed with tobacco's much for some time now. Then do to popular reviews I finally pick up holy holy RY4 and some Flavorah Tobaccos , and try Cardinal. Blown away. Freaking delicious. \r\nSo now comes this, not quite a straight up Pistachio Cardinal, and not quite PRY4 with holy holy ry4 subbed. More of an inspired by both greats situation. \r\n\r\nI started with just TPA Pistachio but then I found WF Pistachio Cream pairs really nicely with TPA while giving it a bit more of a sweet, slightly creamy vibe so I added that.\r\nI've been wanting a way to use Vanilla Bourbon but it just doesnt fit in most applications but here it pairs nicely with the tobacco and nutty notes \r\nAs far as the tobacco, I love the way that Red Burley pairs with and adds more to the tobacco notes of the holy grail ry4 \r\nLastly , I added hazelnut. It helps a tiny bit with the nuttiness but mostly it just adds a nice subtle sweetness to the mix.","steep_days":"10","temperature":"0","recipe_score":4.5,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:50:38.000-05:00","best_vg":"60%","views":"1874","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"HOLY HOLY GRAIL RY4","vendor":"DFS","millipercent":5000},{"name":"Red Burley","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":700},{"name":"Pistachio Cream SC","vendor":"WF","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Pistachio","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Hazelnut","vendor":"FW","millipercent":500},{"name":"Bourbon (vanilla Bourbon)","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000}],"reviews":[{"user":"Slushy","text":"Im rating this @ a solid 5 and going to take a spin on this recipe using Dave's suggestions I have never had the opportunity to try the original but I just ordered it today and was looking for recipes  on this profile I stumbled upon this thank youüòéüëç"},{"user":"ID10-T","text":"As another person who loves both Charlie Noble‚Äôs Pistachio RY4 and Fear‚Äôs Cardinal, I loved the idea of this mix, combining the two. This does that, and therefore is awesome. It‚Äôs a great mix, just the way it is, with Red Burley really turning that Holy Grail into a legit, robust tobacco and the pairing of the pistachio with the caramel is divine. Red Burley also pairs well with the nuttiness here, so it all works together just the way I imagined it would when I saw this recipe. The only thing I can say in terms of criticism or room for possible improvement, is that I‚Äôm missing some of sweetness and boldness that I get from both Pistachio RY4 and from Cardinal. If desired, I think it could be brought into this with just a little fine tuning. Try pushing both the Holy Holy Grail and the TFA Pistachio harder and more sweetness should come out without messing up the balance. I would turn the Holy Holy Grail up to 6, 7, maybe even 8% and the TFA Pistachio up to 3 or 4% or maybe even higher. And ditch the WF Pistachio Cream entirely, it seems to be taking away more than it‚Äôs adding here. No other changes. If that got a little rough, as too much TFA Pistachio can do, maybe replacing the Vanilla Bourbon for 1 or 2% TFA Vanilla Swirl would smooth it back down.
