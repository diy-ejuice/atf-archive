I wanted to mix up a standalone of my realistic strawberry base I made up some time ago, but with a little flair. What better way to enjoy a fresh strawberry than with a touch of powdered sugar coating it? The powdered sugar bit is a bit strange to translate into a vape as it's basically just textured sweetness. I may try to come up with something to use as an accent to bring that bit of texture out a bit more but this is enjoyable as is. Fresh, sweet and realistic strawberry. Shake & vape approved.\r\n\r\nRF Strawberry - A little lighter of a flavor but provides the great tasting realistic notes of the strawberry. Those nice fleshy tones and bits of seedy skin come out nicely. However it is lacking in the body. Can be used to add a touch more realism to another strawberry flavor or as the base for a very realistic flavor.\r\n\r\nFA Red Touch - Gives a nice bit of sweet body to the mix. I get more of the syrup/candy vibes off of this flavor. Used at 2% it fills out the middle and brings some more natural sweetness to the mix.\r\n\r\nTFA Strawberry Ripe - Another realistic strawberry but some say they cannot taste it. It does well in this mix as more of an accent, helping to blend the other two flavors together into something very tasty and realistic. Can be used much higher if desired as a standalone or to replace the RF. In this case it holds strong to tie everything together and give a bit of a pop to everything.\r\n\r\nOOO Powdered Sugar - A nice, light dusting of powdered sugar. A bit of a sweeter touch to the blend without that overboard sugar lips feeling of Super Sweet. 1% is the first amount I tried this at and it seemed to just work. Bringing out the actual powdered sugar texture is kind of tricky but the flavor is there. If you really want to sub this with something else, I would probably use something like FLV Sweetness, FW Sweetener or even TFA Sweetener. The TFA Sweetener could be interesting due to the EM content. That could help blend the different strawberries together but could also mute some of their nuances. CAP Super Sweet is a last resort sub, in my opinion. But should be fine. Just start low if subbing. Maybe around 0.25-0.5%. You can always add more, but you can't take it out once it's in.\r\n\r\nCould do well to add a touch of cooling, if it's your thing. Something like 0.25% WS-23 would really help the flavors pop and chill the vape.","steep_days":"1 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"total_reviews":2,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:50:33.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"2547","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Strawberry","vendor":"RF","millipercent":3500},{"name":"Red Touch (strawberry)","vendor":"FA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Strawberry (ripe)","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1250},{"name":"Powdered Sugar","vendor":"OOO","millipercent":1000}],"reviews":[{"user":"Skywxp3d","score":"5","text":"Wow!

To create a realistic strawberry base and add some powdered sugar. It was done using the same flavors I would pick for an authentic strawberry. RF Strawberry is my favorite for an actual strawberry, but it's so incredibly top heavy it almost doesn't exist outside of that. This is where FA Red Touch and TPA Strawberry come in. TPA Strawberry gives a perfect bottom to the combination, and FA Red Touch fills it out beautifully. The amount of powdered sugar used here is perfect. Just enough to give a wonderful softening effect and powdered sugar textural component without muting or preventing the trio of strawberries from shining. If I ever need to make something with a real strawberry this will be the base I pick. "}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"126503","name":"Dusted Strawberry"}}}
