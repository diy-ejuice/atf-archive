This one is based on a glorious Australian icecream that is up there with the best and is certainly a staple to the Ozzie diet!\r\nThe icecream base at the centre is  VT toffee ice cream and honeycomb with some assistance from LB VIC.\r\nFlavor boosts to the icecream come  from Caramel Candy and Caramel.\r\nSweeten to taste and add cooling if you like I suggest less than 0.5% Polar Blast which works better with creams than WS-23.\r\n\r\nAs with most recipes this should get you close enough and then just tweek to your liking.  If you want more chocolate do it, don't have VT use MB, want HS ice cream in it at 0.5% go your hardest. If you think you can add some LK pencil shavings that is fine with me I just want you to be very, very happy, just have have a good old Gay Time.\r\n","steep_days":"7","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T20:32:33.000-05:00","best_vg":"69%","views":"1929","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Toffee Ice Cream","vendor":"VT","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Chocolate Base (Clear)","vendor":"VT","millipercent":200},{"name":"Vanilla Ice Cream","vendor":"LB","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Caramel Candy","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Carmel (caramel)","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Caramel Rice Crispy Treats","vendor":"WF","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Honeycomb","vendor":"VT","millipercent":2000}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"98770","name":"Street's Time"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
