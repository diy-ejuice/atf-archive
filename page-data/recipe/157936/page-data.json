Not a clone of his recipe by any means, just inspired. \r\nThis will make a terrific syrup/jam base to keep mixed as a one shot and add yogurt, ice cream, cookie, or custard. Just use your imagination and mix away. \r\n\r\nFB FlvFan Page https://www.facebook.com/FLVFan/\r\nÎ©hm Grown Alchemy https://www.facebook.com/groups/ohmgrownalchemy/\r\nMixing in the Kitchen https://www.facebook.com/groups/425650464915364/\r\n\r\nYouTube\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCpzG9vsIgaCUzHVrUMHiV_g\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCDi_UubimriLWjel5Hr0pIA\r\n","steep_days":"3 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-10T17:58:23.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"1460","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Alpine Strawberry","flavor_id":"4360","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":200},{"name":"Bourbon","flavor_id":"4411","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":400},{"name":"Boysenberry","flavor_id":"614","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":200},{"name":"Cream","flavor_id":"604","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":800},{"name":"Jammy Berry","flavor_id":"10150","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":400}],"reviews":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"157936","name":"Bourberry Jam "}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
