Not a clone of his recipe by any means, just inspired. \r\nThis will make a terrific syrup/jam base to keep mixed as a one shot and add yogurt, ice cream, cookie, or custard. Just use your imagination and mix away. \r\n\r\nFB FlvFan Page https://www.facebook.com/FLVFan/\r\nÎ©hm Grown Alchemy https://www.facebook.com/groups/ohmgrownalchemy/\r\nMixing in the Kitchen https://www.facebook.com/groups/425650464915364/\r\n\r\nYouTube\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCpzG9vsIgaCUzHVrUMHiV_g\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCDi_UubimriLWjel5Hr0pIA\r\n","steep_days":"3 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"total_reviews":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-05T12:09:30.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"1456","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Alpine Strawberry","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":200},{"name":"Bourbon","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":400},{"name":"Boysenberry","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":200},{"name":"Cream","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":800},{"name":"Jammy Berry","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":400}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"157936","name":"Bourberry Jam "}}}
