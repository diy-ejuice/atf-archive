The vanilla accented tapioca styled Pudding Base, with its lightly chewy and creamy texture stabilizes the core filling. It not only enriches and thickens the mousse, it simultaneously enhances the subtle vanilla notes found in the soft and fluffy Devon Cream. \r\n\r\nBase: \r\nTo create the crispy Puff Pastry, Shortbread Cookies and Croissant were combined. The warm, dry biscuit styled Shortbread Cookies serves as the toasted and crispy outer layer of the puff pastry; while Croissant serves as the soft and lightly flaky innermost layer. Combined these two flavors create a well-rounded light croux pastry.\r\n\r\n&nbsp; \r\n\r\nMade for Mixin Vixens Ep.24\r\nhttps://youtu.be/KiwM8MaqhUM","steep_days":"7","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:50:23.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"2015","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Corn","flavor_id":"563","vendor":"FA","millipercent":650},{"name":"Croissant SC","flavor_id":"9022","vendor":"WF","millipercent":750},{"name":"Devon Cream","flavor_id":"4223","vendor":"CC","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Pudding Base","flavor_id":"8948","vendor":"VT","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Shortbread Cookies SC","flavor_id":"9045","vendor":"WF","millipercent":2500}],"reviews":[{"user":"wolfwheeler","text":"I bought FA Corn and didn‚Äôt know what to do with it or where it would actually fit once I did an SFT for it.

"},{"user":"shyndo","text":"Love this and not because I love everything with corn as the top note (I DO), but because it uses it in a fairly subtle way that adds a nice sweet corn backnote with a bit of fat to a pastry that really only gets its fat from the egg yolks used in the batter. The amount of daap in this recipe really improves upon the real thing which can be a bit dry and boring to be honest. And the corn is delicately laid in the back just surrounding the nice bakery in a warm husk &lt;3"},{"user":"MECH_MOD_RN","text":"this is FANTASTIC  sooo  good , I am in LOVE ..   forget the  sharklord ,  I now dub thee the corn queen .
