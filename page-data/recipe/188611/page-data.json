A bunch of naughty DAAP filled concentrates that work a dream together to create an amazing Vanilla ice-cream.\r\n\r\nMake a one-shot concentrate and use between 4-6% with other fruits/desserts for best results.","steep_days":"4 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"total_reviews":4,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:51:27.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"2792","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Vanilla Ice Cream","vendor":"LB","millipercent":4500},{"name":"Milk","vendor":"FA","millipercent":750},{"name":"Custard Premium","vendor":"FA","millipercent":750}],"reviews":[{"user":"TheJuiceJackBuilt","score":"5","text":"Great Ice-Cream base!

Used this quite a few times now as its becoming abit of a default ice cream for me now"}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"188611","name":"Nick’s Ice-Cream Trinity"}}}
