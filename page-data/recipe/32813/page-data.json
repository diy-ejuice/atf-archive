Always nice to have a new recipe that goes well with coffee too.","steep_days":"7","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"total_reviews":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-05T11:04:29.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"1452","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Milk Chocolate","vendor":"INW","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Australian Chocolate","vendor":"HS","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Hazelnut","vendor":"FW","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Meringue","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Rice Crunchies","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Marshmallow","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Sweetener","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1000}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"32813","name":"Chocolate Deluxe"}}}
