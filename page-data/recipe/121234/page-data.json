This is probably my favorite recipe I've ever created, and I'm happy to share it.\r\n\r\nFor the strawberry portion of the recipe, I used a combination of 3 flavors. VT Strawberry Glazed is used to add that unique glazed effect and it can't be subbed. INW Shisha Strawberry adds extra syrupy depth and TFA Strawberry adds sweet candy notes.\r\n\r\n*I updated this recipe when WF Strawberry Gummy Candy was released. The small amount used really helped the end result. If you don't have it, you can omit it, but I highly recommend this valuable flavor.\r\n\r\nTo add a darker sweet cooked berry note, FW Wild Berry Cobbler is added to accomplish this. The addition of this flavor keeps you coming back for more, and at 1%, it doesn't take over the recipe. If you have not tried this flavor, it's absolutely delicious and I highly recommend it. \r\n\r\nTo bring all the flavors together and give it some needed weight, I used FA Vanilla Ice Cream/Gelato.\r\n\r\nTo thicken up the jam/syrup, a touch of VT Vanilla Buttercream Frosting is used as well as WF Strawberry Gummy Candy.\r\n\r\nFA Graham Crust adds a nice subtle buttery banknote, along with the buttercream frosting.\r\n\r\nTo give this recipe a really nice saturated mouth feel, I used CAP Super Sweet. Initially, I had this at a higher percentage 0.7%, but have now lowered it after vaping thru so much of this. If you're sensitive to sweetness, use FW sucralose instead. Use it at your preferred percentage or omit it.\r\n\r\nIf your looking for a wonderful after meal vape, look no further. After you try it, don't be surprised if you're reaching for it all day. \r\n\r\nThis recipe really shines in an RDA. I enjoy it the most in the Recurve RDA and now the Jenna. To fully enjoy what it has to offer, push it with a good amount of heat.\r\n\r\nIf you do mix this, I would love to hear your feedback. In return, I will mix a recipe of yours, rate it, and give you some honest feedback.\r\n\r\nSteep time: Give this 2-3 days to start to develop, but you can definitely give it a go right off the shake. The buttery notes need a good 10 days to become present.\r\n\r\nIt's delicious and it holds up to long steeps. I've had this in my daily rotation since development, and plan on keeping it that way. \r\n\r\n*Updated 2/7/19\r\n\r\n70VG/30PG","steep_days":"5 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-02T08:06:00.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"1423","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Shisha Strawberry","flavor_id":"1711","vendor":"INW","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Glazed Strawberries","flavor_id":"8885","vendor":"VT","millipercent":3250},{"name":"Strawberry","flavor_id":"272","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Vanilla Ice Cream","flavor_id":"9957","vendor":"FA","millipercent":2250},{"name":"Vanilla Buttercream Frosting","flavor_id":"8990","vendor":"VT","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Super Sweet","flavor_id":"2384","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":250},{"name":"Wild Berry Cobbler ala Mode","flavor_id":"8499","vendor":"FW","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Graham Crust","flavor_id":"9950","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1250},{"name":"Strawberry Gummy Candy SC","flavor_id":"10097","vendor":"WF","millipercent":500}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"121234","name":"Berry Be Jammin"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
