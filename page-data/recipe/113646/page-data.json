Off of shake and vape, its this thick maple and fudge covered pastry with light notes of vanilla ice cream. As it steeps, the ice cream should become richer. The white fudge is being used with the yellow cake to act as the blondie. The banana nut bread is backing that up with some spices and also adding that hint of a nut since I don't own any walnut flavors, this was what I had to work with. It actually does a decent job of it. The creme brulee and maple bar are being used as the sauce drizzled on top. I am really looking forward to seeing how this mix steeps. I would give it at least a 2 week steep for the creams to shine.","steep_days":"14","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-05T15:43:46.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"1253","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Maple Bar","flavor_id":"4378","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Yellow Cake","flavor_id":"4560","vendor":"JF","millipercent":2250},{"name":"Banana Nut Bread","flavor_id":"144","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":750},{"name":"White Fudge SC","flavor_id":"8383","vendor":"WF","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Vanilla Ice Cream","flavor_id":"1511","vendor":"LB","millipercent":3500},{"name":"Creme Brulee (yc)","flavor_id":"894","vendor":"INW","millipercent":750}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"113646","name":"ExclusiveGirl's Blondie A La Mode #MixinVixens"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
