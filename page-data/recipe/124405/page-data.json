This is a love letter to citrus, and it will make your tastebuds swoon.","score":5},{"user":"NickG","text":"This is easily my favorite all time citrus vape. The flavors pop in a way that you always knew they could, but just somehow never did in any other citrus style recipe. If I had to describe it, I'd say it's like an orange, but a perfect orange. It's succulent and sweet with the absolute perfect amount of tart. Every friend I've let take a hit off my vape does a double take when they taste this, like god damn... Is this for real..? I've probably made four batches of this and each time I too do the double take when I take that first drag. Truly a masterpiece. Thank you for sharing it with us !!!","score":5},{"user":"Kittybit","text":"The citrus combo here is what young people would call \"da bomb\". A truly perfect blend that doesn't need anything to carry it. This is really how sunshine tastes like and it's amazing. ","score":5},{"user":"nowar","text":"whomever said citrus hurts the throat never vaped this. The lime/lemon combo is on point and yet doesnt overpower the Orange combo at all. doesnt need sweet, doesnt cry for coolant. it's lovely as is and still has room to grow. Next time I may add some grapefruit to take advantage of that lovely perfect sweetness because we can't have nice things like this.","score":5},{"user":"AlfredPudding","text":"I love citrus. EyeMakePizza loves citrus. This recipe is awesome. The combination of 3% Lime Tahity (Cold Pressed) and FE Lemon alone is enough for me to love this recipe. When I need a solid fruit mix, I go to this recipe's wonderful creator and he never disappoints. Then you throw in some orange citrus with FW Blood Orange and CAP Sweet Tangerine and head to flavor town. I also like to add .5% FA Bergamot to really drive the citrus home. Not that this recipe needs it, I'm just that into citrus. ","score":5}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"124405","name":"Sunshine State"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
