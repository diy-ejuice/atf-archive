It changes a lot in the first week or so, give it some time.\r\n\r\nJF RY4D - better than tfa. A bit more tobacco, cleaner vanilla and caramel.\r\n\r\nFA caramel + butterscotch - takes a short steep but once they mature it turns into a goopy sticky caramel drizzle.\r\n\r\nTFA FVC - It's malty, rich mouth coating vanilla but not as thick and eggy as custard. Definitely underrated, I put that shit on everything.\r\n\r\nINW TA Cuban Cigar - straight no frills cigar wrapper leaf flavor. Light, leathery, no bull shit.\r\n\r\nINW 555 + FLV Red Burley - primary filler tobaccos for the cigar, 555 adds that nuttiness and Red Burley melds similar notes with a dark, rich and earthy filler. Perfect intersection of profiles.\r\n\r\nINW DNB - you're gonna have a cigar and not smoke it? Light that thang up, Blondie.","steep_days":"14","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T09:27:05.000-05:00","best_vg":"65%","views":"2380","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"RY4 Double","vendor":"JF","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Tobacco Absolute Cuban Cigar","vendor":"INW","millipercent":1500},{"name":"French Vanilla Creme","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1500},{"name":"555 Gold","vendor":"INW","millipercent":750},{"name":"Carmel (caramel)","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Butterscotch","vendor":"FA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Red Burley","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Tobacco Dirty Neutral (dnb)","vendor":"INW","millipercent":1000}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"107597","name":"A Fistful of RY4"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
