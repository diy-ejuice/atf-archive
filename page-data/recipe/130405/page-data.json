If you love that, you will love this one too. If you sub the rich cinnamon for flv cinnamon crunch at .3% and bump the AP a little bit it will be closer to the original. But I prefer it this way ðŸ˜‰\r\nIdeal to bridge the period when Chef's one is out of stock. (which happens sometimes because it is so good and popular)\r\n\r\nIf you like this recipe, you should give Chef's one a try as well,  you can find the oneshot over here\r\nhttps://www.chefsflavours.co.uk/chefsvapour-concentrates/5024-mexican-fried-ice-cream.html","steep_days":"7 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"total_reviews":3,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:50:36.000-05:00","best_vg":"75%","views":"3982","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Rich Cinnamon","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":100},{"name":"Vanilla Ice Cream","vendor":"LB","millipercent":8000},{"name":"Creme Brulee (yc)","vendor":"INW","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Vanilla Custard","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Toasted Marshmallow","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Super Sweet","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":500},{"name":"Cereal 27","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Acetyl Pyrazine 5%","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":200},{"name":"Sweet Coconut","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":750},{"name":"Toasted Almond","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":350}],"reviews":[{"user":"bjorama","score":"5","text":"Certified platinum banger.
