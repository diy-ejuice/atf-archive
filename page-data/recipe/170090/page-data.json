Iced (slush type) or not iced (Soda base with whipped cream on top). As I found out on vacation at Universal, you are not supposed to mix up the non-iced version. Something in whipped cream, I'm guessing the high amount of sugar, causes the carbonation to go crazy and it can bubble out of the cup. This is not the best way to enjoy it. The best way is the iced version. Mix up with whipped cream into the soda and enjoy!\r\n\r\nButter beer is a cream soda base, not root beer, with a loosely whipped, butterscotch whipped cream layered on top. Its a very sweet treat; think i had 2 a day while I was there. This is what I modeled my Butter Beer after. You get a sweet cream soda, not fizzy, followed by a butterscotch, vanilla flavored whipped cream that lingers on the tongue after.\r\n\r\nCAP - Vanilla Whipped Cream: Gives the heavy cream feel from the whipped cream layer on top. \r\n\r\nRF - Cream Soda SC: I chose this because it most closely resembled a cream soda to me. Other flavors I tried were just too weak, or didn't taste right to me. I was looking for a rich sweet and creamy soda and to me this hit it\r\n\r\nFW - Butterscotch: I went back and forth with this and FW - Butterscotch Ripple. They are both very good. I went with butterscotch because it had a more butterscotchy taste, not a lot of cream to take away from it. I needed a pronounced butterscotch here. Ripple is too creamy and lacks the butterscotch feel I was looking for. \r\n\r\nFW - Butter Rum: I went with this to add a little more depth with the butterscotch. Again, Ripple was a contender here, but I feel it just was too creamy and the Butter Rum, SLIGHT rum I get plays well and fades into the cream soda, leaving you with a more complex butterscotch. Butter rum has a tad more brown sugar taste to me vs Ripple as well, so I went with this one.\r\n\r\nI never worked with FW - Butterscotch (Natural). Its a rich, creamy butterscotch but again, I didn't worry about it because I didn't want this recipe to become too creamy and take away from the butterscotch, or overpower the whipped cream profile either.\r\n\r\nI believe this is a VERY close to the drink I had in Orlando, which is what I wanted to model it after. I was lucky enough to have the reference to model it after. The Super Sweet is something you can change of course on your own, but this is meant to be a sweet treat, drop it if you like to get the flavor which is a somewhat subtly sweet mix as it is. \r\n\r\nCan also add Koolada or ws-23 at a super low % to get a cooling effect of it being an iced drink. I didn't use it, but it is something you can do as well. \r\n\r\nThis is a pretty good shake and vape, but the steep gives it a MUCH better flavor. \"","steep_days":"5 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:51:10.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"1080","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Vanilla Whipped Cream","flavor_id":"1","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Cream Soda â€“ SC","flavor_id":"7488","vendor":"RF","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Butterscotch","flavor_id":"1216","vendor":"FW","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Butter Rum","flavor_id":"1213","vendor":"FW","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Super Sweet","flavor_id":"2384","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":500},{"name":"Butterscotch Ripple","flavor_id":"1217","vendor":"FW","millipercent":3000}],"reviews":[{"user":"SeLeV","text":"I'm only on the 3rd steep day (I'm impatient) and I'm already heavily enjoying this as my first butterscotch recipe.
