You get a different taste as you vape an a nice sweet mixed fruit exhale thats sweet an kinda refreshing !\r\nHad alot of problems with that sour after twang I tried all the usual suspects TPA sour 20% , FA Sour wizard , Malic acid an citric acid as well as trying various citrus concentrates an few lemonades in lower %s\r\n\r\nFew notes\r\n\r\nCAP ITALIAN LEMON SICILY / FA LIME TAHITY - These 2 i wanted for there citrus sour taste that are a main note in the sweets ! Kept them high to be an over riding taste in the vape ! The lemon is a bangin candy lemon perfect for this an FA lime is a great fit to the real taste of sour skittles 4 % an 1.75 worked out about right ! so there my green an yellow skittles !\r\n\r\nTPA GRAPE CANDY / INW BLACKCURRANT - Purple i wanted to combine these 2 as i wanted that back end to taste of the INW concentrate as i get that from the originals ! Grape candy is a sweet easier flavour that fits on most berry fruits an just adds another dimension to it ! The INW is a strong one so didnt need to overdo the % on that compared to the Grape\r\n\r\nFW BLOOD ORANGE - Tried adding other oranges in but FW is such a good bitter orange thats pretty sweet an zingy so felt that it could hold its own on team orange ! It gives that bitter grapefruit just in the middle of the vape an as its not hugely strong lays nice with the other citrus notes\r\n\r\nCAP &JF SWEET STRAWBERRY - Love these 2 together the candy / sweety JF is bangin an cap just plays well with them adding  a nice sweetness needed for the actual sweets but also pulls the other fruits in together an a slightly higher %\r\n\r\nFA SOUR / MALIC ACID - Tried alot of combos but to get tongue curling sour you have to add so much of them it just mutes the shit out of all these delicate fruits ! Settled on 1 % FA which i find much better than TPA an .5 of malic acid (do not overdo this one as it mutes the shit out of it an ruins the recipe i found )\r\n\r\nTPA MARSHMALLOW / ETHYL MALTOL  - just adds that overall sweetness an the center part of the skittle which is kinda sweet but tasteless an the EM rounds it all together plus pulling a bit of extra sweetness From the fruits\r\n\r\nJob done an hopefully some of you\r\nTASTE THE RAINBOW ;-)","steep_days":"1","temperature":"0","recipe_score":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-11T20:40:23.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"6340","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Blackcurrant","flavor_id":"645","vendor":"INW","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Blood Orange","flavor_id":"1197","vendor":"FW","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Ethyl Maltol","flavor_id":"1710","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Sour Wizard","flavor_id":"4354","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Grape Juice","flavor_id":"231","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Italian Lemon Sicily","flavor_id":"78","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Lime Tahity Distilled","flavor_id":"415","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1750},{"name":"Malic Acid Solutions (10% PG)","flavor_id":"5554","vendor":"NN","millipercent":500},{"name":"Marshmallow","flavor_id":"332","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Sweet Strawberry","flavor_id":"121","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Sweet Strawberry","flavor_id":"3073","vendor":"JF","millipercent":3000}],"reviews":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"20287","name":"SOUR SKITTLES -TASTE THE RAINBOW "}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
