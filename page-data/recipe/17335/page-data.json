Nice Job with this ! ","score":5},{"user":"bjorama","text":"I gave this a 5 week steep before I tried it.  I made a 30ml and its about half way gone in a day.  Very solid recipe and when it comes to Vanilla Custards I'm pretty snobby about whats \"good\" and whats \"great\".  This one is much closer to great 4.8 stars rounded up.  Simply Delicious.  Thanks for posting!!","score":5},{"user":"KylezKloudz","text":"This stuff is a LONG steeper!!! That being said, I guess that goes for most really good custard vapes... My batch of 60mls took a good month+ to come into it's own.. Went thru almost half of it on testing to see if it was ready, and I almost threw it out and have up on it a good 3+ times as well.. But I can say that the last 30mls have been great! üòÅüëçüëç Nice thick smooth vanilla custard! Way to go!","score":5}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"17335","name":"Jet's Custardo"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
