Liquid Barn Vanilla Ice Cream seriously blows TFA VBIC out of the water. \r\n\r\n\r\nThe Ice Cream\r\n\r\nV1 & V2 - This was my first go around with LB  VIC and I'm very impressed. For my ice creams I normally go with TFA Vanilla Swirl and TFA VBIC, a combo Foment_Life introduced me too. I love the way Vanilla Swirl brings a bit of the soft serve sweet vanilla ice cream to the table so I kept with that even though going with LB VIC this time. The two of them work really well together. \r\n\r\n\r\nThe Apples\r\n\r\nV1- My original Apple blend for this recipe was Cap Green Apple at 1.5% and FA Fuji at 2.5%. My original intention for the apple part was to get the the sour/tang of the green apple while still have the Fuji be the main apple flavor. Testing out the first run over a few days, the Cap Green Apple seemed to clash with the rest of the recipe so I decided to pull it out. \r\n\r\nV2- I decided to pull the Cap Green Apple all together and bump FA Fuji to 3.5%. Though not what I exactly wanted at first, I actually liked this version far far more.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Cinnamon Danish\r\n\r\nV1 - Cap Cinnamon Danish Swirl is the star of this aspect of the mix. While it does a bang up job of having the perfect danish/bakery note plus cinnamon, used to high it and overpowers the other parts of the mix. Keeping it somewhat low gave me the pastry aspect with a touch of cinnamon however, not enough to come through the Ice Cream and Apple.\r\n\r\nV2- With the CDS in V1 not exactly being as pronounced as I was hoping for, I upped it .25% and paired it with just a touch of FLV Rich Cinnamon (I mean literally....A TOUCH) to help boost the cinnamon up. And it did it perfectly. \r\n\r\n\r\nOverall thoughts on each version.\r\n\r\nV1- Ice Cream end was perfect, rich and creamy, with a hint of soft serve vanilla tossed in there. Apples, not right, Cap Green Apple didn't blend too well, has to go. While the CDS was okay, it still needs a bit of help to get to where it should be. \r\n\r\nV2- Hell yeah. Without a doubt blows V1 out of the water. No contest. The Apple and Cinnamon play so well off of eachother. I was 100% content with the recipe. \r\n\r\n\r\nV3- Now...here is where it gets good. I decided to bounce the recipe off of AlfredPudding for some feedback. While he liked it, he came back with some thoughts. He recommended bumping up FLV RIch Cinnamon from .05% to .10%, dropping FA Fuji just a hair and adding some Pear in there to boost the Apple a touch more. JACKPOT. After making those adjustments I could not be happier with the outcome. \r\n\r\n\r\n","steep_days":"1","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:50:39.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"3544","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Vanilla Ice Cream","vendor":"LB","millipercent":5000},{"name":"Cinnamon Danish Swirl","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Vanilla Swirl","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Rich Cinnamon","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":100},{"name":"Apple Fuji","vendor":"FA","millipercent":3250},{"name":"Pear","vendor":"FA","millipercent":500}],"reviews":[{"user":"lionhrt9","text":"Fantastic juice.  I have now made 240mls for wife and mixing more.  This juice I like to say is clean.  Meaning it's a clean full flavored juice that is by far her ADV and keeps from from re-wicking her set up every 3 days so THANK YOU!!!.  I love it as well but have flavor ADD.  The balance of the cream, fruit, vanilla and cinnamon are like nothing I have mixed thus far.  Have learned a lot about how these flavors play together from this recipe.  Thanks for sharing, should have dropped this review here awhile ago!!!"},{"user":"Kittybit","text":"This... this is some good shit."},{"user":"bjorama","text":"Made this a month or so ago and realized I never tasted it.  Didn't have the flavorah cinnamon but mixed everything else and this is excellent.  Nice balance. This is one of 2 recipes that have made me think different about cinnamon in a vape.  Easy 5 star banger.  You'll mix this more than once guaranteed. "},{"user":"TheJuiceJackBuilt","text":"Ive been chasing a decent fuji cinnamon danish profile for a few years now and this recipe is perfect! Even as a s&amp;v its bloody tasty, no harshness from the cinnamon at all. I can only imagine it will improve with time, but had to come give it praise right away. Superbly balanced, very pleasurable vape. Thx pizza. "},{"user":"Up2MyHead","text":"Do you hear that? In the distance? It's the ice cream man!&#xD;\nAbsolute banger of a recipe. Smooth cinnamon, rich buttery ice cream and a mellow, full apple. It truly ticks all the boxes. Even mtl this liquid is perfectly balanced and complex enough to keep staying interesting. &#xD;\n&#xD;\nFull disclosure, I didn't use rich cinnamon, though I can only imagine it improves with it.&#xD;\n&#xD;\nSpeaking of improve, I vastly preferred this after a week steep. &#xD;\n&#xD;\nSeriously, go mix this. And order three times as much lb vic as you think you need. Trust me. "},{"user":"AlfredPudding","text":"I'll say this ad infinitum, if it has FLV Rich Cinnamon I'm into it. It's apple-cinnamon danish ice cream, stop reading this review and mix it up. "},{"user":"Ebc88","text":"The LB and Vanilla Swirl make a tasty cream base. The CDS, pear and fuji are a tried and true apple cinnamon combo. The rich cinnamon helps boost the cinnamon in CDS excellent job and thanks for sharing.
