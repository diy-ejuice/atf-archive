It is now at a point that I am finished messing with it and call it done from my perspective. The FA Apricot made the Peach flavor more natural, and the adjusted strawberries elevated the Peach so that it slightly dominates over the Strawberry. When I vape it the initial exhale is a nice Custard followed by the Peach with the fruit combo settling on the palette which somedays tastes more Strawberry and others more Peach (which is how I remember vaping Peachtree Street). I also reduced the New York Cheesecake and upped the Vanilla Custard which got rid of that dryness I was getting in the vape in the prior recipe. For those that liked the prior recipe here it is:\r\n\r\nCAP Dragon Fruit     0.75%\r\nCAP New York Cheesecake    3%\r\nLA Peach (colorless)    3%\r\nFA Red Touch (Strawberry)    3.5%\r\nTPA Strawberry (ripe)    3.5%\r\nCAP Sweet Strawberry    1.5%\r\nCAP Vanilla Custard v1    2%\r\n\r\n[ Original Post ]\r\nI've been working this recipe off-and-on for almost 2 years. I feel this has gotten to the point to get it out there, but I reserve the right to tweak it. This recipe was patterned off of the Peachtree Street eLiquid from HiggyCigs. I will never get that recipe down, but this is pretty nice.  The balance between the fruit and the custard still needs a little work, and Iâ€™m concerned the flavors are a little too high across the board.\r\n\r\nThe concept is to have a rich creamy Custard base with a natural Peach and tart Strawberry topping. I played around with many Custards and creams and it never worked well, but when Wayne published King's Custard using Capella New York Cheesecake I decided to try it and it works very well indeed. I know LA Peach is more of an artificial Peach flavor, but it vapes with no bite to it. When the Peach is mixed with the Strawberry and Dragonfruit it ends up quite natural to me. The Strawberry mix was my attempt to make a fresh ripe tart Strawberry. The Dragonfruit was added to bolster the Strawberry flavor during the steep, and to blend it with the Peach. The concept is the Peach and Strawberry compete for flavor so that some days you taste the Peach and others the Strawberry. \r\n\r\nIn this recipe I find that the creamy Custard and Peach are present on the exhale, with the Strawberry lingering on the palate after the vape. Judging my recipe I find it to be a tad dry with an every so slight harshness. The Peach component still needs a little work, and I will be playing around with maybe FA Apricot and FA White Peach - although I have tried White Peach with mixed results in the past. I have concerns that the Strawberry might be a bit much as I am somewhat 'tone' deaf to the flavor at times.","steep_days":"14","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"total_reviews":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-06T20:43:45.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"1240","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Peach","vendor":"LA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Strawberry (ripe)","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Red Touch (strawberry)","vendor":"FA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Sweet Strawberry","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Dragon Fruit","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":750},{"name":"Vanilla Custard","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":3000},{"name":"New York Cheesecake","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Armenia (apricot)","vendor":"FA","millipercent":500}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"90010","name":"Peaberry Custard"}}}
