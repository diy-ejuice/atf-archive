The Bavarian Cream and the Biscuit Bring the thickeness and mouthfeel to the Shake. I just prefer this strawberry combination when mixing a Strawberry mix. The cream Fresh brings a nice dairy not to it. I Prefer FW vanilla Bean ice cream over Caps or TFA. Caps is too light for me and TFA a lot of people get a pepper taste. So I chose FW although all three are good. Good on Shake. Grate after 5 day steep.","steep_days":"5","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T17:33:57.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"2356","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Cream Fresh","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Shisha Vanilla","vendor":"INW","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Vanilla Bean Ice Cream","vendor":"FW","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Super Sweet","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":300},{"name":"Bavarian Cream","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Sweet Strawberry","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Strawberry (ripe)","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Biscuit","vendor":"INW","millipercent":500}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"37532","name":"Strawberry Milkshake"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
