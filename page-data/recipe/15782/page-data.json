Tastes fantastic S&V. \r\n\r\nMeringue is fairly optional, meant to be the frosting on the fruit loops adding some sweetness, along with the Vanilla Swirl.\r\n\r\nBavarian Cream with Vanilla Swirl creates a nice milk/cream for the fruit loops to sit in.\r\n\r\nOptional: Add .5-1% of FA Fresh Cream for a nice airy mouthfeel.
