The CAP SC gives a sweet and also slightly grainy feel to the cookie in this mix, while the INW helps with a little more depth and a darker cookie backnote. \r\n\r\nThe ice cream here is a mix of CAP VBIC and TFA Bavarian Cream, which are used in conjunction with the vanilla's below to really give a good punchy vanilla icecream. The addition of CAP SL Whipped Marshmallow helps to add a little sweetness, and lift the creams up a bit to prevent them being too \"heavy\" \r\n\r\nCAP French Vanilla and INW Shisha Vanilla give a strong and distinct layer to this profile, which is what I was going for. The CAP FV is a superstar in my opinion when it comes to vanilla flavours, but it is distinct from other widely used vanilla concentrates. The Shisha does need a little time to mellow out, even at only 0.75%, so a good 2 week steep to help the vanilla's blend with the creams will give a much more satisfying vape. \r\n\r\nAs always, I mix this at 70% VG. \r\n\r\nBone apple teeth.
