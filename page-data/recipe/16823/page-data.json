Dare I say it even surpasses the original. Zero scratchy throat sensation from it. It's yellow cake and it's perfect. Not too moist, not too dry. A fresh baked cake.\r\n\r\nTFA VBIC. Buttery, creamy, vanilla. It's a great ice cream flavor, the best some would say.\r\n\r\nFLV Milk & Honey is the secret Ingredient that bridges the two main components. It's very creamy with a dark sweetness similar to molasses. Not much honey though. I was vaping this as a single flavor when I came up with how to do this recipe. Easily one of Flavorah's best flavors.\r\n\r\nCAP Vanilla Cupcake v.2 helps bolster the cake ever so slightly, but he are mainly using it for it's strong buttercream flavor. It was a perfect fit for this recipe.\r\n\r\nFA Vienna Cream help to round out the ice cream flavor. Makes the texture much creamier and milky, like the ice cream is melting as you eat your cake.\r\n\r\nFA Meringue. As if the milk and honey wasn't enough sweetness, we really load it up here to make it an authentic tasting birthday cake. Gives us a nice powdered sugar cream to round it all off.\r\n\r\nHS ice cream at 0.25% is optional because I understand it's not a very common flavoring, and it's not necessary to achieve the complete profile of this recipe. It does add a nice touch of buttery creaminess, similar to slightly over-churned cream, which works really well in this recipe where you want both cream and butter.\r\n\r\nSteep time - 5 days, but as usual, this doesn't stop me from digging right in\r\n\r\nMade some minor tweaks that turned out real well.","steep_days":"5","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:48:51.000-05:00","best_vg":"80%","views":"14413","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Yellow Cake","flavor_id":"4560","vendor":"JF","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Vanilla Bean Ice Cream","flavor_id":"186","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Milk & Honey","flavor_id":"609","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":500},{"name":"Vanilla Cupcake V2","flavor_id":"130","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Meringue","flavor_id":"530","vendor":"FA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Vienna Cream","flavor_id":"516","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000}],"reviews":[{"user":"bhamcatmaybe","text":"it's real hard to put this shit down. yes- ice cream cake it is, but somehow it's better, classier. it's like a petit four with gelato. i used cap's yellow cake, dropped the percentage to 2.2%, but i will be getting JF's. their sweet strawberry and bavarian cream are whats up, so i trust them. also, per your note on HS's ice cream butteriness, i opted instead to add inw's biscuit at 0.4% and it worked. delicious. THIS is the only cake and ice cream recipe."},{"user":"hashslingingslashur","text":"This is fantastic. I mix it with TPA vanilla cupcake at 1.25%. &#xD;\n&#xD;\nSide note: I had made this with FA Caramel instead of Milk and Honey. It was very good, but the milk and honey version is somehow even better. &#xD;\n&#xD;\nGreat recipe and thanks for sharing!"},{"user":"SixStrings952","text":"Mmmm, already(fresh), this is buttery, fluffy cake with perfect vanilla ice cream. So, even BEFORE it steeps--its at 5 stars for me! I've been looking for a great birthday cake eliquid for 4 years and I finally found it! And as a bonus, it's an ICE CREAM cake! Bravo!!"},{"user":"Thadentman","text":"As a shake and vape the milk and honey is a bit strong, but after 2-3 days it works it's way into the cream very nicely it almost tastes like a birthday cake with vanilla frosting with a very light butterscotch whipped cream. Great recipe with a nice little twist compared to others. Great job Vurve!"},{"user":"Drumbtr","text":""}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"16823","name":"Birthday Ice Cream Cake"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
