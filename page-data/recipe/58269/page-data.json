A refreshing spicy cola vape to enjoy as the summer draws to an end. \r\n\r\n\r\nThis recipe tastes like a liter a' cola you got at the drive through that's been sitting for about 20 mins; right as it's super refreshing, slightly effeversecnt still, and diluted with much needed water (ice). The FA cola obviously carries most of the flavor, gaining a nice cherry body from the marzipan and using the ice to bring the flavor into a refreshing territory. One drop of Rich Cinnamon/30mL gives just an extra touch of spice and effervesence to promote the flavor of the only cola for true refreshment, Wolf Cola: Splash in to the beast.\r\n\r\nDelosi Ice -- Original cannot be sub'd in my opinion, as it appears to be unique among other coolants with it's mild coolness, lack of flavor, and dilutant qualities.\r\n\r\n[Inspiration from Always Sunny in Philadelphia](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XqtunMGmPo)","steep_days":"1 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:49:31.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"3207","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Ice -- Original","flavor_id":"8535","vendor":"DF","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Usa Pleasure (cola)","flavor_id":"552","vendor":"FA","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Marzipan","flavor_id":"1708","vendor":"INW","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Rich Cinnamon","flavor_id":"638","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":125}],"reviews":[{"user":"Kittybit","text":"I fail to see, how I can be the first to review this. Because oh dear lord, this is fantastic! Even though it's a very simpel recipe only using one cola to run the show, it does it gracefully. FA Cola brings both the nice - almost too sweet, and a good amount of fizz. The little touch of cinnamon was a clever move here as it adds some great dimension to the mix. But the INW Marzipan is the winner in this mix. What it does to the remaining ingredients is just fantastic! The cooling I sadly had to sub, as it's very difficult to find DS around here, let alone DS Ice, but a little WS-23 did the trick."}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"58269","name":"Wolf Cola"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
