Together they taste very purple.\r\n\r\nRed - Candy strawberry here that's why I left off the Shisha, don't need that realistic part in this candy recipe.\r\n\r\nGreen - Shisha lime combined with Cap SS is pretty aromatic and candied lime\r\n\r\nOrange - Shisha Orange, see green\r\n\r\nYellow - Went with the pure lemon here mixed with the candy portions its pretty solid in here\r\n\r\nCandy - WF Pixie Stick Candy + Cap Rainbow candy give you a nice sweet candy taste.  It really helps turn these fruits into candy\r\n\r\nSoftening - the TFA Marshmallow helps to soften some of the sharp edges of the fruit.  If you like it let me know.","steep_days":"0 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T22:33:43.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"1892","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Blackcurrant","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Sour Ball Candy SC","vendor":"WF","millipercent":250},{"name":"Rainbow Candy","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":4500},{"name":"Lemon","vendor":"FE","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Grape","vendor":"INW","millipercent":500},{"name":"Shisha Orange","vendor":"INW","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Shisha Lime","vendor":"INW","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Pixie Stick Candy SC","vendor":"WF","millipercent":3250},{"name":"Strawberry Sweet","vendor":"JF","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Red Touch (strawberry)","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1750},{"name":"Super Sweet","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":500},{"name":"Marshmallow","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":500}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"162389","name":"Skittles(Classic Candy)"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
