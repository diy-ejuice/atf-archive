His juice line \"Bogan Brews\" is world famous for addicting flavor. His most intriguing to date is his \"Six and Out\" recipe which is a term used in backyard cricket commonly played at family gatherings here in the summer. His recipe is a balanced yet complex delight of blackcurrant and lychee.  Cloning this was difficult to nail down the back notes and I am still somewhat battling that as this is quite an amazingly balanced juice. This is close but not quite as mellow IMO. Hat's off to the original because I could only get around 80-85% there but none the less a yummy complex juice well worth a 30ml trial before you go and buy the real thing and appreciate it! #BogansMixBest ","steep_days":"0 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:49:25.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"3952","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Peach White","flavor_id":"543","vendor":"FA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Armenia (apricot)","flavor_id":"507","vendor":"FA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Blackcurrant","flavor_id":"545","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Pear","flavor_id":"411","vendor":"FA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Cactus","flavor_id":"647","vendor":"INW","millipercent":250},{"name":"Lychee","flavor_id":"582","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1250}],"reviews":[{"user":"DodgerFog33","text":"Very tasty, so good right off the bat.
