But I had the 3 flavors sitting around, so I though \"Why Not?\" Off the shake I was not too crazy about it, but I figured Wayne knows what he is talking about, put this away with the intention of pulling it out 5 days later, forgot about it till the eleventh day (I date my bottles) and at that point I fell in love with it. It's not Blue Yogi, but using that TFA VC gives it that \"spiced custard\" feel that I like over CAP VC v1/v2 and it works really well with the blueberry after the steep. Consider my skepticism erased and color me impressed.  This recipe deserves a name Wayne. Keep doing what you do and thank you."},{"user":"Jbirdy34","score":"5","text":"Took a copy of your recipe trying to add something to it. By the way its a awesome simple recipe. Thanks for the share even though i know its older."},{"user":"StormyParadise","score":"5","text":"Does not shake n' vape very well, but after a few days it comes to life, tastes awesome, thanks a lot Wayne for this delicious recipe!"}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"51876","name":"TFA Vanilla Custard [Flavor Book Entry Recipe]"}}}
