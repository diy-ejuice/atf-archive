After testing the round with friends. This one was the most requested for more.\r\n· LB White Chocolate Peppermint- This is one flavor I fell in love with after purchasing it for holiday recipes. It is very smooth with a great peppermint flavor. It finishes with a lite creamy white chocolate flavor.\r\n· PUR Condensed Milk- Lite on sweetness and weight. Lite smooth milk flavor with no off notes. It mixes well with other milk/cream/chocolate/cheesecake flavors for more depth. You can sub other condensed milks.\r\n· PUR NY Cheesecake- Very silky smooth cheesecake with a nice graham note. I added it to give the mix more weight and a creamier taste with a bit of graham texture/flavor. You can sub CAP NY Cheesecake at 2% but it won't be quite as smooth.\r\n· WS-23 30%- another one I love. Blows Koolada out of the water. Cold/frozen effect without changing the accompanying flavors.\r\n· PUR Super Sweet- Great sweetener and is right there with CAP Super Sweet. It is a tad less sweet than CAP, but does better in cream or bakery recipes IMO. You can sub CAP Super Sweet at the same percentage or TFA Sweetener at 1%\r\nIt is great off the shake, but gets creamier after a week.","steep_days":"7 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-06T22:02:30.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"1437","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"White Chocolate Peppermint","flavor_id":"6795","vendor":"LB","millipercent":10000},{"name":"Condensed Milk","flavor_id":"7751","vendor":"PUR","millipercent":2000},{"name":"New York Cheesecake","flavor_id":"7772","vendor":"PUR","millipercent":3000},{"name":"WS-23","flavor_id":"8085","vendor":"OTHR","millipercent":500},{"name":"Super Sweet","flavor_id":"7787","vendor":"PUR","millipercent":500}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"87769","name":"Peppermint Rush"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
