Vietnamese Coffee  is just slightly lighter then French roast ,  smooth and not acidic.    \r\nOn inhale you get a   light vanilla  note that transitions to the  coffee/ cinnamon and ends with  touch of cardamon.    it needs a week for the creams to really fill out  and become a nice rich and creamy ice cream \r\nTested on a Reload RDA tested at 68 watts   on a  .16 alien coil  \r\nMade on Freshes show   on coffees   https://youtu.be/ZqN1wzWIFbw\r\n\r\nThis ice cream is  a custard styled ice cream - so @Freshepies   quick custard  base  ( LB ice cream and FLV pudding)   works ideally here. \r\nThe only condensed milk I have  had any luck with is PUR - it just really works  and worth picking up  and helps fill in the middle  of this mix \r\nFor the Coffee I wanted a darker roast that would hold up to all the creams  and  WF brazillian  can do that   -   the Coffee liquor  leans more to  a coffee sryup and  blends into the ice cream  base.  (Off the shake the coffee will be light but WF brazillian coffee  tends to grow   -  so wait a week before you decided to tweak this mix to you preference)    \r\nCardamon is used more in the middle east  with coffee but  a couple of recipes for Vietnamese coffee ice cream  I saw on line  included it,  so decided to add it and I really like some of the contrast it providers to the darker coffee notes \r\n\r\nOPTION: ADD WS 23  and sweetner to your taste - I wanted a touch more sweetener,  as  this   leaned a bit on the savory side without it to me .  I like a a little bit of cinnamon in my coffee - but not every one does  so add  the cinnamon brown sugar if it is your thing \r\n","steep_days":"7","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T21:33:08.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"1192","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Cardamom","vendor":"FA","millipercent":300},{"name":"Cinnamon Sugar","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1250},{"name":"Coffee Liqueur","vendor":"VT","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Condensed Milk","vendor":"PUR","millipercent":1750},{"name":"Vanilla Ice Cream","vendor":"LB","millipercent":5000},{"name":"Vanilla Pudding","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":750},{"name":"Sweetness","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":300},{"name":"WS-23","vendor":"OTHR","millipercent":500},{"name":"Brazilian Coffee SC","vendor":"WF","millipercent":500}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"163439","name":"Vietnamese Coffee  Ice Cream  "}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
