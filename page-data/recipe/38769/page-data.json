I used to just use high percentages of vbic and it was always harsh on inhale and never really had the taste that i want in an ice cream the marshmallow helps thicken it up and helps mellow everything out\r\n\r\nFruit mix\r\nI have always had a problem with tpa boysenberry (bought it by mistake thinking it was the same as flv boysenberry, wrong!!) it has always overpowered everything so i decided to reduce everything down and its amazing especially when it plays off the earthy tones of the shisha strawberry really helps it along\r\n\r\nI have tried this as a shake and vape and its so good but i think its really going to come to life after a good steep for a week or so","steep_days":"7","temperature":"0","recipe_score":4,"total_reviews":1,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:49:13.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"1716","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Vanilla Bean Ice Cream","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Marshmallow","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Meringue","vendor":"FA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Boysenberry","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":250},{"name":"Vanilla Custard","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":500},{"name":"Shisha Strawberry","vendor":"INW","millipercent":1200}],"reviews":[{"user":"ID10-T","score":"4","text":"This is aptly named, the way the boysenberry interacts with the strawberry really is interesting and without having mixed it up myself I wouldn’t have known what was going on there. It’s still a strawberry, but it’s a mysteriously interesting strawberry, not quite a wild strawberry but a strawberry with a wild side. A lady in the streets freak in the sheets kind of strawberry. I’m not a huge fan of this ice cream base, though, as it comes across a little cheesy/overchurned. On the upside though, I got a couple of comments about how nice of a room note this one has.
