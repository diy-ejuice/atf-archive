The Kentucky Bourbon and Black Fire share the spotlight here in perfect harmony. DNB and Dark for Pipe in there to create a nice strong base to showcase the Black Fire and Kentucky Bourbon dream team.

FA Black Fire can be a little unwieldy because it's hickory-ish smoke notes are just so damn strong but it pairs so excellently with the Dark for Pipe and Kentucky Bourbon here. As with everything else I've tried from you so far CBV, it's smooth as hell for a dark, rich, ashy tobacco. Unlike anything I've had, and I can't put it down!"},{"user":"CatWillMew","text":"This is really nice.  Strong tobacco with a nice bourbon kick, very balanced.  I think this could be great for taking to bars when a bunch of people are smoking around you.  I tried doing something similar to this but it ended up tasting like licking an ashtray."}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"54211","name":"Maybe I'll Catch Fire"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
