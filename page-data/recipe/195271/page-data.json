I have been trying different iterations of this profile and finally have one that I am really enjoying. It's not finished but as is it's refreshing, candied, and lightly sweet (add some additional sweetener for a sweeter vape) . This is a shake and vape but a day or two rounds it out as well as allowing the chewy candy center to break through. If your a traditionalist and want some grape to complete the rainbow then you can add grape flv at 1.50%.\r\nI tweaked the recipe minimally on 5/25..It now has just a bit more punch to it.","steep_days":"0 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T07:01:43.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"615","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Blackcherry Jelly Bean SC","flavor_id":"8359","vendor":"WF","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Lemonade","flavor_id":"951","vendor":"LA","millipercent":2150},{"name":"Chews Candy SC","flavor_id":"10111","vendor":"WF","millipercent":1100},{"name":"Lime","flavor_id":"634","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":250},{"name":"Marshmallow (Gooey) SC","flavor_id":"10265","vendor":"WF","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Razzleberry","flavor_id":"1393","vendor":"FW","millipercent":3750},{"name":"Strawberry Gummy Candy SC","flavor_id":"10097","vendor":"WF","millipercent":1600},{"name":"Strawberry Taffy","flavor_id":"4164","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":2400},{"name":"Tangerine","flavor_id":"4421","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":250},{"name":"Sweetness","flavor_id":"4413","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":200}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"195271","name":"Rainbow Noir"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
