Complex tobacco flavor with just 3 ingredients. \r\n\r\nNice rich tobacco comes from the burley. Add some dark notes and caramel with ry4 double, and finish it off with some dark honey notes. Add more burley if you wanna taste that ash, but I wouldnâ€™t recommend over 4%. Let it steep. \r\n\r\nEnjoy. Born.

TPA Black Honey has never been an enjoyable flavor for me but I'm willing and open for a recipe to change my mind about that.  It works for me here.  The Burley dominates this mix and only at the very end does the Black Honey show up. I'm glad I found a use for it!    Nice job.","score":4},{"user":"Deetzz","text":"This Tobacco man!! So much Flavor from such a simple combination. When It comes to my baccos I prefer them in MTL but this one is awesome in my Intake RTA!! Really well done on this one, its in my permanent mixes now!
