Well they have seasonal flavors too, and one of their summer flavors is Blueberry sweet rolls.\r\nThe are more or less a cinnamon roll, but instead of cinnamon they have some sort of blueberry filling in them. It's not just blueberries baked in and it's not a blueberry jam, it's weird actually, but in a good way.\r\n\r\nFLV Blueberry muffin is really the main base of the flavor, it has some bakery notes to it and a great bakery blueberry, but alone it's nothing like the sweet roll\r\n\r\nFLV Sweet dough is the real base to the dough, chewy, very slightly yeast risen dough with brown sugar/caramel notes to sweeten it and give it a hint of being baked. 1.25% sounds like a lot especially if you've used any of FLV other dough flavors, but this one is much lighter and more forgiving than the others.\r\n\r\nFLV Blueberry is a weird fuckin' blueberry, but it's good. It's very 'purple' tasting, but it's a good way to bend other flavors. It really fills in some blueberry notes other blueberry flavor miss, so while it's poor solo it's great in a mix. In this case if you ever try the sweet rolls you instantly taste the 'purple' blueberry flavor in them, to the point with the first bite I had of one I thought of FLV blueberry instantly. With the two FLV blueberry flavors the blueberry is dead on to the sweet roll.\r\n. \r\nFLV Frosting is the icing the covers the sweet roll, it's a heavy vanilla glaze the covers them, and this fit right in on the profile. Not super intrusive in the mix, but adds sweetness and vanilla notes here and there\r\n\r\nFLV cupcake batter works to thicken the entire vape up, give it some grease and cheap doughy cake vibe vs some fancy, high end fresh baked roll. It also up's the sweetness of the entire thing without the need to add sweetener. \r\n\r\nIt's end being super addictive and for a FLV only recipe it came together incredibly well.
