He ran out of his Triple C stash. So he picked up a bottle of Milkman Hazel to get by. I didn't get to try it, but I smelled the bottle a bit.  I have no idea if this recipe tastes the same as Milkmans Hazel. Good news is it's very very tasty. Triple C was my ADV for 2 year or so. This is now my ADV. Goodbye  4 to 6 week steeps.\r\n\r\nFLA Cookie Dough and FW Hazelnut play very well together. The FW Butterscotch Ripple is my bridge to the creams. There might be better ice creams out there, but these are the best two I have. It tastes good the next day, but is much better with a 5 to 7 day steep. A long steep has not been tested.\r\n\r\nI will be getting LB and HS Ice Cream soon. If they work better in this recipe I will post a V2.

The cookie dough works great in this application and almost adds a thick maltyness along with the hazelnut. Top recipe mate 5 ‚≠êÔ∏è from me! üëçüèª *** just to note, I did add 0.5% CAP SUPER SWEET***"},{"user":"finsamson","text":"Thoroughly enjoying this after just a few days. Really pleasant hazelnuty butterscotchy creamy combination. Very rich but not too rich. I'm running it high mg in a Caliburn and it's doing the trick nicely. Thanks so much for this recipe!"},{"user":"Marnu","text":"This legitimately doesn't need a serious steep. Delicious after just 5 days. Finished my batch in an afternoon. Highly recommended.

Nice work! üëçüëç"},{"user":"cdaniell30","text":"This was a really nice mix for me.  Not too much butterscotch, and the hazelnut brings out a little chocolate vibe in the cookie dough"},{"user":"RdaJunkie","text":"I‚Äôve went through 120 mls of this and still keep wanting more. I did sub tfa vbic for LB vbic because I prefer it and also sub vanilla swirl for LB Vienna cream and this stuff has been a dream. Super smooth, rich and addicting.
