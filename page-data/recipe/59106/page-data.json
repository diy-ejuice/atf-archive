You can hate on me for the price of the concentrates or you can love me for a delicious recipe with very little steep time. The ingredients pretty much speak for themselves. It's a creamy coconut pudding pie with a cookie crust.  This creamy coconut pudding pie is topped with whipped cream. This recipe is perfect on a 3 day steep but I am sure it will get better and better the longer it steeps but it is a very tasty vape after 3 days.  I had Flavorah cheesecake in this recipe and I liked it but after a steep it left a curdled milk taste so I removed it all together and upped the cookie .25% because I had  used the cheesecake for the crust.

If there were a compelling reason why this had to be an all-FLV recipe, this would be a 5-star recipe. If there were a contest recipe and had to be all-FLV, I think it would win. But with so many other options for cookie crust, why? FLV Cookie as no crunch, and the slight maple note it has a short steep comes out even more after steeping this for six weeks and really distracts from that wonderful coconut cream pudding. I want to try this again using something like a combination of CAP Sugar Cookie and FA Cookie for the crust, or maybe scrapping the cookie idea completely and going for a nice graham crust.
