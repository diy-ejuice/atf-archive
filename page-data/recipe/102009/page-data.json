The flavors work really well together!! The top note being watermelon and all the wonderful flavors work really well to hit all the note in your mouth! Give it a try! You'll love it.  You can also add a drop of your favorite lime per 30cc to give it an extra boost.  No sweetener is necessary because it has a beautiful fruit flavor that is sweet enough.

The Watermelon is right up front and leaves you with that Strawberry/berry goodness. Very full flavored, juicy and well balanced mix. Perfect summer ADV. I added 1% ws-23 for cooling after tasting the original mix. Love it both ways. Thanks for the recipe!
