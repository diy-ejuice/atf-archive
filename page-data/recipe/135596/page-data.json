Purilum watermelons the most important ingredient, it's got a sweet candy vibe and does great work here. If you don't have JF - Sweet Strawberry you could sub it for the CAP version but they're pretty different, results not guaranteed. Tiger's Blood is all about the creamy coconut, so I layered them a bit. Give it two days for the fruits to relax and the coconut to come through.\r\n\r\nThe coolants are optional. At this level they don't really cool the vape just add a bit of mouthfeel. You could also use one or the other at .7% if you don't have both.","steep_days":"2","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T17:35:26.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"1914","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Watermelon","flavor_id":"7797","vendor":"PUR","millipercent":8000},{"name":"Strawberry Sweet","flavor_id":"4745","vendor":"JF","millipercent":6000},{"name":"Coco' (coconut)","flavor_id":"416","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1750},{"name":"Coconut Candy","flavor_id":"223","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1750},{"name":"WS-23","flavor_id":"8085","vendor":"OTHR","millipercent":350},{"name":"Polar Blast","flavor_id":"5910","vendor":"FA","millipercent":350},{"name":"Sweetener","flavor_id":"1432","vendor":"FW","millipercent":500}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"135596","name":"Tiger's Blood Pod/MTL"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
