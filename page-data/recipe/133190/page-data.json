On the inhale you get a full sweet cream  with a  slight tangy back note note  that transitions to  a dark coffee and chocolate finish  Works best in an RDA  at higher wattage 60 - 80,  but  also works in a tank .   This is a bit of a steeper  2 weeks min. \r\n\r\n**TPA Bavarian**  was used to help add a neutral  creamy dairy body to the  the mix with out overwhelming egg or custard notes .  Some of the darker sweet accents notes that come from Bavarian cream will also support the  coffee and chocolate notes  of a tiramisu \r\n**WF Marscapone**   is a full sweet slightly tangy cream, that is ideal for this application.  Dont let the  initial aroma  put you off  as it is indeed a strong cheese.   This does dissipate over time and  you are left with a lush  sweet full cream and slight tang back note.   \r\n**FA up and WF white cake**  provide the cake base for this.   White fluffy cake  with Up  create that   sweet sponge biscuits .  UP is really unique as it provides that dark black coffee note along with some cake/ biscuit texture and helps to bridge to the  VT coffee liquor \r\n\r\n**VT coffee liquor**  has a moderate  sweet  creamy coffee note and  has a slight syrup mouth feel.    The booze note is very light as compared to the the other liquor flavors  from VT   and is very similar to kahlua\r\n\r\n**JF cocca** is that dark chocolate powder note that  sits at the end of this mix  with a nice finish. it works well as it does not get  blended into the creams    \r\n\r\nNOTES: this is fairly sweet but  with the darker coffee notes you may want to add some sweeter .  I would recommend FLV sweetness at .3%     WF marcarpone is pretty unique and not easily subed  but   NY cheese cake by CAP or PUR  will add some of those cheese notes at around 3%  .  WF white fluffy cake  also is not an easy sub  but a Yellow cake could be used  adding a little more of a cake note to the mix then teh fluffy white cake ","steep_days":"14","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-11-30T14:35:06.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"1738","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Cocoa","vendor":"JF","millipercent":500},{"name":"Coffee Liqueur","vendor":"VT","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Bavarian Cream","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Mascarpone Cream Cheese","vendor":"WF","millipercent":1300},{"name":"Fluffy White Cake SC","vendor":"WF","millipercent":2500},{"name":"UP (coffee)","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1500}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"133190","name":"Classic Tiramisu "}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
