So I'm attempting a delicate cake with complex flavor profile of apple for both sweetness and juiciness then black current as a hint, honey (I'm conflicted as to whether this is a good place for this), elderflower, and lavender as the ingredients that make this a \"ladies' luncheon cake\" if you know what I mean??  The cookie is added because I am not so sure how good or not good white cake is.
