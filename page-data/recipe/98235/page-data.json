So I'm attempting a delicate cake with complex flavor profile of apple for both sweetness and juiciness then black current as a hint, honey (I'm conflicted as to whether this is a good place for this), elderflower, and lavender as the ingredients that make this a \"ladies' luncheon cake\" if you know what I mean??  The cookie is added because I am not so sure how good or not good white cake is.  This is the first run of this recipe!!","steep_days":"10","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"total_reviews":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T20:32:32.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"967","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Black Currant","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":750},{"name":"Cake (White)","vendor":"FW","millipercent":2700},{"name":"Fuji Apple","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Sugar Cookie","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1150},{"name":"Country Apple","vendor":"PUR","millipercent":1750},{"name":"Lavender","vendor":"FA","millipercent":750},{"name":"Elderflower","vendor":"INW","millipercent":1250},{"name":"Honey","vendor":"FW","millipercent":450}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"98235","name":"Ladies' Luncheon Cake"}}}
