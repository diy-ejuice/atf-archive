My idea wasn’t chosen, but I was intrigued.....so I mixed it.\r\n\r\nCaps Gingerbread was my first choice, but it needs help in the cake department so I went with JF Yellow Cake......mostly because it happened to be sitting on my desk. JF Bavarian for the creamy, dark sweetness and mouthfeel. FA Rose and Cardamom because it’s the only rose/cardamom I have.....used em low so they didn’t take over. FA Meringue mostly for the sweetness.\r\n\r\nOff the shake, everything was in your face. 10 days later, all has mellowed quite nicely. Cardamom gingerbread on the inhale, a nice light rose on the exhale. Yum.","steep_days":"10","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-06T14:08:26.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"765","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Yellow Cake","flavor_id":"4560","vendor":"JF","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Cardamom","flavor_id":"498","vendor":"FA","millipercent":250},{"name":"Gingerbread","flavor_id":"58","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Meringue","flavor_id":"530","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Rose","flavor_id":"511","vendor":"FA","millipercent":250},{"name":"Bavarian Cream","flavor_id":"4466","vendor":"JF","millipercent":2500}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"142924","name":"Cardi G"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
