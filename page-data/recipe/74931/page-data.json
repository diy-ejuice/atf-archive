I've been looking for an excuse to have a recipe loaded up with FW Yellow Cake, Cake Batter Dip and Sugar Cookie all together. It's a heavy vape no doubt, but absolutely delicious. Enjoy!

Coming from someone who has mixed every donut on ATF and even made up many of my own, this is a cinnamon donut, cookie, churro that is spot on to what I like in a vape. Cinnamon and sugar on the lips with a heavy fried donut on the exhale. The cookie adds a ton of mouth feel to this recipe. It takes that dryness you get on most donuts out of the picture and the yellow cake / cake batter and zeppola combination is a winner for the interior and shell of the donut. Warning - if you do not like cinnamon vapes... move on. It does have a perfect coating of cinnamon for me. I really like it. Thanks! This will be a staple in my recipe box for sure."},{"user":"DeadHer0ine","score":"4","text":"This one REALLY needs the steep time - I find it best after 2 weeks. It is heavy, but it's also quite good. The cinnamon sugar sticks to your lips! Definitely one that I'll make again, but not one that will justify repurchasing Yellow Cake after my stash is depleted."}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"74931","name":"Cinnamon Doughnut Cookie"}}}
