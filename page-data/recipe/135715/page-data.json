The percentage is high  in this mix  as OOO waffle and SA  banana  flambe need are not super concentrates and need to be high  to  come through  and contrast the sweet syrup notes \r\n\r\n**WAFFLE** is a slightly toasted sweet  dough waffle base no real dark notes, or syrup notes.   it needs some support so **SUGAR CONE** is added for some of the darker notes\r\n\r\n**BANANA FLAMBE and BANANA NUT BREAD** provides a nice sweet banana note which support that warmed sweet banana note this mix needs.\r\n\r\n**BUTTER PECAN** adds the dark rich nuttiness and butter that this mix needed\r\n\r\n**MAPLE, GOLDEN SYRUP** work to create a really nice maple syrup . Maple up around 2% can be gritty so the golden syrup helps in this situation\r\n\r\nSUBS: LB waffle is a great sub for the waffle base if added you can remove the sugar cone and brown sugar \r\n\r\nMixed for mixi in the kitchen Maple episode   #40  maple    https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCpzG9vsIgaCUzHVrUMHiV_g","steep_days":"7","temperature":"0","recipe_score":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-12T05:50:19.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"1344","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Banana Flambe","flavor_id":"9131","vendor":"SA","millipercent":5000},{"name":"Banana Nut Bread","flavor_id":"144","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":3500},{"name":"Waffle (Belgian)","flavor_id":"1916","vendor":"OOO","millipercent":6500},{"name":"Butter Pecan","flavor_id":"1212","vendor":"FW","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Golden Butter","flavor_id":"60","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Golden Syrup","flavor_id":"8887","vendor":"VT","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Maple Syrup","flavor_id":"509","vendor":"FA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Sugar Cone SC","flavor_id":"9050","vendor":"WF","millipercent":2400}],"reviews":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"135715","name":"Sunday Morning  ( Belgian Waffle, banana, butter pecans, maple syrup)"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
