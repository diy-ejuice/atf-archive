This is a  simple, **VERY TASTY**  and really well balanced mixed - it is for those that like a creamy full mix but do not want that over the top egginess of a custard.    This is  very vapeable off the shake but really comes together at 5 - 7 days  \r\nTested on a reload RDA at 65W on a .15 alien coil \r\n\r\n**flapper pie** is the base of this it is has a nice light caramel with a vanilla pudding/ custard/ meringue cream filling a light bakery note. \r\n\r\nQuick custard  by  @freshepies  **(LB vanilla ice cream and FLV vanilla pudding - if you do not have these flavors I highly recommend u get them as it is probably one of the most useful cream custard bases out there)** really fills out the cream part of this mix and is nice off the shake but hits its stride at 4 - 5 days. it creates a custard type of profile with out some of the heavy egg notes\r\n\r\n**marshmallow gooey** is pretty much \"fluff\" and I love it!! it adds some of those marshmallow vanilla top notes,  and helps transition to the custard \r\n\r\nThe **brown sugar cookie and cap sugar cookie** are noticed on the finish as the crust and support the bakery in flapper pie ","steep_days":"5 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-11T22:45:03.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"3127","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Brown Sugar Cookie SC","flavor_id":"10256","vendor":"WF","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Flapper Pie SC","flavor_id":"10106","vendor":"WF","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Marshmallow (Gooey) SC","flavor_id":"10265","vendor":"WF","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Sugar Cookie","flavor_id":"115","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Vanilla Ice Cream","flavor_id":"1511","vendor":"LB","millipercent":5000},{"name":"Vanilla Pudding","flavor_id":"4433","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1000}],"reviews":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"152994","name":"Mile High Custard Pie "}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
