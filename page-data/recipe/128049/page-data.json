It can be used at low percentages as an additive role or as the main role. At 4%, stays right at the front note without messing the overall balance of the profile. It's the only watermelon I enjoy because it's authentic, juicy and doesn't fade so much especially at this percentage. Next, FLV Wild Melon to give a little more body to the Watermelon itself.\r\n\r\n**TPA Dragonfruit / TPA Honeydew** - Both flavours make this profile even juicier and TPA Dragonfruit helps a lot here creating a bond between the watermelon and the berries.\r\n\r\n**FA Forest Mix / CAP Harvest Berry** - Both percentages for my taste are just enough to be present in this profile. If I go higher, I start to get plastic off-notes especially with CAP Harvest Berry. Combined, the blackcurrant and the raspberry are present while the blueberry and the strawberry note stays right at the back being slightly present aswell.\r\n\r\n**CAP Super Sweet** - Optional here but in this case, creates a more full mouthfeel.","steep_days":"3 (SNV)","temperature":"420","recipe_score":0,"total_reviews":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T02:16:41.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"1287","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Watermelon","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Wild Melon","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Dragonfruit","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":750},{"name":"Forrest Mix (forest Fruit Mix)","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Honeydew","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Harvest Berry","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Super Sweet","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":500},{"name":"WS-23","vendor":"OTHR","millipercent":500},{"name":"Cool Menthol","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":500}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"128049","name":"Waterberry"}}}
