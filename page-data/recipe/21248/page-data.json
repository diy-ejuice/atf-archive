Another lemon vape, sue me. Anyway, Glas pound cake was one of my adv's and I sought to not necessarily clone it, but attempt the profile and spin it a bit to my taste. As I've vaped quite a few bottles of this stuff so far I think it's safe to say I did a good job in pleasing myself (insert your favorite joke here). wouldnt really try this one as a shake n' vape as the yellow cake really doesn't come out to play until day three.  \r\n\r\nJF Juicy Lemon: I use this lemon for just about everything; one of my favorite flavors. It's very bright with just the right amount of tartness to really stand out in a mix. \r\nFA Meringue: Useful here in the aspect that it offers a very light baked note without making the mix too \"dark.\" It adds to the sweetness and helps out with the glaze. \r\nCap Golden Butter: Don't know about you, but I make my poundcake with as much butter as I can so this flavor only makes sense. Yellow cake by itself is not exactly poundcake consistency so the butter helps in changing that. \r\nFW Butter Cream: Used in a small percentage here for the lemon icing. It's sweet and one of the better icings available in my opinion for that sweetness. \r\nJF Yellow Cake: Beautiful yellow cake flavor. Every bit as good as FW, but minus the sucrose. Fits very well here and frees the other ingredients to add the sweetness. \r\nTfa Cheesecake (graham crust): Added here in a small percentage to help along with turning the yellow cake into something more dense and moist. I first was using Cap NY, but I think this one was the way to go as it's a bit more subdued in flavor and only used for texture. \r\n","steep_days":"5","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:48:55.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"3057","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Lemon Juicy","flavor_id":"4743","vendor":"JF","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Meringue","flavor_id":"530","vendor":"FA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Golden Butter","flavor_id":"60","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":750},{"name":"Butter Cream","flavor_id":"1211","vendor":"FW","millipercent":500},{"name":"Yellow Cake","flavor_id":"4560","vendor":"JF","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Cheesecake (graham Crust)","flavor_id":"152","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":500}],"reviews":[{"user":"Burritoclock","text":"Another one I've tried to nail and given up on. I've bought store \"premium\" juice and it was never quite good. This however is tasty and perfectly nails the profile. Amazing! And is one of those that gets comments from people walking by because it smells so good. Great recipe!"}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"21248","name":"Lemon by the Pound"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
