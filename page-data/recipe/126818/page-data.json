When I say I love coffee though, I should be honest and say I put mocha in my coffee at home with some creamer.   So, this recipe is very similar to my coffee at home.  \r\nThe recipe is pretty straight forward, I will just add the **VT Coffee Base** is excellent.  \r\n","steep_days":"3","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T20:32:48.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"1572","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Coffee Base","flavor_id":"8856","vendor":"VT","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Caramel Mocha","flavor_id":"8846","vendor":"VT","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Salted Caramel","flavor_id":"8959","vendor":"VT","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Sweet Mate","flavor_id":"8981","vendor":"VT","millipercent":250},{"name":"Vanilla Whipped Cream","flavor_id":"1","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":2000}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"126818","name":"Tam's Caramel Mocha Coffee"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
