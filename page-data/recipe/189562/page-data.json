You're late because you got caught up enjoying this sweet and delicious crepe filled with smooth buttercream with apple chunks and crushed almonds, topped with a gooey spiced amaretto sauce. Still have to get to that AA meeting though!\r\n\r\nUpdate:\r\nSo I've had this sitting around awhile and it seems to have gotten a bit harsh even though it was smooth to start with.  I am trying to work out of it's the apple, the cinnamons or just my change in hardware.\r\n\r\nUpdate 2: lowered the fuji, marzipan and crepe. Much smoother now.","steep_days":"4","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-06T20:52:29.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"383","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Fuji","flavor_id":"506","vendor":"FA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Shisha Apple","flavor_id":"814","vendor":"INW","millipercent":200},{"name":"Apple Filling","flavor_id":"4376","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":400},{"name":"Marzipan","flavor_id":"10477","vendor":"OOO","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Marshmallow Vanilla","flavor_id":"10092","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Crepe SC","flavor_id":"8365","vendor":"WF","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Cinnamon Danish Swirl","flavor_id":"35","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Almond","flavor_id":"6804","vendor":"NF","millipercent":1000}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"189562","name":"AA Crepe!"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
