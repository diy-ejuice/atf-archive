I have let this steep for over a month and the only thing that dies down a bit is the strawberry. I also mixed it at half strength and a quarter strength wile its not bad it just doesn't have the same intense mouth feel as when there this high. I can see various reasons why you won't mix this like you can't afford it lol , you looked at it and thought thats way to high this guy is off his head, i am pg sensitive, i can't fit my pg nic in there ect \r\nBut if you like sweet intense mouth feel vapes and the perfect strawberry doughnut (imo) give this a try its good off the snv and just as good a month later. Mix it don't mix it its up to you as always.","steep_days":"1 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-12T03:46:03.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"2126","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Cinnamon Donut","flavor_id":"8853","vendor":"VT","millipercent":10000},{"name":"Strawberry (ripe)","flavor_id":"271","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":10000},{"name":"Marshmallow (Vanilla)","flavor_id":"1798","vendor":"OOO","millipercent":10000}],"reviews":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"113675","name":"Marshmellow strawberry doughnut"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
