I have let this steep for over a month and the only thing that dies down a bit is the strawberry. I also mixed it at half strength and a quarter strength wile its not bad it just doesn't have the same intense mouth feel as when there this high. I can see various reasons why you won't mix this like you can't afford it lol , you looked at it and thought thats way to high this guy is off his head, i am pg sensitive, i can't fit my pg nic in there ect \r\nBut if you like sweet intense mouth feel vapes and the perfect strawberry doughnut (imo) give this a try its good off the snv and just as good a month later. Mix it don't mix it its up to you as always.","steep_days":"1 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-04T23:28:15.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"2115","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Cinnamon Donut","vendor":"VT","millipercent":10000},{"name":"Strawberry (ripe)","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":10000},{"name":"Marshmallow (Vanilla)","vendor":"OOO","millipercent":10000}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"113675","name":"Marshmellow strawberry doughnut"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
