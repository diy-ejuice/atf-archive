It's another one of my special mixes I came up with personally while playing around in my \"lab\" (basement).  As always mix until frothy then I heat up in a baby bottle warmer for 15 minutes then cool with the cap off.  Then I let it sit for at least 2-3 days.  Taste is all relative though...enjoy!","steep_days":"0","temperature":"0","recipe_score":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-10T13:44:18.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"1063","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Dragonfruit","flavor_id":"226","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":9100},{"name":"Raspberry","flavor_id":"268","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1200},{"name":"French Vanilla","flavor_id":"170","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":5000}],"reviews":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"11461","name":"Velvet Shadow"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
