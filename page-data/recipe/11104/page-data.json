It's even more delicious than I expected, which is saying something, because my expectations were already absurdly high. I remember reading the original post in the sbreddit and salivating eagerly, the way one does when reading a recipe in particularly well-worded cookbook. I even remember wishing that it had FLV Rich Cinnamon in place of the CAP Cinnamon Danish Swirl, but that desire disappeared in a cloud of vapor last night as soon as I tasted it. It's absolutely perfect, and I wouldn't change a thing. I even woke up craving it with a cup of coffee this morning! Thanks for this recipe! Really good stuff!"}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"11104","name":"CBBF / / / Cinnamon Banana Baby Food"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
