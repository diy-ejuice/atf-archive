Brought to your home in vape form. The combination of the FW Hazelnut along with INW and TFA Double Chocolate clear create a great chocolate flavor mimicking the outer layer of a Reese's, with the peanut butter as the filling. I replaced the INW milk chocolate with FLV Milk chocolate because INW changed the ingredients and I actually think the FLV works better. FA Cream Fresh and Cap Vanilla Bean Ice Cream is the ice cream base I like to use, and I added the FA caramel to give it a little bit of darkness and richness that you get with a McDonals Reese's McFlurry. And of course a little sweetener to sweeten everything up. Hope you all enjoy!","steep_days":"3","temperature":"450","recipe_score":5,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:49:07.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"4312","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Double Chocolate (clear)","flavor_id":"158","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Hazelnut","flavor_id":"1312","vendor":"FW","millipercent":500},{"name":"Peanut Butter","flavor_id":"291","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Cream Fresh","flavor_id":"540","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Vanilla Bean Ice Cream","flavor_id":"4","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":4500},{"name":"Super Sweet","flavor_id":"2384","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Carmel (caramel)","flavor_id":"503","vendor":"FA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Milk Chocolate","flavor_id":"4389","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":500}],"reviews":[{"user":"NJDAVE","text":"Great recipe!
