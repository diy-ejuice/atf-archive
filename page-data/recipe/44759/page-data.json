I wanted to make a refreshing summer drink with this as the base after I did a single flavor test with it.\r\nCAP Hibiscus - This flavor was from my first DIY order and I have been trying to find a way to use the rest of it and I knew hibiscus and tea work well together in beverages so here it is in my beverage vape. It's pretty sweet and not overly floral in this recipe. I would say it's optional but I mixed this up without it and it's just not the same.\r\nFA Forest Mix + TPA Blackberry - These two flavors together have been my go to for the lemonade recipes I have been playing around with. The lemonade really made these berries pop. The Lemon Tea is no different the lemon brings the berries forward. \r\n\r\nCAP Super Sweet - Optional. I live in NC and sweet tea here requires like 1:1 sugar to tea ratio so I added super sweet to make it more authentic. \r\n\r\nAdd Koolada or your favorite cooling agent if you want it cold. Hope you enjoy it!","steep_days":"1 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:49:18.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"2391","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Hibiscus","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Forrest Mix (forest Fruit Mix)","vendor":"FA","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Lemon Tea","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Super Sweet","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":500},{"name":"Blackberry","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":500}],"reviews":[{"user":"ID10-T","text":"This makes for a terrific vape. Lemon Tea, Hibiscus, and the two berries are balanced precisely.. I'm going to go ahead and give this five stars because the only two recommendations I have to improve the experience are very subjective and already addressed in the notes as options. 1) Less Super Sweet. I went ahead and used the 0.5% in the recipe. Don't do that. Eliminating it is an option but I think just cutting it in half will most likely be just right for this recipe and also get rid of that lingering fake sweetener aftertaste.  2) Definitely add your coolant of choice. It's a wonderful fit with this. I just added a few drops of WS-23 and it was so refreshing. "},{"user":"trandism","text":"I mixed that as part of my hibiscus research and was pleasantly surprised, so went on to do a 50ml. I already knew beforehand that TPA Blackberry + FA Forest Mix + FLV Lemon Tea would work and how it tastes so it was the perfect recipe to test CAP Hibiscus on a profile I already knew. I have to say it works like a charm. Great vape"}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"44759","name":"Berrybiscus Sweet Tea"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
