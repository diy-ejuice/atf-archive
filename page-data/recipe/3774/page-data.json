As S&amp;V not that much but after a week it starts getting better and after 2 weeks it's awesome!! After steeping the Milk&amp;Honey comes into play at it's full potential. Thanks man!"},{"user":"MrBurgundy","score":"5","text":"Wonderfully creamy and nutty tobacco. I can vape this all day. The cherry note of Marzipan gives the RY4 a deep sweetness that works so well with Milk and Honey. The drier pistachio note brings out the nut flavor just enough. This is my new favorite tobacco vape. Make this stuff in large quantities!"},{"user":"Smoky","score":"5","text":""},{"user":"RdaJunkie","score":"5","text":"Damn good man.
