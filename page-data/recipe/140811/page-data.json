So I tried to emulate a japanese dessert: Green Tea Icecream with Azuki (red bean jam).\r\nThe recipe is very simple and tasty with less then 7% flavoring.\r\n\r\nIce cream\r\nA combination of LB Vanilla ice cream and CAP Vanilla custard\r\n\r\nGreen Tea\r\nFE Green tea is the perfect solution. I tried MB natural green tea also, but FE is a better and faithfull solution\r\n\r\nAzuki\r\nVT red bean is a perfect Azuki jam. I tried to add VT jam it but it would alter the red bean flavor.\r\n\r\nSweet and steep\r\nGreen tea is bitter, so we need a 0.75 CAP super sweet here.\r\nYou need at least 3 days of steeping here in order to obtain the perfect mix of green tea and azuki.\r\n\r\nEnjoy, review, vape!","steep_days":"3","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-06T20:44:38.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"993","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Red Bean","vendor":"VT","millipercent":500},{"name":"Green Tea","vendor":"FE","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Vanilla Ice Cream","vendor":"LB","millipercent":3500},{"name":"Vanilla Custard","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Super Sweet","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":750}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"140811","name":"JapanCream - Green tea ice cream and azuki"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
