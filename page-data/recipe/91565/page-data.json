And then added Cavendish which I just love and vanilla bacco which is nice and finally some dulche de leche to smooth it out plus sweetener which I'm not sure is necessary for this recipe but I know the person I'm making it for likes sweet plus I think it kinda acts like salt in that it brings out flavors.  I've single tested cavendish at 3 and that is a good spot for it.","steep_days":"5","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T17:34:47.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"1215","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Green Apple","flavor_id":"67","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1750},{"name":"Double Apple","flavor_id":"45","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Cavendish","flavor_id":"4422","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Vanilla Bacco","flavor_id":"5916","vendor":"NR","millipercent":1250},{"name":"Dulce De Leche","flavor_id":"160","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Super Sweet","flavor_id":"2384","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":250}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"91565","name":"Green apple sweet tobacco"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
