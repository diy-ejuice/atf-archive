It’s sweet and super juicy and tastes like mixed melon and cucumber, as it should. But that’s just a bit too much FA Cucumber. It gets too peel-forward and almost astringent that high as a single flavor and in this mix. I’m certain that switching those CAP and FA cucumber percentages would be a big improvement here.
