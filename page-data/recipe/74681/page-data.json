Thank god for FLV Root Beer for sparking this idea and to my inspirations from Minty Down Under v2 from Rage and Anubis Nectar from Vurve.\r\n\r\nFLV Root Beer 2% - I like this here as its not overpowering but adds that great root beer spice. I love this flavoring so much.\r\n\r\nHS French Ice Cream/TFA VBIC/FA Merngue - This is the base for most of my ice creams, shout outs to Vurve's Anubis Nectar that inspired this base\r\n\r\nHS Chocolate Cream/HS Australian Chocolate - This combo comes from Minty Down Under v2 from Rage. I love how these chocolates work together and they really work well with the ice cream base and the FLV Root Beer.\r\n\r\nI get a good flavor of that sip you take after you drop in a scoop of chocolate ice cream into a glass of root beer and it starts to melt just slightly.\r\n\r\nI mixed this at 80vg/20pg and let it steep for a week.","steep_days":"7","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:49:42.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"2538","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Root Beer","flavor_id":"8567","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":2000},{"name":"French Vanilla Icecream","flavor_id":"2129","vendor":"HS","millipercent":800},{"name":"Vanilla Bean Ice Cream","flavor_id":"186","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":3500},{"name":"Meringue","flavor_id":"530","vendor":"FA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Chocolate Cream","flavor_id":"3512","vendor":"HS","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Australian Chocolate","flavor_id":"2657","vendor":"HS","millipercent":2500}],"reviews":[{"user":"BigFoot1","text":"Mixed exactly like the recipe calls for, no subs. Let steep 19 days before I was able to get back to it, due too some problems. I know that flv root beer is a very strong flavor from sft. Too me its very root beer foward with alot of creaminess and slight hint of chocolate lingering on my tongue. Mouth feel is very good. I would tell everyone if you like your root beer floats look no far and give this a mix. 5 stars "},{"user":"NonStopMix","text":"Mixed this up after watching the Root Beer Noted episode. 5 days in after the mix and this is absolutely phenomenal! Balanced very well and the root beer is not over powering as the mixer intended. The chocolate mixed with vanilla ice cream and root beer is VERY good. If you like root beer floats and chocolate, mix it and love it. Lovely lingering root beer after taste."},{"user":"ID10-T","text":"FLV Root Beer is inspiring, isn't it? And chocolate ice cream root beer float! What an awesome idea! Unfortunately, I can't really review this recipe, because I didn't really mix this recipe. Ever since I started tasting black pepper in TFA VBIC, I've been playing around with subs. It seems like 8:6 LB:TFA ratio has been working pretty well, so instead of 3.5% TFA, I used 4.7% LB Vanilla Ice Cream and otherwise followed the recipe. I might have messed it up a little doing that, upset the balance a bit as is very often the case with making substitutions. If I get around to mixing it again, I'll try lowering the LB down, maybe to 4%, because that wonderful Root Beer flavor isn't as forceful as I'd like it to be and I'm afraid I drowned it a bit in vanilla. But still, even with probably too much VIC, I'm getting a terrific vape. 5 stars for the lovely vape and because I can't take one away for something that's very likely my own fault. Enough root beer is still there to get that makes an outstanding pairing with chocolate ice cream even if it isn't the balance of the two I'd hoped for. The chocolate is the coolest thing here. The root beer seems to be doing some magic. I'm not a big fan of the way HS Chocolate Cream tastes on it's own. It's got a yucky sourness to it like chocolate yogurt. But I'm not getting any yucky sourness here. I love HS Australian Chocolate, but it's too dark, too nutty, and too dry. I'm getting just the slightest hair of nuttiness and zero dryness from this one, and it's not too dark for the profile. Root Beer magic! Definitely mix this up if the profile interests you and you don't get pepper from TFA VBIC.  If you are a pepper taster, try LB VIC but don't use as much as I did, or maybe bump the FLV Root Beer up a notch. Or, start from scratch making your own chocolate ice cream root beer float and don't forget to thank Dr. Doobie for the inspiration!
