I had never tried one till recently and was more than satisfied with a divinely balanced sweetness that was a little rich & almost caramel-like but delicious. This isn't a \"tea\" as such rather it is based on the parts of the flavours that I really enjoyed. It's interesting that I thought this would be a simple recipe when I started working with this, but it was actually quite a challenge to emulate the experience and strike the right balance in a vape eLiquid. I think this is a very close rendition regardless. \r\n\"A simple yet delicious combination of flavour that is easily an all day vape!\" \r\n\r\nEnjoy! \r\n\r\nIMO this is a very pleasant and enjoyable vape on a single coil RDA at 60W with a SST single coil at 0.2 ohm \r\n\r\nSteep Time 5 Days for best results. \r\n\r\nI hope you enjoy this just as much as I enjoyed creating this little recipe, but let me know what you thought in the comments below. \r\n\r\nSeriously if you like a solid recipe that works give it a go!\r\n\r\nCheers for reading this far, now go and get mixing!\r\n\r\n\"Together, Let's Discover!!!\"\r\n\r\nFacebook - https://www.facebook.com/groups/diydownunder/\r\nDiscord - https://discord.gg/kH4Fqbc\r\nYoutube - https://www.youtube.com/c/diydownunder\r\nWebsite - https://www.diydownunder.com/\r\nInstagram IGTV : @diydownunder","steep_days":"5","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-05T15:44:19.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"3153","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Brown Sugar","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Condensed Milk","vendor":"PUR","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Golden Syrup","vendor":"VT","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Marshmallow Vanilla","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":500},{"name":"Milk","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":500},{"name":"Milk & Honey","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":500},{"name":"White Chocolate (Milky Cream)","vendor":"WF","millipercent":1000}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"156599","name":"Brown Sugar Milk"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
