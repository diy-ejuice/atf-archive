I boosted the subtle pear notes with with a touch of INW Pear, which is still the best pear around IMO.\r\n\r\nINW Gold Ducat\r\nA fabulous tobacco for tobacco virgins! The ducat boosts the pear tobacco and brings with it natural honey and nuts which perfectly marries with the pear.\r\n\r\nINW Biscuit and HS French Vanilla Ice cream\r\nI find tobacco recipes to be too linear and the addition of these two superstars adds that roundness and fullness to take this to the next level. this also brings a of familiarity to the bacco novices... The HS FVIC can be subbed for 1% FA Cream.\r\n\r\nEnjoy!\r\n ","steep_days":"7","temperature":"0","recipe_score":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-11T14:07:41.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"1541","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Tobacco Pear","flavor_id":"877","vendor":"INW","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Gold Ducat","flavor_id":"783","vendor":"INW","millipercent":2000},{"name":"French Vanilla Icecream","flavor_id":"2129","vendor":"HS","millipercent":500},{"name":"Pear","flavor_id":"665","vendor":"INW","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Biscuit","flavor_id":"642","vendor":"INW","millipercent":1000}],"reviews":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"70605","name":"DuPear"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
