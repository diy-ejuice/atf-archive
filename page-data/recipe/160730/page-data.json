I sit quietly in the background mostly making other people's recipes and not creating a lot.\r\n\r\nThat being said I couldn't find a horchata recipe and that itch needed scratching so here it is. I think it is quite good and authentic.  Nothing too fancy. A nice smooth, creamy, and sweet rice drink with a nice cinnamon note.\r\n\r\nI like this recipe sweet but adjust to your taste. I used 2 drops per 30ml of rich cinnamon. \r\n\r\nPlease give it a try and offer up comments and suggestions.
