I have never bought the coffee but it sounded good so I went for it. No need to worry about the boosy note in this recipe as the bourbon is very light after the steep and blends nicely with the butter pecan and and coffee. This needs 5-7 days to steep.  I get butter pecan/caramel/cream on the inhale that transitions smoothly to a creamy coffee on the exhale.\r\n\r\nSM Italian Roast.... Stixx Mixx concentrates are ready to use presteeped flavors.  I find this to be a medium roast black coffee...not bitter just a very clean coffee flavor.  I prefer this concentrate between 5-6% but i believe you could take it higher without any off notes...just stronger more in your face coffee.\r\n\r\nRF Aged Bourbon Cream.....While this does have a distinct bourbon note after the steep is becomes subdued somewhat by the cream and caramel that emerges.. This flavor needs around five days to steep although it can be shake and vape if you don't mind the bourbon.\r\n\r\nOOO Butter Pecan Ice Cream....light butter pecan with a lot of cream...at this percentage i get no off notes in it at all but i find the Pecan note light.\r\n\r\nFW Butter Pecan...not much i can add about this flavor...its good...feel free to substitute OOO Butter Pecan if that is you prefered flavor.\r\n\r\nFA Vanilla Bourbon....Enough said...LOL\r\n\r\n","steep_days":"5","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"total_reviews":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T02:16:35.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"1210","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Italian Roast","vendor":"SM","millipercent":5000},{"name":"Aged Bourbon Cream â€“ Super Concentrate","vendor":"RF","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Butter Pecan","vendor":"FW","millipercent":2250},{"name":"Butter Pecan Ice Cream","vendor":"OOO","millipercent":2250},{"name":"Bourbon (vanilla Bourbon)","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"120122","name":"BUTTER PECAN BOURBON COFFEE"}}}
