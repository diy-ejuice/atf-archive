At first I was like wtf? This steeps into an absolutely delicious strawberry milkshake after 3 or so weeks, so hang in there!

I like your strawberry stone here:  FA Red Touch, which can be one-dimensional and flat, jammed up with VTA Strawberry Jam and Dragonfruit is a perfect combo for bright candied strawberry. Nice mixing. Tastes nice but will get back after a longer steep"}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"181037","name":"5Ô∏è‚É£ Dollar Shake"}}}
