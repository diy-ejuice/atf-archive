Make a raspberry limeade.\r\n\r\nFW Lemonade + FA Lemon Sicily = the authentic and tart lemonade.\r\nCAP Lemon Lime = how I transformed this lemonade into a limeade, if you take this out you get an authentic raspberry lemonade.\r\nINW Raspberry + FLV Red Raspberry = the true raspberry fruit, without any jammy/candy effect. INW Raspberry is the most authentic raspberry there is, and FLV raspberry just gives that real raspberry with seeds and off the branch dimension to any raspberry.\r\n\r\nIf you want you can add WS-23 or TPA Koolada at 0.5% (or more if you need more), to get the cold effect that goes with lemonade.\r\n\r\nPS: Thanks to Fresh03 for the inspiration to buy FW Lemonade because I remembered him say that it's the most authentic lemonade.\r\n\r\n******\r\nPYNK Nectar is my homage to Janelle Mon√°e's song PYNK and if you haven't seen it or you don't understand what the song is about, then here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaYvlVR_BEc .\r\n\r\nIn case you still don't get it, PYNK is about going down on women and how pleasurable it is for women. The best description I can give you on what it's like to go down on a woman is raspberry limeade and if you haven't tried it yet ... just stop everything you're doing and go ...\r\n\r\nMy job is done here.\r\n******","steep_days":"3 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-11-27T16:08:25.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"1290","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Raspberry","flavor_id":"667","vendor":"INW","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Red Raspberry","flavor_id":"4367","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":500},{"name":"Lemonade","flavor_id":"1336","vendor":"FW","millipercent":5000},{"name":"Lemon Sicily","flavor_id":"524","vendor":"FA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Lemon Lime","flavor_id":"83","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":2000}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"117139","name":"PYNK Nectar (Raspberry Limeade)"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
