Extremely flavorful. Enjoy!\r\n  \r\n**NOTES:**\r\n  \r\n\r\n*The strawberries I chose are for obvious reasons. FA needs to be high, as it's  a weak flavor. I enjoy the combination of TFA Strawberry & FA Strawberry.*\r\n  \r\n*TFA Coconut Candy was used as a slight accent, and is only shyly present.*\r\n  \r\n*INW Raspberry is the BEST raspberry candy out there IMHO. So, its' inclusion was obvious.*\r\n  \r\n*CAP Vanilla Whipped Cream & FW White Chocolate add body and texture respectively. I find that the CAP Vanilla Whipped Cream also serves to tame Inawera's Raspberry so that it's  not so much in your face*\r\n  \r\n  \r\n*Best at 65-70% VG(I prefer 70%). Best after 7-10 day steep.*\r\n  \r\n#EJUICEMAKERS\r\n\r\n*Please ask permission to post this recipe elsewhere, as it was made to only be shared on ATF. You may not use this recipe for commercial profit.*","steep_days":"7","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T15:20:47.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"2346","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Strawberry","flavor_id":"272","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Red Touch (strawberry)","flavor_id":"421","vendor":"FA","millipercent":4500},{"name":"White Chocolate","flavor_id":"1462","vendor":"FW","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Vanilla Whipped Cream","flavor_id":"1","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Raspberry","flavor_id":"667","vendor":"INW","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Coconut Candy","flavor_id":"223","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":500}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"59433","name":"Stormborn(Queen Of Hearts)"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
