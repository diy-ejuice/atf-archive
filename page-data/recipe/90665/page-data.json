It's creamy, strong and a natural sweetness comes through.\r\n\r\nINW Shisha Strawberry/FA Juicy Strawberry\r\n\r\nJuicy Strawberry is another great strawberry flavouring from FA.  It gives both a ripe and sweet taste, so really the best of both worlds.  Shisha Strawberry I added to give vibrance and a long lasting strawberry flavour.\r\n\r\nFA Meringue \r\n\r\nMeringue adds a touch of natural sweetness to the mix, while adding a creamy feel and also a bit of texture to the finished juice.\r\n\r\nINW Biscuit\r\n\r\nThis flavouring speaks for itself and adds the biscuit crunch I wanted to implement to the custard and strawberry profile.\r\n\r\nCAP Super Sweet\r\n\r\nBesides adding a little more sweetness to the mix, it also gives me a great mouthfeel from the juice and bit more vibrance.","steep_days":"21","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:49:59.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"6986","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Custard Premium","vendor":"FA","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Custard","vendor":"INW","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Shisha Strawberry","vendor":"INW","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Juicy Strawberry","vendor":"FA","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Biscuit","vendor":"INW","millipercent":1250},{"name":"Meringue","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Super Sweet","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":250}],"reviews":[{"user":"Jwolfe1525","text":"Awesome strawberry and cookie dessert recipe.  Im a new mixer and was hoping to stay away from liquids with added sweeteners so I made a 30ml tester of the recipe without the SS and it was pretty good, not something I'm in love with but definitely a good recipe.   Well I broke down and said screw it (I love sweets, sweet liquids, and anything with sugar) and got FW Sweetener and some CAP SS and  added the SS to the batch i already had floating around and the difference it made was amazing.   This may become my new favorite strawberry liquid,  I just have to give it a few days and see how my taste buds react vaping a lot of it. Thank you for the recipe.

I knew this mix was going to be fire and made a 120ml off the bat. No qualms at all. Excellent custard base, great usage of the new FA Juicy Strawberry. A lot of strawberry mixes I can't taste but I think the thickness of the custard base really lets it shine here and it's delicious. The biscuit does have a nice snap at the end of the vape too, the crunch is definitely there. Definitely an ADV now."},{"user":"JustMixIt","text":"I initially made a 10ml bottle, and after a 2 week steep and taste test, I made up a 120ml bottle.  I absolutely love this flavor. I have become a big fan of Custard Premium by FA since trying this recipe and it really seems to shine here.  Easily an ADV for me, I will always have a bottle of it on hand! Thanks for sharing this recipe! "}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"90665","name":"Strawberry Crunch Custard"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
