It’s a profile I’ve been chasing for a while now. After several iterations, I think I’ve finally settled on this recipe. Pink burst and JF sweet strawberry make up the bulk of the strawberry profile, with shisha strawberry lending a helping hand by providing a natural ripe strawberry accent on the backend. Salt water taffy provides a textural base by imparting a slightly chewy and thick mouthfeel with help from marshmallow. Vanilla swirl adds the smoothness and creaminess. \r\n\r\nSweetener is up to the initial mixer, but this is a candy and it benefits from it in the end. \r\n\r\nGive this about a seven to ten day steep. I found the profile a bit harsh and muddled after a day. After a prolonged steep it starts to shine.
