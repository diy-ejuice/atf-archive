I like to add berries, like blueberries, raspberries, or strawberries. While apples and oranges are more traditional, I find berries infuse more flavor and color into the wine.\r\nA bit of fruit, a little orange juice, some brandy. Boom, boom, done\r\n\r\nLet the ingredients speak for them selves in this bloody cold but tasteful recipe.\r\n\r\ngive it a 5 days rest and enjoy.\r\n\r\nRF Brandy = RF SC brandy","steep_days":"5","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"total_reviews":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T17:35:28.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"3529","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Blood Orange","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1250},{"name":"Berry Blend","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":300},{"name":"Brandy","vendor":"RF","millipercent":500},{"name":"WS-23","vendor":"OTHR","millipercent":750},{"name":"Forrest Mix (forest Fruit Mix)","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1250},{"name":"Lime Wedge","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":500},{"name":"Sangria","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":2750}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"137446","name":"Frozen Berry Sangria "}}}
