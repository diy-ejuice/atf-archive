It is a sweet fruity vape and changes with temp, build, and wattage. It is an extremely complex recipe and trying to recreate it was a hard task as taste is subjective and the flavor keeps changing as you vape it. Give this a shot and let me know what you think if you have had the original.\r\n\r\nFa - Oba Oba - This is where the magic happens of the flavors changing. By its self it is just a weird flavor but with all of these fruits it for some reason picks and chooses what you taste. \r\n\r\nFa Blackcurrant/Forrest Fruit - This is a great combo and could be a mix on its own. The sweetness of both of these help boost the entire profle and are the main notes or what you may taste most in this mix. \r\n\r\nCap Golden pineapple / Pina colada - This is what gives that nice pina colada flavor in this mix you may taste just the pinapple but then you may taste that pina. This is the middle note or what you will taste some times when the time is right and the mix says you need a change of pace. \r\n\r\nCap Sweet Mango /Sweet Strawberry - This is the least prominent flavor in this profile or at least what I tasted the least of. You sometimes get a mango vape sometimes a strawberry sometimes both of them together.  Some people including myself have a strong taste for mango AKA can taste it in the juice no matter what. If you feel like this is you crank that down to 1% or lower if your tasting a strong mango and your not a fan of the Mangos. \r\n\r\nTFA Marshmallow- Strictly to add the mouthfeel and make this feel more like a full vape. \r\n\r\nCap Super sweet- This can range from .5% to 1% depending on how sweet you like your stuff and if you want to change your coils every day.. I recommend the half a percent but i dont like cleaning coils every day and it is plenty sweet for me but as always you may find you want more sweetness. \r\n\r\n","steep_days":"1 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:49:11.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"8172","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Oba Oba","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Blackcurrant","vendor":"FA","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Forrest Mix (forest Fruit Mix)","vendor":"FA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Golden Pineapple","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Pina Colada","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Sweet Mango","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Sweet Strawberry","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Marshmallow","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Super Sweet","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":500}],"reviews":[{"user":"RdaJunkie","text":"People keep saying this isn't Betty and it's not. It's better. You did an awesome job here man. It is one of the most interesting and addicting recipes I've mixed. I don't get too much of any one flavor. It is completely balanced with hints of you don't fucking know what but you like it. I'll be mixing a 240 of this. Thank you for your time and efforts "}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"36441","name":"Betty ( A Pinup Vapors Remix)"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
