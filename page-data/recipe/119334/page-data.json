The spice notes calm down after a couple weeks and mellow into a warm underglow to the maplely leafy tobacco notes and the woody fire notes.  The Creme Bavarian brings in the caramel notes, boosts the maple notes, and smooths the flavors with a cream note. The Honeycomb acts as a backbone to the tobacco adding a bakery note that isn't quite a cookie and isn't quite honey.","steep_days":"5 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T14:13:28.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"1147","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Tatanka Tobacco","flavor_id":"4417","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Black Fire","flavor_id":"458","vendor":"FA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Bakery Spice Blend","flavor_id":"8824","vendor":"VT","millipercent":40},{"name":"Honeycomb","flavor_id":"8901","vendor":"VT","millipercent":230},{"name":"Bavarian Cream ","flavor_id":"9951","vendor":"FA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Fuji","flavor_id":"506","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1900}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"119334","name":"Jarvis - Mixin Vixens - Episode 29 - Fall Leaves"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
