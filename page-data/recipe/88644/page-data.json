This definitely ticks the boxes! \r\n\r\nThe LA and FLV Lemonade combo works a treat. LAs is weaker, but more authentic, and FLVs reminds me of a lemon sherbet/ bon bon. It gives a more cloudy impression to the lemonade. \r\nI added RF Cream Soda to thicken the mouthfeel and try to convey more bubbles. \r\nFA Lemon Sicily, my favourite lemon, used for its beautiful fresh lemon authenticity. \r\nINW Cactus at a low percentage really complements the lemon, just gives it a little juicy boost. The Super Sweet pushes everything forward and helps the sour notes hit the tongue more. It could probably be lowered slightly, though I wouldn‚Äôt go any higher. \r\nI used a small amount of WS-3 for a cooling effect, without retarding the flavours as it does for me when used higher. The only trouble is it does fade over time.\r\nI can see lots of ways to tinker with this, adding different fruits instead of the Lemon Sicily, just got some VT Fizzy Sherbet in too, which I‚Äôll be swapping for the Cream Soda once I finish this batch, and I‚Äôll update if necessary. But as it stands it‚Äôs damn addicting and true to the profile. \r\nHope you enjoy it as much as I do! \r\n\r\n\r\n","steep_days":"2 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T17:34:43.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"1698","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Lemonade","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1250},{"name":"Lemonade","vendor":"LA","millipercent":3500},{"name":"Lemon Sicily","vendor":"FA","millipercent":750},{"name":"Cream Soda ‚Äì SC","vendor":"RF","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Super Sweet","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":250},{"name":"WS-3 (Koolada)","vendor":"SA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Cactus","vendor":"INW","millipercent":250}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"88644","name":"Limonada üçã"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
