The profile was strawberry apple compote, which is basically a chunky fruit jam used as a topping of sorts. Delicious as it sounds, obviously we were a tad limited on what we could use. This flavor would need to consist of cooked apples and strawberries, a touch of cinnamon all cooked with sugar and a bit of apple cider. This idea came from a Google search of strawberry apple lol since that was 2 of the flavors we were supposed to use. TFA Strawberry Ripe/JF (or FA) Fuji and last but not least CAP Cinnamon Danish Swirl were the flavors. The rules also said no more than 3 extra flavors.  Anyways, needless to say, I didn't win. Boo hoo, oh well. \r\n          \r\nNow, I really loved the profile once I stumbled on it, but to me, the one I made just did not hit the level I was looking for. Everything was there, but it just wasn't as realistic as I wanted it to be. The CDS really screwed up a lot in that one, simply because even at a really low percentage, that pastry note would come through. I tried to cook the fruit with some FA Liquid Amber and while that would certainly work for such a thing, I wasn't digging it. Strawberry just isn't the type of fruit that does well getting \"cooked\" by Liquid Amber imo. I mean, in a compote, the cooked aspect isn't what you're trying to achieve anyways. It's just a scrumptious, chunky jam as I said so it really just needed to be darkened up into a jam-like version. Here, I took SB Ripe, gave it a touch of red (see what I did there?) to add a bit more realism to it as well as darken it a little cuz FA Red Touch to me is already like a bunch of smashed up strawberries. Of course, I didn't have to do a thing with the apple aspect because JF Fuji is so tasty and tastes much more realistic than its FA counterpart. To me that realism and the fact that it's not quite as sharp as FA, it was perfect for a bakery apple. FLV Rich Cinnamon is the ultimate bakery cinnamon so 1 drop per 15 mls is all you need. You can even go 1 drop per 30mls if you're really sensitive to it.  I used FLV Caramel and TPA Toasted Marshmallow to complete the compote. The Caramel is there simply to give that browned sugar effect but its not as sweet as I would want so I paired it up with the TM which has its own caramelly notes as well as a nice slight bakery burnt touch. This combo really helps with the whole \"cooked down w sugar\" idea but the marshmallow also helps to soften everything down as the cinnamon can be kinda harsh. \r\n       \r\nSo there you have it. A strawberry apple compote! This recipe really hits the spot in the fall. That baked apple is the best when its a little chilly outside. If you find the cinnamon to be a little harsh after the steep, try it at 75-77% VG instead. It's not much of a difference but it seemed to help a lot when I make this. \r\n","steep_days":"7","temperature":"420","recipe_score":4.5,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:48:57.000-05:00","best_vg":"75%","views":"2443","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Strawberry (ripe)","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Red Touch (strawberry)","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Fuji","vendor":"JF","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Toasted Marshmallow","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Caramel","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":750},{"name":"Rich Cinnamon","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":150},{"name":"Sweetener","vendor":"FW","millipercent":1000}],"reviews":[{"user":"corvape","text":"Great fall recipe. Definitely has a nice apple compote flavor. I added cap sugar cookie for some texture and itâ€™s. Bangin!&#xD;\nThanks for sharing"},{"user":"ENYAWREKLAW","text":"This is such a great recipe to bring in the Fall season. Taking the Strapple craze of the summer and infusing some autumn-ness into it. There's a delicious blend between the caramel / cinnamon base and the strawberry apple profile that creates an easy to vape profile, but one with dimension. Choosing the right kind of fruits is vital to this recipe, and I think KrisWK has done just that. If you're a fan of baked apple / apple pie recipes, as well as strawberry jam recipes, you'll really love this one. While there's not much I don't like, it's not a perfect recipe. I feel the Toasted Marshmallow actually hinders the recipe. It just pulls away at the top a bit, and doesn't do much to the overall flavor. Maybe a different type of bakery would've worked better. Overall a very impressive offering. &#xD;\n&#xD;\nFlavor Score: 4.25 / 5 &#xD;\n&#xD;\n[THIS RECIPE WAS REVIEWED ON \"THIS WEEK WITH WAYNE: ARE FLAVORS IN VAPING DEAD? 9-14-17]"}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"23720","name":"Strapple Compote Part Duex"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
