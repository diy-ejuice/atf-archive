I've been meaning to throw this up for a while. Feel free to go all the way up to 10 or so percent on the wf peach pie and cream and as low as .75 on the eggnog. Have fun toying with it and seeing how you prefer the balance.","steep_days":"1 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"updated_at":"2020-12-12T14:06:22.000-05:00","best_vg":"69%","views":"10696","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Peach Pie & Cream","flavor_id":"6058","vendor":"WF","millipercent":7000},{"name":"Eggnog","flavor_id":"4396","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1250}],"reviews":[{"user":"NickG","text":"","score":0},{"user":"QueerYourVape","text":"This recipe is amazing. My favorite peach vape. I add 2% TPA Peach Juicy and a tad more Eggnog because I find WF PP&amp;C a little thin on the fruit. It has become my ADV of the moment. Brilliant !","score":5},{"user":"NaCHeF","text":"Delicious! This is exactly what christmas taste in the south hemisphere! You get the warm feeling of spiced eggnog contrasting with the fresh creamy peach. Masterly developed and very well balanced.","score":5},{"user":"Asire","text":"Exceptional example for simple recipe that beats most others in flavor depth department. The WF peaches get turned around by the eggnog like 180 degrees. It adds an insane depth to the cream part, itâ€™s bends the peaches into a more cooked like taste and adds extremely delicious spice notes. To me cardamom seem to stand out a bit but there are many more to be tasted. The balance is insane and for me this will be a perfect vape introducing fall until well after Christmas. Great work ","score":5},{"user":"SlashaLO","text":"What can I say other than: Another great Shyndo simple mix. 2 flavors, balanced extremely well, that play with each other and create an amazing vape.
