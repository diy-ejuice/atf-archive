By itself it is a good custard with some nice egg notes. The addition of New York Cheesecake V2 (CAP) and Bavarian Cream (FA) combine to add a richness and thick mouth feel that really brings the custard together.\r\n\r\nBlueberry Candy (TPA) mixed with Blueberry Extra (TPA) and Forest Mix (FA) combine to make a sweet blueberry compote that has been loosely stirred into the vanilla custard.\r\n\r\nThis recipe tastes very good right after a good shake but it has a little bit of harshness. Give it a couple weeks and it is much smoother. After four weeks it is a very nice blueberry vanilla custard that will continue to develop over the next few weeks, if it lasts that long.","steep_days":"30","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"total_reviews":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-06T20:39:41.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"2044","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Bavarian Cream","vendor":"FW","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Blueberry Candy (pg)","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":4500},{"name":"Blueberry (extra)","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Forrest Mix (forest Fruit Mix)","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"New York Cheesecake V2","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Sweetener","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Vanilla Custard V2","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":6000}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"38005","name":"True Blue Custard"}}}
