Connecticut Shade is a leafy, dry tobacco wrapper that has some coffee and cocoa notes on the exhale but used to give a true cigar wrapper feel. Red Burley and Native are the tobaccos that fill that cigar. Red Burley brings depth to this tobacco layer, darkening it up and providing some nuttiness and cocoa. In my tobaccos I usually will use Cured, Native, or Kentucky depending on how much I need to dry it out. Native is the nice middle ground to dry it out and add some spiciness.\r\n\r\nAM4A is a very nice tobacco that only gets more complex as it steeps. On it's own it is a spiced, woody aromatic tobacco with some dark dried fruits. I personally pick out some raisin, figs, and mostly dates in the background. I choose to use this flavor because it can be very different for most people and changes in many situations.\r\n\r\nMilk & Honey is here to bring forward some of the richness of the tobaccos as well as smooth it out. .5% is a good place to start and if it is too dry than you can take it up as far as 1%.\r\n\r\nThis is great after 1 day, and then at 2 weeks it's even better. But if you leave it for 1 month you really get something special from the AM4A.","steep_days":"14","temperature":"0","recipe_score":4.9,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:50:09.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"7726","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Connecticut Shade","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":800},{"name":"Am4a By Inwera","vendor":"INW","millipercent":750},{"name":"Native Tobacco","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Milk & Honey","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":500},{"name":"Red Burley","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1600}],"reviews":[{"user":"lionhrt9","text":"I can't say much more than what's been written. It takes someone to know their flavors well to make them play nicely together. Awesome tobacco mix right here. Only made 30 aaaaaand that was a mistake. "},{"user":"MaxUT","text":"This ranks with Abuela in my favorites list.  I wouldn't know a nuance if it danced on the tip of my nose, but Gatsby hits all the right notes for me.  Been vaping it every day for almost a month and ain't tired of it yet."},{"user":"goosegirl","text":"I let this steep for a month, as you suggested.  I admit I was surprised how much flavor this has, and it took a minute to comprehend what I was vaping.  Even more than the vape itself, I love the aftertaste that it leaves.  The fruity sweetness, and dark cocoa flavors blend perfectly for my taste.  Thank you for a unique experience."},{"user":"Ebc88","text":"The Connecticut and AM4A had a chemical taste to me when single flavor tested them, but i have never noticed it when i mixed with them but i had never mixed them together, and i am getting a chemically tobacco note on the first vape or 2. Then it goes away until I stop vaping it for a while and come back to it. Then i notice the chemical note for the first 2 pulls. Other than that it is a great recipe. Burley and Native is an excellent combo, Milk and Honey was made for tobaccos IMO. "},{"user":"amouthforwar","text":"Tested at day 1 and day 7 so far, great vape regardless of the steep time. tobaccos definitely get richer as it ages. I don't get much nuttiness but the tobacco mix here is solid as hell, subtly sweet, nice rich leafyness from the burley, hint of spicy tobacco from the Native and dried fruits underneath it all. Great smooth mix. Coming back to it after the recommended steep time yields something incredible. It's a deliciously dry cigarish vape with a hint of coffee or cocoa and some really subtle dark fruitiness from the am4a. Fantastic job!"},{"user":"ObiWanCannoli","text":"I LOVE this recipe! Just a delicious and rich cigar type vape. This is bold as all hell in a Hadaly and almost too much for me but this is right at home in my Berserker MTL. These tobaccos work very well together to create one hell of a beautiful and complex recipe. The M&amp;H works awesome in this recipe to bring that extra sweet and smooth kick and compliments those darker tobaccos nicely. Keep up the good work, I will be keeping this in my rotation for sure!"},{"user":"ConcreteRiver","text":"Tested at 3 weeks.&#xD;\n&#xD;\nA really nice dark, sweet, and rich cigar recipe.  I probably can't say \"artisanal swisher sweets\" without looking like a jerk, so I'll call it a refined take on a lizard brain tobacco staple.  Looking at the description, I do think it's basically what you were going for.  I'm not the tobacco vocabulary guy, but I am getting a distinct wrapper type note, so that's cool.  The cocoa is probably a bolder component for me here than the fruitiness.  Opens with a heavier cocoa note with some pleasant roast coffee overtones.  Nothing too grassy in the base, so that cocoa is working pretty well. I do pick up some of that dark fruitiness on the finish, but it's playing nicely with cocoa up front.  Sweet but not gross sweet.  The milk and honey is adding some darker caramel notes but isn't swamping the texture. Comes across as fairly dry without being too harsh.   The woodier notes from the AM4A are going across as almost a light spice note, which is working well everything here.  I like the balance overall, and this is a great take on dessert tobacco that isn't just an RY4 in disguise."}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"100160","name":"Gatsby"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
