The custardy buttery taste of the Flapper Pie works so well with the Butterscotchs. It is rich but not overly rich, creamy and just buttery-scotchy  goodness. I don't use a lot of sweeteners or go much above 0.5% when I do use them but you can add sweetener to your liking. If you like super sweet vapes then go ahead and add sweetener to your tastes. It is lightly sweet with just the Meringue.\r\n\r\n WF Flapper Pie single flavor test, it has a smooth buttery sweet custard / pie flavor after a week steep. After trying it I immediately knew I wanted to try a Butterscotch custard Pie with it. . Hope you will give it a shot and give me your feedback and thoughts on what you would or did change or what would possibly work better with the Flapper Pie. \r\n\r\nAnd for anyone leaving comments I will politely ask that if you have something negative to say or feedback do not be rude or curse me. Approach me as an adult and be civil and leave the nastiness elsewhere.
