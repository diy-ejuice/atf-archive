In this recipe adds some creaminess and binds with the nuts so they do not get so dry.\r\nFA Hazel Grove (hazelnut) - Pure hazelnut and super concentrated. Add realism to the Hazelnut itself.\r\nFW Hazelnut - A very versatile hazelnut that can be applied to various profiles. Upping the percentage brings notes of chocolate.\r\nFLV Pistachio - A pistachio balanced both in body and texture. The skin is present in this flavor such as TPA Pistachio. Incredibly strong and real.\r\nCAP Toasted Almond - Generic almond like the ones we buy at supermarkets. Not much toast but a noticeable note.\r\nTPA Whipped Cream - Recipe emulsifier. Creates a bond between the nuts and the caramel.\r\nFW Salted Caramel - Caramel that is not salty as the name says but simulates the characteristic flavor of salty caramel. That note of caramel that as it took salt has a distinct aroma, different than just caramel made of sugar.\r\nFLV Chocolate Deutsch - Creamy and melted chocolate from the cakes. It is the best possible description for this flavor. Super concentrated too. 1 DROP IS ENOUGH! Together with FW Hazelnut, it brings notes of melted chocolate to the profile.\r\n\r\nSteep: Between 5 to 7 days for the chocolate to calm down and the caramel to be wrapped with the nuts.","steep_days":"7","temperature":"0","recipe_score":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-10T13:45:29.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"992","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Bavarian Cream","flavor_id":"145","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Chocolate Deutsch","flavor_id":"2151","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":100},{"name":"Hazel Grove (hazelnut)","flavor_id":"417","vendor":"FA","millipercent":250},{"name":"Hazelnut","flavor_id":"1312","vendor":"FW","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Pistachio","flavor_id":"3520","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":500},{"name":"Caramel (salted)","flavor_id":"1232","vendor":"FW","millipercent":3500},{"name":"Toasted Almond","flavor_id":"128","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Whipped Cream","flavor_id":"193","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":500}],"reviews":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"105315","name":"Choco Nutbar "}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
