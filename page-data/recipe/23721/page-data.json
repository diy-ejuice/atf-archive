Gone through 10 iterations and tweaks already and I've vaped almost 1l of this exact recipe and still want more so there's no point in mixin less than 100ml - it's getting through coils too fast to even steep properly :) Heavy on cream side, but strawberry is still pronounced very well. Also has a lot of weight and volume due to 2AP. Rest should be self-explanatory.\r\n\r\nSIMPLE MODE: \r\nJust add 4% of shisha instead of 3 and give up with rest of strawberries.
