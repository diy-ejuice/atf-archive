For a vegetable that doesn't taste of much it came through fresh and tasty in the vape. Once I got into DIY I knew I wanted to try and make something using cucumber.\r\n\r\nAfter quite a few iterations and playing with percentages I've settled on the below.\r\n\r\n**CAP Cucumber** - Juicy, freshly sliced cucumber. I found 3.5% the sweet spot for the flavour to come through the KB.\r\n\r\n**TPA Kentucky Bourbon** - First tried this with [Coop's Kiwi Bourbon recipe](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/21614). Now I'm not a bourbon drinker but I really enjoyed that recipe so I thought to myself why not try make a cocktail with the cucumber. Used here at the same percentage as Kiwi Bourbon it gives you the warm boozy flavour.\r\n\r\n**FA Lemon Sicily** - I've got a few lemons but found this one works best as a \"dash of lemon\" in a drink. Here to add another dimension and an extra note just lingering in the background.\r\n\r\n**WS-23** - Once I'd got the recipe to my liking it was time to finish it and pour it into a glass of ice. 0.75% is perfect to me for this but I know other people's tolerances vary for this. Adjust to your liking.\r\n\r\nWorks off the shake but I like to at least leave it overnight.","steep_days":"1 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":4,"total_reviews":2,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:50:25.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"1539","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Kentucky Bourbon","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Cucumber","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":3500},{"name":"Lemon Sicily","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"WS-23","vendor":"OTHR","millipercent":750}],"reviews":[{"user":"JTHerman","score":"4","text":"Great choice of flavors, but I found the bourbon at 2% to be way too low. If you like whiskey I think you’ll agree this recipe needs a lot more. It’s like the SOHO tobacco flavor: the manufacturers recommend you use that at 20%. A lot of people find that to be way too strong, but if you like cigarettes (not lights), SOHO at those levels makes a vape oil with a similar intensity and mouth feel. The same thing goes for the Kentucky Bourbon in this mix. If you’re a whiskey drinker, try it with a lot more and this is a fantastic recipe. Also, don’t try using INW Lemon Mix in place of FA Lemon Sicily. Lemon Sicily is a slightly sweet, slightly tart flavor that supports the CAP Cucumber. Lemon Mix is like straight lemon juice, and it covers over the cucumber."},{"user":"coop34","score":"4","text":"Good use of cucumber. After a week the bourbon has came into play nicely. I dont really like lemon, but it is essential to the mix. I dialed it back to my tastes. If you have been looking for a use for the wonderful Cap Cucumber, give this a try. It is a nice refreshing change from the usual creamy desserts that I normally vape."}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"116636","name":"Cucumber Bourbon"}}}
