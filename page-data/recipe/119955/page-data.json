Unfortunately this recipe is going to need a few weeks steep for all the buttery richness to fully come to fruition, so it's not a shake and vape, and I may be adjusting or adding to it later after I see how it steeps out.  But so far the molasses and spice notes are at almost the right balance, so long as the DAAP components of several of these flavors steep out.  It doesn't currently have a lot of Baked flavor, if those notes don't come out I may add some FA cookie or some VTA Biscuit base...but I was trying to use the least amount of flavorings I could to achieve the recipe taste I am looking for.  Right now it's more like the biscoff cookie butter to me, which was also a recipe I wanted to do too.   If the baked part doesn't come out enough after the steep I am going to consider this recipe to be the cookie butter version of these cookies, and will not down here in the description if I do anything to change it to make it more of a baked cookie. \r\n","steep_days":"14","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"total_reviews":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-06T20:44:17.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"1055","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Gingerbread","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Graham Cracker Clear","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Sugar Cookie","vendor":"DF","millipercent":2800},{"name":"Creme Caramel","vendor":"CC","millipercent":1700},{"name":"Acetyl Pyrazine 5%","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":300},{"name":"DX Brown Sugar","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":300},{"name":"Sweetness","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":400}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"119955","name":"Jarvis - Mixin Vixens - Episode 30 - What the biskoffing is this cookie?
