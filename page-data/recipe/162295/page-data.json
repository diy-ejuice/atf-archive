What is it? \r\n\r\nThis is \"Bonkers!\"\r\n\r\nMy two favorite profiles and all day vapes are a strawberry bakery recipe and a banana bakery recipe. As a DIYer it has pained me for years that I have been handcuffed to a recipe called \"Banana Bondage\", from a recently defunct commercial eLiquid creator. It pained me because for so long I challenged myself to create something almost as good or better. This recipe in my opinion is better! \r\n\r\nI love a hot banana, something authentic and has body through out the vape. I have also been experimenting with many various pairings & combinations over a long time to finally get this recipe that has finally set me free and it's fair to say has made me \"Bonkers\" with excitement! \r\n\r\nSteep Time - Great off the shake but even better in 5+ days\r\n\r\nBanana Flambe by Solub Arome \r\n\"Had me at hello.\" \r\nIt's cooked banana done right, no off notes and provides the hot body of banana in this recipe.\r\n\r\nBanana Custard by Vape Train \r\nI used to sweeten the banana delicately and help provide some contrast not only to the banana but also to the pudding body of this vape. \r\n\r\nVanilla Pudding by Flavorah\r\nProvides a lovely vanilla body and really helps round the edges of how this recipe works. \r\n\r\nCaramel by Flavor Art \r\nHelps to assist with a lovely syrupy caramelisation in this recipe. Normally I would always pair with FA Butterscotch as they are great friends but in this profile there are other tones that allows FA Butterscotch to have a rest for now. \r\n\r\nHoneycomb by Vape Train\r\nGives a lovely contrasting sweetness and texture to this recipe that can be appreciated more after a 5 day steep. \r\n\r\nSesame Candy by Wonder Flavors\r\nWith my several paring experiments, I have found this flavour to be the perfect compliment to sweetening nuts, popcorn and giving something lovely to caramels. In this recipe it is used to enhance the peanut butter honeycomb & caramel notes and it works wonderfully. \r\n\r\nPeanut Butter DX by TFA/TPA\r\nThis is the twist, this is what delivers morrishness as it reciprocates delectably with all the other flavours in this recipe. As a smooth peanut butter, it works well but works better with the right enhancement and it's fair to say the compliments are mutual with all the other flavours in this recipe. \r\n\r\nThis is a white whale recipe that has gotten better than the white whale I was looking for originally, but that is the journey of DIY. DIY allows you to create what you like! \r\n\r\nIf you mix this and like it or not, let me know in the comments below :)\r\n\r\nEnjoy!! \r\n\r\nIMO this is a very pleasant and enjoyable vape on a single coil RDA at 60W with a SST single coil at 0.2 ohm and various mesh subohm tanks as well. Vary the wattage and see what you taste! \r\n\r\nSteep Time 5 Days for best results. \r\n\r\nI hope you enjoy this just as much as I enjoyed creating this recipe, but let me know what you thought in the comments below. \r\n\r\nSeriously if you like a solid recipe that works give it a go!\r\n\r\nCheers for reading this far, now go and get mixing!\r\n\r\n\"Together, Let's Discover!!!\"\r\n\r\nFacebook - https://www.facebook.com/groups/diydownunder/\r\nDiscord - https://discord.gg/kH4Fqbc\r\nYoutube - https://www.youtube.com/c/diydownunder\r\nWebsite - https://www.diydownunder.com/\r\nInstagram IGTV : @diydownunder\r\n","steep_days":"5","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"total_reviews":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T23:38:03.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"2356","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Banana Custard","vendor":"VT","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Banana Flambe","vendor":"SA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Carmel (caramel)","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Honeycomb","vendor":"VT","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Dx Peanut Butter","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Sesame Candy SC","vendor":"WF","millipercent":500},{"name":"Vanilla Pudding","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1000}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"162295","name":"Bonkers"}}}
