It reduces the chance of inadvertently muting your flavors like EM can do, which is in Sweetener (TPA).\r\n\r\nHope you enjoy,\r\nScrewdriver","steep_days":"1 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"total_reviews":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-04T23:27:50.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"1590","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Blue Raspberry","vendor":"LB","millipercent":6000},{"name":"Pineapple","vendor":"LB","millipercent":6000},{"name":"Pineapple","vendor":"HS","millipercent":500},{"name":"Raspberry","vendor":"INW","millipercent":500},{"name":"Strawberry","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Sweet Strawberry","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Super Sweet","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":500}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"78327","name":"BlueRas Pineapple"}}}
