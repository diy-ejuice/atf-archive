This recipe is derived by an old family real banana custard that I took and made into a vape juice..\r\nSome recipes can be complex where others are are so basic.. This recipe to me is fairly basic in my eye's with an extra banana flavor with the custard as the base and the rest melt together..\r\nBoth the Soft Banana and the Banana Puree are a must in this recipe..","steep_days":"10","temperature":"0","recipe_score":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-10T17:57:29.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"1982","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Soft Banana","flavor_id":"1524","vendor":"MB","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Banana Pur√©e","flavor_id":"6042","vendor":"WF","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Shisha Vanilla","flavor_id":"841","vendor":"INW","millipercent":750},{"name":"Sweet Coconut","flavor_id":"605","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Milk SC","flavor_id":"9031","vendor":"WF","millipercent":750},{"name":"Meringue","flavor_id":"4112","vendor":"RF","millipercent":500},{"name":"Vanilla Custard","flavor_id":"131","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":3250}],"reviews":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"98346","name":"Custy Naners"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
