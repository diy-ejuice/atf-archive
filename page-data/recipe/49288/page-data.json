Caps Cappuccino is actually pretty good, tastes a bit like cappuccino candy, and fits profile better than other coffee flavors i got. i I love FW white choc so that's a nobrainer for me. used with tpa's version to back it up. it is a little bit dry so therefore butter cream and sweet cream come in. both are sweet and milky, they make white choc a bit softer and the profile more creamy. lastly cap peppermint for candy peppermint note.\r\n\r\ni find it pretty hard to make complex recipes with mints, because it tends to overpower subtle notes. here in this recipe you can't taste too much of the white chocolate, although fw's version is pretty strong and distinct in most situations. It's subtle but definitely there with its sweetness and cacoa butter powder flavor. recipe is still good, not perfect, but decent. for me i could only taste a stronger white choc flavor without peppermint in the recipe. so i guess that would be an option\r\n\r\nFW white choc apparently has sucralose in it and the other conc are also sweet ... so there's not really a need for extra sweetener.
