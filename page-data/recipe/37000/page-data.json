For me this was actually more of a coconut like flavor, and reminded me of the crumb donuts I lived on in high school.  so I decided to try and bring that out more with the coconut extra. I use the sugar cookie and graham cracker to try and get more of the crumb texture.\r\n","steep_days":"5","temperature":"0","recipe_score":4,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:49:12.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"1325","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Zeppola","vendor":"FA","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Sugar Cookie","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Graham Cracker Clear","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":750},{"name":"Coconut Extra","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":500}],"reviews":[{"user":"JustinLFranks","text":"Simple but effective. I get a really \"off\" flavor from TPA Coconut Extra, so made my usual substitution of TPA Coconut Candy at twice the amount (so 1% here). I might try increasing the TPA Graham Cracker Clear to 1-1.25% next time, as I found the crumb flavor to be a bit too far in the background."}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"37000","name":"Crumbs"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
