Shoutout to Chef's and everyone who picked this one up.\r\n\r\nThe original description was: \"Chewy candy with a classic blend of cherry, strawberry, orange, and lemon.  Stellar and explosive.\"  What I couldn't say was that this is a starburst recipe.  But like all the starbursts at once.  Whatever.  It was a good recipe.\r\n\r\nI figured it probably needed some actual development notes, so here goes...\r\n\r\nI had been playing around with the platonic concept of \"the starburst\" for a long ass time. And I thought I was making some headway.  I had originally posted a simplified version of this recipe as BURST.  The key part of the recipe, for me at least, was trying to nail down the texture.  And I feel like we mostly got there.\r\n\r\n**The Base**\r\n\r\nThis base wouldn't have been possible without guidance/wholesale theft.  Kopel originally put me on to the **Vanilla Swirl** as a taffy base idea, and yeah, it works.  Most taffy has a background vanilla, and a vanilla swirl has this weird waxy, thick texture to it. I remember going through revisions and nailing down 2.5% as the amount of vanilla swirl you could add without the maltol in the flavor muting everything to shit. **Marshmallow** is added to further bring up that chewy, waxy texture.  TPA Marshmallow is another flavor that mutes, so .5% is about as high as I could stomach for the integrity of the mix.  The **Greek Yogurt** was ripped off from Steam's appermelon gummy recipe.  I still don't 100% understand why it works, but a touch of FLV Greek Yogurt really does add to the chew of a recipe, and the butyric notes steep out really, really quick.\r\n\r\nThose three flavors together make for a hell of a chewy candy base when slammed up against big, bright fruit flavors.\r\n\r\n**The Fruit**\r\n\r\nA traditional american starburst mix is cherry, strawberry, orange and lemon.  **FW Starburst Type** (or Star Candy or whatever non trademark infringing name they are selling this under this week) has a pretty damn accurate starburst orange and lemon vibe.  I don't get any strawberry or cherry from it, but the citrus parts are bold, bright, and sweet with a pretty intense bite.  The muting properties of the base soak up some of the bite, but I think it still gets the point across.   **TPA Strawberry** isn't the best strawberry for the job here, but it does work.  I needed a big, pink candy strawberry with some softer edges.  **JF Sweet Strawberry** at 3% works better. Maybe use that one if you have it, but the TPA still delivers.\r\n\r\n...AND THE CHERRY.  You can hack together three cherry-ish flavors for something that doesn't taste like gasoline and almost looks like a cherry in the right light.  Or you can just use **TPA Cherry Extract** if you can deal with a weak, candied cherry flavor that isn't garbage. It's weak though! And it has some water in it!  So you'll never get a bold, vibrant cherry out of it, but it works as a complement and that's all I needed here.\r\n\r\nThis only has .5% of FW Sweetener in there.  Feel free to sub in CAP SS.  The recipe works with it.  I think this was from a transitional period before I fully embraced sweetener for candy-type vapes.  If I had to do it all over again I'd probably switch to SS at .5% or FW Sweetener at like 2%.\r\n\r\nSo, this is my best attempt at a normal-ass starburst recipe. I liked it.  Steeping with this recipe is a bit tricky though.  I think it needs at least a week for everything to settle down and thicken.  And I think it gets too muted after 3-4 weeks.  So it's definitely not perfect, but it's the closest I've tasted to a mouthful of classic starbursts.  \r\n\r\n","steep_days":"7","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"total_reviews":1,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:49:52.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"2155","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Starburst Type","vendor":"FW","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Strawberry","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Marshmallow","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Vanilla Swirl","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Sweetener","vendor":"FW","millipercent":500},{"name":"Cherry Extract","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":4250},{"name":"Greek Yogurt","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":250}],"reviews":[{"user":"Frin","score":"5","text":"This thing is flat out Skittles.&#xD;\n10/10 would mix again"}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"84100","name":"Cherry Hills (EJM x Chef's One Shot)"}}}
