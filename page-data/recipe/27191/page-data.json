Between the hops, cactus, and absinthe, this ends up tasting like strawberry-basil.  It's a sweeter recipe, but it manages to avoid pushing that sweetness too far into that herbal backend and ruining the balance.  All in all, really refreshing, interesting, and well-balanced."}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"27191","name":"Aura: Forest"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
