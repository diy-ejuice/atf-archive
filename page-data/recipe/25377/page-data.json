Inspired by Kalamazoo's very own WMU Broncos and their amazing year in the FBS. Kalamazoo is known for its craft brews and Root beer is no exception as I can remember having a hard Rootbeer at a brewery awhile back and it was absolutely delicious. This is pretty good as a shake and vape but really comes together after 3 days. I added the butterscotch ripple and dulche de leche to add some depth to the root beer float. The rest is just part of a Ice cream base i've been working on. Give it ago and let me know if ya like it I know I do and im not really a fan of root beer but its very tasty and a nice break from the norm for me.

This is the most interesting root beer recipe I've seen.  How did it turn out?  Would you technically call it a 'root beer float' recipe given the dulce de leche and butterscotch, or is it something very different?  Nonetheless think I'll have to try it as seems simple and deliciously different."}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"25377","name":"Float the Boat"}}}
