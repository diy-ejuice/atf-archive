Iam not the biggest fan of banana vapes , but this one i can enjoy. The Cream Milky Undertone mutes the Banana Cream down,&#xD;\nthat there is a very good balance between the Milk and the banana. Its good after 7 days, but it really shines at 10days+!&#xD;\nFor me it works better with 2.5% LB Vanilla Ice Cream. Its a little more than TPA VBIC, because its weaker. But this is a personal thing, the recipe is 5 stars, how it is.&#xD;\nThanks for the recipe Mr. G!&#xD;\nPS.&#xD;\nMade a Version where i replaced the GCC with FW Hazelnut at same amount and changed 1% of the VBIC with 1% TPA Vanilla Swirl.&#xD;\nAnd i like that Version more, because its fuuler, and milkier and the Banana taste a little stronger."},{"user":"cxxxxp","text":"Really good recipe Mr G üëç Great use of TPA cheesecake (Graham} and TPA Graham Cracker (Clear) as well as OOO Cream (Milky Undertones) which really brings the milk factor and the other two bring body, sweetnes and light malt to the milk base. I would also be using LB Vanilla Ice Cream as I just prefer it to TPA's version. The banana is nice and sweet, perfect for what you want in a Banana milk, personally I would enjoy the addition of a second more realistic Banana to add dimension but I think you've done a fantastic job on this. There is a wonderful AU juice by Sticky Fingers called Banana Ice Cream that I'd like to replicate and I can see myself building on parts of the foundation you've laid here (keep an eye out) I love a good Banana milk and I have enjoyed this. At 2-3 weeks the banana has settled and the milk is more forward. A nice sweet banana vape. Smells divine too. Thanks for sharing! Keep up the good work!"},{"user":"Skywxp3d","text":"This stuff is so good! Glad I finally tried it, seems so simple but I‚Äôll tell ya, this tastes better than any of those 15 flavor high end recipes, and I‚Äôve tried a ton of em! BOOM! Pass me the Mr - G‚Äôs bro! "},{"user":"goosegirl","text":"This recipe is accurate to the description, and has a more muted flavor than most of the bananas I have tried.  Give this one a try if you are not sure about bananas."},{"user":"bjorama","text":"Of all the delcious juice's  I've made from mixers on this sight, this one is the one my friends grab when they come over.  Do you know how many times Ive heard, \"Man... Mr G is the shit!!\"  or Gimme Mr. G's good shit.."},{"user":"elsignor","text":"Very impressive recipe, usually I can't stand banana  cream this high but in here I can.  I will probably mix an another batch with a more authentic banana like WF banana pur√©e and some cereal 27 (or some cookie) to had some texture. But as it is, it's a tasty and very enjoyable recipe"},{"user":"phried","text":"Great recipe, love how well the banana and creams/milk blend in this. I'm thinking of grabbing some Cereal 27 and turning this into a cereal mix with  sliced bananas."},{"user":"vagdal","text":"Awesome recipe! I'm not really big banana fan but I like this one a lot! Thanks for sharing"},{"user":"KRUCIAL","text":"Man this is delicious, after a 5 day steep the milk note is surprisingly stronger than I thought it would be and the banana is right were it needs to be great job bro !!!!"},{"user":"Exercyst","text":""},{"user":"lococarnage","text":""},{"user":"VapinTrucker","text":"Nice balance of milk and banana.
