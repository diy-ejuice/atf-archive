This came out exactly how I’d hoped. \r\n\r\nThe MB Palm Coconut and FLV Sweet Coconut make a lovely combo. I love CC Devon Cream. I’ve found if you want to use it as a main cream note it’s got to be cranked up a bit. \r\n\r\nI borrowed a couple of elements I really liked from Leche De Coco by hashslingingslashur. TFA CCGC adds to the richness of the cream and adds to the almost grated texture the Palm Coconut has. The FA Fresh Cream stops it being too dark. \r\n\r\nIt’s best after 7 days steep for the richness and thickness of the cream to develop and the coconut to really blend in.
