FA Fuji...way too candyish.\r\n  \r\nFA ObaOba is added because I found it made the FA Watermelon(Red Summer) into a more 'thick' or pulpy-type of taste(similar-but not exactly like a smoothie), if that makes any sense.\r\n  \r\nThis was specifically made for a higher VG percentage, thus the higher percentages than are typically used.\r\n  \r\nYou will find a perfect strawberry-watermelon balance with a slight cotton candy background & odor. No sweetener is needed. Can be vaped as a s&v, but the watermelon pops after one day and the Country Apple settles down a bit.\r\n  \r\nIf you enjoy this recipe as is(substitutions are NOT recommended), please leave a review!\r\n  \r\nEnjoy!\r\n  \r\n**Please do not share this with any other websites. I only post to ATF for my own reasons and hope this is respected. Also, you may NOT reproduce this for commercial sale. \r\n \r\n  \r\n#EJUICEMAKERS for life!\r\n  \r\n","steep_days":"1 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:50:00.000-05:00","best_vg":"75%","views":"2960","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Juicy Strawberry","vendor":"FA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Red Touch (strawberry)","vendor":"FA","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Red Summer (watermelon)","vendor":"FA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Oba Oba","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Pink Champagne","vendor":"FW","millipercent":500},{"name":"Country Apple","vendor":"PUR","millipercent":750}],"reviews":[{"user":"DodgerFog33","text":"Taste good right off the Shake.
