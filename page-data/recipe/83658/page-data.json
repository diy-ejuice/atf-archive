Not to buttery like many others. More of a homemade cookie than the kind you get in a box.  I really enjoy Real Flavors cookies and wanted to make a recipe using one because there are not many on here.  I am not very good at flavor notes so just give it a try.","steep_days":"7","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-06T20:50:31.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"1150","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Acetyl Pyrazine 5%","flavor_id":"1709","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":250},{"name":"Biscuit","flavor_id":"4487","vendor":"JF","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Shortbread Cookie â€“ SC","flavor_id":"7546","vendor":"RF","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Shisha Vanilla","flavor_id":"841","vendor":"INW","millipercent":1000}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"83658","name":"Shortbread Cookie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
