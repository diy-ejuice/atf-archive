My Fruity ADVs just don't have the same effect, so I set out to create a tobacco recipe that encompasses all the notes I use to love in my real tobaccos... Rums, almonds, vanilla, and caramels/butterscotches.\r\n\r\nInstead of trying to mimic that I decided to switch things up a bit and bring said notes to the foreground and leave the tobacco as the accent.\r\n\r\nFW Butterscotch Ripple. This is a sharp, yet rich butterscotch with lovely dark sugar caramel tones that begs to be paired with a tobacco. I wanted this to be the main profile but not overpowering, I paired it up pretty high with the RY4 Double but I knew it had to bump it a bit to make sure it stands out from the crowd.\r\n\r\nRY4 Double: This is my favourite tobacco. it really is just a nice and sweet tobacco with more yummie rich maple and caramel notes to complement the FA Butterscotch and I think at 1.5% it is perfect to ensure that the tobacco is sufficiently present.\r\n\r\nFA Jamaica Special:Rum and maple has always been one of my favorite blends and was almost a natural choice here. it sits in perfect harmony alongside the tobacco.\r\n\r\nTFA Almond: the almond,  may seem high here, but fills out the tobacco beautifully and helps bridge the rum, tobacco and butterscotch with the cream base\r\n\r\nTFA Sweet Cream: Now  the idea here was to pair this with my evening cup of coffee (White and Sweet), so sweet cream seemed like a great way to have my vape compliment my coffee while helping the other flavors stand up to the coffee taste. (i discovered that by chance with a previous tobacco recipe)\r\n\r\nFrench Vanilla: I chose Vanillin initially but it the vanilla was just present throughout the entire vape and with everything going on it was too much. I needed the vanilla to have a place in the recipe. I really have no opinion of which is the best vanilla to use, so I chanced it with this one and it turned good. the vanilla sit light and fluffy on top of the cream and gives all the main flavors the stage and then shines alongside the cream on the tail of the vape.\r\n\r\nVanilla custard: the original recipe just did not have enough body I added vanilla custard purely out of frustration, I started off with 1% but after a two week steep it still did not have the body I was looking for, so I added another 0.5 and the results we great! it really also doesn't feature prominently in the flavor profile, it really is just complimenting the flavors already in the recipe. gives a nice buttery eggy-ness to the sweet cream, bumps the french vanilla in all the right places and almost makes you want to chew your vape before you swallow it. I find it hard to decide if this is distracting from the recipe or not.\r\n\r\nAfter a four week steep, I simply can't put it down and I have compliments from everyone who tried it. I just still think I have too much going in here\r\n\r\n","steep_days":"28","temperature":"0","recipe_score":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-12T17:10:22.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"2404","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Ry4 Double","flavor_id":"379","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Jamaica Special (jamaica Rhum)","flavor_id":"521","vendor":"FA","millipercent":750},{"name":"Almond","flavor_id":"286","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"French Vanilla","flavor_id":"170","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Vanilla Custard","flavor_id":"131","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Sweet Cream","flavor_id":"183","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Butterscotch Ripple","flavor_id":"1217","vendor":"FW","millipercent":4000}],"reviews":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"23984","name":"Testosterone"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
