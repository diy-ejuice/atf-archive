Feel free to go crazy and add whatever you want to it. \r\n\r\nCAP NY Cheesecake is a good cheesecake. It’s more cheese than graham crust. It gets used up around 3% pretty frequently which is too high imo. It gets a weird offensive off note so I don’t usually go higher than 1%. \r\n\r\nTFA Graham Cracker (clear) pairs really well with the NY Cheesecake which is somewhat lacking in the crust department. It’s a medium dark, crunchy graham note that’s just slightly sweet. \r\n\r\nCAP Vanilla Whipped Cream is just a light, fluffy cream with a slight vanilla note. Does well here to fill out the cheesecake and gives the mix a little creamy vanilla. \r\n\r\nI always use CAP Super Sweet a .5% in cheesecakes because I think the citric acid is something that they need but sweetener is optional as always. \r\n\r\nWatch the Video here: \r\nhttps://youtu.be/Zut4sfG3JLY","steep_days":"3","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T17:36:31.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"723","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"New York Cheesecake","flavor_id":"90","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Graham Cracker Clear","flavor_id":"325","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Vanilla Whipped Cream","flavor_id":"1","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1000}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"203894","name":"Cheesecake Base "}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
