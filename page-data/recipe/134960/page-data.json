That is what this is. FLV Blueberry muffin is fantastic. VTA Buttercream is thick and sweet. VTA Sweet cream tones the overwhelmingly sweetness of the buttercream and adds body. Fluffy white cake adds to the density of the FLV muffin and the lemon sicily just adds to the bakery aspect. I like this quite a lot and I don't care for bakery vapes usually.","steep_days":"5","temperature":"0","recipe_score":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-10T19:00:57.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"1473","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Blueberry Muffin","flavor_id":"608","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Fluffy White Cake SC","flavor_id":"9024","vendor":"WF","millipercent":250},{"name":"Italian Lemon Sicily","flavor_id":"78","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":250},{"name":"Sweet Cream","flavor_id":"8979","vendor":"VT","millipercent":250},{"name":"Vanilla Buttercream Frosting","flavor_id":"8990","vendor":"VT","millipercent":250}],"reviews":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"134960","name":"Blueberry Cupcake"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
