I do get the slightest tinge of pepper off of the vcv1 but that's a fault of the flavor and not recipe. Thick and rich as hell. The butter note is off the charts in a good way. Cookie base is solid too. I do recommend the omission of vanilla custard for any of my fellow pepper tasters though. Great work and great mix."},{"user":"Lexiebea_65","score":"5","text":"I love this so much.Hot water bath and thats it. Making a larger bottle now. I did sub FA Butter for the TPA butter because that is all I had. Nice work"},{"user":"DodgerFog33","score":"4","text":"This is a very solid flavor. Really enjoy it. Love how the coookies work so well together. Plus in my book you can never go wrong with Caps Custard as it's my favorite. Definetely this is a solid nice sugar cookie. I'm grouping to give this a 4 .25/5 . "},{"user":"MrColdOne","score":"5","text":"I love sugar cookie! And like a more pronounced cookie so 1% FA Cookie with the 6% sugar cookie worked really well here! I really liked this as a shake and vape! Great job. Can't wait to see what you put out in the future. "}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"40981","name":"Buttery Sugar Cookie "}}}
