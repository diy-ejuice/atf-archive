It is really quite tasty with FLV Pumpkin Spice and HS Pumpkin Pie. The Flv Sweet Dough and VT Butter Toffee mixed with the FLV Pound Cake add a yummy creamy base for the pumpkin. Topping the cake and mixed in is the VT Vanilla Buttercream Frosting. \r\nDelicious!!!","steep_days":"5","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-11-25T21:32:00.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"1124","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Pumpkin Pie","flavor_id":"5896","vendor":"HS","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Pumpkin Spice","flavor_id":"4436","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":500},{"name":"Sweet Dough","flavor_id":"4406","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":500},{"name":"Pound Cake","flavor_id":"4306","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Dessicated Coconut","flavor_id":"9362","vendor":"VT","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Vanilla Buttercream Frosting","flavor_id":"8990","vendor":"VT","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Butter Toffee Base","flavor_id":"8844","vendor":"VT","millipercent":1000}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"124901","name":"Earthquake "}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
