This is not heavy on chocolate flavoring.. it's mixed in softly with the cream/custard base.\r\n\r\nI do not recommend breathing, heating, frothing, etc. for any of my recipes. Just shake it up and put it away for a few days.\r\n\r\nThis recipe is best enjoyed at lower wattages with restricted airflow. Lastly, make sure you vape this on a fresh atty or new cotton for optimal taste.","steep_days":"10","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"updated_at":"2020-12-12T20:28:52.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"1379","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"French Vanilla","flavor_id":"56","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Graham Cracker","flavor_id":"62","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":500},{"name":"Horchata","flavor_id":"74","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Hot Cocoa","flavor_id":"76","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":5500},{"name":"New York Cheesecake","flavor_id":"90","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Sugar Cookie","flavor_id":"115","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":500},{"name":"Sweet Cream","flavor_id":"117","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Vanilla Custard","flavor_id":"131","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":4000}],"reviews":[{"user":"RuntDastardly","text":"This is one of my favorite recipes of all time. Very definitely a spicy cocoa, that CAP Horchata and Hot Cocoa taste like they were made to go together. Even if you don't like chocolate vapes, you owe it to yourself to mix this up. So rich and warm and satisfying. Utter perfection after a month's steep. ","score":5}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"29907","name":"Fireside Cocoa"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
