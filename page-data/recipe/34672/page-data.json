Once I entered the DIY realm I had my chance. This is a cool vape for after you've eaten a meal or brushed your teeth. I always have this on hand ready to be dripped. No steep necessary, but I like to let it sit for a day or two. Great on a series box. :)","steep_days":"5 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-10T15:59:55.000-05:00","best_vg":"75%","views":"1889","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Ripe Banana","flavor_id":"269","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":6000},{"name":"Sweet Cream","flavor_id":"183","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Mint","flavor_id":"683","vendor":"INW","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Menthol (liquid)","flavor_id":"1353","vendor":"FW","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Super Sweet","flavor_id":"2384","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":200}],"reviews":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"34672","name":"Menthol Banana"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
