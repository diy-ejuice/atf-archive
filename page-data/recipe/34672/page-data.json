Once I entered the DIY realm I had my chance. This is a cool vape for after you've eaten a meal or brushed your teeth. I always have this on hand ready to be dripped. No steep necessary, but I like to let it sit for a day or two. Great on a series box. :)","steep_days":"5 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"total_reviews":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T20:31:56.000-05:00","best_vg":"75%","views":"1881","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Ripe Banana","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":6000},{"name":"Sweet Cream","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Mint","vendor":"INW","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Menthol (liquid)","vendor":"FW","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Super Sweet","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":200}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"34672","name":"Menthol Banana"}}}
