Nice and acidic, crisp even, but with all the sweet guava blasting my taste buds I can't really pick anything else out. It doesn't taste bad, it's just... very bold, not exactly my type of mix. I did not try with TFA VBIC  + FA Cream Fresh, maybe thats the key. &#xD;\nThanks for sharing."}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"20484","name":"Sweet Guava Goodness"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
