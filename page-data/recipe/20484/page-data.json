Can easily be an ADV. Juicy guava with some banana and strawberry to back it up. Use Vurve's Smoothie base\r\n\r\n\r\nVBIC: 1.5%\r\n\r\n\r\nFA Fresh Cream: .5%\r\n\r\nto make it into a smoothie!\r\n\r\nOr replace the banana with .5% FA Mango and 2% CAP Sweet Mango for some delicious mango goodness.","steep_days":"2 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":3,"updated_at":"2020-12-12T02:44:21.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"3650","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Sweet Guava","flavor_id":"118","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":8000},{"name":"Banana Cream","flavor_id":"916","vendor":"LA","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Strawberry (ripe)","flavor_id":"271","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Shisha Strawberry","flavor_id":"1711","vendor":"INW","millipercent":2500}],"reviews":[{"user":"rugshuds","text":"I mixed 10mL of this and vaped it single coil, 450f-500f.&#xD;\nI actually had really  high hopes for this, I love sweet guava at 4% but had never experienced it any higher. Nice and acidic, crisp even, but with all the sweet guava blasting my taste buds I can't really pick anything else out. It doesn't taste bad, it's just... very bold, not exactly my type of mix. I did not try with TFA VBIC  + FA Cream Fresh, maybe thats the key. &#xD;\nThanks for sharing.","score":3}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"20484","name":"Sweet Guava Goodness"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
