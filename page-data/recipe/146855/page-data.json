There is a need for a sweet creamy base which where FLV cream comes into play for the creaminess, but to water it down a bit and add more sugar FLV Milk & honey was introduced.  Combine this with the sweet rice and you have that silky rice with a touch a touch of pistachio cream topped with toasted almonds.  The pistachios play really nicely with the almond.

This has no doubt suffered from the really long steep it got before I got around to trying it, with the way that Sweet Rice fades, bit it is still a little ricey, maybe just ricey enough. It looks like a lot of the cardamom has drifted off, too, and I didn't know cardamom did that. But I do get a hint of it, and it's pleasant. What I'm mostly getting here is a darkly sweet, rich, creamy base with roasted nutty top notes. It doesn't really taste like ice cream topped with honey-roasted peanuts - the base has some rice and isn't exactly ice cream, nuts are almondy and not peanutty, there's that hint of cardamom spice, and the dark sweet stuff isn't quite honey - the way it all comes together reminds me of ice cream topped with honey-roasted peanuts. I think if like the idea of ice cream topped with honey-roasted peanuts, you'd like this. It's yummy. I love it. Don't really know how to make it \"better.\" But, adding some of that VT Rice Base might help the rice stick around better/longer. The Cardamom is probably supposed to taste stronger, but I wouldn't recommend increasing it to make this stand up to a steep. It's detectable and delightful right were it is."},{"user":"kitu5","score":"5","text":"Very rich and creamy. The toasted almond is blatant and delicious. Took a look at the ingredients, and WOW. I did not know I liked pistachio. That would be the other nuttiness I couldn't place. The dab o honey from milk and honey is a great touch.&#xD;\n&#xD;\nGave the rest of my sample to a friend who can't vape hardly anything but killed  1/4 of my tank in a 10 minute break. Very smooth. Winner here."},{"user":"shyndo","score":"5","text":"I absolutely adore this. my only slight criticism is I think wf pistachio cream kinda tastes more like an almond flavor than a pistachio flavor but it doesn't matter too much because of how much authenticity the cardamom adds. milk and honey makes it taste cooked and borderline caramelized and the rice is the perfect amount to not fade into oblivion. I'm left with a delicious bite of nutty slightly spiced rice pudding with a warm sweet caramelized finish. Absolutely delicious."}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"146855","name":"I Kheer U"}}}
