It's pretty well balanced but you get a lot of the lime up front and the lemon sticks around through the exhale. It's sweet, not sour or bitter and has a good amount of body. \r\n\r\nI've added FA Marshmallow to round out the edges and give the profile a nice creamy head. \r\n\r\nCAP Hibiscus is sticky and sweet. It's not a main note here but it does help everything around adding to the authenticity. \r\n\r\nVTA Persian Lime is the star of this show. It is a zesty natural lime that sticks around through the steep. Very Good. \r\n\r\nSome sweetener is essential for this recipe. I use CAP Super Sweet at 0.5% and I think this is a minimum. \r\n\r\nWatch the Video Here:\r\nhttps://youtu.be/4V6orBaLnEw","steep_days":"2","temperature":"0","recipe_score":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-11T22:45:32.000-05:00","best_vg":"80%","views":"362","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Persian Lime","flavor_id":"8942","vendor":"VT","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Lemon Lime","flavor_id":"83","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":5000},{"name":"Hibiscus","flavor_id":"72","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Marshmallow","flavor_id":"473","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Super Sweet","flavor_id":"2384","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":500}],"reviews":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"201380","name":"Avant Limeade"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
