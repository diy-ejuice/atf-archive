Vanilla-forward tobacco.\r\n  \r\n**NOTES:**\r\n  \r\nI've always been a sucker for a good NET and Stixx Mixx makes the best! I use SM Havana Prime here at 5%. TFA Red Oak is added to give it a nice woody kick and a hint of smokiness. FW Butterscotch Natural lends a nice contrast at its' position in the recipe. The butterscotch isn't meant to be in your face in this recipe--it's just there to complement the tobacco.\r\n  \r\nThe vanilla/creamy part of this was formed with LA Cream Cheese Icing(which you can actually drop to 2% if it's too much for your liking), Vanilla Swirl, and a smidgen of CAP Vanilla Custard. \r\n  \r\nFW Hazelnut of course, provides dairy creaminess and a touch of nuttiness that this recipe needed.\r\n\r\n**Good as a SNV, but surely begins to pop the longer it will sit.**\r\n  \r\n**60/40 ratio recommended**\r\n\r\n **Do not take it upon yourself to copy and publish this recipe over to ELR. THIS ACTION IS STRICTLY FORBIDDEN.** \r\nRespect mixers, they are not your ticket to success...They are your friends.\r\n\r\n#EJUICEMAKERS","steep_days":"3 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"total_reviews":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T17:34:05.000-05:00","best_vg":"60%","views":"5795","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Cream Cheese Icing","vendor":"LA","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Vanilla Swirl","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Vanilla Custard","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Havana Primed","vendor":"SM","millipercent":5000},{"name":"Butterscotch (natural)","vendor":"FW","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Hazelnut","vendor":"FW","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Red Oak","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":150}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"47803","name":"Vanilla Tobacco"}}}
