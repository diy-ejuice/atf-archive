The rainbow sherbet I used to create the bright fruit flavor mix  - along with the fizzy sherbet which helps that flavor to really brighten and pop . The hard candy is not really needed here but does add that slight sense of the hard candy shell if kept a a very low %.  If you want that extra pop of sweetness  then add sweetner but it is pretty sweet with the cotton candy ","steep_days":"3","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-06T20:43:50.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"1858","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"27 Bears","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Cotton Candy (circus)","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Fizzy Sherbet","vendor":"VT","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Hard Candy","vendor":"FW","millipercent":500},{"name":"Marshmallow (Vanilla)","vendor":"OOO","millipercent":500},{"name":"Rainbow Sherbert","vendor":"LB","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Super Sweet","vendor":"PUR","millipercent":300}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"93881","name":"Tutti Frutti Jelly  Bean  "}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
