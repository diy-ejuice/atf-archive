The rainbow sherbet I used to create the bright fruit flavor mix  - along with the fizzy sherbet which helps that flavor to really brighten and pop . The hard candy is not really needed here but does add that slight sense of the hard candy shell if kept a a very low %.  If you want that extra pop of sweetness  then add sweetner but it is pretty sweet with the cotton candy ","steep_days":"3","temperature":"0","recipe_score":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-10T17:57:24.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"1866","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"27 Bears","flavor_id":"8735","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Cotton Candy (circus)","flavor_id":"318","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Fizzy Sherbet","flavor_id":"8878","vendor":"VT","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Hard Candy","flavor_id":"1308","vendor":"FW","millipercent":500},{"name":"Marshmallow (Vanilla)","flavor_id":"1798","vendor":"OOO","millipercent":500},{"name":"Rainbow Sherbert","flavor_id":"1501","vendor":"LB","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Super Sweet","flavor_id":"7787","vendor":"PUR","millipercent":300}],"reviews":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"93881","name":"Tutti Frutti Jelly  Bean  "}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
