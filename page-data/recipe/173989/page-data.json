I really love the cobbler layer of both LB Cranberry Cobbler and FW Wild Berry Cobbler and the cranberry gives this dessert a little tartness which is really nice paired with the sweet currant of Capella. I used Devon Cream from cupcake world because it is a decadent and rich custard that is a perfect flavor for the only main note of a custard. I hope you enjoy!\r\n\r\n*add sweetener to your liking","steep_days":"5","temperature":"0","recipe_score":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-12T06:59:48.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"934","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Cranberry Cobbler","flavor_id":"9130","vendor":"LB","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Devon Cream","flavor_id":"4223","vendor":"CC","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Sweet Currant","flavor_id":"10171","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Wild Berry Cobbler ala Mode","flavor_id":"8499","vendor":"FW","millipercent":3000}],"reviews":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"173989","name":"mlNikon Berry Cobbler Custard"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
