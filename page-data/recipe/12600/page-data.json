Didn't even bother changing it.\r\n\r\nFruit Loops.  Pretty simple.. \r\nFW Fruit Rings:  The fruit loops base.  The lemon taste is better in FW version than the lemon pledge of TFA.\r\nFA Cream Fresh + FA Almond + TFA Bavarian Cream:  The milk.  Cream Fresh provides a nice milk tone without being overly sweet.  The bavarian cream builds a little sweetness and the almond provides an extra flavor to the milk.  Without the almond, the milk flavor tastes a bit flat.\r\nTFA Brown Sugar: Just added at such a small amount to accent the Fruit Rings.  Adding a small piece of complexity to the Fruit Rings.","steep_days":"0","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T10:43:04.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"1133","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Fruit Rings","vendor":"FW","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Cream Fresh","vendor":"FA","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Brown Sugar","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":250},{"name":"Almond","vendor":"FA","millipercent":250},{"name":"Bavarian Cream","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2000}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"12600","name":"Sugary Whips"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
