I just found this recipe about 4 weeks ago and let it steep - love this. One of the top three custard recipes ever... so good"},{"user":"ronc","text":"One of my favorite recipes on ATF! Definitely worthy of all these high reviews. Just an outstanding 3 flavor mix. Must start mass producing this now!"},{"user":"Spycke","text":"Couldn't wait mire than 7 days. Allready full of taste, I wonder how it tastes after 7 more days :)"},{"user":"rx1142","text":"Amazing! Definitely needs the steep. Gets better as it sets. One of my go to custards now. Flavor is outstanding!"},{"user":"bjorama","text":"Damn tasty.   It's not my favorite custard but it's in the rotation."},{"user":"ancient7","text":""},{"user":"RuntDastardly","text":"I know I bought FW Butterscotch Ripple for a specific recipe, but by the time my order came in I had forgotten which one and it sat unused until now. This is a damn tasty recipe, though I really don't get much almond from it. That said, I mixed it up as posted, am enjoying it immensely, and I'm looking forward to mixing it again with that suggested 1.5% FW Yellow Cake added in. So far it hits all those notes I look for in a decadent, cuddly custard while staying very low in total flavor percentages. Great stuff!"},{"user":"nowar","text":"I find I am on the fence about Butterscotch Ripple and I like it in this recipe. I think the almond does get lost a bit in the mix but this is a great base to add some pastry. I might like to try this with the yellow cake next time. and there will be a next time."},{"user":"chief63","text":"One of the complaints on ATF is the lack of reviews so I'm going back and commenting a few recipes I've made more than a few times and this is one of them.  This is an excellent Custard and one of my several keepers in this crowded and popular category.  Easy ADV.  "},{"user":"SatJoe563","text":"6-24-18. Tasted off the mix, and I may need to change my cotton.  I like the Ripple flavor.  Gonna let it steep a bit and try again, I have been having trouble getting flavor on my wasp at 50w.    I may add a drop or two of sweetner, but will comment again.  Thanks for the recipe."},{"user":"gengstah","text":"I can't help myself from trying this at only 3 days of steeping and I can tell you this is a very delicious and amazing vape. I can taste the butterscotch throughout the vape. If Notcharlesmanson said this recipe \"after two weeks is magical\", then it will only get better!"},{"user":"kindground","text":"Sticky, decadent, rich vanilla custard. This is not a light custard, it a very bold one with that much Butterscotch. I lost the Almond in the steep, but a half percent of INW Marzipan helped that issue. "},{"user":"FizzChaser","text":"G'Damn this is good! I will make sure to always have some steeping. Awesome recipe Krucial!"},{"user":"kitu5","text":"I'll be the first to admit, not the biggest custard fan in the world. Nor of almond, really. But I am an ADDICT when it comes to butterscotch, and since a very highly rated review...as soon as I saw I had the ingredients, had to throw it together.&#xD;\n&#xD;\nAnd I'm very glad I did.&#xD;\n&#xD;\nThis is a rich, decadent custard. Smooth, filling mouthfeel to the point where I had to double check a few time to make sure I was just vaping. The nuttiness surrounding the sweet eggy vanilla...sinful. And the rich as hell butterscotch (with the rum notes of the ripple adding a dark sweetness)...it's like someone took the butter rum life saver and figured out how to turn that into a custard, then top it with finely chopped almond.&#xD;\n&#xD;\nThe fact it's this damned good with three ingredients?&#xD;\n&#xD;\nHoly freakin Hannah, this stuff is GREAT.&#xD;\n&#xD;\nThis vape is for: butterscotch lovers, custard junkies, desert lovers, people who like creamy or rich desserts, and, most importantly, people who are burnt out on or don't like custard. This flavor changed my mind on the issue of custards. Guess it's what I get for all my previous experience with custards being store bought, neh? ADV, no doubts or discussions."},{"user":"RdaJunkie","text":"I had become bored of custards until I tried this one. All I can say is damn this shit is good "},{"user":"mlNikon","text":"Very Tasty mix bud! its very rich and decadent. I love seeing good simple recipes like this, they are always so vibrant. Good job."},{"user":"Gonzilla","text":"Mixed up with and without fructose cake, let them steep for a good month and both are fucking delicious. Got a 100ml of the standard version steeping now. If you like custards you'll love this. Butterscotch banger!"},{"user":"wh1skeyk1ng","text":"I found this a bit underwhelming until it got through the 2nd week of steeping, but after that it was definitely a solid and satisfying vape.  Really a great simple and tasty 3 ingredient recipe!"},{"user":"Basq","text":"Holy shit! TY."},{"user":"HerrHut","text":"Mixed with yellow cake. Tested as SNV and it's fucking delicious. Hope there is something left to test after 7 days. Thanks!"},{"user":"111111jack","text":"This is a great recipe. Only use 3 flavorsã€‚Taste very good"},{"user":"cincinnatiking","text":"I am a beginner mixer. I have followed every top rated custard recipe. This is has been my favorite! I like it with and without the yellow cake. Excellent recipe!    Update- After a one month steep I prefer it with the yellow cake. I really enjoy this in something like a kayfun. I think it brings out every note."},{"user":"VaperKitten","text":"OMG YUMMMY, I couldn't help it I tried it two hours after mixing and it is good.  Now I will let it steep and get back to you but as of now it is a 5 star, I can imagine it will only get better."},{"user":"SamKayla","text":"Great three flavor recipe !! "},{"user":"Tootall","text":"my favorite recipe using only 3 flavors this is a great recipe."},{"user":"SteamOn","text":"Very smooth and flavorful for such a simple formula. Love it man, Great job! 7 days on the spot it's delicious."},{"user":"Dalpho","text":"First off I would like to say this is amazing. This is such a smooth vape and I love the mouth feel. I am a huge custard fan and I will be adding this to my rotation for sure. I'll definitely use this as a base to add some tobaccos to it as well. Great juice. "},{"user":"zwermp","text":"This is great... super delicious."},{"user":"Crazyndalazdayz","text":"I'm really liking this after a week, we'll see if the next one makes it to 2."},{"user":"TotallyLilt","text":"Delicious, can't stop vaping this."},{"user":"KenWhitfield","text":"This very simple and basic recipe blows my mind. OUT.STAND.ING!"},{"user":"Thadentman","text":"If the final round was based on the final recipes it would be very difficult to judge yours vs Goldbones. Best butterscotch vape I've had to date!"}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"12870","name":"Butter Almond Custard "}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
