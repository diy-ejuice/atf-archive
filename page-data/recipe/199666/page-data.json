It’s a bit like pouring lime soda on a cheesecake rather than a slice of lime, but the alternatives might well have been a worse result. FLV Lime Wedge would have been perfect if it weren’t so damned fadey.  &#xD;\n&#xD;\nAll the elements are there, the thick, slightly tangy cheesecake, a little crust, the fruits esp the fresh strawberry. It’s a recipe that works. &#xD;\n"}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"199666","name":"MlNikon's stb lime cheesecake"}}}
