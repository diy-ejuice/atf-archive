I am not a fan of Chai tea but I actually enjoyed this. Capellas version of Chai tea is very good. Then with the raspberry thrown in it makes a quite pleasant vape. I would imagine you could sub the raspberry for other fruits and it would be good as well. No aging needed with this one. So feel free to mix it up, I would like to hear some feedback. Hope you enjoy it as much as the person I made it for does!","steep_days":"1 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"total_reviews":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T17:34:20.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"1202","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Chai Tea","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Raspberry","vendor":"INW","millipercent":500},{"name":"Raspberry (sweet)","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":5000}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"62572","name":"Raspberry Chai Tea"}}}
