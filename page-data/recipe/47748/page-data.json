A nice, creamy peanut butter ice cream, topped with marshmallow with hints of lavender. The anise is very subtle after a good steep, it plays well and accents the lavender quite well. The lemon I put in there to help the lavender drop the \"green\" note I was getting from it. The anise and lemon together seemed to just left a nice lavender aroma without the vegetation taste. The marshmallow comes out nice and thick on the exhale mixing with the lavender a little. Very pleasing flavor.\r\n\r\nPlease let this sit at least 5 days. This is NOT a shake and vape. The anise is WAY to overpowering until it mellows out, it will be all you taste. After a week you can see where the flavors are going and it is a nice vape experience, which is why I put the 7 day steep time. Personally, I'm a long steep time person and very much enjoyed it at about 1 month. It didn't seem to change much after that.

I had no idea TFA Peanut Butter could be made to taste so smooth and creamy after a steep. It loves to just dry out and turn to mud. Not so here; where it's peanut butter ice cream all day. Topping this delightfulness with lavender-infused marshmallow seems like a strange choice, but it works, very well. I was scared of the anise too - I hate the actual taste of it - but here it just seems to modify the lavender, which is comes across as just a floral hint, not as laundry soap or even full-on flowers but more of an exotic spice, and helps to make 2% TFA Marshmallow actually taste and feel like a marshmallow topping, which is an accomplishment.. It's a shame that all these \"scary\" ingredients will probably prevent all but a few brave souls from trying it. Those who pass it by are missing out on something amazing.
