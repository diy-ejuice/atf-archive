She used TFA honeydew, I quite like JF honeydew however. It's smoother and doesn't melt plastic. \r\n\r\nThe half point of Flv cantaloupe rounds the body of the Melon and takes a bit of the tang away from it. \r\n\r\nCap lime fits into the candy/drink profile I was shooting for with this remix.  It adds a nice layer of sweet and acid missing from the original mix. \r\nThe EM is really to blenderize the mix together and round any harsh spots. \r\n\r\nToo much flavor was lost with mts vape wizard to be viable here imo.  \r\n\r\nAll together, this is a satisfying near summery vape with a lot of flavor and complementery flavors..","steep_days":"5","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-05T06:46:50.000-05:00","best_vg":"100%","views":"1541","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Cantaloupe","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Cantaloupe","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":500},{"name":"Erythritol Solution (5%)","vendor":"NN","millipercent":3500},{"name":"Ethyl Maltol","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Honeydew Melon","vendor":"JF","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Lime","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Mango","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":5000},{"name":"Papaya","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":4000}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"25349","name":"Chanology"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
