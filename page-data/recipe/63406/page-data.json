This is one half of the heart of the recipe (The other being LB Vanilla Ice Cream). Basically this is a bare bones cobbler with notes of blackberry and raspberry. In my opinion it lacks alot of body and fullness, which makes it a great flavoring to build upon.\r\n\r\n\r\nLB Vanilla Ice Cream - Most ice cream flavors either taste like the real deal or a basic cream to me. This one tastes like the ice cream as melted slightly and gives more of a milk/dairy note. With VWC added, this makes a layer that is my go to for bakery creams. \r\n\r\n\r\nCAP Vanilla Whipped Cream - I went with this flavors mostly because it adds a subtle cream note, not that dissimilar to actual whipped cream, but also to give the recipe more thickness overall. It is a bakery after all, and bakery flavors should be thick tasting to reflect that. \r\n\r\n\r\nTFA Raspberry (sweet) - This bring the fruit notes more forward, since Wild Berry Cobbler's Fruit notes tend to fall off after a few days.\r\n\r\n\r\nFW Pie Crust - Acts similarly to how I used TFA Rasberry, however the bread notes dont fall as much as they get over powered by the creams. I find this flavoring prevents that. \r\n\r\n\r\nSuper Sweet is Optional, or you can sub for your preferred sweetener.\r\n\r\nTested with: Hadaly .25 ohm 22g kanthal, 42w, Smoant Charon.\r\nBest vaped warm, not hot, tight air.","steep_days":"3","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T20:32:13.000-05:00","best_vg":"60%","views":"1306","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Wild Berry Cobbler ala Mode","vendor":"FW","millipercent":3500},{"name":"Vanilla Ice Cream","vendor":"LB","millipercent":3500},{"name":"Vanilla Whipped Cream","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Pie Crust","vendor":"FW","millipercent":500},{"name":"Raspberry (sweet)","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Super Sweet","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":500}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"63406","name":"Berry Cobbler Ice Cream Situation Thing"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
