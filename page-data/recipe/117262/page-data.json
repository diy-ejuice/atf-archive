Thanks to the awesome box I happen to have one clove flavor. After a little single flavor testing I came up with this.\r\n\r\nMost of the ingredients here are tried-and-true favorites, so the notes on this one are going to be pretty quick.\r\n\r\nINW biscuit - a dry buttery cookie flavor with a light coconut flavor. If you don't already have it you should. jungle flavors biscuit is an acceptable substitution Some people prefer JF I'm not one of them.\r\n\r\nTPA butter - near and dear to my heart, it taste like butter.\r\n\r\nDL clove - I played around with a few tobacco's I'm not the best at describing them but here we go. A sharp ashy clove tobacco flavor with earthy Woody undertones. Reminds me of pumpkin spice as a shake and vape, the clove is very strong and spicy. As with most of the delosi flavors, it fades pretty quickly, after 3 days it was no longer overpowering and started to fit into the profile nicely. After a week it's perfect.\r\n\r\nFA cookie - a great single flavor cookie, a little on the dry side. The list of suitable substitutions here, is almost endless. Just to name a few jungle flavors, real flavors super concentrate, and cap sugar cookie. That said this is a staple flavoring and and should definitely be in Your Arsenal.\r\n\r\nJF dulce de leche - another one of my favorites, this flavor is super dense, Smooth, rich, and creamy, with caramel, and brown sugar undertones. As a shake and vape tends to comes off very brown sugar, as with most good things it needs time. Here is a full review if you're interested.\r\n\r\nhttps://www.reddit.com/comments/5p092a\r\n\r\nFLV vanilla bean - This is one of my favorite vanilla flavorings, is dead on vanilla bean!! Hats off to the folks at FLV they knock this one out of the park.\r\n\r\nA pretty simple cookie recipe with an amazing room note!!!! I'm not kidding this stuff smells fantastic.\r\n","steep_days":"14 (SNV)","temperature":"420","recipe_score":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-12T10:15:27.000-05:00","best_vg":"69%","views":"1547","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Clove","flavor_id":"6187","vendor":"DF","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Cookie","flavor_id":"490","vendor":"FA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Biscuit","flavor_id":"642","vendor":"INW","millipercent":500},{"name":"Butter","flavor_id":"147","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":250},{"name":"Dulce De Leche","flavor_id":"4575","vendor":"JF","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Vanilla Bean","flavor_id":"8573","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":2000}],"reviews":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"117262","name":"Cookie baco "}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
