From what I saw this is something many Aussies enjoy, so I figured with the theme of Fresh's show, this is what I would try. This is a great full flavor red apple, like biting into a fresh red one. The caramel/butterscotch blend gives a deeper caramel taste, its \"slightly high\" but the apple muscles to the top. Rose is a little high, but needs to be there due to blending from the apple and the pear. You can drop it and get an amazing caramel apple as well.
