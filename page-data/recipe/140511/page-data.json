I saw TFA Cherry Blossom and wanted to see how to work that ingredient in a recipe for a nice, sweet floral note.  I feel it plays well with the other ingredients.  \r\n\r\nThe overall profile initially has an interesting smoky fruit/floral note on the inhale, the exhale focuses more on the citrusy side with more focus coming through on the WF Starfruit. FA Fuji. and CAP Kiwi.  FA Mandarin helps bring a citrus note to the overall profile and FA Lychee adds more of a little juicy mouth-feel imo.  Off the bat, it may be a little harsh on the throat, but after a day or two, it really mellows out.  \r\n\r\nHope you guys enjoy and comments would be appreciated!","steep_days":"2 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"total_reviews":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-06T08:37:42.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"1062","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Kiwi","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Tanger (mandarin)","vendor":"FA","millipercent":750},{"name":"Fuji","vendor":"FA","millipercent":750},{"name":"Cherry Blossom (pg)","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Starfruit SC","vendor":"WF","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Lychee","vendor":"FA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Super Sweet","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1000}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"140511","name":"Sempai"}}}
