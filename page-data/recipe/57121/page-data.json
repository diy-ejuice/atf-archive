It is a full, juicy, fresh orange with ZERO artificial notes. This is straight up orange juice without the acidic notes or annoyingly sweetness present in most orange concentrates. There is a fabulous zesty back note which emphasizes the authenticity perfectly.\r\nBest of all, this baby does not fade - ever! \r\n\r\nThe cream provides a bit of body and mouthfeel to avoid the 'linearness' often present in simple fruit vapes.\r\n\r\nA dash of WS23 provides just the right amount ice to make this one a winner!!\r\n\r\n3 days rest and she's ready to go!!!\r\n\r\n","steep_days":"3 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"total_reviews":1,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:49:30.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"3213","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Shisha Orange","vendor":"INW","millipercent":2000},{"name":"WS-23","vendor":"OTHR","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Cream Fresh","vendor":"FA","millipercent":500}],"reviews":[{"user":"Deetzz","score":"5","text":"INW Shisha Orange has become one of my Favorite concentrates since you posted this recipe.
