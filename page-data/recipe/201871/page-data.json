Dark and Rich.....Simple yet eloquent.......\r\n\r\nThis is my take on a simple Chocolate Custard. The VT Chocolate Custard is the star of the show. By itself the VT Chocolate Custard is a great single mix flavor but I wanted to add a little more depth to it. At 5%, it seems to be the sweet spot. I added some VT Pudding Base to give it more depth, body and creaminess. The FA Meringue is used as the pie'ce de re'sistance. It blends all the flavors together.
