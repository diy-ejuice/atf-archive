Every layer has a different seasoning/spice/texture. This mix is awesome. The Cranberry/Fig flavored granola topped with the thicker texture and tangier flavor from Greek Yogurt. Sweetened with Honey Bee, this granola is so good, I plan on making another batch of it tonight.","steep_days":"14","temperature":"0","recipe_score":4,"updated_at":"2020-12-12T10:34:22.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"2423","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Cranberry","flavor_id":"2493","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Crunch Cereal","flavor_id":"602","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Granola","flavor_id":"8555","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":750},{"name":"Greek Yogurt","flavor_id":"615","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Sweet Cream","flavor_id":"4402","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Honey Bee","flavor_id":"2149","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":100},{"name":"Sweet Fig","flavor_id":"4410","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":500}],"reviews":[{"user":"SlashaLO","text":"Very tasty mix. I love FLV granola, possibly to a fault. It's such a good flavor. The crunch cereal adds a little something to granola to give it a taste and texture. The fig/cranberry combo is very very good. I enjoy Sweet Fig quite a bit. It's a very noticeable flavor in this to me, but in a good way. I would have to say, if there was one criticism, its not \"yogurt\" enough to me. I didn't get any kind of tang or anything like that from this, the mix just seemed to have a creamy texture, and if that is what you were going for then it was spot on. To me, if you were looking for a slightly tangier yogurt, for me it missed the mark, but still a very good mix. I enjoyed this quite a bit.
