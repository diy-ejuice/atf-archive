This was modeled after \"red\" Swedish Fish.\r\n\r\nTPA Swedish Gummy: This flavor can be an outright pain in the ass. It's very accurate to it's name, but it carries a vicious throat hit if you use it much higher than 1.5-2% At 2% in this mix it started imparting some unwanted harshness, so I dialed it back to 1.5% in the final recipe to help keep things smooth, while still imparting some sweet gummy flavor.\r\n\r\nCAP Jelly Candy: A bit of a sleeper flavor, you don't taste this very much in the mix. It's intended purpose is to lend some body to the Swedish Gummy, which I think it does well. Standalone this flavor is very similar to the inside part of a jelly bean.\r\n\r\nTPA Watermelon Candy: A bit of a weaker watermelon flavor, this helps keep the strawberry balanced from it's usual syrupy self, while still contributing to the overall sweet \"red\" flavor of the swedish fish. \r\n\r\nTFA Sweetener: What's a little candy with some sugar, eh? Earlier versions included more, or less sweetener. At 1% it started  overpowering the flavor a bit, but at .5% it just wasn't quite there so I landed at .75% to try to catch the best balance between sweet candy and gross syrup.","steep_days":"0","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"updated_at":"2020-12-12T20:28:51.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"2248","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Swedish Gummy","flavor_id":"337","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Watermelon Candy","flavor_id":"275","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":6500},{"name":"Strawberry","flavor_id":"272","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":4500},{"name":"Jelly Candy","flavor_id":"2170","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":3500},{"name":"Sweetener","flavor_id":"339","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":750}],"reviews":[{"user":"Rdubu","text":"This is a great mix.
