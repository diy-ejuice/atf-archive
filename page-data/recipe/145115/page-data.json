I wanted to try my hand at something my family has loved since childhood. It turned out pretty good. The aftertaste is what seals this as a good rum ball. After the exhale you are left with the great flavor of thick dense chocolate cake and rum with just a hint of powdered sugar. That might be able to go up a little more. I'm going to keep working on this, though, so look for updates in the coming weeks. \r\n\r\nI hope someone that loves these little delicacies gives it a shot and leaves some thoughts. \r\n\r\nThanks go to all the great people over on the DIY_Ejuice group over on discord for holding my hand at the beginning of my journey into DIY. You guys are the best.","steep_days":"7 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"total_reviews":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-02T10:29:27.000-05:00","best_vg":"60%","views":"921","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Lava Cake","vendor":"LB","millipercent":6000},{"name":"Sweet Cream","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1250},{"name":"Powdered Sugar","vendor":"OOO","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Butter Rum","vendor":"LA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Butter Rum","vendor":"FW","millipercent":1750},{"name":"Sweet Coconut","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1250},{"name":"Australian Chocolate","vendor":"HS","millipercent":1500}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"145115","name":"Rum Balls v1"}}}
