I used them in this recipe but you can leave them out.\r\n\r\nEnjoy this refreshing combination.\r\n\r\nSteep: needs 5 days","steep_days":"5","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T02:16:28.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"2192","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Russian Vodka","flavor_id":"8957","vendor":"VT","millipercent":3750},{"name":"Juicy Strawberry","flavor_id":"8779","vendor":"FA","millipercent":2250},{"name":"Basil","flavor_id":"4387","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":500},{"name":"Alpine Strawberry","flavor_id":"4360","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":500},{"name":"Super Sweet","flavor_id":"2384","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":150},{"name":"WS-23","flavor_id":"8085","vendor":"OTHR","millipercent":750},{"name":"Baja Soda â€“ Super Concentrate","flavor_id":"7831","vendor":"RF","millipercent":2100}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"113924","name":"Fizzed"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
