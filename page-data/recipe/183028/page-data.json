Tart. Floral. Mystical.\r\n\r\nThese were the words floating in my mind soup as I crafted this delectable masterpiece.\r\n\r\nFA Aurora - This one here imparts a sharp, sweet, fresh-squeezed lime note near the top. It's very versatile and should be in everyone's stash.\r\n\r\nINW Dragonfruit - Pitaya - The *real* dragonfruit flavor. This and JF Honeydew Melon form the unspecific desert-fruit base.\r\n\r\nINW Cactus - Here is your juicy, sour, tart enhancer.\r\n\r\nCAP Hibiscus - Here to provide humidity, sweetness, and the distinct floral tone you'd expect from a peyote.\r\n\r\nJF Honeydew Melon - The king of honeydews and just incredibly complex and amazing on its own.\r\n\r\nFA Lavender - To activate your throat chakra and speak your inner truth.\r\n\r\nThis has almost entirely replaced Grack Juice as my primary addiction. I hope you enjoy and I'd love to hear your reviews.","steep_days":"0 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":4,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:51:22.000-05:00","best_vg":"65%","views":"1289","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Aurora","flavor_id":"399","vendor":"FA","millipercent":750},{"name":"Dragon Fruit - Pitaya","flavor_id":"652","vendor":"INW","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Cactus","flavor_id":"647","vendor":"INW","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Hibiscus","flavor_id":"72","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":500},{"name":"Honeydew Melon","flavor_id":"4577","vendor":"JF","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Lavender","flavor_id":"510","vendor":"FA","millipercent":750}],"reviews":[{"user":"Parad0x357","text":"Very nice recipe! Sadly, I couldn't get my hands on JF's Honeydew Melon, so I substituted it with TPA's Honeydew. I really like it, but if I ever get the chance to try it with JF's Honeydew Melon I update this review. I'm a big fan of FA's Lavender and I have to say this is one of the best uses for the flavor I've tasted so far. Also, this made me fall in love with FA's Aurora. A very good flavor. Mixed it with up with some WS-23 for that extra bit of kick."}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"183028","name":"Peyote"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
