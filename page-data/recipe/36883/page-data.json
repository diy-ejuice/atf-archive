I just peeked into the stepping cabinet to try something different. It's been steeping sing 3/29/17. Very nice vape! Thick, creamy, and smooth. I really like it. Wish I would have mixed more. I think this is a great cream base to use with your favorite fruits. It's very good as it is though.. Thanks for sharing!","score":5}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"36883","name":"creamed in your mouth"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
