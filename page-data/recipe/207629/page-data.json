LB VIC brings depth and mouthfeel as it sits quite thick whilst SSA VIC Is brighter and carries sweet upfront vanilla and dairy notes. Borneo Vanilla is sweet and very bright also and really boosts out a nice thick vanilla cream. \r\nVT Love runs out a nice white chocolate that pairs fantastic with the sweet raspberries that run threw the entire ice cream. \r\nI also added 0.5% berry boost from chefs to help the raspberry out also.\r\nBeen vaping this a few weeks now and honestly find this to be one of my all time favourite raspberry vapes.","steep_days":"14","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:51:47.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"1142","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Madagascar (Vanilla Classic)","vendor":"FA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"French Vanilla Icecream","vendor":"HS","millipercent":3500},{"name":"Love DIY","vendor":"VT","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Raspberry Jam","vendor":"VT","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Berryl (raspberry)","vendor":"FA","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Vanilla Ice Cream","vendor":"LB","millipercent":3500},{"name":"Super Sweet","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":500}],"reviews":[{"user":"Rock10574","text":"Looks awesome BRDZ.
