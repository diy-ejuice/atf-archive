This mix is on the realistic side and not on the candy side so if you want candy this is not it. I’ve mixed mango pineapple and peach with good success in the past so that was not the surprise. The surprise was the addition on VTA Green Mango adding to the authenticity of the blend. By itself green Mango is a bit floral and a cross between the peel of the mango and the pit, but as a mango enhancer it worked magic. The cantaloupe is in this mix as a backdrop base, that helps emulsify all the stronger fruits and adds a mouth watering aspect. This recipe needs a few day steep at the very least (around 3 days), but I would recommend at least 2 weeks to allow all the strong notes in these fruits to blend. This mix is very flavorful, has a full body mouthfeel and it's sweet even without sweetener. If you don’t like cooling agents this mix worked well without it. I added WS-23 at a low % for a light freshness. If you prefer a creamy take I do think TFA Vanilla Swirl at around 2% would fit in well.
