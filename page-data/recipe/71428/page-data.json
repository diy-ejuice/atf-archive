It's light, creamy but not heavy, nice tart raspberry, subtle tea, and classic chai spice without being overpowering. Fantastic mix, although a bit too light for my tastes (at least SNV, I'm sure the steep will do it well) and personally would have preferred a more syrupy/jammy raspberry. Delicious nonetheless, and a batch with a touch of coolant (koolada + ws-23 @ 0.5% each) turned out fantastic for a nice iced raspberry chai. It is summertime afterall :)"}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"71428","name":"#1 The Raspberry Chai "}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
