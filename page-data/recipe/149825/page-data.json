It's got some zing yet the balance of flavor is a very pleasant thing! \r\nKinderground recently spoke of the loveliness of VTA Sour Lemon & FE Lemon working together, I think it was on \"Noted\" on the DIY or DIE YT channel. \r\nWhile I know those flavors well,  before this recipe I can't recall putting these together but I am very glad I did. Me being me, wanted to go to the extreme and also offer a little zest note that the other lemons lack (not a bad thing), hence a little FA Lemon Zest was added & works really well here I think. \r\nNow as pleasant as that little lemon trinity is, it's not a stand alone vape rather it's more of a stone to use in other profiles like this.\r\nTo make things simplish I thought, lets add this \"Trinity\" to a custard. A custard that's full, creamy and a little sweet to compliment the lemons and mellows out those higher lemon notes that keeps things lovely and balanced. After playing with a few combinations I really enjoy the full yet smooth mouthfeel of how FA Custard premium works with Butterscotch Ripple and a little Holy Vanilla. \r\nAltogether after an at least 7 day steep allowing for the lemons to settle and the creams to meld this comes together in a way that I think is lovely and offers a balance to the \"Zing\" of the lemons. \r\n\r\nIMO this is a very pleasant and enjoyable vape on a single coil RDA at 60W with a SST single coil at 0.2 ohm \r\n\r\nI hope you enjoy this just as much as enjoyed creating this little recipe but let me know what you thought in the comments below. \r\n\r\nSeriously if you wanna a solid recipe that works give it a go!\r\n\r\nCheers for reading this far, now go and get mixing!\r\n\r\n\"Together, Let's Discover!!!\"\r\n\r\nFacebook - https://www.facebook.com/groups/diydownunder/\r\nDiscord - https://discord.gg/kH4Fqbc\r\nYoutube - https://www.youtube.com/c/diydownunder\r\nWebsite - https://www.diydownunder.com/\r\nInstagram IGTV : @diydownunder","steep_days":"7","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"total_reviews":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-05T15:44:13.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"2893","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Butterscotch Ripple","vendor":"FW","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Custard Premium","vendor":"FA","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Holy Vanilla","vendor":"DFS","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Lemon","vendor":"FE","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Lemon Zest","vendor":"FA","millipercent":250},{"name":"Sour Lemon","vendor":"VT","millipercent":2000}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"149825","name":"Zing"}}}
