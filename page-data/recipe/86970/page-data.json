Outside of that omission I mixed it exactly as the recipe required. The first thing I noticed about this is the delicious combination of caramel and butterscotch ripple that blends perfectly into the banana custard. I was a bit worried about the banana being too candy-like, but it was nailed extremely well. Finally, the duo of Bavarian Cream and Vanilla Custard is wonderful and I enjoyed it immensely in this application."}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"86970","name":"Bad Monkey"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
