For me it's a monumental cup of coffee, my mod, and catching up on what's going on in the world (But usually Reddit). This is my ode to that time of day, a coffee cake that actually has some coffee in it. Most coffee cakes don't actually have coffee in them but I wanted to give this a try and here we are.\r\n\r\nTo the notes!\r\n\r\nDat Cake: JF Yellow Cake/RF Sugar Cookie help create cake base and is actually a base that Tootall had in one of his recipes (Be sure to check out his recipes when you get time, his stuff is awesome). CAP CDS is used for our cinnamon sugar infusion that coffee cakes normally have, the bakery notes from it support the cake base as well. I also added just a little bit of CAP Cake Batter to give a some density.\r\n\r\nBut Coffee flavors always taste like burn Popcorn!: I've tried a few coffee flavors in this recipe; FA Dark Bean, FA Up, and FLV Coffee to name a few. RF Coffee SC seems to have the most bearable of burnt popcorn tastes from the flavors that I have bought. It's kind of a light/medium roast that has some splenda added to it. DFS Holy Vanilla helps as an emulsifier with RF Coffee at this % and BEHOLD! NO MORE BURNT POPCORN TASTE. \r\n\r\nAll in all this is a pretty bangin coffee recipe and if that's the profile you're into I would suggest giving this a try. \r\n\r\nLet me know what you think! I always appreciate constructive criticism.","steep_days":"10","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T11:43:59.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"1188","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Yellow Cake","vendor":"JF","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Sugar Cookie – SC","vendor":"RF","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Cinnamon Danish Swirl","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Coffee – SC","vendor":"RF","millipercent":1250},{"name":"Cake Batter","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":500},{"name":"Holy Vanilla","vendor":"DFS","millipercent":1000}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"93696","name":"Coffee & Cake"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
