The sweetener and cinnamon danish swirl v1 was the perfect ingredient to top off the mix.  \r\n\r\nit seems i did a big flavor bend with strawberry ripe @ 5% it gave many notes and assisted the entire mix without identifying itself as a predominant flavor note.  that 1 ingredient i feel assists the creaminess of the pudding, then added to the apple to help complete this original profile. \r\n\r\nI hope you enjoy it as much as I did since its creation it has been a ADV for me.  I only use drippers and it has been a beautiful mix to enjoy the past weeks.\r\n\r\nthis can be used as a shake and vape but i found after the 4th day the peanut butter stands out more and more. After 2 weeks i have found no more flavor note changes to my personal taste \r\n\r\n","steep_days":"4","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T14:11:55.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"1665","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Cinnamon Danish Swirl","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":2250},{"name":"Dulce De Leche","vendor":"FW","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Apple Fuji","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Peanut Butter","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":3500},{"name":"Strawberry (ripe)","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":5000},{"name":"Yogurt","vendor":"FW","millipercent":7000},{"name":"Sweetener","vendor":"FW","millipercent":1000}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"18236","name":"apollo creed "}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
