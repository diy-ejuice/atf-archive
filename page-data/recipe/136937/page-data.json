The picture was soooo beautiful.....I had to find a way to vape it. \r\n\r\nI was also looking for a good use for WF Marscapone.....and I found it. It works perfectly here....twangy and thick, bolstered by the VT sweet cream. The cake was white in the picture so I choseWF Fluffy White Cake over FW White Cake because itâ€™s just so much better. Bumbleberry is perfect for me, but I can imagine you can sub it with another mixed berry at the appropriate percentage. \r\n\r\nI hope you mix it and enjoy!","steep_days":"10","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T14:13:42.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"1066","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Mascarpone Cream Cheese","vendor":"WF","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Fluffy White Cake SC","vendor":"WF","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Bumbleberry SC","vendor":"WF","millipercent":2000},{"name":"New York Cheesecake","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Sweet Cream","vendor":"VT","millipercent":1500}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"136937","name":"Berry Marscapone Cake"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
