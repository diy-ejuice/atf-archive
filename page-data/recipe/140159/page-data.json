It also gives a little citrus which can complement almost any style of light fruity beverage profile IMO. \r\nThe hero here is the delicious Blueberry lemonade Slushie. The blue razz tones are so similar to those blue slurpees and the lemonade offers an almost bubbly mouthfeel which really assists this over all profile with the right level of sweetness and a slight cool note offers some refreshment. While the Baja Soda ? Blueberry lemonade slushie are almost good stand alone, together they are a happy marriage. \r\nHowever I really wanted to add a little bit of a tropical mouthfeel to this profile without getting to complicated. IMO nothing adds a little \"tropical\" to a beverage profile better than the delectable ? delightful Flavorah Pink Guava. This stuff alone takes you to an oasis with pink flamingos lol. \r\nSeriously though the contrasting tones of flavor against the refreshing blue ? citrus notes seemingly work beautifully. A couple of extra cubes of ice (hence 0.5% ws-23 30%) and this one is going to be perfect on the sundeck as we sit poolside relaxing and enjoying this vape. \r\nAt least this is what I get and feel from this lovely little recipe. \r\nWhat did you get? Did you enjoy it? \r\nLet me know your thoughts and most of all just enjoy mixing ?
