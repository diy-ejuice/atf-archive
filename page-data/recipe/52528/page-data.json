A great after dinner pleasure, or before dinner, or heck, any time of day really. I started this after loving an Aussie brand called Botany Bay Bottling Co and their mix \"Black Cow\". This is a homage to that juice. \r\n\r\nThe chocolate I settled on here is TFA Double Chocolate - I played with mixes of INW and TFA Milk Chocolate, however none of them gave the result I was looking for. Here, at 6%, the DCC holds its own as the main profile for the mix. \r\n\r\nThe Rum component is achieved with use of the Butter Rum, and enhanced with the Butter Cream. The rum at 2.2% imparts a solid, but still layered alcohol effect that plays extremely well with the chocolate.\r\nThe Butter Cream also affects the thickness of the milk and cream components.\r\n\r\nI achieved the milkshake portion of the mix through the blend of Sweet Cream, VBIC and Butter Cream. The Dairy Milk at 0.5% adds the slight tartness of a real milkshake, that lends itself nicely to the sweeter dairy components. \r\n\r\nI hope you enjoy this recipe like I do :) ","steep_days":"10","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T00:07:21.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"1075","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Double Chocolate (clear)","flavor_id":"158","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":6000},{"name":"Butter Rum","flavor_id":"925","vendor":"LA","millipercent":2200},{"name":"Sweet Cream","flavor_id":"117","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Butter Cream","flavor_id":"3","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Dairy/Milk","flavor_id":"2164","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Vanilla Bean Ice Cream","flavor_id":"4","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":2000}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"52528","name":"How Now Brown Cow (Choc-Rum Milkshake)."}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
