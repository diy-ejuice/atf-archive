It provides a nice chewy and round base for the other flavors to flesh out. TPA Pomegranate was awfully gross in my SFT, but it fits really well here. It bends the Swedish Gummy into something more tart and sharp. The floral edge of Pomegranate also seems to work with TPA Pineapple to hit that “sour” note. It doesn’t have the intense and gritty sour sweetness of the actual candy, but it gets close enough to satisfy me. Very interesting combination that works better than expected. Tasty stuff, Wayne!","score":4},{"user":"Asire","text":"Really love this candy recipe. The pomegrenade pineapple combo really hits the spot tastewise of the blue and pink Sour Worms. Candy aspect is also hit on spot with just the swedish gummy and sweetener. &#xD;\nI think the only thing is that people misinterpret the \"sour\" part. At this point there is just NO way to really get a mouth pulling sour taste in a liquid. What this liquid does for me is still even more impressive. Somehow the pineapple brings a light sour undertaste to this liquid and this is still the most sour i have ever tasted in a liquid. If you want a more chewy gummy feeling to this liquid add 0,5% TPA Vanilla Swirl. It is an awesome Addition to most gummy liquid. But dont take it higher than 0,5% otherwise it will take away from the awesome fruit combo flavor ","score":5},{"user":"cloudstate","text":"This is an awesome base. While vaping the first 15ml I thought something was missing and one day I was drinking lemonade and with a drink of that and hitting the vape, it was the PERFECT taste! I added FW Natural Lemonade at 5% and it was perfectly tart and brought the whole juice together!","score":3},{"user":"QueerYourVape","text":"I had never tried a candy vape and I found this one quite smooth and tasting of that artificial/gummy aspect of sour worms. It's not sour, unfortunately, but it's quite similar once you've sucked all the sugar/citric acid off of your blue and pink sour warm. Not an ADV but I like it in my rotation every couple of days.","score":4}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"78017","name":"Sour Worms by Candy King #REMIXMONTH"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
