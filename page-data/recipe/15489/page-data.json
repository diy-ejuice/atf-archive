I wanted to go against the grain and not do a bakery recipe with the basket ingredients. I combined two yogurts and cinnamon danish swirl to create a cinnamon roll yogurt.  I then added strawberry and apple and threw them in a blender with meringue for creamy sweetness (not literally!) to create a strapple cinnamon smoothie.  The two fruits are upfront on the inhale and the cinnamon roll yogurt come out on the exhale.  Not your conventional smoothie, but a nice sweet fall treat.
