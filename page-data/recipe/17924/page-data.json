What I wanted was a nice yellow cake with a thin but sweet cream layer topped with Cinnamon Apples. Hope you guys enjoy!\r\n\r\nI have not had much experience with CAP Cinnamon Danish Swirl so this whole process was a lot of fun to work with something I had never touched before. I had a lot of ideas but this is the recipe that stood out most to me and I enjoyed vaping on the most. With that said, here we go.\r\n\r\nCAP Cinnamon Danish Swirl: Going into this comp I had never used this flavoring or any cinnamon flavoring before. So of course I began doing my testing and I settled upon 1.5% because I wanted to get that Cinnamon Apple. I felt like too much CDS would lead to the danish coming out which I didn't want. At this percentage it compliments the apple nicely giving me that Apple cooked with some Cinnamon that I was looking for. This is a really useful flavoring that I look forward to working with more in the future and it's thanks to this competition.\r\n\r\nFA Fuji: This is my favorite Apple flavoring. It can be quite strong so I settled for 1.5% to match the CAP CDS. 2% would have probably worked as well but I didn't want this flavoring to overpower the cake, the cinnamon and the cream. \r\n\r\nTFA Strawberry Ripe: This is not a flavoring that works very well with cinnamon. What it does do is supply EM to the recipe to round everything off. 2% may actually be a little high here but I do enjoy it here to curb the cake, the apple, the cinnamon and the cream together into a flavor I enjoyed.\r\n\r\nJF Yellow Cake: The hype is real. I never used FW Yellow Cake once the drama around the use of fructose and corn syrup exploded and I refrained from using it. Then comes along Jungle Flavors Yellow Cake and BAM, this is such a wonderful cake flavoring. I knew once I tried it that I wanted to make at least one recipe for this contest that included this. At 3% you get a very nice light fluffy yellow cake that isn't intimidated by the creams, the cinnamon or the apple.\r\n\r\nFA Meringue: This is probably my favorite of the FlavorArt creams. It's extremely versatile and can be used in so many situations. Here I wanted to add a nice layer of cream that wasn't super heavy like a custard or heavy cream but something that was still sweet. Meringue does exactly that in this recipe and at 1% it gives me the nice thin sweet layer of cream that I want. \r\n\r\nFA Cream Fresh: Now that I have my thin sweet layer of cream, why would I add FA Cream Fresh? Well, I like how it accentuates Meringue and makes it just stand out a bit more. It compliments FA Meringue at an equal 1% and makes the Meringue just a bit more noticeable in the face of cake, apple and cinnamon. \r\n\r\nLike all of my recipes I like to mix this at an 80vg/20 pg blend and as a shake & vape it is decent but a few days steep really brings those two creams out and makes the recipe more complete.
