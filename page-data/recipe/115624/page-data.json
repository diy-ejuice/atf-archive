Capella - New York Cheesecake is the first support flavor, bringing an additional note of caramelized sugar for the crust, adding some serious creaminess, and opening the bridge to vanilla flavors a bit more. Lastly, the TFA - Cheesecake (Graham Crust) completes the crusty undertone portion of the trinity and adds another hint of dairy. This trio can be used in any capacity to add an authentic and delicious cheesecake profile to a recipe. It's okay in a SNV, but I really suggest waiting about a week for it to come together. \r\n<lb/>\r\nThis recipe was inspired by the MixinVixens blueberry ice cream recipes. It utilizes EdibleMalfunction's Holy Trinity of Blueberry. I specifically picked Rin's Blueberry Ice Cream recipe as the inspiration for this, because she mixes at low percentages, and it really demonstrates the versatility of the cheesecake trinity.  My favorite ice cream base is a combination of FLV Cream and vanilla, found in both Rin's Recipe and Longing. FLV Cream is a bit hard for me to summarize, other than by saying it's an incredible cream flavor and should be added to everything. Vanilla Swirl is the most common vanilla, with a smooth and unobtrusive vanilla taste and a ridiculous amount of body. FA Bilberry adds an awesome depth and muskiness that helps combat the muting effect of vanilla swirl, and it should always be used at a low percentage if you don't want to end up in Funky Town. FW Blueberry brings the blueberry flavor to the top with a bold somewhat-artificial flavor. TFA Blueberry (Extra) is a natural  blueberry that helps tie into the ice cream seamlessly. You can try this with or without the WS-23, it was added because ice cream is cold.\r\n<lb/>\r\nInspired by Rin's Blueberry Ice Cream","steep_days":"7","temperature":"450","recipe_score":5,"updated_at":"2020-12-12T10:34:23.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"9158","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Bilberry","flavor_id":"533","vendor":"FA","millipercent":250},{"name":"Blueberry","flavor_id":"1201","vendor":"FW","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Blueberry (extra)","flavor_id":"218","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Cheesecake (graham Crust)","flavor_id":"152","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":250},{"name":"New York Cheesecake","flavor_id":"90","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":500},{"name":"Yes, We Cheesecake","flavor_id":"9272","vendor":"INW","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Cream","flavor_id":"604","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":500},{"name":"Vanilla Swirl","flavor_id":"189","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"WS-23","flavor_id":"8085","vendor":"OTHR","millipercent":500}],"reviews":[{"user":"UnappreciatedRobot","text":"This is now in my top 3 favorite recipes. When mixing at this low of an overall percentage, it is amazing how you can tell exactly what each individual flavor is doing for the recipe. EdibleMalfunction's Blueberry Trinity was the perfect choice for this recipe and paired perfectly with the ice cream and cheesecake.","score":5},{"user":"ncdulo","text":"After an 8 day steep and fresh wicks on my squonk I feel I can safely say I'm tasting this at it's full potential. I get a wonderful naturally sweet blueberry ice cream with a light sprinkling of cheesecake crumbs throughout. Everything seems very balanced in this recipe and I very much like the low total flavor percent. It should be fairly easy on coils without burning out your taste buds through chain vaping. The blend of cheesecake flavors bring a nice, dense mouthfeel to the recipe that accentuates the natural creaminess of real ice cream and really allows the blueberry to shine through without being hidden behind the other flavors. I get a hint of tartness with this blueberry as well, I believe through the FA Bilberry. If you aren't a big fan of cooling you may want to drop the WS-23 to 0.25% but I don't think it should be omitted - it definitely adds to the profile. I highly recommend this recipe and I like it enough to have cleaned out my squonk just for it.","score":5},{"user":"Mrmixer","text":"Ive been vaping this for a couple days now, and its quickly rising to the top of my must have mixed up list. Ive used the 3 blueberries in many mixes before, they are spot on for the profile in this recipe. They bring forward a nice sweet blueberry without being to candyish. I think the star of the show here is the blend of cheesecakes. This is the first recipe ive tried using inw yes we cheesecake in, and it does so well here, It gives a really nice cheesecake flavor, that melds into a delicious creamy flavor after a couple days. I plan to switch out the TPA vanilla swirl for some other vanillas just for shits and gigz.  This recipe is by far one of my favorites atm. Thanks to AlfredPudding for the work put towards this stellar mix. I am looking forward to the other 2 recipes I saw submitted over on reddit as well. Do yourself a favor and mix them all up!!","score":5}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"115624","name":"Holy Trinity Ice Cream"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
