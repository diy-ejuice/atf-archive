I am getting all grape fruit up front with a slight lemonade note and killed a finish. It may be a little over flavored. There is no throat hit at all which surprising considering the percentage of acidic flavorings. The sweet raspberry is not coming through at all and could be dropped completely without affecting the flavor. That being said if you lower the % of ruby red grapefruit to 1.5% and lemonade to 2.5% it would allow the other flavors to show off and allow the raspberry to be noticable. The sweetner, koolada, and tart note brought by the line tahity distilled is perfectly balanced. This is a great profile idea it just needs a little adjusting. I hope this review is helpful to you.
