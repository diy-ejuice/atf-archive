You might ask, \"Why would you make this if you've already got Holy Holy Grail RY4?\"  My answer is simple.  Because Cardinal . . . that's why.  Also, I've been neglecting JF RY4 Double and FLV Milk and Honey and wanted to try my hand at simplicity.  At only 6% this is a surprisingly bold RY4 . . . extremely thick and rich. Mixed it up last night (60vg/40pg) . . . filled up the Savour with it this morning.  It goes great with coffee.","steep_days":"1 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"total_reviews":2,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:50:14.000-05:00","best_vg":"60%","views":"3278","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"RY4 Double","vendor":"JF","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Milk & Honey","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Holy Vanilla","vendor":"DFS","millipercent":2000}],"reviews":[{"user":"Ebc88","score":"5","text":"This is simple and tasty. This is everything i wanted an ry4 to be when i started vaping. I agree with ID10-T this is an excellent recipe for showcasing JF RY4. And the holy vanilla and milk&amp;honey just work beautifully together "},{"user":"ID10-T","score":"5","text":"This seems like great example of what can be done with JF RY4 Double that makes it superior-tasting, if not more versatile, than its TFA counterpart . Full-flavored and dark vanilla-forward, some rich caramel, and a thick, satisfying cream, with a solid hit of sharper toasty tobacco notes tightening up the finish. There’s a lot going on in this deceptively simple recipe, because all to JF RY4 Dub and FLV Milk &amp; Honey complexities come though. I kind of expected that much Holy Vanilla to smother them but it doesn’t, it just makes it a caramel-vanilla-tobacco. Love this.  "}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"105659","name":"3-2-1 RY4"}}}
