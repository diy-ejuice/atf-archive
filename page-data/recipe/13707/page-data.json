I recommend this be mixed at 70/30 and steeped for 1 week. This was one of my first recipes I had ever created. I know that strawberry recipes have been done over and over again but this one has a spot on classic flavor without the icing. The .10% of MTS Vape wizard is essentially 1drop per 15ml. This is a simple recipe great for beginners. I know you will enjoy it. Please rate and comment, thanks.","steep_days":"0","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-05T11:04:06.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"2959","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Strawberry (ripe)","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":8000},{"name":"Mts Vape Wizard","vendor":"FA","millipercent":100},{"name":"Biscuit","vendor":"INW","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Cake (yellow)","vendor":"FW","millipercent":5000}],"reviews":[{"user":"Mr-G","text":"its ok"},{"user":"SamKayla","text":""},{"user":"Rageisalotofwork","text":"I'm skeptical of strawberry, but I'll give this a shot."}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"13707","name":"OG Strawberry Cake"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
