Enjoy!\r\n\r\nThis is something I have put a lot of time into and I think I'm ready to share it. With most of my recipes I never feel like they are \"done\" but I like to think this is ready to present at least. This is my twist on a stroopwafel, but with cinnamon and a butter pecan filling. On to the notes!\r\n\r\nWe be Stroopin: The Stroopwafel part is fairly straightforward, INW Biscuit and LB Belgian Waffle bring out the main stroopwafel for this recipe, but I added some CAP CDS to help support the bakery notes, but not too much, and adds a great cinnamon flavor to it. I was playing with JF Biscuit between 0.5%-1%, but I think it was adding an off/cookie kind of note and a little too much soft mouthfeel, so INW made a great and logical replacement.\r\n\r\nI know the % for INW Biscuit is weird, but 0.75% was a little too dry and 0.5% you can't really notice it, so 0.66% is where I put it at.\r\n\r\nDat filling: I originally was trying to use just FW Butter Pecan and nothing else, but after hearing the suggestion of trying OOO it came out much better, I also felt that since it was a filling it needed some support and TFA Bavarian Cream did really well with that.\r\n\r\nThe Holiest of Holys: DFS Holy Vanilla just does great with everything, it helps support the waffel, a little for the filling, and all around just makes this profile great. \r\n\r\nAdd some CAP SS to taste and you are good to go! Be sure to leave a review with your thoughts. If you don't have OOO Butter Pecan, FW is an okay replacement at 2%","steep_days":"7","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"total_reviews":2,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:49:50.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"2213","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Cinnamon Danish Swirl","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Holy Vanilla","vendor":"DFS","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Belgian Waffle","vendor":"LB","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Bavarian Cream","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Super Sweet","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":150},{"name":"Butter Pecan","vendor":"OOO","millipercent":1750},{"name":"Biscuit","vendor":"INW","millipercent":660}],"reviews":[{"user":"MrBurgundy","score":"5","text":"This shit is downright delectable. I could ADV this like nobody’s business. It reminds me of Dutchie, and is that ever a compliment. Belgian Waffle and Biscuit do a great job of creating that waffle cookie flavor. It’s thin, dense, and crunchy. Cinnamon Danish Swirl adds a doughy center and a cinnamon sugar on top. One of the greats, Holy Vanilla, and bavarian cream add a spicy vanilla that smooths out any rough edges that might have been there. The OOO Butter Pecan is subtle, but present. It just adds another tasty accent to the mix. Everything is working together harmoniously.. Seriously, I love it. This is a new favorite of mine. I’ll be mixing big bottles, no doubt."},{"user":"kitu5","score":"5","text":"Okay, this is definitely a stroopwafel. Very light, waffle flavor which matches the usual thin waffle flavored wafer/pastry that encases the goodness. At one week, you can taste some of the butter pecan, and it intermingles very well with the vibrant as hell vanilla/maple/cinnamon that's coming through.&#xD;\n&#xD;\nIt's addictive as hell. I've run through half my bottle in 3 days, and it's been a true treat. Now, I'm gonna stash this and try to ride out until i hit 3 weeks.&#xD;\n&#xD;\nFor people who love stroopwafel, breakfast fiends, and people who really dig their sweets with a side order of bakery. Seriously, as it stands, this is one utterly decadent treat, and i do believe it's only going to get better. To be continued.&#xD;\n&#xD;\nBANGER!"}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"81614","name":"I be Stroopin"}}}
