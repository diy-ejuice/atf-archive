If you have only got VTA Vanilla buttercream frosting, that works. Inawera custard rather than TFA VII works well.\r\n\r\nNo sugar cookie? use JF Cookie. Haven't got one ingredient leave it out or throw in 3%5% of FW Butterscotch Ripple.\r\n\r\nTry subbing the cookie for a Molinberry version, it won't hurt it.\r\n\r\nAdd some fruit like bananas, berries ect and it will hold up nicely.\r\n\r\nMake it even fatter in mouthfeel by adding some FLV Vanilla Marshmallow? Maybe even sub in some cheesecake? Regardless it will hold up beautifully!\r\n\r\nIn over 4 years of mixing I haven't seen a recipe that is as constantly versatile and delicious as this is to work off.\r\n\r\nHave fun with it & enjoy the evolution!","steep_days":"7","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:51:44.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"2467","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Buttercream Frosting SC","vendor":"WF","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Cookie","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Cookie Butter SC","vendor":"WF","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Frosting","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Sugar Cookie","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Vanilla Pudding","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Vanilla Custard 2","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1500}],"reviews":[{"user":"cxxxxp","text":"Fantastic work Pippa, reminds me of dipping scotch finger biscuits in warm milk :) I subbed 1/2 the sugar cookie with JF cookie, kept all else the same.
