It needed something more. Green Blood didn't work by itself even after tinkering the harshness of the blackberry and grapes down.\r\nThis is where I tried out a few bases for it to settle on top of with the soda taking me by surprise. It's not a berry-sprite as I was expecting given the ingredients.\r\n\r\nI hope that this too takes you pleasantly by surprise, as true love often does.\r\n\r\n[Btw, my ws23 is 30% in pg]","steep_days":"1 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"total_reviews":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-06T20:45:35.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"899","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Citrus Soda","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1250},{"name":"Lemon Lime","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1000},{"name":"WS-23","vendor":"OTHR","millipercent":500},{"name":"Guanabana","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Kiwi","vendor":"FA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Blackberry","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Grapes","vendor":"INW","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Cactus","vendor":"INW","millipercent":500}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"183924","name":"Green Blood Soda"}}}
