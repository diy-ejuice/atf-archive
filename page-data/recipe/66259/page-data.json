I made the first renditions of this recipe weeks before the bourbon barrel vanilla cream recipe  I just released so this was the inspiration for the bourbon barrel portion of that recipe.\r\n\r\nThe Bourbon Barrel:\r\nI used a delicious combination of flavorah flavors. I used bourbon at .85% just enough so you know there is bourbon in the recipe not over powering in any way. If you like it boozy then you might want to turn up the bourbon a little because its more of an accent but its definitely present. Oak barrel is a light flavor but a great flavor to accent the oak barrel. I then added just a touch of caramel and butterscotch  just to accentuate the sweetness in a bourbon barrel.\r\n\r\nThe Vanilla Custard:\r\nIt looks a little heavy handed but this is my third rendition and this was the one that tasted the best. I used 2.5% of both  tfa and capella\"s vanilla custard's. I wanted a creamy custard so I added vanilla whipped cream by capella at 2%. I also added 1% cream fresh by flavor art and 1.5% holy vanilla. As heavy  handed as this recipe looks in the vanilla department after a 10+ day steep this turns into something special. A delicious vanilla custard with a delicately infused bourbon barrel back note. Definitely a good change in pace if your like me you need something different.

Anyways mixed this up the day it came out. It's been I believe about 5 days. Anyways I have been bored with my flavors vaping lately. So I decided to taste this early. All I can say is wow, this is a really good vape after 5 days. It has just that nice perfect balance of flavors and it's not too boozy. Overall it's just great. I have to say I can't wait to try this again after the full 10 day steep. Right now this is a 5  star. After ten days I'll bet it's better than that. Great job with this mix Rory. Thanks again for another stellar vape."},{"user":"KRUCIAL","score":"none","text":"Holy fucking dark juice batman lol looks and samples great I will complete this review after the steep.
