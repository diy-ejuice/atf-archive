She loves her coffee black and she's been all up in those flavor roasted coffees. She likes the black cherry in her French roast.\r\n\r\nWF Brazilian Coffee/FA Carmel/FA Bourbon = That's your black coffee. I really like WF Brazilian Coffee, even though I don't like coffee in general. It's an authentic flavoring and definitely the best coffee on the market right now. Fresh gave me the advice to add a little FA Carmel for that rich coffee liquid darkness profile and to use a darker vanilla flavoring to spice it up, hence FA Vanilla Bourbon.\r\n\r\nWF Blackcherry Jelly Bean/FA Cherryl =  That authentic, fleshy black cherry profile that will marry my black bourbon vanilla coffee base.\r\n\r\nOOO Marshmallow Vanilla = At 1% you're not getting a lot of vanilla or marshmallow flavor, however, you're getting the best mouthfeel you can find for something like this.\r\n\r\nI hope it works out and she likes it, but also I think this gives people the idea to try vaping and mixing flavor profiles that are strong and a little different from what we're used to.\r\n\r\nEnjoy, be queer & vape on!\r\n\r\n[Picture Credits: www.cherryblack.com.au ]","steep_days":"3 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-11T19:42:44.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"724","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Blackcherry Jelly Bean SC","flavor_id":"8359","vendor":"WF","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Cherryl (cherry, Black)","flavor_id":"468","vendor":"FA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Brazilian Coffee SC","flavor_id":"9016","vendor":"WF","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Marshmallow (Vanilla)","flavor_id":"1798","vendor":"OOO","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Carmel (caramel)","flavor_id":"503","vendor":"FA","millipercent":250},{"name":"Bourbon (vanilla Bourbon)","flavor_id":"420","vendor":"FA","millipercent":500}],"reviews":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"165365","name":"Glasgow Dark (Cherry Black Coffee)"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
