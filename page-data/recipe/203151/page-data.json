It's got a thick creamy body and its not super eggy. The best part is, it steeps fast (for a custard). I've added TFA Bavarian Cream to really thicken up that cream note and make this an extra dense custard.\r\n\r\nThe FA Marshmallow and CAP Sugar Cookie are in here to give it a baked note. Marshmallow for mouth feel and stickiness and Sugar Cookie to add some warmth and buttery and a few caramelized sugar notes. \r\n\r\nAdd sweetener as desired. \r\n\r\nWatch the video here:\r\n\r\nhttps://youtu.be/Ejuz_hdNbmY\r\n","steep_days":"7","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T19:16:36.000-05:00","best_vg":"80%","views":"1101","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Vanilla Custard 2","flavor_id":"10427","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":5000},{"name":"Bavarian Cream","flavor_id":"145","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Sugar Cookie","flavor_id":"115","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Marshmallow","flavor_id":"473","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"203151","name":"Baked Custard All Day "}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
