My mixes involve working mainly with creams, custards, cookies and fruits. So this is where I knew I needed to start. \r\n\r\nFA Forest Fruit - I have mixed with this flavor before and find it a great mix of berries with notes of Strawberry, Blueberry, Raspberry, and Blackberry, to me this flavor is really fantastic. This flavor pairs well withmany different flavors. At  3%  here it gives the perfect Amount of balance to let's the Berries really shine.\r\n\r\nTFA Banana Cream- This was a tough one here as I wanted that nice banana flavor to mellow out the tartness of the fruits and add a nice texture of flavor that would pair well with the berry mix. At 2 % this does a great job As an accent to the berries without giving off that banana Runty taste and giving a nice banana flavor on the exhale. \r\n\r\nFA Cream Fresh- I use this flavor often as it really adds a nice amount of creamy milkyness to any mix. At 2% this really made the recipe turn into a very nice refreshing cream base. This really adds some nice body to the mix. To make this a very nice banana berry smoothie. \r\n\r\nThis flavor taste good as a Shake n vape. Best after 5 days to really let the Fresh cream settle in with the rest of the mix.
