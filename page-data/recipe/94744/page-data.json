Most of the strawberry fades out during the steep. \r\n\r\n\r\nNotes: I started messing with this profile months ago, and after a few different variations I never could come up with anything i was satisfied with. So I abandoned it. Until a week ago i decided to revisit it. For my 2nd mixersclub submission. I pretty much gutted my failed original recipes, and simplified it to see if it wouldn’t turn out a muddled mess like my previous attempts\r\n\r\nFW Creamy Sponge Cake:i went with it bc it is a soft “twinkie” like cake with cream. Which is what i was looking for this recipe. \r\nTPA strawberry ripe:is still my favorite strawberry flavor. It hits all the marks i am looking for i a strawberry flavor but it does fade. Which i why i added RF SC Strawberry one of my favorite strawberries for mixing with other strawberries\r\nFLV Elderflower: To build a Strawberry Elderflower sponge cake. You obviously need an Elderflower flavor, and this is only option I had. This flavor did that some time to whip into submission to get it not to overpower the other flavors i wanted to taste in this recipe. \r\nINW Custard: Quickly became my favorite custard a few months back when I added to my arsenal. The culinary recipe I loosely based this off. Used a warm creamy/runny vanilla custard. Which INW is not but it works in here plus it cuts the steep exponentially.

I got some kind of soft, moist bakery that could be a sponge cake underneath an elderflower-berry something. The cream or custard seems to be part of the sponge cake rather than part of the elderflower-berry and the strawberry tastes like more of a generic red berry thing rather than a clear strawberry. Interesting and delicious. I have some past experience with elderflower and I never would have guessed it could work in a bakery based on those experiences. And yet, here it does. It tastes like a super fancy dessert made with St. Germain-laced mixed red berry coulis. I love this. I wouldn't change this recipe at all."}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"94744","name":"Elder Sponge"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
