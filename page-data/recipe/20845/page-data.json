After finally getting JF Honey Peach in my arsenal and doing some single flavour testing, I have realized that THIS is a the concentrate I've been looking for. There isn't anything too complex about this mix, but it's fucking delicious. The peach notes hit straight away and are very prominent. The FA White Peach and FA Fuji help add some bright, tart notes to the overall sweet creaminess the rest of the ingredients impart. FW Butterscotch Ripple is a must have for any sort of bakery vape, and even though this isn't necessarily a bakery vape, it's addition in this mix helps add some brown sugar and caramel notes that were initially only supposed to help mute some of that assumed throat ripping harshness the peaches would create, but it also adds some real depth to an otherwise simple mix. As a shake and vape, this is incredible, no real need to steep at all.\r\n\r\nAlthough delicious as it is, this will also work as a great base for any number of peach inspired recipes.\r\n\r\nArt created by me : more paintings can be seen at http://www.matthew-kocanda.com","steep_days":"1 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":4.7,"total_reviews":7,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:48:54.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"5434","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Honey Peach","vendor":"JF","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Butterscotch Ripple","vendor":"FW","millipercent":1750},{"name":"Peach White","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Vanilla Cupcake","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1250},{"name":"Fuji","vendor":"FA","millipercent":2000}],"reviews":[{"user":"Illegal_Immigrant","score":"5","text":"Oh man! That peach flavor is smoooth. I had it in my steep drawer for almost 4 months and forgot about it. Glad I did. Smooth butterscotchy peach on the inhale, and a ton of mouthfeel and volume on the exhale. Absolutely delicious! Thanks for this one."},{"user":"Ebc88","score":"5","text":"Absolutely delicious purchased Honey Peach for this and i am not disappointed. I also don’t care for the harshness peaches bring along, but for me with a week steep they usually go away, but with this i never even got the slightest hint of harshness. Excellent job and thanks for sharing "},{"user":"horizonism","score":"5","text":"This shit is delicious. Best use of FA White Peach I’ve found. "},{"user":"fluid85","score":"4","text":""},{"user":"orangetree","score":"5","text":"Mixed some days ago, it instantly joined my ADV team. It's a pleasant and light vape, the combination of Peach White and Honey Peach results in a very authentic peach. "},{"user":"triangulatethisdick","score":"5","text":"This is deffinetly a fantastic tasting recipe! But not only does is taste spectacular, it also achieves your goal for it to not tear your throat up. The butter scotch ripple is a perfect pair it help smooth out the edges and adds a slightly carmalized aspect which i want to sqrew around w/ adding more of. I don't even like peach vapes, but after giving this a shot, I'm very pleased. Thank you man!"},{"user":"Smoky","score":"4","text":""}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"20845","name":"Whatever Forever"}}}
