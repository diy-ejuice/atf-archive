So maybe this does, maybe it doesn't.  The original recipe seemed to think it did.\r\n\r\nOrig Recipe - http://e-liquid-recipes.com/recipe/1226583/Secret%20Strawberry%20Churrio%20%28The%20best%29\r\n\r\nAdded TFA Strawberry Ripe instead of CAP Sweet Strawberry\r\nAdded a couple % of TFA Sweetener\r\nRemoved TFA Meringue - It's pretty rough on my throat even at low %s.\r\n\r\nI may still test removing the TFA Acetyl Pyrazine too.  I haven't mixed it too much and honestly, since I usually only make 10-15ml at a time, I don't like having to futz with such small %s.  If it doesn't make too much or any difference to me I'll remove it from here.\r\n\r\nListed it at a 7 day steep even though the original says SnV/3 as it was better to me after having more time to sit.","steep_days":"7","temperature":"0","recipe_score":4,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:49:25.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"1758","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Acetyl Pyrazine 5%","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Churro","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":4000},{"name":"French Vanilla","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Funnel Cake","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Sweetener","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Whipped Cream","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Strawberry (ripe)","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":4000}],"reviews":[{"user":"Kemmo","text":"Good recipe.
