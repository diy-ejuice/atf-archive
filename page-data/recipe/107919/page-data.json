LB honeydew has a bit of creaminess that comes out at higher  % and it  works well with the LB rainbow sherbert.  it is also plays nice with other fruits and does not overpower them.  You can pick these up on the exhale \r\n\r\nSuagr loaf pineapple is a sweet and tart almost candy  pineapple which  works well in the middle bringing the top notes of the guava and the base sweet notes of the   melons together \r\nrainbow sherbert is added for some more   of the ice creamy texture  along with  more  orange citrus notes  \r\n\r\nADD IF YOU WANT:  I really enjoy mint with some fruits and wanted to add a  mint coolness here arctic chill  borders on a  sweet mint with a touch of menthol   it is not needed .  Desiccated coconut  adds a  nice sweetness at the finish  but it not needed   \r\nAdd sweetner to taste \r\nNOTE  this  recipe was inspired by  Waynes mix   Heat   https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/107762#live_mixing_the_heat_by_enyawreklaw\r\n\r\nLOOKING for a group to learn about mixing your own juice check out these groups and youtube channels\r\nhttps://www.facebook.com/groups/diydownunder/\r\nhttps://www.diydownunder.com/ \r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/user/frank1360\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0xkeZFSG04\r\n\r\n","steep_days":"3 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-06T20:44:05.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"1464","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Honeydew","flavor_id":"1492","vendor":"LB","millipercent":5000},{"name":"Melon Cantaloupe","flavor_id":"529","vendor":"FA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Sweet Guava","flavor_id":"118","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Rainbow Sherbert","flavor_id":"1501","vendor":"LB","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Sugarloaf Pineapple","flavor_id":"8978","vendor":"VT","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Dessicated Coconut","flavor_id":"9362","vendor":"VT","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Arctic Mint","flavor_id":"7736","vendor":"PUR","millipercent":500}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"107919","name":"Living in The Tropics "}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
