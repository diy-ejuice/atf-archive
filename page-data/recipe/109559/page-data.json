In this recipe I tried to mix up two of my favorite FA purple Flavours: grape concord and violet. FA almond here is used like an additive to calm down the floral violet note and the aggressive grape flavour. Cotton candy and cream is the way to milk and combine all together.\r\nI like this with a 0,5 of sweetener, but this is very subjective.\r\nGood vapes guys!","steep_days":"2","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-06T07:22:38.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"1169","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Violet","flavor_id":"512","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Grape Concord","flavor_id":"554","vendor":"FA","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Cream Whipped","flavor_id":"541","vendor":"FA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Cotton Candy (circus)","flavor_id":"318","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Almond","flavor_id":"528","vendor":"FA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Super Sweet","flavor_id":"2384","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":500}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"109559","name":"PurpleVape"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
