Let it steep for a few weeks for more of the authentic donut to come out. Sweet dough is a really nice donut flavor with no play dough notes. I was using the almond because I was experimenting with using almond to separate the base from the glaze, I'm not sure about all that but this is a good vape. Great for the cooler weather.
