Earthy Sweet and slightly floral, but not overbearingly at this percentage.\r\n\r\nPear, I am using TPA here, mostly because I have a lot of it :) There are other pears, better pears, less overpowering, sweeter, etc. This was more of a convenience thing for me. It works, sweetens and does everything it is supposed to while bring a good solid pear note to the mix. A mix of INW Pear and FA Pear would maybe be a little nicer, if there was less going on in this recipe.\r\n\r\nCantaloupe/Honeydew... My longest running favorite melons are TFA Honeydew and LA Watermelon. This was not a place for watermelon. TFA Honeydew needs a little help to flesh it out a little bit, this is where Cantaloupe comes in. I did at one time use TFA Cantaloupe for this but then CAP came along with theirs and it just blows the others out of the water. Anyways, perfect use of it here.\r\n\r\nJF Honey Peach and INW Peach, the two best peaches out there, mixed ;)\r\n\r\nINW Cactus, why the hell cactus? WET, that's why, this profile screams mouth full of wet fruit and INW Cactus delivers on that. I have been playing around with the percentage on this also, maybe nice to shine through? Maybe nice to peek through? I kinda like it where it is, not enough to notice CACTUS but enough to be WET.\r\n\r\nSweetener... I try and use as little as possible. To be quite honest I do not put it in every batch. I also sometimes just use CAP Super Sweet in this, at about half or less of the 1% shown.

I love TFA Honeydew but I can't seem to tolerate it at the levels other people enjoy it. Whatever alchemy went into making 4% TFA Honeydew taste delicious to me in the original Honey Sucker is missing from this version and the result is a mouthful of soap. That said, I'm crazy about CAP Cantaloupe thanks to that recipe and the combination of INW Peach and JF Honey Peach has proven wonderful elsewhere, so I'm sure anyone who doesn't have some kind of weird honeydew problem would love this mix. I'm going to give it another go with the Honeydew cut in half.   UPDATE: Yeah, I still don't like it as much as the original Honey Sucker, but with half as much Honeydew, this is delicious and super juicy.
