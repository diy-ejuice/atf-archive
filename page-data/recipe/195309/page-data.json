The OOO Butter Pecan** really brings out the authentic Butter Pecan taste in the Wonder Flavours Butter Pecan Pie. The Vape Train Golden Syrup is adding that dark sweetness this pie needs. FA Jamaican Rum, this flavor is a classic, a rum, that is not really boozy, but offers a nice spicy rum taste. And OOO Pie Crust, not much to say, except this adds the perfect pastry pie crust.\r\nEnjoy!","steep_days":"3","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"total_reviews":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T10:44:53.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"587","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Butter Pecan Pie","vendor":"WF","millipercent":3500},{"name":"Butter Pecan","vendor":"OOO","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Golden Syrup","vendor":"VT","millipercent":500},{"name":"Pie Crust","vendor":"OOO","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Jamaica Special (jamaica Rhum)","vendor":"FA","millipercent":750}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"195309","name":"Spiced Rum Butter Pecan Pie "}}}
