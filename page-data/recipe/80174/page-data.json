This is not a clone but it inspired me to mix a Portuguese Custard Tart. A traditional Portuguese custard pastry that consists of a crème brûlée-like custard caramelized in a crust. The INW Creme Brulee has a  caramelized  sugar, slight egginess, thick, fresh, creamy texture. I couldn't imagine a custard tart without CAP Vanilla Custard in the mix. The FA Catalan cream brings the filling together with its dulce de leche like flavor (caramel and hint of cinnamon). The Biscuit and Pie Crust combines for a nice crust.","steep_days":"3","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"updated_at":"2020-12-12T18:29:36.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"3319","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Creme Brulee (yc)","flavor_id":"894","vendor":"INW","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Vanilla Custard","flavor_id":"131","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Biscuit","flavor_id":"642","vendor":"INW","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Catalan Cream","flavor_id":"483","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Pie Crust","flavor_id":"179","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2000}],"reviews":[{"user":"Untitled","text":"Thats a good one! After 4 days of steeping its already pretty thick, (perfect) sweet, creamy and the light thin caramel crust from the Creme Brulee + Pie Crust is banging. Not sure how this will evolve but its pretty tasty for now. Well done!","score":5},{"user":"Luck3","text":"Never tried the original, but this is an amazing recipe. Thanks for sharing. ","score":5},{"user":"Ambedo","text":"Very nice recipe right here! Have been enjoying the hell out of this one! It has a nice Caramel note with spice. Nice and rich custard creamyness. Tastes \"brown\" if that makes sense. Could go nicely with a tobacco like soho. Recommended if you wanna vape a nice rich custard with an interesting spice twist.
