They also go by the name Rocket Pops and Firecrackers, and I'm sure there's a few more names for them as well. These popsicles had a lemon/cherry/blue raspberry flavour, which i'm sure most have enjoyed at least once in their lives. I know Flavor Art has this specific flavour called Booom, but I feel that this is more realistic and layered. Please give it a try and let me know if this hits the profile. I am still going to try and get it closer, but I think it's close enough and I want to move on to something different. \r\n\r\nLemon Flavour - LA Lemonade / FA Lemon Sicily - The lemon from the BombPop gives me the taste of  lemonade so I went with this combo.\r\nCherry - FA Black Cherry - Not a huge fan of any cherry flavour available ATM, but I feel that this seems to work best.\r\nBlue Raspberry - CAP Raspberry / CAP Juicy Peach - This combo tastes like a blue raspberry to me, and apparently others feel the same.\r\n\r\nAdd WS-23 if you'd like, but you can leave it out if you wish or don't have in your arsenal.\r\n","steep_days":"3 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T17:34:20.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"2570","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Lemonade","flavor_id":"951","vendor":"LA","millipercent":4500},{"name":"Raspberry","flavor_id":"108","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Juicy Peach","flavor_id":"81","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Cherryl (cherry, Black)","flavor_id":"468","vendor":"FA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Italian Lemon Sicily","flavor_id":"78","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":750},{"name":"WS-23","flavor_id":"8085","vendor":"OTHR","millipercent":750},{"name":"Super Sweet","flavor_id":"2384","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":750}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"62026","name":"BombPop"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
