I dream of the cake after the ice cream melts and saturates the cake with all that creaminess. This is what I am trying to portrait here, a nice slice of cake with melted ice cream. Tres  Leches gives me the foundation that I can build upon add the Yellow cake and the angel cake to give it more of that base cake flavor. Vanilla Custard and Vanilla Swirl gives this recipe more of the vanilla note and Whipped Marshmallow gives it a sweeter topping. I have grown fond of this recipe I believe it is a good ADV if you like bakery.","steep_days":"10","temperature":"0","recipe_score":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-12T05:56:40.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"422","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Tres Leches","flavor_id":"1446","vendor":"FW","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Angel Cake SC","flavor_id":"9014","vendor":"WF","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Super Sweet","flavor_id":"2384","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":500},{"name":"Vanilla Custard","flavor_id":"188","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":5000},{"name":"Vanilla Swirl","flavor_id":"189","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Yellow Cake","flavor_id":"5854","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Whipped Marshmallow","flavor_id":"8744","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1500}],"reviews":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"198336","name":"Dastardly"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
