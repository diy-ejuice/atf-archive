Well, since I know we are all looking for that savory meaty vape, figured I'd whip up the next best thing, mashed taters.\r\n\r\nHere's the 'development' notes, more like the thought process.\r\n\r\nFE Sweet Rice / FE Taro - Needed some starchy substance. While Sweet Rice has a good starch to it, Taro gives that dry earthly like potato note.\r\nINW Yes, We Cheesecake - This is just a decent plain cheesecake. I used it low to give some body to the Sweet Rice / Taro.\r\nOoO Milky Undertones - Add some creaminess / dairy to the overall potato mix.\r\nTFA Butter - Who eats their mashed potatoes plain? You damn savages.\r\n\r\nIs it perfect? Oh, hell no. Could I work on it over and over? Sure. Did I just mix something up for the fun of it? Oh yeah.\r\nReally, I just wanted to see if it was even possible with what I have. It's more of a concept than anything. Off a shake, the Taro is just strong and there is an overall mild potato butteryness. Not much in the way of creamy note but the idea is there. Maybe after a few days it will incorporate better... or worse? I don't know.  \r\n\r\nHappy Thanksgiving y'all. Hope you get fat, drunk, and pass out in a Best Buy to get those Black Friday deals.","steep_days":"1","temperature":"1122","recipe_score":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-10T14:52:59.000-05:00","best_vg":"60%","views":"1081","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Sweet Rice","flavor_id":"7727","vendor":"FE","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Yes, We Cheesecake","flavor_id":"9272","vendor":"INW","millipercent":750},{"name":"Taro","flavor_id":"1693","vendor":"FE","millipercent":200},{"name":"Cream Milky Undertone PG","flavor_id":"6539","vendor":"OOO","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Butter","flavor_id":"147","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":300}],"reviews":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"128413","name":"Mash'm Tat'rs"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
