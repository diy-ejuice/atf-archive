If you don't use it you might wonna bump up the Lemon Lime a percent.\r\nSuper Sweet is optional.\r\n\r\nI'm mixing for a few years now. Most of my mixes are based on premium juice profiles.\r\nMy recipes are remixes and not clones. In my attempts to remix these juices I'm always trying to make\r\nit as good as, or even better than the commercial juice without the loads of sweetener these companies throw in.\r\n\r\nGive it a try and enjoy ....................................","steep_days":"2 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"total_reviews":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:50:14.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"1709","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Blueberry","vendor":"FW","millipercent":8000},{"name":"Lemon Lime","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Raspberry","vendor":"INW","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Boysenberry","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":500},{"name":"Tart and Sour","vendor":"LA","millipercent":150},{"name":"Super Sweet","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":300}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"105763","name":"Rockin' Blue Pony (Head Bangin' Boogie Remix)"}}}
