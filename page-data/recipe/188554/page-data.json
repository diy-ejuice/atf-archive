The pineapple comes thru immediately up front. While the cake lingers after. I used the vanilla butternut for the wetness of the cake and the biscuit for that “baked good” taste while the butter base ties it all together. I like Vienna cream with pineapple because it has the same sweet yet sharp profile that compliment each other for another layer of depth. Enjoy this one with your fav RDA off the shake or steeped for a couple days.","steep_days":"0 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"total_reviews":1,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:51:27.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"844","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Biscuit","vendor":"INW","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Vienna Cream","vendor":"FA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Butter Base","vendor":"VT","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Pineapple","vendor":"INW","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Super Sweet","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":500},{"name":"Vanilla Butternut","vendor":"FW","millipercent":4000}],"reviews":[{"user":"Jonnycoldcutz","score":"5","text":"Yummmm.
