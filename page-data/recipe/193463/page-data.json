Sweet and fruity with a touch of tartness from the lemon lime. For this week's episode.

It does a bit blended up, like I’m not getting separate colored layers here, just a gradual fade from blue raspberry upfront to a lemon lime finish with a lot of blending in the middle. The strawberry in here is odd the way it mostly just seems to enhance the blue raspberry and thicken it, but every once in a while it pokes out and lingers. I would like the blue raspberry to be a little more intense here. That Blue Raspberry is very nice but always a little on the soft side, and while the strawberry gives it more berry depth, it doesn’t make it punch harder the way adding another blue raspberry or other raspberry flavor would. Maybe some VT Boysenberry or that WF Boysenberry Raspberry. Maybe FW Razzleberry, or WF Sour Blue Raspberry. Something. It’s all a nice balance of sweet and tart and entirely pleasant, though. The half percent of Super Sweet is a bit much for me here. It gives me that sugar lips but it sticks out as an artificial sweetener, it seems like a little less would be better. Or maybe some Polar Blast would work here and the Super Sweet would help carry the cooling a little further?  &#xD;\n","score":4}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"193463","name":"mlNikon's Unicorn Drank"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
