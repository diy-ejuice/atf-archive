As a shake and Vape it’s pretty good and scent wise it’s great! \r\n\r\nI imagine 4-7 days steep for full profile to settle and the chewy side to come trough a bit. And as always leave out the sweetener if you like. \r\n\r\nMix it Vape it and comment below if you liked it or if you have any constructive criticism.
