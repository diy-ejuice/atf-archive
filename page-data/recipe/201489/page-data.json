Very fruity, a little throaty but fairly unique. Guanabana has a pineapple banana type flavor that is lovely as a tropical or smoothie base. Sugarloaf pineapple added to enhance pineapple note and add a hint of citrus. Malaysian Guava adds to the tropical essence and adds a little bit of funkiness. Whipped cream and vanilla bean added to provide a slight smoothing effect without taking away/burying the fruit notes. Add sweeetener if you like.","steep_days":"2 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T21:33:27.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"423","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Whipped Cream","vendor":"OOO","millipercent":500},{"name":"Guanabana","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1250},{"name":"Sugarloaf Pineapple","vendor":"VT","millipercent":250},{"name":"Malaysian Guava SC","vendor":"WF","millipercent":150},{"name":"Vanilla Bean","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":150}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"201489","name":"Rin's Phil Mix"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
