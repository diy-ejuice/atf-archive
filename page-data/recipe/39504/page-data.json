And since alot of them tend to be some of your typical Strawberry Cream/Yogurt/Donut/Milk recipes, I thought of combining a couple different ones, and went along with it. So my thought on this one, was to have a Strawberry/Dragonfruit/Coconut frosted donut, that was dipped into milk. Now why would you dip your donut into milk? Cause the Tin-Man has a sheet metal cock, that's why.\r\n\r\nTPA Dairy Milk - I used Dairy Milk in this to provide that milky flavor, without taking away from the rest of the recipe. And at 2%, I think it did it's justice.\r\n\r\nINW Coconut - I wanted to use Coconut because it's something a little out of the ordinary, and thought it could blend in with the recipe to add some accents/diversity to the overall taste. I wouldn't go anymore than 0.5% on this, otherwise it just tastes like coconut. \r\n\r\nTPA Dragonfruit / INW Shisha Strawberry - I went with this combo, and it provided me with the type of artificial sweetness that I wanted, without it being too overpowering. That was why I went with more Dragonfruit than Strawberry on this concept. I wanted to try a different combination than what's currently out there, and I think that at these percentages, you get what you're looking for, without being all you get.\r\n\r\nTPA Frosted Donut / TFA Vanilla Swirl / FA Apple Pie - Now I went a little different with this combination as well for the same reasons as mentioned before. I wanted a different combination than usual, and it seems to do it's job quite well. The Vanilla Swirl acted well as the frosting on this recipe, without getting that eggy feeling with what CAP's Vanilla Custard would provide. Frosted Donut was the obvious choice for me in this recipe, as I wanted that donut feel. The Apple Pie acts as an accent to the Frosted Donut, giving it a little bit of deep fried/crusted affect to the Donut, without taking away from the Donut taste. \r\n\r\nCAP Super Sweet - For a sweet dessert, of course it needed a little bit of Sweetener in it as well. You should put in no more than 2-3 Drops per 15ml, and that helps with the frosted feeling that you'd get when biting into a frosted donut. Anymore, and it'll be sweetness overload.\r\n\r\nThis recipe is about 95% done, in that I feel like there can still be some tweaks I can do to provide the overall experience. But this is a very solid shake and vape recipe for if you want a dessert, but don't want to wait the 1 to 2 + weeks of steeping. Although this is a flavor that will get better overtime.","steep_days":"5 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-12T02:44:34.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"1608","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Dairy/Milk","flavor_id":"2164","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Coconut","flavor_id":"650","vendor":"INW","millipercent":500},{"name":"Dragonfruit","flavor_id":"226","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Shisha Strawberry","flavor_id":"1711","vendor":"INW","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Frosted Donut","flavor_id":"171","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Vanilla Swirl","flavor_id":"189","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Apple Pie","flavor_id":"551","vendor":"FA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Super Sweet","flavor_id":"2384","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":500}],"reviews":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"39504","name":"Frosted Dragon Nuts"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
