I've found while working on this recipe, that it works great with FLV Cookie. They pair well together to create that authentic soft cookie dough flavor that we all love. TFA Double Chocolate Clear and INW Chocolate (not milk) create the perfect chocolate chip note which lays in the cookie not on top. TFA Vanilla Bean Ice Cream and TFA Vanilla Swirl create the ice cream flavor. FA Marshmallow adds a little more depth and mouth feel. I only used one drop of INW Chocolate per 10ml.I have found that any more than that and it overpowers the mix. I've been working on this one for a while now and finally found what works for me and I am totally satisfied. It's really good as a shake and Vape but it gets even better with some time !  So mix it up, rate it and leave me some feedback. Thanks SAMUEL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
