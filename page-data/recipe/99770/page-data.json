I am in love with this  unique banana blend. It's uniquely delicious. If you like sesame sweets by inawera and banana vapes in general then i dare say you will fall in love as well. I mean how cant you not love a fried glazed banana with sesame seeds sprinkled on top?? Give it a try you may be pleasantly surprised!!!! Once again this recipe proves my tried and true banana combo of wonder flavours banana puree  and flavorah  banana tastes like a real banana not a candy banana like most people think when they see flavorah banana. I use the flv banana to brighten up the banana puree and it works time and time again.  It's just the banana combination  for me!!!$$$\r\n\r\n\r\nSweetener: i used .35% flavorah sweetness. You can use or dont use your preferred sweetener at your preferred percentage its your choice.","steep_days":"10","temperature":"420","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-06T23:07:47.000-05:00","best_vg":"75%","views":"1399","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Banana Pur√©e","vendor":"WF","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Banana","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":750},{"name":"Butterscotch","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":500},{"name":"Caramel","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":500},{"name":"Sesame Sweets","vendor":"INW","millipercent":750}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"99770","name":"Sweet Sesame Bananas"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
