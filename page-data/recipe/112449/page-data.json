This recipe is recommended for a dripper. Make no mistake, this is for you if you're the type of chick (erm I mean dude) that frequents coffee shops.\r\n\r\nAdd sweetener if you like your java really sweet. WF & FA Caramel provide the level I'm satisfied with.\r\n\r\nAdditionally you can add .15% of FLV Irish Cream for a more bold coffee flavor, but it's not absolutely necessary.","steep_days":"7","temperature":"420","recipe_score":5,"updated_at":"2020-12-12T08:13:39.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"3738","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Smooth Cappuccino Cream","flavor_id":"6060","vendor":"WF","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Carmel (caramel)","flavor_id":"503","vendor":"FA","millipercent":750},{"name":"Cream","flavor_id":"604","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Marshmallow","flavor_id":"473","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000}],"reviews":[{"user":"kindground","text":"This is really nice, simple, straightforward coffee vape. No burnt popcorn note and lots of cream. The caramel is just enough to sweeten it up and accent it nicely. Great mouthfeel too because of the cream and marshmallow. Because of the caramel and the slight vanilla notes it almost tastes like an RY4 that has the tobacco replaced with coffee. Well done. ","score":5},{"user":"gravi-tea","text":"this is the coffee vape I've been hoping for I really like the dash of caramel. had to wait on the wf to arrive but it was worth the wait. I think I'll try making my own variation as well, maybe add .5% of fw hazelnut. overall a real nice and simple mix.","score":5},{"user":"PiriPiri","text":"Mixed this up without the irish cream (just dont have it) and it's a great thick smooth creamy coffee vape. Having a taste of caramel really doesn't hurt either. ","score":5}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"112449","name":"Thick and DTF Coffee"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
