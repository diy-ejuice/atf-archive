The combination of FA Pear, TFA Pear, and FA Fuji is hands down the best, most realistic pear I've ever had in vape form.  I'll, again, repeat what I said in my review of DAAPled Pears: it is a smooth, sweet, crisp work of art.  Using it in a take on Charlie Noble's Commodore Peary ( recipe released in 2017: https://charlienoble.com/blogs/the-not-so-discontinued-series/the-not-so-discontinued-series-commodore-pearry ).\r\n\r\nYes, the name is long and flowery . . . no, this is probably not a recipe for the percentage minimalists out there.  However, this was a recipe I envisioned while drifting off to sleep last night (which has become common practice in this time of safer-at-home).  It is Foment_life's pear utilized in a Commodore Peary-esque recipe, where Holy Holy Grail RY4 acts as the caramel note (instead of FW Caramel Candy).  VT Vanilla Cream instead of the FW Bavarian Cream and CAP French Vanilla V2, FLV Sweet Coconut instead of CAP Coconut, FA Custard Premium instead of CAP Vanilla Custard V2, and TFA Red Oak just because I like the way it plays with custards.\r\n\r\nThe painting is from N.C. Wyeth's cover art for The Bounty Trilogy . . . the emblem is from the book cover beneath the dust jacket.  I just thought it went well with the ideas of dissent against a boat's captain and what not.  Great off of the shake . . . this 15mL will not see tomorrow.
