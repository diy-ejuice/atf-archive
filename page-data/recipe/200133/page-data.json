Yum! "},{"user":"Grfxman","score":"5","text":"I mixed this up late Friday night after the show and off the shake was super impressed. Very nice Blueberry (combining HS and FLV is a learned experience) will definitely use that again. Is a very pleasant creamy, berry vape - the blueberry is rich and dark without being earthy or to candy in nature. I think with a few days steep, this will get even better."},{"user":"Screwdriver","score":"5","text":"Thought at first glance you'd be going way over with the 3% (HS) French Vanilla Icecream, but noooo. This is super delicious of the shake and getting better still... Thx buddy ;)"},{"user":"BigRed","score":"5","text":"very unique "}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"200133","name":"Blueberry Ice Cream | Live Mixing"}}}
