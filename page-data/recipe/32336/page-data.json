It's a nice vape with lovely tea on the back. That green tea comes through nicely and it's needed especially for the steep time. It's actually quite realistic when you think about a smooth green tea latte, albeit on the sweet side. Personally I skipped the ws-23 tho. I personally skipped the Super Sweet for the 2nd batch though, with the marshmallow, whipped and meringue, it's sweet enough in my personal taste. But lovely stuff.
