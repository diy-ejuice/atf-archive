Think toaster strudel with a more indulgent twist. Vapeable as shake and vape. Yogurts and fruits subside over time. On day three the essence of the flavor profile comes together. Steeping takes this recipe on a journey from a black berry yogurt parfait to a conglomerate of pastry sweetness. The result is what fat kids dream about. \r\nYour feedback is appreciated.
