If you are sensitive to the Peppery notes from TFA custard you can mix it with Cap Custard but I would lower the % to somewhere between 3% and 4%. This recipe benefits from added PG I'm not exactly sure why because I'm not a chemist but there is a difference when I made it max VG. Steep time is minimum 2 weeks. but best after 4 weeks.

First time was to the recipe and it is delicious. Second time I had to sub banana cream for LA banana cream and also sub tpa custard for CAP custard, still delicious. &#xD;\nUsed to be a big fan of Suicide bunny’s line but haven’t had it in years. Don’t remember derailed being this good. Bravo.
