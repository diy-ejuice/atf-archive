Lately I’ve been on this dessert vape kick. So I decided to mess around a make a nice frosted Cupcake with some sweet goodness.\r\n\r\nTFA Vanilla Cupcake : Such a great flavor that works so well to build that nice moist cupcake taste with nice vanilla notes. \r\nFLV vanilla Pudding.: This flavor is just such a great flavor perfect in so many desserts. I brings that nice creamy feeling to the recipe while adding a bit of wetness.\r\nCap: French vanilla or DiyFS french vanilla. just adds a bit more creamy vanilla flavor to recipe. If using caps give it extra day or two to steep.\r\nFW : Butterscoth This Flavor is just reall delicious when mixed low brings that sweet flavor that you would taste in a Donut or a nice balanced cupcake. \r\nFW Buttterscoth Ripple: This works well with the butterscoth to give a bit more richness to the cupcake and plays well with FW Butterscotch.\r\nFLV Frosting: This Flavor provides the nice icing flavor that you want on a real cupcake. It just adds that perfect amount of sweetness. \r\nInw biscuit  used this to add a bit of texture to the recipe  authenticity of a real cupcake. \r\nCap Supersweet: This Flavor is optional but I like it as it adds just a bit more sweetness that I love in a recipe.\r\nI mixed this up at 70/30 and it taste good after a shake. I steeped for 5 days and it’s just so delicious everything just blends together so well to make the perfect sweet creamy Cupcake. Give it a try , I absolutely love it.","steep_days":"5","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-06T04:11:01.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"1535","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Vanilla Pudding","flavor_id":"4433","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Vanilla Cupcake","flavor_id":"187","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Butterscotch","flavor_id":"1216","vendor":"FW","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Butterscotch Ripple","flavor_id":"1217","vendor":"FW","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Frosting","flavor_id":"4412","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":750},{"name":"Biscuit","flavor_id":"642","vendor":"INW","millipercent":750},{"name":"Super Sweet","flavor_id":"2384","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":500},{"name":"French Vanilla","flavor_id":"4977","vendor":"DFS","millipercent":1500}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"74730","name":"Seduction cupcake "}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
