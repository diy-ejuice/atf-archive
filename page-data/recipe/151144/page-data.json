Being married to a wonderful Japanese lady, who are heavily into buddhism, I started to look up what kind of food, the original Buddha's (yes there are a few of them) would actually eat.\r\nRice was a given and after much researchning I came up with a few recipes.\r\nA sweet/floral one and a more sweet/savory one.\r\n\r\nThis one being the sweet/savory one.\r\nInitially, this was the original idea for my Buddha vapes, which nicknamed \"Project Buddha\" in order to cause a little hype on the DIY_eJuice Discord.\r\nThe very first dish I came across, that seemed doable for a vape and something the different Buddha's would eat, was rice with mango.\r\nPretty straight forward, but the more I worked on it, the more messy it got.\r\nAt some point I had the whole rose apples aspect from Part One mixed into it and by the end of the day, it was over-flavoring so hardcore, that all you could taste was rice and a strange unidentifiable weak sweetness. NOT THE PLAN!\r\nSo after spending a little time with @Shyndo trying to fix this mess, I made the decision to turn it into two recipes.\r\n\r\nChoices:\r\n\r\nThe Rice: is made from FA Sweet Rice and VT Rice Base. I found this combo to be pretty much what nicely steamed basmati rice tastes like.\r\n\r\nFLV Cream: helps to bind the rice together, but only just enough to not turn it into a creamy rice pudding, as it wouldn't fit the profile. By all means, this is not really a dessert.\r\n\r\nSpicy Mango: I went for FLV Mango here for the sort of main mango flavor, as it is almost what I would consider to be the flavor of an actual mango. However, I felt it lacked a tiny bit bitterness in the aftertaste from the peel, I considered many options. Here both TFA mango (didn't fit), JF Mango (way too bitter!) and FW Mango Guava (no and no, definitely not fitting). Neither of these working, I finally settled for VT Shisha Mango.\r\nI felt VT Shisha Mango added both to help FLV Mango with the sweet and added exactly a tiny amount of bitterness I was after.\r\nFLV Rose Essence comes into play here again as it does help the rice giving it a bit of fragnance and it does add a sort of perfume to the mango.\r\n\r\nConcerning spices I had some ideas: \r\nAt some point FLV Rich Cinnamon was in play, but as I did not wanted this to be a dessert and I didn't quite see the connection, I scrapped that idea quickly. For a long time, I had FA Cardamom on the table and I had planned to actually pull through with it, but in a previous version I realised that it actually didn't do much good for the vape and added an unwanted off-flavor - while still being good, not what I was after.\r\nFinally, I landed on FLV Heat, which also had been on the table for a long time. Both Heat and Cardamom was in the original line-up, but Shyndo being Shyndo, I realised that I couldn't have both in this vape, so I made a choice and FLV Heat stayed in to give the vape the spice (plus add some good throat hit!).\r\n\r\nConcerning FLV Heat: 0.5% is my prefered. If you want it higher or lower (or not even at all), just adjust accordingly. I suggest you leave it in, as it is one of the key components.\r\n\r\nOn the inhale, you'll taste the wonderful flavor of sweet mango mixed with a pleasent amount of heat. Not too spicy, but nice and moderate.\r\nThe exhale mellows out the mango and leave you with a bit of warmth and a delicious creamy flavor of steamed basmati rice.\r\n\r\nNo real steep is needed for this, as FE Sweet Rice has a habit of fading, but over a day or two, it'll become more creamy and delicious. Works great as a SnV!\r\n\r\nHope you'll enjoy and feel free to leave a review!\r\n","steep_days":"1 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:50:55.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"1602","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Sweet Rice","vendor":"FE","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Rice Base","vendor":"VT","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Heat","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":500},{"name":"Mango","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":2750},{"name":"Cream","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":750},{"name":"Shisha Mango","vendor":"VT","millipercent":1250},{"name":"Rose Essence","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1000}],"reviews":[{"user":"ID10-T","text":"This is a perfectly good slightly spicy mango on top of a pile of absolutely perfect rice. A very unusual savory-ish vape done very well, everything has a wonderfully authentic flavor.  Kind of a dry finish despite the juicy mango, but I think that’s the price you pay for really perfect rice. The lingering spice and rice is satisfying, almost like I’ve really just eaten this dish.
