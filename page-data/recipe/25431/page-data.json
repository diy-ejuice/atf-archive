Hmm... All wonderfully utilitarian concentrates but all helper flavors, not really suited for leading a recipe to the top of the box office. So what do you do when given a basket full of solid supporting actors? Showcase them as such, and cast yourself a leading lady with some exotic sex appeal! In this case, the lovely and talented FLV Mango! And how do you make it a blockbuster? Give her a love interest, of course! Enter: TFA Green Tea, a Lipton tea bag type green tea with a bit of a grassy note that’s a little unfortunate for fruits alone but easily covered up by something creamy. \r\n\r\nSo the romance between our star, sweet, juicy FLV Mango, and TFA Green Tea takes center stage, but who are these other characters and what are their roles? For all her beauty, FLV Mango has an annoying habit of sitting right on top of the recipe. The hefty weight of CAP Sweet Mango pulls her down, into the tea and beyond, so that the taste of mango permeates the experience. FA Pear also adds a nice pomaceous sweetness that builds a bridge between the mango and tea, but his main task here is to provide a wetter mouthfeel for this beverage-inspired vape. Meanwhile, FA Lemon Sicily enhances the citrusy top notes that are part of what being a mango is all about, speaking up for those high notes partially muted by milky ingredients while the deeper mango tones hold their own. FA Whipped Cream easily makes this a milk tea, with the assistance of a touch of FW Hazelnut to give it the savoriness of milk. Hazelnut also teams up surprisingly well with one final ingredient, CAP Jelly Candy, to give you a textural surprise like those delightfully gummy tapioca pearls. Because it’s just not boba tea without the balls to suck through those fat straws.
