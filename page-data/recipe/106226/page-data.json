When Flavorah came out with Apple Filling and Apple Pop I mixed them with FA Apple Pie and FA Fuji originally. However, when I discovered PUR Country Apple I thought immediately after trying it that this would probably replace FA Fuji in my Hillbilly Pop recipe.  Here is how I built this recipe.\r\n\r\nThe base is \r\nFVV Apple Filling\r\nFLV Apple Pop\r\nFA Apple Pie\r\nPUR Country Apple \r\nFA Amber (for that nice fermented apple touch)\r\n \r\nSome body for the recipe\r\n\r\nCAP butter Cream adds some body and helps smooth out the pie portion of the recipe\r\n\r\nSupporting and and polishing  the recipe\r\n\r\nFA Whisky of course adds the alcohol note that makes this recipe authentic. I tried other types but FA Whisky seemed to carry that note well.\r\nFA Shade helps to separate the apple from the alcohol and helps to smooth out the recipe.\r\n\r\nI really enjoy this and find it to be a very interesting e-liquid to vape on. It's pretty accurate and those who like the alcohol type vape will probably\r\nenjoy vaping this as much as I do. It sure is different than most other e-liquids I vape.\r\n\r\nTo note, FA Shade can be left out but it makes the vape a bit harsher but a bit stronger. Sometimes I use it and other times I don't. If you try this recipe\r\nI suggest trying it first with FA Shade and then once without. You can SNV but I normally give at least 3 days for the Whiskey to settle down a bit.","steep_days":"3","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-02T08:14:50.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"1229","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Apple Filling","flavor_id":"4376","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Apple Pie","flavor_id":"551","vendor":"FA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Apple Pop","flavor_id":"4380","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":500},{"name":"Butter Cream","flavor_id":"3","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":500},{"name":"Country Apple","flavor_id":"7754","vendor":"PUR","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Liquid Amber","flavor_id":"476","vendor":"FA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Shade","flavor_id":"438","vendor":"FA","millipercent":250},{"name":"Whisky","flavor_id":"556","vendor":"FA","millipercent":2500}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"106226","name":"Hillbilly Pop"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
