DIY Flavor Shack knocked it out of the park with this Li Hing Mui flavoring. It has a nice light floral character with notes of cherry and plum. Naturally, it is the star here. Once I tested LHM it screamed for a pairing with FW Watermelon. The two complement each other so well. \r\n\r\nRF Candy Base (The VG version, NOT the SC!) just sweetens the bargain, adds some body, and rounds out this recipe. I prefer this mix a touch sweeter, to really drive home the \"candy\" feel, hence the Erythritol.\r\n\r\nWorks well as a shake-n-vape, but 2-3 days allows the flavors to marry and the notes to round off, as with any mix. That's the sweet spot. The RF Candy Base shines through nicely at that point.","steep_days":"2 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-10T15:59:57.000-05:00","best_vg":"60%","views":"1517","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Candy Base","flavor_id":"2235","vendor":"RF","millipercent":5000},{"name":"Erythritol Solution","flavor_id":"4491","vendor":"OTHR","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Li Hing Mui","flavor_id":"5055","vendor":"DFS","millipercent":5000},{"name":"Watermelon","flavor_id":"1458","vendor":"FW","millipercent":2000}],"reviews":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"37312","name":"Li Hing Mui (Asian Plum Candy)"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
