As I began mixing I slowly began to collect an array of floral flavors, and this recipe represents some of my favorite elements from these flavors.\r\n\r\nTPA Cherry Blossom: A faintly floral cherry, with a tart powdered candy type finish. At 4% this stands out brightly against some of the sweeter more syrupy flavors. A very delicate flavor, but not overly potent so this range works well. Once you take this over 4% it gets somewhat astringent.\r\n\r\nTPA Honeysuckle: A staple in any floral fan's arsenal. Brightly sweet and juicy, and not perfumey at all. At 4% it acts well as a bright juicy base to help blend the TPA Cherry Blossom just enough to stand out against some of the stronger flavors to follow.\r\n\r\nCAP Hibiscus: Mildly floral, but very sweet and almost syrupy in mouth feel. This flavor gets much more perfume like if you take it much higher than 2-3% so at 1.5% it adds just enough sweet hibiscus flavor to stand out from the TPA Cherry Blossom without overpowering it.\r\n\r\nCAP Sweet Lychee: Another syrupy sweet. Not very floral but it adds the \"Sweets\" for our candy profile very effective. Another flavor like CAP Hibiscus that goes to perfume at a high percentage, at 2% it's just enough to shine alongside the others, without overtaking them.\r\n\r\nINW Raspberry: A very potent, very sweet raspberry flavor. I was very hesitant to use it this high, but I found at lower percentages it just wasn't showing up. Much to my delight, at 1% it does a wonderful job tying the CAP Sweet Lychee and CAP Hibiscus together to finish our candied fruit profile, while still allowing the others to play their part.\r\n\r\nThis recipe is decent fresh, but in my humble opinion shines much more after a week steep in a dark cave while it thinks about it's life choices, and how it got here. It underwent countless revisions and revisits before I landed here. If you're into florals of any kind, this one is definitely worth a visit.","steep_days":"5","temperature":"0","recipe_score":4.9,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:49:12.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"5171","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Cherry Blossom (pg)","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Hibiscus","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Honeysuckle (pg)","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Raspberry","vendor":"INW","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Sweet Lychee","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":2000}],"reviews":[{"user":"Parad0x357","text":"Finally got around to test this classic, and I have to say, it's great! Thou I modified it a little bit: Added 0.5% FA Jammy/Candy Wizard, 0.5% WS-23 and swapped the 2% CAP Sweet Lychee for 1% FA Lychee, since I really don't like CAP Sweet Lychee. But those are no real big and/or impactful changes and just down to my personal perference. Overall, the profile is just great and kudos for making a tricky, floral profile work so flawlessly!"},{"user":"MotherPunker","text":"Really great mix, even though Lychee &amp; cherry blossom are really not my thing, I still enjoyed playing with this.  Ive never had the real thing so can't comment on the likeness, though this is what I imagine one would taste like.  The hibiscus does a great job of creating a syrupy candy finish in the mouth &amp; honeysuckle.... does one really need a reason to like seeing that in anything?  Nice job kopel :)"},{"user":"fluid85","text":""},{"user":"Ebc88","text":"After a month steep this is amazing. Hands down a 5 ⭐️ Recipe"},{"user":"Deweysuds","text":"Two week steep.  Nice tart floral candy.  A very nice hard candy note without any sweetner or candy.  Well done on that part.  Gives all the experience one would get from eating one of these candies.  Well crafted and inspiring.  "},{"user":"BradH","text":"Nicely done. Checked it out after the \"noted\" episode you were on.
