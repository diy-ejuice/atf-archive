Played around with this one for awhile and hit spot on Welch's Grape Soda IMO. \r\n\r\nNo strange perfume or floral flavors. Not a dry vape, but not super wet.  The grapes and champagne flavors play well together and the double apple brings it together. I use two sweeteners because they are different alone,. Together they give me something I like. I may be wrong, but it floats my boat in several of my mixes. A little sour wizard. You can leave it off if you are not a sour fan, but it won't be quite the same.\r\n\r\nNice shake and vape. Better after one to two days. After a week still nice and flavorful. I do let it breathe for a few hours after mixing it.\r\n\r\nTell me what you think and enjoy.","steep_days":"2 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-06T20:50:04.000-05:00","best_vg":"75%","views":"2486","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Grape Juice","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":5000},{"name":"Grape","vendor":"INW","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Champagne Type (pg)","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Double Apple","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Sour Wizard","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Super Sweet","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":750},{"name":"Sweetener","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":500}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"59397","name":"üçáGrape Sodie Popüçá"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
