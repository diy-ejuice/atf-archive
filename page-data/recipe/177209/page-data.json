Luckily, mother nature has provided us with a  veritable smorgasbord of fruity wonders, including the must underrated Papaya.\r\n\r\nI love, love, love the inherent bitterness & body of TPA Papaya which lays the substructure here. It perfectly balances the sweetness of the other fruits, whilst boosting the mouthfeel to create a thick, full vaping experience.\r\n\r\nFE Mango perfectly encapsulates the very best a fresh, ripe & luscious mango. Used at 1%, it masterfully imparts the essence of mango & allows the mango to shine.\r\n\r\nA splash of CAP Cantaloupe & a smidgen of Peach juicy keep things nice and moist & deepens the melange of fresh, ripe fruit without distraction.\r\n\r\nFA Coconut enhances the creaminess & imparts a delicate, natural coconut edge. It is barely noticeable (which was the  intention) and allows coconut haters the opportunity to experiment with this stunning multi-use beauty.\r\n\r\nGive this baby 2 days or so to settle.\r\n","steep_days":"2 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:51:15.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"1232","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Papaya","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Mango","vendor":"FE","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Peach (juicy)","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Cantaloupe","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Coco' (coconut)","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000}],"reviews":[{"user":"NOVITEC","text":"This recipe is bomb!
