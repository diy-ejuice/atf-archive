I have quickly turned it into one of my ADV. I made it for a girlfriend who is a big fan of pineapple. She wanted to be on a beach somewhere & this is what I came up with.

I love the way all the flavors mingle and you can still pick them out. Very nice balance for a fruit blend. I will say I did not mix this 1:1, I sub'd the CAP Sweet Guava for FLV Pink Guava @ 0.5% and I can see where your iteration is probably better. Very nice work!","score":5}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"48685","name":"Bombshell"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
