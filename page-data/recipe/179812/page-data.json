I just provide the necessary building blocks.\r\nEnjoy..","steep_days":"10","temperature":"0","recipe_score":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-12T06:59:53.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"1589","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Basil","flavor_id":"4387","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":400},{"name":"Blueberries & Cream â€“ Super Concentrate","flavor_id":"7847","vendor":"RF","millipercent":1250},{"name":"Blueberry (wild)","flavor_id":"215","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2500},{"name":"French Vanilla Icecream","flavor_id":"2129","vendor":"HS","millipercent":1100},{"name":"Blueberry (extra)","flavor_id":"218","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Vanilla Pudding","flavor_id":"4433","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1250},{"name":"Berry Blend","flavor_id":"4395","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1000}],"reviews":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"179812","name":"Blueberry Basil Ice Cream"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
