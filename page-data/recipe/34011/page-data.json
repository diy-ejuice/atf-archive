I like to mix it at 75/25. Tastes great and easy to make. \r\nMix it up!\r\nMy INW Cherries is from Bull City, thereâ€™s seems to be a difference when it comes from Flavor Jungle. The one I use has a sort of spice to it, but still cherry whereas the one from FJ smells like cherry juice or something. I may switch it if I like that one better","steep_days":"4 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T23:35:26.000-05:00","best_vg":"75%","views":"1812","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Cherries","vendor":"INW","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Cherryl (cherry, Black)","vendor":"FA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Lemon Lime","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Lemonade","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Lemon Sicily","vendor":"FA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Lime Tahity Cold Pressed","vendor":"FA","millipercent":500}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"34011","name":"Cherry Lee Lewis"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
