There is only slight layering in this mix as I get creamy soft vanilla and nutmeg notes at the initial exhale with apple filling and caramel notes following at the end. The recipe does not need much explanation other than the Apple Cider adds a little brightness to the Apple Filling, and the Milk & Honey brings in a little sweetness.\r\n\r\nThis is my ode to Bryson and Flavorah. Without any prompting on my part Bryson reached out and offered up 15 sample flavorings only noting that I was active and engaged in the community (not because I'm some kind of prolific mixing wizard - thank goodness - LOL)","steep_days":"4","temperature":"0","recipe_score":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-11T17:21:43.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"752","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Vanilla Pudding","flavor_id":"4433","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Apple Filling","flavor_id":"4376","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":3500},{"name":"Eggnog","flavor_id":"4396","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":500},{"name":"Caramel","flavor_id":"612","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":500},{"name":"Milk & Honey","flavor_id":"609","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":500},{"name":"Apple Cider","flavor_id":"4368","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":250}],"reviews":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"173719","name":"Apple Cuddle"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
