The ice cream man @eyemakepizza is about to be a father. To toast this, I've mixed a blue \"milk\".\r\n\r\nWhat fun would it be if we made a straight forward blueberry cream? It has to be more than that. So I chose to go for a less common fruit (the pun didn't hurt). But then I was stuck, do I really want to just have a milk or cream base under this gooey boysenberry? Absolutely not. So while staying in the spirit of milk I choose to do a horchata.\r\n\r\nThe recipe is pretty straightforward,\r\n\r\nFLV boysenberry is delicious and pairing it with PUR boysenberry preserves helps push it a little sweeter, and give it a little more if the syrupy feel I wanted.\r\n\r\nThe horchata is a balancing act\r\nFLV horchata bring a nice layer of both the cinnamon and rice flavors, but I felt that reinforcing it a bit with the rich cinnamon to stand up to the boysenberries and the rice base to help mitigate fading was prudent. TFA's Bavarian cream was chosen for the relatively neutral vanilla and just a little bit of DAAP-y creaminess.\r\n\r\nSpecial shout out to @rainbowdragon for helping with the art(okay, that's selling her efforts short, she did all the work) in this month's series of MC recipes","steep_days":"7","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:51:23.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"805","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Boysenberry","flavor_id":"614","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1250},{"name":"Boysenberry Preserves","flavor_id":"7741","vendor":"PUR","millipercent":2250},{"name":"Horchata","flavor_id":"4439","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Bavarian Cream","flavor_id":"145","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Rice Base","flavor_id":"8954","vendor":"VT","millipercent":500},{"name":"Rich Cinnamon","flavor_id":"638","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":100}],"reviews":[{"user":"nowar","text":"I got to try this in MC without the knowledge of what's in it. This here didn't present itself to me as a Blue Rice Milk treat per se. What I got was a really interesting blue jam with something in between a muffin and a cake donut covered in a light sprinkle of powdered sugar. Something about how the rice base played off the horchata, mixed with the blend of spices gave me that impression of a slightly toasted powdery treat. And it is a treat. The focus here is on how that boysenberry comes through less like an overbearing filling to the a healthy donut, but rather as blended into the mix and just present throughout. Probably the best muffinnotmuffin mix I've ever had. Made me commit to purchasing flv horchata.
