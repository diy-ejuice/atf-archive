Being married to a wonderful Japanese lady, who are heavily into buddhism, I started to look up what kind of food, the original Buddha's (yes there are a few of them) would actually eat.\r\nRice was a given and after much researchning I came up with a few recipes.\r\nA sweet/floral one and a more sweet/savory one.\r\n\r\nThis one here are the sweet/floral one.\r\nIt's based off on the a rice dish mixed with what we currently know as a Rose Apple - or more commonly (cause there are MANY Rose Apples), a Java Apple.\r\nWhile a Java Apple actually not being an apple at all, but got its name due to its colour, it's more of a melon-ish, snow pear-ish type of fruit.\r\nIt's found in wide areas in South East Asia.\r\nA lot of credit here goes to @Shyndo and @Alfredpudding for ideas and help choosing the flavors for the Rose Apple\r\n\r\nChoices:\r\n\r\nThe Rice: is made from FA Sweet Rice and VT Rice Base. I found this combo to be pretty much what nicely steamed basmati rice tastes like.\r\n\r\nFLV Cream: helps to bind the rice together, but only just enough to not turn it into a creamy rice pudding, as it wouldn't fit the profile. By all means, this is not really a dessert.\r\n\r\nRose Apple: Shyndo and Alfred both chipped in here. Alfred suggested using CAP Sweet Guava, to add some of the flavor and the flesh along with TFA pear and \r\nFLV Rose Essence for flavor. While Shyndo chipped in (agreeing unknowingly with Alfred) on the pear and rose essence. Shyndo went further and suggested to add some honeysuckle, as honeysuckle and rose essence could be a killer combo - and I agree.\r\n\r\nCombine the rice and the rose apple and it's a great sweet and floral vape, with a wonderful rice flavor on the exhale.\r\n\r\nNo real steep is needed for this, as FE Sweet Rice has a habit of fading, but over a day or two, it'll become more creamy and delicious. Works great as a SnV!\r\n\r\nHope you'll enjoy and feel free to leave a review!","steep_days":"2","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:50:56.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"2819","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Sweet Rice","flavor_id":"7727","vendor":"FE","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Rice Base","flavor_id":"8954","vendor":"VT","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Pear","flavor_id":"257","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":750},{"name":"Rose Essence","flavor_id":"10093","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Honeysuckle (pg)","flavor_id":"306","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":750},{"name":"Cream","flavor_id":"604","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":750},{"name":"Sweet Guava","flavor_id":"118","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":3000}],"reviews":[{"user":"ID10-T","text":"Absolutely fabulous recipe, FLV Rose Essence is worth having just to be able to make this. Tastes like some kind of exotic sweet apple-pear-thing with a delightful little unfamiliar floral aspect, natural, not at all a candy thing despite being quite sweet. And it’s situated on top of a delicious pile of rice is so spot-on. The whole thing tastes intricate without being weak in flavor. Has a full spectrum of flavor, start to finish, that’s very satisfying. Both exciting and relaxing somehow, like being on vacation somewhere exotic but being lazy and doing nothing there. I fucking love it, it might be the best recipe I’ve tried all year that I didn’t make myself. I need to get my hands on one of these rose apples, apparently, if they taste like this. "},{"user":"RainbowDragon","text":"The taste of this reminds me of jasmine rice but creamier. I wouldn't make it my adv but it's fantastic. I was told that it's not for everyone and it's wierd but it really isnt wierd. Rosy rice-y goodness. 10/10 would recommend."},{"user":"folkart","text":"Thick creamy savory Rice base with baked apples and hints of rose....most excellent. Very nice job bending that pear into an apple. Has a slight APness that really sells the rice base. Savory, creamy, apple sweetness with just a hint of floral essence ....perfect! Might could be on the best recipe of the year list.  Great job man!&#xD;\n"},{"user":"AlfredPudding","text":"I'm so impressed with this recipe. It actually manages to make VT Rice Base work at 1%, and I didn't think that was even possible. It's seriously a beautiful creation. The combination of TPA Pear, TPA Honeysuckle, FLV Rose Essence, and CAP Sweet Guava manages to sell the rose apple idea perfectly. The florals actually tie into the fruits so well that I don't know if I could call it a floral vape. FLV Cream works perfectly in the background to fill this out and bring a nice, delicate cream into the background with the rice combination. Please do yourself a favor and mix this one up ASAP.
