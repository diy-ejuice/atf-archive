Sweet enough but not overly sweet, it can also be mixed without any sweetner simply up the FA meringue to around 0.60. The flavor percentage is a little higher than my usual recipes, but intentionally so as my goal was mimicking a mainstream juice. A few quick flavor notes-Vanilla Custard: It's 2am and the strawberries are lonely and looking for something to cling too. CAP VC at 1.5% fits the bill perfectly without turning it into a custard vape. Bavarian Cream and sweet cream tag team to boost the dairy component along with a little marshmallow. Fa Caramel/Fa torrone- These two are bit players in this recipe making cameo appearances only. I like my caramel on the sharp side and FA cuts like a knife, Torrone provides a mysterious nutty goodness and provides a oohey gooey texture to any recipe. Strawberry Sweet- This provides that over the top artificial strawberry we all know and love but fades over time, this is where strawberry ripe steps in and helps boost the flavor slightly. FA Meringue- this simply adds a little sweetness to the mix along with CAP super sweet...enjoy.","steep_days":"3 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":4,"total_reviews":1,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:48:59.000-05:00","best_vg":"75%","views":"1322","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Bavarian Cream","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Cream Fresh","vendor":"FA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Strawberry (ripe)","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Sweet Strawberry","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":8000},{"name":"Vanilla Custard","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Torrone","vendor":"FA","millipercent":250},{"name":"Carmel (caramel)","vendor":"FA","millipercent":250},{"name":"Sweet Cream","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Meringue","vendor":"FA","millipercent":300},{"name":"Super Sweet","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":200},{"name":"Marshmallow","vendor":"FA","millipercent":400}],"reviews":[{"user":"kitu5","score":"4","text":"Wanted to mix something up for Easter, and found this. I mean, yeah, strawberry cream...really says Easter. But hell with it, It's called Cottontail Cream, close enough, so a-mixin we shall go. &#xD;\n&#xD;\nThis one's interesting. Ran through a tank in my Ammit, which is my flavor chasing tank. It took almost 3/4 of the tank to taste the strawberries. And there's a *LOT* of strawberry in this, so that's saying something. So, now I'm running it in my Ares, which is a MTL tank with damned good flavor and can be switched to a fairly restricted DTL. Both ways, the inhale is a rich cream with a goodly amount of vanilla, and a touch of nuttiness. The strawberry shows up in that moment where the inhale flips just before the exhale, and it's vibrant enough for that moment. The exhale is a gooey creamy puff of sweetness. Hard to really put my finger on what it is, but it's interesting enough I killed a tankfull trying to figure it out.&#xD;\n&#xD;\nThe issue I have with this is there's just way too much going on. This is tasty without a doubt. The more I vape it, the more I like it. While it's fun separating the layers out, the initial and final thought is that this is muddled. Tasty as hell, but muddled. I think the marshmallow mutes things considerably, and it could probably do without the sweet or fresh cream. Just way too much going on there. The caramel and torrone add enough mouthfeel and sweetness, and the Bavarian cream and vanilla custard add the creaminess and other tones to make the cream nice and \"fluffy\" if that makes sense. Some consolidation would go a long way, and make the strawberries stand out more. While I like the kiss of strawberry in this, I'd like to taste it a little more, given there's so much of it in there.&#xD;\n&#xD;\nAs the recipe stands now, I'm forced to lowball it at a 4. I can see where it's going, and with a little tweaking, this can be a standout strawberry and cream with a little extra to make the most standardized profile in vaping zing, and be unique.&#xD;\n&#xD;\nThis one's for people who like strawberries and cream, but want something more, people who like puzzling out layers of flavor, or those who like a sweet nutty cream that's been kissed with a fruit as it goes by.&#xD;\n&#xD;\nPretty damned good. I'll get back to you once I've tried it with the alterations I've suggested."}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"25878","name":"Cottontail Cream "}}}
