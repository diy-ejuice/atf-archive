At 4% you get a nice fluffy white cake with a little bit of vanilla frosting. I’ve added the TFA Vanilla Custard II to add to the depth and make it a little darker. \r\n\r\n\r\nCAP Sweet Strawberry is so good. It’s a nice in between artificial and natural strawberry. CAP Vanilla Whipped cream for a nice fluffy cream on top. And a little bit of CAP Sugar Cookie to make the cake a little drier. \r\n\r\nWatch the Video Here: https://youtu.be/4WploIH0Ti8","steep_days":"3","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:51:42.000-05:00","best_vg":"80%","views":"826","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Sweet Strawberry","flavor_id":"121","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Vanilla Cupcake","flavor_id":"129","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Vanilla Whipped Cream","flavor_id":"1","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Sugar Cookie","flavor_id":"115","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Vanilla Custard 2","flavor_id":"10427","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2000}],"reviews":[{"user":"Vinderex","text":"The aroma alone was amazing, and made it extremely difficult to let it steep.  I just couldn't wait to try it!&#xD;\nSo after just an overnight steep, I'm already loving it.  It's floury and biscuit-like with just the right amount of sweetness, and the strawberry compliments it nicely without being overpowering.  I'll definitely be making more of this in the future!"}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"202720","name":"Strawberry Shortcake "}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
