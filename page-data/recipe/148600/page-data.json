It is visible only to wizards and cats. It is generally described as a sort of greenish purple yellow colour. The only time non-wizards can see it is when they close their eyes; the bursts of color are octarine.\r\n\r\nDevelopment notes:\r\nThis recipie was inspired by @foment_life, who wisely said \"I do love the idea of just toying around with a bunch of things that are just individually tasty and seeing what shakes out in the end.\"\r\n\r\nWell, this is the result of that.","steep_days":"1 (SNV)","temperature":"420","recipe_score":5,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:50:53.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"2838","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Pistachio","flavor_id":"293","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Blueberry","flavor_id":"2076","vendor":"HS","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Yellow Cake","flavor_id":"4560","vendor":"JF","millipercent":1000}],"reviews":[{"user":"TheJuiceJackBuilt","text":"Cant really add much more than what's been said already.

You know the Chris Pratt meme \"I don't know whats going on, and at this point I'm too afraid to ask\" ? That's this recipe. It's delightfully, deliciously blue.  I'm not going to pretend I know what the TFA Pistachio is doing or what the JF Yellow Cake is doing. But they're doing something and they're doing it well.   10/10 "},{"user":"ID10-T","text":"If I didn’t know this was going to be weird by the description, I could have braced for it to be weird by the ingredients. Pretty much anything starring HS Blueberry is going to be at least little odd, as it tastes more like the color electric blue in a bottle than a blueberry. The question was whether it was going to be delightfully weird or just weird weird. The answer is delightfully, and weird in the way that’s hard to put down. It’s very HS Blueberry-forward but the Pistachio and touch of Yellow Cake are doing strange things to it. I don’t get any pistachio or cake out of this, but they fill it out and make it rich and almost creamy, and they seem to “cook” it in a way that’s hard to wrap my head around and even harder to explain. Not cooked blueberry, but cooked electric blue color. Imagine you had a muffin, but instead of blueberries it was baked with little balls of blue neon light in it. Pluck out those lights after it’s baked and look at them. Since they were really a color and not a flavor, they’ve changed color. They’re Octarine now. I’m going to have to keep an eye on this Staybert character… &#xD;\n"}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"148600","name":"1-2-3 Octarine"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
