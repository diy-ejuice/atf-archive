With this little touch makes the recipe twice better.\r\n\r\nWs-23: adjust to your own preference i suggest 1% is best, but for me is a bit low so thats why i posted 2%... feel free to add your go to percentage.\r\n\r\nEdit: I think the profile is better with more berry flavour than grape so i dropped both grapes 1% and added 0.25% boysenberry.","steep_days":"7 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T23:37:50.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"1303","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Berry Blend","flavor_id":"4395","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Grape Juice","flavor_id":"231","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":4000},{"name":"WS-23","flavor_id":"8085","vendor":"OTHR","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Super Sweet","flavor_id":"2384","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":500},{"name":"Boysenberry","flavor_id":"614","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":750},{"name":"Grape Soda","flavor_id":"1300","vendor":"FW","millipercent":2000}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"155530","name":"A$AP B'RRY"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
