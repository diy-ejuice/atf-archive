It's just overwhelmingly busy with the fruity top notes. It wouldn't be a strap-on anymore, but I'd like to try it again with either the apple, strawberries, or melons removed. Probably the apple seems most out of place; it tastes like a good start to something like a melon-strawberry milk. No matter what, I wouldn't change that vanilla milk base; it's heavenly.
