No seriously this is delicious and addicting and if you enjoy ry-4 recipes then you will most likely love this. The one thing I will say is toffee ice cream  is absolutely  ment to be used with ry-4 double they are perfect for each other. My only other notes are mix it already!!! 😎😎😎😁😁😁😁. The only critical ingredients are the toffee ice cream and the ry-4 double. Everything else can easily be subbed butter toffee buy real flavors can be subbed with your favorite caramel or of course toffee flv. Vanilla cream extra can be subbed using any vanilla cream.
