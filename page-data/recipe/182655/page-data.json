An old secret most southern women know, is if you run out of buttermilk, you can mix a little lemon juice with milk to get that flavor.  Here we used Lemon and whipped cream to fake out that tangy buttermilk taste.  For the crust we're using a trick I heard from Developed Cookie/Sugar Cookie.  Custard gives it that creaminess you need, and without butter, well bless your heart you just ain't living!   Don't go getting your panties in a wad, or jumping the gun, because it takes  a few days for that lemon and whipped cream to mix.  If you try this on the shake and vape you're gonna get a sweet lemon curd, which ain't half bad, but sweetheart, it ain't buttermilk either.
