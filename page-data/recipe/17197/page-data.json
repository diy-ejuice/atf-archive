Creamy, milky, balanced cinnamon that isn't in your face but provides warmth and a bit of spice.  The strawberry was used to not only brighten the apple but smooth it out, seeing as strawberry ripe contains some EM.  Cinnamon danish boosts the cinnamon in CAP Horchata.  Overall a delightful fall vape, been really enjoying this profile throughout the month of october.
