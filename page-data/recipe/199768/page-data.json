I found myself not wanting to pull the wick out and switch to something new once finished"},{"user":"spicemustflow","text":"This is really something special. Ever since I started doing DIY I've been chasing a quality, well balanced donut recipe that doesn't need a long steep but has enough going on that I can vape it all day without getting bored. Several years later, I think I've found The One. Big ups to you RUG_ly! Looking forward to trying some of your other recipes soon."},{"user":"robolto78","text":"Another great recipe. This one is good enough off the shake I had to make a second 30 ml to steep. "}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"199768","name":"Raspberry Cream Donut"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
