Autumn/Winter is my all time favorite time of year.  It's the time to start putting away all the fruity, light flavors and once again start breaking out the heavy custards, creams and bakeries (my specialty). So, to start it off I decided to share this little number. A tasty almond custard RY4. Very simple recipe and a pretty basic profile. Nonetheless, it's freakin' scrumptious and perfect for that Fall vaping. Throw a hoodie on and walk the leaf invested streets. Give this baby some time, the custard needs it as does the tobacco. 10 days and you're golden Pony Boy..\r\n\r\nFLV Milk & Honey and CAP Graham Cracker really bump up the almond custard flavor here. The graham even brings a bit of cinnamon without even having cinnamon, I love it. But anyways, give it a shot, I promise you won't be disappointed.","steep_days":"10","temperature":"375","recipe_score":5,"total_reviews":1,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:49:28.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"1951","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"RY4 Double","vendor":"JF","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Milk & Honey","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Cured Tobacco","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1250},{"name":"Graham Cracker","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":500},{"name":"Toasted Almond","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Vanilla Custard","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":2500}],"reviews":[{"user":"Rawtune","score":"5","text":"You recommended this to me my first day on discord and I'm glad I finally got all the ingredients and mixed this up.&#xD;\n&#xD;\nThis recipe just tastes like fall to me-- I don't even know how to explain it.
