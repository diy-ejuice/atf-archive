Ive never went through so many batches as I did this one. I started off with Inw Milk chocolate but it simply did not work here..The chocolate wouldnt come through and it wasnt very nice to my cotton (It bothers me to vape a juice that discolors my cotton). Also Fa Raspberry ive had luck in the past with chocolates but also something just wouldnt work here with it.. I also tried subbin CAP Yellow cake instead of JF but in the end i stuck with JF yellow cake.  \r\nJF Yellow Cake 4%\r\nFA Marshmallow 1%\r\nFA Almond 1%  \r\nFA Marzipan 2.25%\r\nFW Hazelnut 1%\r\nTFA Raspberry Sweet .75%\r\nINW Shisha Strawberry 1%\r\nFA Liquid Amber .3%\r\nTFA Double Chocolate Clear 2.5%  \r\nHS Australian Chocolate .75%\r\n Sucralose .5% \r\n 11 concentrates is alot for me but IMO needed here 15.05% total flavoring.  \r\nAlmond Cake \r\nFa marzipan/ JF yellow cake/ Fa Almond/ Fw Hazelnut/ Fa Marshmallow\r\nThese are one of my favorite cookies and i always wanted them in vape form... It wasnt until recentky that i bought a 3pack in 711 that i saw on the package it was almond flavored cake. This gave me a good starting point. Thanks /u/ID10-T for suggesting the marzipan because its the star of the show. Adding fa almond and fw hazelnut just boost it up and the hazelnut at 1% adds nuttyiness without changing which type of nut it is. Jf Yellow cake is just my favorite cake base and worked here over CaPs version.. Fa Marshmallow is added for a bit of sweetness and to just fluff up that cake a bit. Caps vanilla cupcake worked nicely in place of the marshmallow but in the end i preffered the marsh.   \r\nThe Jam  \r\ntfa raspberry sweet/ Inw Shisha strawberry/ Fa liquid amber  \r\nShisha strawberry is jammy so i wanted to use this as the base of the jam. My first probably 15 batches were with FA raspberry but it just didnt work as good as the raz sweet. Liquid amber at a small amount just mends the 2 together more and adds more jammyness.  \r\nthe Chocolate \r\ntfa double choc/ hs aus choco\r\nI really wanted to use inw milk chocolate but it was just not cooperating here and making the juice too dark for my taste without giving much chocolate flavor. double chocolate with aus choco works nicely and not an overpowering chocolate to still let the almond cake and jam shine. at my local bakey i recently discovered these same cookies but with white chocolate i am defiently going to play with that see where i end up\r\nsucralose is probably option but i tried it without and I need it to just bring things a bit forward for me\r\nHope yall enjoy!","steep_days":"7","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"total_reviews":3,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:49:04.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"2018","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Yellow Cake","vendor":"JF","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Double Chocolate (clear)","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Raspberry (sweet)","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":750},{"name":"Shisha Strawberry","vendor":"INW","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Marzipan","vendor":"FA","millipercent":2250},{"name":"Hazelnut","vendor":"FW","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Liquid Amber","vendor":"FA","millipercent":300},{"name":"Marshmallow","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Australian Chocolate","vendor":"HS","millipercent":750},{"name":"Almond","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"sweetener (sucralose)","vendor":"OTHR","millipercent":250}],"reviews":[{"user":"therealDR-GONZO","score":"none","text":""},{"user":"R2ME2","score":"5","text":"Deejay_mills you did an awesome job on this one.  Just mixed it up and it's delicious.  I was a bit nervous about the high percent of marzipan, but it works. Vaping it now on a Hadaly and can't wait to see what some steep time does to this beauty. Love the way everything plays so well together.  Hats off to you for this wonderful creation."},{"user":"triangulatethisdick","score":"none","text":"just reading this, scratched an itch i didnt know i had. not to mention i have all 11 flavors... whats the odds? &#xD;\nill be mixing this here shortly. and will update w/ a review"}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"29761","name":"ITALIAN 7"}}}
