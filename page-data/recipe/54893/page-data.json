The Apple Fuji really shines here as the top note, got love it. Then the Forrest Mix takes over, while both Peaches sweeten things up just right.\r\nI put the Cactus in there for more juiciness not totally needed. You might want to try Koolada (TPA) @ 1% or Polar Blast (FA) @ 2% for some coolness up to you.","steep_days":"7","temperature":"0","recipe_score":4,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:49:28.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"2571","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Cactus","vendor":"INW","millipercent":150},{"name":"Forrest Mix (forest Fruit Mix)","vendor":"FA","millipercent":3500},{"name":"Apple Fuji","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Peach (juicy)","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1750},{"name":"Sweetener","vendor":"FW","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Peach White","vendor":"FA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Polar Blast","vendor":"FA","millipercent":2000}],"reviews":[{"user":"jake1191","text":"A little preamble-I mixed this with 1% Koolada instead of Polar Blast. I get a lot of the Forrest Mix on the intake, with a nice sweet, cold peach exhale. I plan to drop the sweetener down to 1% on the next bottle I make just because its a bit sweet for me. Still a damn good recipe thats going into my daily rotation"},{"user":"SlashaLO","text":"To start off, I think, for me at least, the polar blast was too high. It muted almost all of the flavor for me. I've used it before at lower % with no issues. I wanted to mix as is to leave an accurate review. The other flavor combinations here seen great. What I can taste through the coolant is good though. I also tried koolada at 1% and it was much better. I don't know if it was the combo of flavors but all I could taste was sweet cold. I plan on missing without the coolant to try the flavors that way as well. &#xD;\n&#xD;\nThe Fuji does seem to take the top, followed by the first fruits then peach at the end. The flavor is great in that regard. "}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"54893","name":"Fuji Forest"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
