As I knew I could t cheat it and use undetectable amounts of some of the required ingredients. I've been looking for a good use of FLV chocolate Deutsch and I think this is on to something.\r\n\r\n1% flv chocolate Deutsch is not too heavy but still present. It has a great dark chocolate taste with hints of coconut and dense cake.\r\n\r\n.75% cap cinnamon danish swirl just to be enough to add to the dough and a slight cinnamon to the rest of the mix. This stuff is one of caps more potent flavors and I didn't want it's cinnamon note to take over.\r\n\r\n1% JF fuji adds a subtle sweet crisp apple note. Not as tart as fa Fuji which I like in this case.\r\n\r\n6% tpa Strawberry ripe. This flavor in my expirience has a tendency to due down and get overshadowed by other heavier flavors so I bumped this up a notch. For those not in the know this is a must have strawberry. Bright, sweet and authentic ripe as the name suggests.\r\n\r\n2% JF Bavarian cream. This has become my favorite of any of the Bavarian creams. Sweet and thick with a slight caramel to it. I like my German chocolate cake with a good thick cream filling or covering and this accomplishes that.\r\n\r\nLastly 1% fa hazelnut. I love what hazelnut adds to strawberry flavors adding some authenticity and creaminess and this adds the creaminess and slight nut taste I wanted. I almost decided to go with fa coconut as should be present in German chocolate cake but since this isn't really a authentic German chocolate cake I left the coconut note up to the flv chocolate Deutsch.\r\n\r\nA weeks worth of steep does this some good but is actually pleasant as a shake and vape.","steep_days":"0","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"total_reviews":null,"updated_at":"2020-11-26T13:06:54.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"993","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Chocolate Deutsch","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Cinnamon Danish Swirl","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":750},{"name":"Fuji","vendor":"JF","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Bavarian Cream","vendor":"JF","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Strawberry (ripe)","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":6000},{"name":"Hazel Grove (hazelnut)","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"15883","name":"Germanesque cake"}}}
