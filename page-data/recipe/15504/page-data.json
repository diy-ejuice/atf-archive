There's better recopies than this. You need to update the page or pass it down to someone that cares to keep up with the times.&#xD;\nI like skittles alot but make some  room for some real recipes.. Its enough already. Same for Grack juice. It's not that good."},{"user":"s2k","text":"...for this a 6th star was born&#xD;\nI can't tell you how many gallons of this I've vaped over the years...still one of my favs....I always keep some mixed. Its a great recipe and even more taste like vaping \"back then\" for me and its always a good throw back. Miss your madness, hope all is well with you and the fam!"},{"user":"Zugmaschine","text":"Iam disapoint. &#xD;\nAfter 3 weeks nearly zero strawberry taste. The rest is nothing special. Iam really sorry but there are much better Strawberry Creams out there."},{"user":"JeffVader","text":"There's a reason this appears on the main page for so long now. Can't believe it took me so long to try it:( For the last 6 or so months I've always a bottle of this on the shelf - a great staple in any DIYers recipe book methinks. Generally speaking also, can be put into any RDA etc without needing a cotton change, or can put another flavour over the top when you run out I've found. A tasty all-round easy to mix flavour profile and makes a fine ADV"},{"user":"Nickevz","text":"I can see where the fascination would have come from for this but i think with the concentrates available today it loses its appeal, but still a good mix nonetheless."},{"user":"1dyllic","text":"A very well balanced vape that is vapable from day one, but steadily improves over the course of a week. If you find that this mix feels \"empty\", I've found that adding 0.3 - 0.5% sweetener really fills the body out and makes this an enjoyable all day vape. "},{"user":"6r1pdro9","text":""},{"user":"YippYo","text":""},{"user":"kicker074","text":"I'm not a fan but a colleague of mine loves it, it's creamy and a little sweet but takes a while to steep and never hits the spot for me, favour is subjective and this one isn't for me "},{"user":"NikosD","text":"Even though it improved over time, I still can't say that it is a favourite for me. It is well balanced, creamy and slightly sweet but I find the over flavour a little underwhelming - I puff deeper and deeper in order to get some sort of saturation (that I never get). Maybe on more power intensive setups it is better."},{"user":"gravi-tea","text":"gave this probably a month steep in the cupboard and while my girlfriend enjoyed it it really tasted kind of bland to me. the mouthfeel is there but the strawberry almost totally faded out."},{"user":"sc0lm00","text":"2 weeks - This is a solid flavor. A bit more dragon fruit than I'd like, or better said more pronounced than I'd like. I never was big on dragon fruit at least as a primary element. While the dragon fruit isn't a primary flavor it's definitely noticeable enough. The core strawberry and cream is very solid and worth experimenting with. Definitely a solid flavor overall.&#xD;\n&#xD;\nAt 1 month this really excellent. The dragon fruit has calmed significantly. You can still taste the element right after the strawberry but itâ€™s far more blended in and has less of that dragon fruit bite to it. Nicely creamy and flavorful. Definitely easy to see why this one is popular.&#xD;\n&#xD;\nNotes - I made this same recipe sans the dragon fruit to see how it would work to build from. After revisiting it at 1 month though I might just try adding some NY cheesecake to it or sweet cream to suit my flavor preferences. Without the dragon fruit it definitely tastes like it's missing something. Another lesson learned, every flavor contributes to the whole and you can't always just axe what you don't like."},{"user":"AlfredPudding","text":"Bright and clean being the operative words. This strawberry and cream recipe reminds me of milk with a hefty helping of strawberry syrup mixed in. The strawberry flavor is extremely bright, thanks to the dragon fruit. The milky base made from a combination of bavarian cream and cheesecake (graham crust) is very mellow and enjoyable. As some people have said, as this steeps the strawberry does fade a bit. Overall this recipe is extremely well balanced and impressively made from all TPA flavors.  "},{"user":"RemoveHasperat","text":"As far as Strawberries and Creams go this one is really up there but I do find that the strawberries sometimes fade once the Cheesecake GC and Bav Cream get them where you want them. "},{"user":"alexis666","text":"What else can be said about God Milk? The first recipes that I liked and still one of my favourites and, in my opinion, one of the greatest recipes ever. I think it's just perfect. I don't think it is a strawberry milk, the biscuity base note makes it more complex than that but just enough to give it depth and dimension. It steeps really well as well. "},{"user":"MrEx","text":"This is the recipe I mix up to quiet DIY skeptics. It's also my most mixed by quantity (1000ml/month). Personally don't indulge...preferring more desert style to cream and fruit..."},{"user":"koldfusion","text":"This was my first mix. Hated it from the get go. 2 days later I was in love with it. Steeped 12 days and it is still my go to vape flavor. &#xD;\nAfter a month the creams get silky smooth and the taste of stems and plastic are mellowed out a bit.&#xD;\nThis would be a great recipe with a fruit I could taste right."},{"user":"evild","text":"So good."},{"user":"ooooNaSuGamisoooo","text":""},{"user":"Benoz","text":""},{"user":"Frin","text":"Did not care for it at all. Too much dragonfruit for me honestly. Its decent. Tried w/o the dragonfruit but again, wasnt all that much again."},{"user":"andreaelle","text":""},{"user":"DODO","text":"Nice recipe, but not my favorite, simply because I'm not a huge fan of the ripe strawberry taste. That's just my personal preference though, this is still a great recipe! For me, I definitely needed to add some sweetener, but again, that's just me. I really enjoy the taste of sucralose, and 0.5% Super Sweet really improved this mix for me. "},{"user":"Gummy","text":"Verry good. Def good for adv rotation. thx for sharing"},{"user":"DNags","text":"One of the best DIY recipes ever. The fact that it's so easy and cheap to mix is just a nice bonus."},{"user":"FizzChaser","text":"Very nice subtle strawberry in a delicious milk.  Loved it! Great job Skiddlz!"},{"user":"esc1218","text":"Excellent recipe. Only a few hours after mixing and I absolutely love it. Made 100mls and I do not expect it to last long enough to comment on steep time. Highly recommend this recipe for taste and low cost affiliated with TPA flavors."},{"user":"Irrelevant_Being","text":"Not one of my favorites of this type of juice, I wanted to like it but it's just not doing anything for me."},{"user":"AndreM","text":"I like a long (8 weeks) steep for this one, but am never without. A classic! Thank you for the recipe."},{"user":"Alt-FcTs","text":"This has been the launching point for every great S&amp;C mix im currently hoarding.

Good stuff."},{"user":"Bradmaden","text":"Very good "},{"user":"cincinnatiking","text":"It's in my top 3. The Strawberry is made very vibrant using the dragonfruit. I still need to steep it fully, but at 4 days I know I'm making more! Excellent recipe if you like to taste the strawberry in your S&amp;C."},{"user":"ChefJohn","text":"The strawberry is a touch waxy here. &#xD;\nGood body and nicely balanced. &#xD;\n"},{"user":"super8line","text":"There's a reason why this is currently the most mixed recipe on here.... it's awesome.  The dragonfruit just makes the strawberry super juicy with just the right amount of creaminess behind it. "},{"user":"Stuminello","text":"Awesome Recipe, I just mixed it and had to taste.  It's going to be hard to leave it alone for 10-14 days to make it shine.

Super satisfying after a mere 5 day steep. I'll have to mix another 50-100mL as I couldn't put it away after a few days."},{"user":"BigMoose","text":"Top-notch Strawberry Milk. Needs a day for the dragonfruit  to settle and the cream to kick in. The strawberry is nice and bright on inhale with a nice cream exhale and the graham adds some malt-like qualities. No need for sweeteners as the sweetness is on-point."},{"user":"CriticalVape","text":"Never tried the original. After a 2 week steep, this is a nice, light strawberry cream. The graham note is subtle, but present, and the scent is awesome. Such a simple profile, and extremely well done. Definitely a reliable, big-batch strawberry cream recipe all you fuckers should try. I have another 60mL awaiting a full month of aging."},{"user":"jajohnson93","text":"Quite good after a couple days. Just keeps getting better"},{"user":"mk0","text":"Colt killed it.
