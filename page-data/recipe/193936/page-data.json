I’m not good at letting stuff steep but luckily I made this when I had a scratchy throat and this mix irritated the SHIT out of it... so I put it away for a while. I just recently was dripping stuff Inset aside and came across this mix and fell in love with it. I love the banana cornflake combo. It goes so well together. Good work man!"},{"user":"Vishousvapez","text":"This is great the meringue and fresh cream create the milk and the nana custard and cereal 27 really work well together 2 week steep for me... To me its more of a raisin bran type flake than a corn flake... in that case if you do like that id say try the new raisin bran banana nut crunch... thanks for the delicous recipe i will stop being a shill now be safe =] "}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"193936","name":"Banana Frosted Flakes"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
