He liked to fish, and he was a fan of the simpler things in life. One thing that he always had though, was a flask of his homemade strawberry and banana flavored moonshine handy. This custard is a tribute to Cuzzin Carl and all of the simple things in life. \r\n\r\nNow on to the actual description. This is an extremely dark strawberry and banana custard. Simple. But here's where things get really weird. OK, to start off with, I may have been a little bit high when I came up with this one. I did not expect such a seemingly simple, yet complex vape to come from my inebriated brain. I love the extra warmth and hints of cinnamon and caramel that the CAP Graham Cracker gives to the TFA Banana Cream. CAP Vanilla Custard is, of course, a staple at 4%. I also love the combo of the TFA Strawberry and Strawberry Ripe.
