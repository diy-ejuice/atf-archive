The combination of FA Jamaican Rum, FLV Bourbon and FLV Sweet Coconut provides the delicious Malibu Rum note in this mix. Bread pudding is creamy and warm and thick and that's where the crème brûlée comes in to add all those creamy eggy notes with hints of toasted topping. I helped out the sweetness and added extra cream and toasted notes with a bit of toasted marshmallow.. Marzipan is a big player here don't be fooled by its small percentage it is used to tie in the coconut, the cream and the booze into one final delicious creamy boozy desert blend.\r\n","steep_days":"10","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-01T11:56:25.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"1296","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Bourbon","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":500},{"name":"Creme Brulee (yc)","vendor":"INW","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Marzipan","vendor":"FA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Sweet Coconut","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Jamaica Special (jamaica Rhum)","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1750},{"name":"Toasted Marshmallow","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":750},{"name":"Vanilla Cupcake","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Vanilla Pudding","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1500}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"96719","name":"Tipsy Coconut #Mixin Vixens"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
