A dutch candy with liquorice and banana. I'm pretty proud of this one, give it a try if you like liquorice. It's spot on. It's not even funny anymore how spot on it is to the real thing. Get your candy fix!

The two main notes are balanced perfectly so that they seem to take turns in the spotlight from draw to draw. Much more depth and complexity than the short ingredients list would suggest. Been looking for a truly ADV-worthy licorice recipe for years now and this is it. (Note - I backed off on the sweetener a bit for the sake of my coils and I don't feel the flavour suffered.)"},{"user":"notsonattynate","text":"My wife is from Holland. She got me into Black Licorice and I love it now. This candy started my obsession and this juice is dead on.  Great job. I make this for a guy at work regularly. He gives you 5 stars as well."},{"user":"reuben","text":"I LOVE this stuff THANKS for sharing this, I mixed up a 30ml and after the 5 day steep I tasted it and immediately mixed up 60ml more. &#xD;\n"}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"134553","name":"Monkey heads"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
