Wild Melon is still the star of the show. This is pretty straight forward but I will say this; I tried a couple other melons before deciding on the VT Shisha Melon.  It's at a ow enough percentage that I'm not getting any creamy notes but a nice full mouthfeel and nice Cantaloupe flavor. Straight forward juicy melon here, folks.","steep_days":"1 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-10T16:04:35.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"1216","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Wild Melon","flavor_id":"619","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1750},{"name":"Watermelon","flavor_id":"616","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Cantaloupe","flavor_id":"610","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Shisha Melon","flavor_id":"8965","vendor":"VT","millipercent":1750},{"name":"Super Sweet","flavor_id":"2384","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":200}],"reviews":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"145207","name":"My Girlfriend's Melons"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
