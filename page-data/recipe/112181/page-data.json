This has become a favorite of mine.  A simple and straight forward mixed berry milkshake.  The HS French vanilla ice cream, Sweet cream, Hazelnut, and LB Vanilla ice cream form a rich and thick milk shake base.  The VT Forest mixed berries combined with the FA Forest mix make a nice sweet berry blend.  The berries and ice cream balance well together to become a deliscious and rich berry milk shake.  This is not bad right away, but after 7 days this sets up perfectly.  Enjoy.
