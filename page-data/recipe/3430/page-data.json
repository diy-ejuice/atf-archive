Fuji gives it a nice twist, dropped it down to .5 as suggested below.&#xD;\nReally good straight forward S&amp;C vape that I could vape all day. The cream are smooth and nice, the strawberry bold and in the front."},{"user":"MrBurgundy","text":"I really enjoy this. The cream is mild and clean. The strawberry is tart and dominant. As a shake and vape the apple was a little too distracting for me. After a 2 week steep it has calmed down and I enjoy it much more. Next time I mix this, which will be soon, I'll likely drop Fuji to 0.5%. That's just personal preference. The recipe is fantastic as it is. The complexity of the strawberry is intriguing, and I find myself taking 5 or 6 draws to get a good sense of it. That's the mark of a great recipe!"}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"3430","name":"Strawberryish & Cream"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
