Look no further folks, we've got a tasty one here!\r\n\r\nThis recipe starts with the fantastic 3-2-1 strawberry trinity, follows it up with a delicious combo of pur/fa watermelons and finishes it off with some jelly candy. \r\n\r\n\r\nThis has become the favorites of several of my close friends and its the only thing my girlfriend vapes. It would be a shame not to share it! \r\n\r\nSweeten as desired. If you enjoy menthol flavors start at about .6% ( I use a 50/50 mix of ecx ws-23 and ecx menthol solution, .3% each, with great results)\r\nFor pods I use a 50/50 vg/pg ratio and a healthy dose of nicotine. If you want to sub ohm this recipe,  you can raise the ratio and reduce the flavoring some since it wont have to rise above all that nicotine. \r\n","steep_days":"3 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"total_reviews":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T21:33:04.000-05:00","best_vg":"50%","views":"1791","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Apple Fuji","vendor":"FA","millipercent":650},{"name":"Jelly Candy","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Lemon Sicily","vendor":"FA","millipercent":650},{"name":"Shisha Strawberry","vendor":"INW","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Red Touch (strawberry)","vendor":"FA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Strawberry Sweet","vendor":"JF","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Super Sweet","vendor":"PUR","millipercent":500},{"name":"Watermelon","vendor":"PUR","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Red Summer (watermelon)","vendor":"FA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Sweetener","vendor":"FW","millipercent":500}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"155014","name":"Straw-melon pod rancher"}}}
