Seems like a good instructive recipe, there are things to be gleaned from this. Look how much Sweet Guava he had to use to get it to shine through all that heavy cream enough to be a little guava syrup on top. See how 1% Yes We Cheesecake goes a long way. It’s a recipe I’ll remember the next time I’m messing with any of these ingredients, and I appreciate that. Really the only flaw I can find here is that the butter here seems a bit excessive. French Vanilla Ice Cream is already buttery, HS Ice Cream is also very buttery, and together they get to tasting like what I imagine severely overchurned ice cream tastes like.
