It's well balanced and addicting!\r\nThe custard helps build the body up and give the banana a pudding style flavor as well as keep the caramel on the top. Then you'll get a light whipped cream accented with a hint of toasted almond on the tail end of the exhale. The super sweet can be bumped to .5% if you like it a little sweeter.","steep_days":"5","temperature":"425","recipe_score":4,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:49:24.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"3672","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Banana Cream","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":5000},{"name":"Banò (banana)","vendor":"FA","millipercent":300},{"name":"Caramel","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":500},{"name":"Caramel (original)","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Cream Fresh","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Super Sweet","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":250},{"name":"Toasted Almond","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":750},{"name":"Vanilla Custard","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1750},{"name":"Vanilla Whipped Cream","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1500}],"reviews":[{"user":"KylezKloudz","text":"Nice job! Getting a nice carmely banana cream... Don't get much of the whipped cream tho... I'll get a taste every great once in a while... Maybe just my senses, I'd try to bring it out a lil but more for my taste, but overall it's a nice tasty vape. 👍👍"}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"51306","name":"Banana Cream Dream"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
