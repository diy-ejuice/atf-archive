Its not quite 100% there yet, but it's definitely close and a very good vape. I love that it straddles the line of being a bakery, but also a crisp refreshing flavor. Works well as a shake and vape, but the Apple really comes out in 3-5 days. The lemon-lime and lime tahiti pair nicely to compliment the fuji and create a very nice top note that's extremely bright and refreshing. Normally I use sugar cookie at a higher percentage because, well.......it's sugar cookie. One of the best and most versatile flavors around. It's here just to boost inherent sweetness and add a bit of graininess. The graham cracker and sugar cookie the base of the crumb note and is boosted by the liquid amber. I'm almost positive that amber isn't in the original, but it works so well getting the profile where it needs to be. Lastly a dash of meringue is used to round out the harsh edges and work as a bridge. Hope you enjoy! \r\n\r\nSteep Time: 5-7 days, but can work as a shake&vape if you're in a pinch. \r\n","steep_days":"0","temperature":"0","recipe_score":4.9,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:48:49.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"10971","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Liquid Amber","vendor":"FA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Sugar Cookie","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Lemon Lime","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Meringue","vendor":"FA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Fuji","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Lime Tahity Cold Pressed","vendor":"FA","millipercent":750},{"name":"Graham Cracker Clear","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1500}],"reviews":[{"user":"vix","text":"I mixed this at 70VG and the flavor was way too light. With the flavor total being 7.25%, I should probably mix this at most 60VG, but this may fall under a personal preference. After adjusting, I found that I prefer this as a SnV. The lime flavor seemed to dissipate a little with steeping, at least for me. Awesome juice. Well balanced and difficult to put down!"},{"user":"Dustalot","text":""},{"user":"amouthforwar","text":"Really good mix, light and well-balanced for the most part but I personally can't handle CAP Lemon Lime in a lot of mixes. It just tastes too much like flat sprite to me and I notice it above all over flavors for some reason. That said, the overall profile is tasty as hell and it is a really nice summer time vape for those of us who still like a bit of bakery but want something light enough to toot on all day. Solid 4/5 but I would personally find an alternative to CAP Lemon Lime (then again I've never tried the original)"},{"user":"cyclereno","text":"Pretty decent as is and a great start!&#xD;\nJust tried my 30ml trust batch after a 5-6 week steep!&#xD;\nItâ€™s pretty good as is, definitely has a bakery feel to it and the Apple/Lime is blanced nicely..&#xD;\nI might up the Apple by .5% because I feel the Lime combo is overtaking the Apple just a tad bit...&#xD;\nI doubt FW Yellow Cake is in the original but I may add like 1% of that in and then up the sugar cookie by .5-1%"},{"user":"MrZigglesworth","text":"This is light enough that you could definitely enjoy this throughout the spring and summer, but the graham cracker clear, meringue, and sugar cookie give the bakery notes that I enjoy in my day-to-day vaping. I would highly recommend this one."},{"user":"Ike_Malkov","text":"At one time this was one of my favorite juices on the market. As I was mixing it I could smell that juice. When I finished mixing it was a little off. SNV it's really close maybe a little sweeter maybe more lime than the original but I'm sure that will calm down with a steep. Really excellent my dude!"},{"user":"GeekFish","text":"Great juice!
