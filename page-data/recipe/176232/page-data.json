And thatâ€™s it for the crust.\r\n\r\nNow the filling, everyone knows Iâ€™m fond of FA milk but it didnâ€™t fit well here, I needed something with more of a butyric vibe so I chose VTA fresh milk backed up with VTA pudding base itâ€™s a good filling but it wasnâ€™t complete, I added sugar cookie to fill it out and add a touch of vanilla, FA almond is self explanatory and is also helped out by the slight nuttiness of the crispy wafer,  the chai masala brings nutmeg amongst a few other spices hidden in the back, because this is a simple profile I find sweetener really helped out the mix as a whole so even though you can drop it out I recommend not to.\r\n\r\nI also recommend giving this a week steep to let everything blend and to let the chai masala settle down.\r\n\r\nIf you like this mix and what I do then please rate and review accordingly ðŸ˜˜","steep_days":"7","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"total_reviews":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-04T21:26:05.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"1657","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Pudding Base","vendor":"VT","millipercent":500},{"name":"Crispy Wafer SC","vendor":"WF","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Chai Masala","vendor":"VT","millipercent":500},{"name":"Sugar Cookie","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Milk Fresh","vendor":"VT","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Almond","vendor":"FA","millipercent":750},{"name":"Super Sweet","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":500},{"name":"Apple Pie","vendor":"FA","millipercent":2000}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"176232","name":"Silk tart"}}}
