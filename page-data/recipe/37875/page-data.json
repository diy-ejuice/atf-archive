FLV Fig does not fit here at all; the dark musky flavor clashes hard with the watermelon. However, I think swapping the FLV Fig out for FA Fresh Fig would be all one would need to do to turn this bad recipe into a good and possibly even great one. What we've got here is simply a bad case of wrong fig for the job. "}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"37875","name":"Figgy Strap-On"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
