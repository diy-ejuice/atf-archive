You can replace CAP Sweet Cream for 1.5% of CAP Vanilla Whipped Cream for a sweeter vape.\r\n\r\nFA Marshmallow brings more texture to the mix, making the vapor chewy.\r\n\r\nAfter giving it a good shake, sit it in a warm bath for 30 minutes and it's good to go.","steep_days":"0 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:51:06.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"1234","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Sweet Guava","flavor_id":"118","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Sweet Cream","flavor_id":"117","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Meringue","flavor_id":"530","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Marshmallow","flavor_id":"473","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Yogurt","flavor_id":"1471","vendor":"FW","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Creamy Yogurt","flavor_id":"5","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Super Sweet","flavor_id":"2384","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":500},{"name":"Italian Lemon Sicily","flavor_id":"78","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":500}],"reviews":[{"user":"bjorama","text":"Is it just me or is CAP Sweet Guava in a league by itself?    Seriously every recipe that has Sweet Guava comes out great. This is no exception.  I'm a heavy Custards and Tobacco Vaper and need to break up the same ol same ol with some fruit once in a while.  While I find some fruit recipes to be quite good they don't seem to capture my taste buds to qualify for an ADV.  When I vape this I get a nice sweet guava that is very smooth and slightly creamy, pudding like exhale. I don't really taste any tart or lemon, but the end result is still great. Nice recipe and thanks for posting something good!"}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"162269","name":"Brazilian Guava Mousse"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
