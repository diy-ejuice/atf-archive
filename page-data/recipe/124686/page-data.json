It is a recreation of the ever popular combination of Nilla wafers and banana pudding. This version is a bit more exciting than the real thing, because I decided to add some eggy Vanilla Custard richness and actual banana to counter TPA Banana Cream.\r\n\r\n VT Banana Custard makes up the authentic banana slices, but it's lacking in the custard department. CAP Vanilla Custard fills in for that with some intense richness and thickens the overall profile. TPA Banana Cream brings the artificial Jello banana pudding flavor, but only enough of it to be present. FLV Vanilla Pudding is where the name comes from. It's a pretty solid creamy pudding flavor that works as a blank canvas here. FA Cookie and VT Pudding base are used to give some Nilla Wafer texture to the experience. Lastly, the meringue is used because the reference picture had whipped cream, and I wanted something that would show up more and prevent the recipe from getting wispy.

Nice and creamy mouthfeel, and a bit of spice from the custard. Well done!"},{"user":"vagdal","text":"It's delicious! I've mixed this 3 months ago. Thanks for sharing!"},{"user":"whthek","text":"The longer it sit's, the better it git's...My palate typically requires around 3 weeks for many mixes containing any type of dairy. I had given up trying to develop or find a banana recipe that didn't have sharp edges or just taste completely over saturated with the aroma. This mix covers all the bases, for me. At 6 weeks it is the most well balanced,delectable, accurate,smooth, banana masterpiece of a recipe I've ever tasted. Nice work,Alfred, and thanks for sharing!

But this one takes it to another level üëÜ Nice thick dense pudding with banana slices and cookie finish. ü§§ This will definitely be going into my recipe Hall of Fame and have me reworking my own \"Ugly Butters\" recipe. Great job, Excellent work Alfred! üëçüëçüëäüëä"},{"user":"diesel223","text":"Let me start out by saying WTF?? How am I the first person to rate this delicious treat? That being said I would also add that I have lived my entire life in the south. Banana pudding and family get togethers at grandma's go hand in hand. The real deal banana pudding I'm accustomed to doesn't actually have \"banana\" flavoring in the pudding. It is a homemade cooked custard type vanilla pudding. Then real banana slices are added in along with nilla wafers. Lastly it is topped with meringue and baked off in the oven. This is the only recipe I've ever tried that gives me the vape that matches what I just described. Real banana pudding doesnt just taste like a box of jello brand fake banana flavor pudding. It taste just like this masterpiece presented here by Alfred. I get that warm, thick, rich, and eggy vanilla pudding layered with banana slices and nilla wafers topped off with meringue. After only a 2 day steep I am amazed by this recipe and will keep 100 ml mixed up in my stash at all times in the future. Truly great work Alfred. You have not only created a tasty vape but you have filled my mind with nostalgia and fond memories of times gone by and sitting around the table as a child at grandma's on Sunday afternoon with a bowl of true banana pudding bliss. Mix this up guys and gals, you won't regret it."}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"124686","name":"Nana Pudding"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
