There's a bit of sweetness used here, you don't have to - it's optional - or you could replace it with whatever sweetener you prefer if you like your coffee's really sweet like I do.  If you're more of a black coffee drinker, you may need to add in something like FA Cappuccino at 0.25% or Tiramisu to bump the dark coffee notes up some, but this is far more a light and sweet coffee flavor.
