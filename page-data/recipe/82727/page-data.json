This is a perfect dessert for all those that love a nice rich creamy sweet strawberry with creams.\r\n\r\nSHISHA STRAWBERRY: To me one of my favorite strawberryâ€™s when making a dessert. This Strawberry adds a nice natural Strawberry Taste, while enhancing the creaminess and adding a bit of smooth ripe strawberry flavor the the recipe.\r\n\r\nSHISHA VANILLA: This Vanilla is so versatile and can be used in many recipes, it works exceptionally well with creams, adds a nice light vanilla flavor,  some sweetness, and a bit of body to recipe.\r\n\r\nBUTTERSCOTH RIPPLE: Sweet and Creamy and plays so well with most caramels to give that real authentic buuterscotch note.\r\n\r\nSALTED CARAMEL: This caramel pairs well with the Ripple to add a nice buttery, rich, soft caramel and really make that butterscotch standout.\r\n\r\nVANILLA SWIRL: at 2% this works wells to add almost a sweet vanilla pudding flavor that is thick and buttery. \r\n\r\nTFA BAVARIAN CREAM: This Flavor gives it more body, thickness, vanilla and adds a nice dairy note and is not too heavy at 1%.\r\n \r\nPURILIUM MARSHMELLOW: This is used to strictly add Sweetness to the mix. Works very well here. ( you can sub your favorite Sweetener). \r\n\r\nThis recipe taste good off the shake, but for all the flavors to meld together give it a 3-5 day Steep. Mixed at 65/35PG.\r\nEnjoy. Feedback is Appreciated.
