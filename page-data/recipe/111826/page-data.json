The two apples blend together to make an apple filling with a touch of cinnamon.  Combining strawberry and rhubarb is something I personally prefer, because I like the taste combo.  I see red in that pastry so my red bits are the strawberry and rhubarb.  The Rhubarb Cuddle from DV has a nice creamy note to it that brings a softness to the crust...if you really like your deserts with custard drizzled over them add a touch more of your favorite custard to this to create that effect.  I didn't add sweetener because it didn't need it for me, but if I were going to sweeten this for folks who are used to more commercial style, I'd add 0.5% FW Sweetener or a touch of stevia.
