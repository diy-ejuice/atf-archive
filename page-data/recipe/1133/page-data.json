Nice, creamy lemon fruit loops flavor! Quick steep too!"},{"user":"Kriswk","text":"Simple yet complex. I made this a while back using CAP New Marshmallow, but when I made it with the original, it made it even better. The milk is sweet, and full. Just a tasty rendition of a popular profile. Nice work sir.."},{"user":"hyperlite310","text":"So surprised to see no ratings on this one! Mixed this up and it was great as a SNV. I also mixed up a second batch adding 1% FW Lemon Meringue Pie. I feel the lemon meringue really pushes the FW Fruit Rings to the front and makes it pop. This was still excellent with out it! Will definitely be mixing this up more!
