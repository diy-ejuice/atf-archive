Coconut and Blackcurrant is a great combination. Throw all three together and you get one of the best flavor profiles I've done so far. Already vaped through 200 ml of this goodness. Let's get into the nitty-gritty:\r\n\r\nFA Black Touch - In my opinion the only good Licorice on the market, especially for a real, non-candy Licorice flavor. 3% might sound like a high percentage at first glance, but cut the dosage and it loses a lot of its presence in the mix.\r\n\r\nINW Blackcurrant & CAP Black Currant: Inaweras take on the flavor is by far my favorite. It's not too sweet and has the right amount of sourness. Capellas Blackcurrant helps to give the profile even more fruitiness.\r\n\r\nCAP Coconut & TPA Coconut Candy: I've tinkered with these a lot in the first batches. 2% for both turned out to be the exact sweet spot I was looking for. Capellas Coconut is needed to give the right Coconut texture, TPAs Coconut Candy bolsters it nicely and gives the mix much needed sweetness. A positive side effect of TPA Coconut Candy is that we don't need any sweeteners in this recipe. \r\n\r\nI like to add 1% WS-23 (10% dilution in PG). You can decrease the amount or leave it out completely, you call.\r\n\r\nSteep time is AT LEAST 7 days. No SNV!\r\n\r\nHope you enjoy and have a nice vape!","steep_days":"7","temperature":"0","recipe_score":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-11T06:45:10.000-05:00","best_vg":"50%","views":"567","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Black Touch (licorice Plus)","flavor_id":"425","vendor":"FA","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Blackcurrant","flavor_id":"645","vendor":"INW","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Coconut","flavor_id":"37","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Black Currant","flavor_id":"8738","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Coconut Candy","flavor_id":"223","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2000}],"reviews":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"182705","name":"Black Hole Currant"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
