The apricot does help to blend the two peaches to some degree. This would be a five star for me if it didn't say black tea background. The tea for me is the main note I'm getting. I will mix again but will most likely drop the black tea to 2% and up the white peach some. Thanks for this nice recipe."}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"69174","name":"southern sunset (peach sweet tea)"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
