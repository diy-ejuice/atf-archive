Changing one stars to five for now, until I get a chance to try the correct recipe and re-review it. Meanwhile, please disregard the following as a review of this recipe and instead enjoy it as a cautionary tale:&#xD;\n&#xD;\nDO NOT MIX. Here's what I think happened: I think Chris was putting the ingredients in for this and accidentally switched the %ages for CAP Sweet Cream and FW Vanilla Bean Ice Cream. A simple mistake, it happens. And I think it might be a tasty recipe with those %s swapped.. A little Lemon Sicily seems like it would be an excellent accent to TFA Pom. But, as written with 6% CAP Sweet Cream and 1.25% FW VBIC, I found this to be disgusting; it tastes like pomegranate bubblegum bits suspended in putrid margarine. There's no way the creator of the most popular recipe of all time, Sugar Cookies &amp; Cream, as well as various other excellent recipes, did this on purpose.
