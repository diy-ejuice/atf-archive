And it got even better a week after the recommended steep time. Iâ€™ve never had Duchess Reserve. But this reminds me of taruto,  but more savory. "},{"user":"phried","score":"5","text":"I knew it would be a good one when I saw the flavor list - I enjoy all these flavors individually, what more in a mix right? Haven't tried the original, but after I dripped this a couple of times to test it out it went straight into a squonker. A touch high on the sweetener at first glance but it works great in this recipe with just a slightly noticeable amount of gunking. 60mL's gone in just a few days coming off the steep, definitely keeping this in my rotation."},{"user":"TheDrStore","score":"5","text":"Keep forgetting to give this a review. This is outstanding and really close to the profile. Well done!"},{"user":"SlashaLO","score":"5","text":"Mixed this up. I went and bought an original just to try it out side by side as well. I agree...its not EXACT, but its so close its not even funny. This mix is amazing. Good job."},{"user":"corvape","score":"5","text":"Excellent recipe. So tasty after a good steep!&#xD;\nNever tried the original but this one is definitely added to the rotation "},{"user":"Thadentman","score":"5","text":"Never had the original, but this vape after about a month steep is incredible, probably the best custard recipe I have had to date. Great job Joel!"},{"user":"Rageisalotofwork","score":"5","text":"I have realized that trying this after a two week steep, I should have mixed more than 60mls. this recipe is wonderfully layered, rich and complex and has renewed my interest in rich creamy vapes. The tres leches, butterscotch and hazelnut and balanced very well, that sort of reminds me of the toppings on an ice cream sunday, without the ice cream. Very good work Joel!"},{"user":"MrColdOne","score":"5","text":"Closest recipe to the duchess I've ever had!! Awesome job by Mr. Hardwick!"},{"user":"R2ME2","score":"5","text":"I mixed up 100 mos of this just because it looked so good and requires such a long steep time.  Vaped a little right after mixing and it was very tasty.  I can only imagine how much better it will get with time.  I've never tasted DR and don't plan on buying any for comparison. Why do that when this is so delicious. Reason number 318 why I LOVE DIY....brilliant!"},{"user":"mlNikon","score":"5","text":"I just mixed this up so haven't let it steep yet but good work sir. I have not tried the original duchess so I have no idea how it is supposed to taste but this mix is very good. I love how rich and decadent it is. This is exactly the mix I have been looking for! I can't wait to see how this develops as it steeps. I am going to do my best to forget about this for the full 21 days."}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"32097","name":"Reserved Duchess"}}}
