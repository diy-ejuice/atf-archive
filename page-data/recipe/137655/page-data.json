I recently ordered VT Popcorn and I may tweak the recipe a bit and try adding it in after I get it and see how it changes it but as is here, it's amazing. It is very much a true buttered popcorn but sweeter. If you like popcorn vapes of any kind I promise you will LOVE this one... You won\"t regret mixing it. No substitutions can be made for these flavors. If you don't have them, do yourself a favor and invest and order them. They are def worth the price tag. A little goes a long way... Mix, sit back and Enjoy THE MOVIE!","steep_days":"2","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"updated_at":"2020-12-12T10:15:41.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"1423","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Popcorn","flavor_id":"8564","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Sweetness","flavor_id":"4413","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":250},{"name":"Butter Toffee Base","flavor_id":"8844","vendor":"VT","millipercent":600},{"name":"Pudding Base","flavor_id":"8948","vendor":"VT","millipercent":1500}],"reviews":[{"user":"FuriousMixer","text":"Great job very tasty and less than 4% total flavourings!

However, the longer I vape it the more it turns into sweet buttercream cake frosting....and that's not a bad thing.  It's a very rich and decadent vape that's really a bit too much to be an ADV but definitely worth going back to again and again.  ","score":5},{"user":"alexmori","text":"Very good!
