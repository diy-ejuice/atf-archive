I sat in front of my mixing station one day, looked at my flavors and figured these would make what I wanted and they did, and spot on at that.  The only tweaks I made were with the %s on the CAP Lemon Meringue Pie by upping it slightly from the original amount and the same goes for the CAP NY Cheesecake.  And to make a note on the V2 selection.  There is no shortness of body in this recipe, nor are there any strange off notes due to the use of the V2s.  To be completely honest these two V2 purchases were made when I first started mixing and never used until now or anywhere else in my mixing.  They did the trick perfectly here though without a doubt.\r\n\r\nI hope you guys enjoy this one!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","steep_days":"3 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"total_reviews":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T19:16:17.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"1131","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Lemon Meringue Pie V2","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":3500},{"name":"New York Cheesecake V2","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":2250},{"name":"Lemon Sicily","vendor":"FA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Lemon (water Soluble)","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Lime Tahity Cold Pressed","vendor":"FA","millipercent":750},{"name":"Cream Cheese Icing","vendor":"LA","millipercent":750},{"name":"Meringue","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1250},{"name":"Marshmallow","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":500},{"name":"Super Sweet","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":500}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"172767","name":"F*ck the Crust"}}}
