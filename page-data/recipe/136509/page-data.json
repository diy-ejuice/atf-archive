I am a lazy man so I may have (read: did) copy and paste my initial info and just fixed the bits and bobs that were changed.\r\n\r\nPretty simple right? Definitely needs some steep time for the LA Watermelon because it's initially harsh as hell for me. If you want to add some Marshmallow it will tend to mellow out faster, but both fruits are already really sweet. I say skip sweetener on this one, especially cotton candy?EM sweeteners due to the fact that TFA strawberry is already packed with EM and the addition of more EM will most certainly cause muting.\r\n\r\nAlso please pretend that I found an image that included strawberries or alternately that I shopped one in to the included picture.","steep_days":"1 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T00:08:11.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"1924","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Strawberry","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Watermelon","vendor":"LA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Dragonfruit","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2000}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"136509","name":"Pink Lady"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
