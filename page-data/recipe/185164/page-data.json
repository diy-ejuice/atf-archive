My goal was to re-create those yummy Kellogg's fruit snacks from my childhood.\r\n\r\nCactus (Kaktus) (INW): The Juicer-Upper - This is very needed but be careful not to add more than .25% in my testing .25% brightened/juiced up the strawberry while not imparting a cactus flavor, your results may vary.\r\n\r\nStrawberry (Red Touch) (FA): Strawberry Jelly Jam - This very sugary strawberry helps us candy up the TPA Strawberry and rounds out the strawberry flavor as well.\r\n\r\nStrawberry (TPA): The Go-To - This is my go-to strawberry, it works in so many different applications but here we are using it as our base candied strawberry flavor.\r\n\r\nStrawberry Gummy Candy (SC) (WF): The Star of The Show - This flavor is what i built my recipe on it has an interesting balance of natural and artificial strawberry (i feel as though this mimics a fruit snack) and a great gummy feel.\r\n\r\nSwedish Gummy (TPA): The Gummy Enhancer - I tried this in .1 increments all the way from 1-4% For me, any lingonberry taste just ruins the recipe for me but at 1.75 i get a candied strawberry and more of a gummy mouthfeel.\r\n\r\nVanilla Swirl (TPA): The Vanilla Bridge - This tones everything down a bit and rounds it out, and also adds a bit to the mouthfeel, this is a must in all my gummy recipes\r\n\r\nSuper Sweet (CAP): This is pretty self explanatory, cut it if you don't like sweeter but i prefer it with sweetener at about .5% \r\n\r\nHope you guys enjoy and if you mix it up, tell me what you think!","steep_days":"3 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:51:23.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"1770","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Cactus","flavor_id":"647","vendor":"INW","millipercent":250},{"name":"Red Touch (strawberry)","flavor_id":"421","vendor":"FA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Strawberry","flavor_id":"272","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Strawberry Gummy Candy SC","flavor_id":"10097","vendor":"WF","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Super Sweet","flavor_id":"2384","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":500},{"name":"Swedish Gummy","flavor_id":"337","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1750},{"name":"Vanilla Swirl","flavor_id":"189","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1000}],"reviews":[{"user":"Zany","text":"Never had those gummies, so can't say if it's accurate to what profile it's aimed at - But I can say this ..&#xD;\nIt is a DAMN tasty strawberry gummy recipe! WF Strawberry Gummy Candy had been forgotten in my stash, but I am happy that I found it again. I was afraid the Swedish Gummy would be too prominent, but it just sits in the back and adds a bit of brightness to the strawberry. The small amount of INW Cactus also adds that bit of wetness, without being able to taste the actual flavoring - and then the Vanilla Swirl ties it all together nicely.&#xD;\nGreat recipe! - Mixing up my second batch now!&#xD;\n&#xD;\nUPDATE: I've started mixing this recipe with Swedish Gummy at 1% instead - This suits my personal taste better."},{"user":"AutomaticFailure","text":"Well god dammit, it's a strawberry fruit snack and I am strawberry blind.
