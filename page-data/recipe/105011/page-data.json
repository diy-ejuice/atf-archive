For 2 years now I have been wanting to nail down the perfect Maple Syrup flavor that I am familiar with when I drizzle it over pancakes, ice cream and what ever I feel like at the time. With every concentrate I tried that offered promise of helping me reach my happy place, it seemingly always fell short of delivering the authenticity I wanted.  The closest I found was FA Maple Syrup but by it's self I seem to get the right tones but a little dryness and felt more like licking maple syrup off a dry serviette. I knew it needed a little help but with what? I know it pairs nicely with TPA Banana Fosters and is less dry with it but what if I want to use it in a profile that doesn't contain banana? Then \"CHOO CHOO\", VT Golden Syrup steams in on Platform 2 showing me a lovely sweet syrup that is just perfect in so many ways and offers the solution to FA Maple Syrup IMO. It gives the Maple a slightly deeper and more syrup like tones that compliments it very well. However it just needs \"something\" else. Something was missing to give me the 100% gorgeousness I was chasing. I reached out to DIYorDIE's Wayne Walker on a recent live show and he suggested to try adding an even amount of FA Butterscotch & FA Caramel (two of my most favorite flavors) and boom, a star was born by simply using 0.5% of each.  Those syrupy caramel and butterscotch notes help to complete this & offers deliciousness at the next level IMO. After 3 days steep  I think it's 99% authentic and ready now to add into a recipe with some bakery concentrates and where ever the imagination goes. I think this is the \"missing link\" that can help so many of us take our Maple Syrup included recipes to the next level. While I think it's great, tell me what you think.
