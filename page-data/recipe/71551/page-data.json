Reddit's self-appointed village idiot did all the work. The idea to add ginger to Longing was because @ID10-T's description of it (honeysuckle infused ice cream rather than his ex's, um, juices) made me think of ginger ice cream, a discontinued Haggen Daas 5 flavor. One of my goals as a mixer is to replicate that ice cream in an e juice someday. With that said, this recipe does NOT do that. \r\nAnyway, I hadn't done any single flavor tests on my two gingers (FW & FLV). I went by smell. The FLV smells nothing like ginger root. It smells very floral, hence my selection of a ginger flower for the pic. I will eventually try adding FW and HS (on the way from BCF this week) to Longing and go from there to create my ginger ice cream. But Id10-T's Longing recipe piqued my interest in floral vapes so I went with FLV. It turned out so amazingly good that I posted on Reddit for the first time so other's could enjoy the awesomeness of it.\r\nIt reminds me a bit of orange blossom honey and ID10-T got the same thing when he tried it. If you love, or are curious if you might like, floral vapes, please give this a try. It is amazing. One vape and I gave it 5 stars in the program I use which is really rare for me. I usually have to vape a full tank or more before I will give a recipe 5 stars.","steep_days":"3 (SNV)","temperature":"420","recipe_score":5,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:49:41.000-05:00","best_vg":"80%","views":"2896","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Cream","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Cream Fresh","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Honeysuckle (pg)","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Shisha Vanilla","vendor":"INW","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Vanilla Bean Ice Cream","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Ginger","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1500}],"reviews":[{"user":"ID10-T","text":"This is ridiculously great stuff, way better than Longing. I never would have guessed FLV Ginger and TFA Honeysuckle would fit together so well. Putting those two together definitely deserves a checking of the original recipe box. I like it better after a few days, when those two have time to calm down and intertwine a bit more, so if it's too floral or gingery at first, just give it time.
