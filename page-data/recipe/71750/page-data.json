Cuban supreme is an awesome , relatively neutral tobacco, pretty dry and earthy with some light sweetness at the end. The shade brings in a cigar leaf flavor with some leathery, chocolate back notes. The walnut comes in to give some moisture and mouthfeel to what would be two otherwise dry flavors. This is a great mix that I find myself coming back to daily."}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"71750","name":"Shaded Cuban With A Nut"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
