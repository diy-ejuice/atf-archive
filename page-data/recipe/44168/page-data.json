If you don't have joy you can drop it, but after a steep it imparts a slight yeast note which fits well here. \r\n\r\nThe blueberry combo was pulled from one of the reddit FotW threads and I have used it ever since. I'll change them around a little, but this mix really does give a well rounded blueberry to me.\r\n\r\nMeringue/Torrone: Gives the glaze on top, its not really a powdered sugar, but more of a glaze here when used with the sweetener. The sweetener \"wets\" the powder sugar feel here and it tastes great","steep_days":"7","temperature":"0","recipe_score":4,"updated_at":"2020-12-12T14:05:20.000-05:00","best_vg":"65%","views":"11594","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Zeppola","flavor_id":"6312","vendor":"FA","millipercent":3500},{"name":"Blueberry (extra)","flavor_id":"218","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Blueberry","flavor_id":"1201","vendor":"FW","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Cake (yellow)","flavor_id":"1222","vendor":"FW","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Meringue","flavor_id":"530","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Bilberry","flavor_id":"533","vendor":"FA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Torrone","flavor_id":"550","vendor":"FA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Joy","flavor_id":"401","vendor":"FA","millipercent":250},{"name":"Super Sweet","flavor_id":"2384","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":250}],"reviews":[{"user":"Skywxp3d","text":"I love this stuff!","score":5},{"user":"Jroc","text":"Theres like a fried, heart stopping thickness. While still having such a succulent blueberry flavor. Smh. Wow. I steeped for 5 days before I tried it. Those three blueberry flavors together are just singing. Steeped it for another month...tastes even better than I remember. Phenomenal. Thank you for your time and effortüôè","score":5},{"user":"FuriousMixer","text":"Adding 1% cap vanilla custard v2 or v1 will give this much fuller mouth feel. üëçüèª Decent recipe though. ","score":3},{"user":"whthek","text":"Nice job! Wished it had a bit more mouth feel... What would provide that in this mix?","score":5},{"user":"crumbym","text":"This is really good, I've only let it steep 3 days. I know it will be good enough to mix a 120 ml at this point. The blueberry is so realistic, and on exhale the doughy fried doughnut pops.. I mean this is getting a 5* from me, and I have tried several blueberry mixes, quite a few I wished i never mixed. This is worth the mix folks and 3 days in, go for it! I can't wait to see how this tastes after a week or so.. GREAT JOB!","score":5},{"user":"justjasontm","text":"Today was the 7th day of steeping so I went and got a fresh blueberry glazed cake donut this morning to refresh myself on what they taste like. Loaded this up shortly after and man is it accurate! Tasty, tasty stuff! Joy can be a pretty polarizing flavor, and I find the touch of it here does exactly what you intended in bringing a bit of a yeast note and adding to the authenticity that zep has on its own. Even the glaze on top is accurate. All in all, my mind doesn't have to strain to figure out what I'm tasting here. Very straight forward, tasty blueberry donut! ","score":5},{"user":"Deetzz","text":"Delicious Donut!! Full on sweet delicious Blueberry on the inhale, with a full greasy fried donut in the middle and a well blended Blueberry donut on the exhale! This is a great as a SnV and develops into this Lit Blueberry donut on steep. For my full notes check our review on TheFogVlog Mixers Review. Thanks Slashalo!!","score":5},{"user":"ObiWanCannoli","text":"Definitely a dense greasy-ass donut here. The blueberry trinity is pleasant and fairly authentic to a slightly candied/cooked blueberry. The donut base and glaze is true to the description and nails the profile in taste. In vape experience however, I'm not digging this 100%. I seem to have a big harshness problem with a lot of FA flavors...namely torrone, custard, and zeppola. There's just something about them that is harsh and nauseating to me so I'm always hesitant to mix recipes that contain them. I bit this time because it's been a while since I've had a good blueberry donut vape. Anyways, its a tasty recipe but its almost a bit too greasy tasting and the harshness from torrone and zeppola really tears up my throat. I'd be trying this with some new flavorings such as glazed donut(WF) or their deep friend pastry dough if I were to tackle this profile again. A good recipe and lots of others seem to like it so good job.","score":4},{"user":"shakenvape007","text":"","score":5},{"user":"cdaniell30","text":"This is how a blueberry glazed donut should be done, the donut is more present than the blueberry, but the blueberry is vibrant as well.","score":5},{"user":"horizonism","text":"Straight off the mix &amp; shake, this is the best portrayal of this profile I've ever come across. I'll return to update after a 7 day steep, if it lasts that long. Great work! üëç","score":5},{"user":"Gonzilla","text":"A fantastic dense fried doughnut with syrupy baked blueberries and a sweet sugary glaze tying it all together. Wonderful balance allowing both flavors to shine, really enjoyable vape!","score":5},{"user":"DaddyKane91","text":"I mixxed up a 30 ml bottle , of this juice only exception was i didn't have the yellow cake and subbed for CAP cake batter....but even still this is a bomb recipe ...and i loves some blueberries ...great job on this ..","score":5},{"user":"TamVapes","text":"Spot on!!!  Recipe definitely fits the profile.  Delicious.  I feel that powdered sugar taste on exhale, but not dry, it is definitely more like a glazed feel, just as described.  Excellent.
