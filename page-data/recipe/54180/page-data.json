It's thick and luxurious, excellent mouthfeel. Coupled with the FA FC/Yogurt it makes one of the best full bodied yoghurts in vaping.\r\nAdded a solid combo of Blueberries, a touch of Sucralose to round any sour edges and boost the blueberries and voila!\r\nI prefer this as a S&V, the Bilberry isn't as strong off the bat in this recipe, but if you find it strong just let it sit for a couple of days. \r\nEnjoy x\r\n","steep_days":"3 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":4,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:49:27.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"1651","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Greek Yogurt","flavor_id":"615","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Cream Fresh","flavor_id":"540","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Yogurt","flavor_id":"408","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Bilberry","flavor_id":"533","vendor":"FA","millipercent":500},{"name":"Blueberry","flavor_id":"1201","vendor":"FW","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Blueberry Jam","flavor_id":"18","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Super Sweet","flavor_id":"2384","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":300}],"reviews":[{"user":"lmhobbs","text":"Just mixed a 60ml and I imagine it'll be gone before it gets a chance to steep :-) Great recipe even as a shake and vape.
