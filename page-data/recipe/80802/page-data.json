I've been working on this since September and feel it is where it needs to be.  This is buttery cornbread custard.  The AP and Cereal 27 mixed with OOO Corn Bread really pushes this toward the authentic cornbread.  It helps with the fluffy grain aspect that is the hallmark of the cornbread that has become the staple of the Southern table.  The CAP Cake Batter helps to pull this in the sweet cornbread direction.  The Custard/Creme Brulee/Devon Cream combination creates the thick rich custard that is enhanced by the crumb and crust of the cornbread.  Butterscotch Ripple/Butterscotch brings the custard and cornbread to the butterscotch-y, caramel-y level that I was going for. \r\n\r\nGive this at least a week to steep, and it blossoms into a sweet, buttery, cornbread custard.  I annihilated 30mL of this and am waiting on the next batch to steep.  \r\n\r\nAs always, I mixed this at 60vg/40pg and, then, let it age for a week.  This is what I was looking for in a cornbread vape.\r\n\r\nEdit:  So, in coming back to read this with sober eyes . . . I realize that the use of \"in lieu of\" is used incorrectly (sigh . . . celebrating a snow day and typing do not mix).  I'm not changing it as a lesson to myself.  I guess I was thinking \"for fear that,\" but it came out all wrong.  Must remember to self-edit before hitting save.
