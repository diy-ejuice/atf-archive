That ended up being a delightful ADV for me that I had no need for feedback on. So when it came submission time for this entry I was out of fresh ideas that I wanted to pursue (and test various failures of). So, I saw some notes scrawled on a post-it note by my computer and I remembered a mix that worked with an idea I had a while back to use FLV Arabian as an accent note to a bakery of some sort. \r\n\r\nI have been really lazy mixing during Covid, mostly spending the time doing tests and write ups at the computer over the busy life I generally lead where I can make some tests and not have a chance to vape it until 3-4 weeks later when I next have time. Needed a quick mix one day and decided to try Kokanda's Sick AF. I like SC and MnH so why the hell not? I was struck off the shake how sweet it was and it didnt have a strong singular note that stood out on top of that sugar. I figured this would be a great base to play with and i probably over-complicated it with a couple of flavors I knew would pull it where I wanted. To top it all off, I added a few drops of Arabian and so v0 was born. The current recipe as it stands is a bit pared down. I am currently in love with WF HnC with tobacco thanks to Tesla DelMar and so I opted to leave out the MnH from the original mix. SC could probably go higher if I wanted a prominent 'cookie' vibe, but I didn't. I wanted it to be in this nether region between sweet and spicy, tobacco and bakery, sugar and cream. I chose WF Caramel Butter over FM or FA Caramel or an RY4 because I wanted it to play to the cookie vibe, HnC because good but also to add that nutty creaminess to blend the bacco to the cookie. Decided to see if I can bend the spice notes of Arabian just a bit with a touch of Cardamom. For me, 0.5 is about right but here I'm going for an indistinct blend of warm subtle spice. This is a new addition and I know Cardamom works but not sure if it will poke through enough at 0.15, but fuck it, let's try it. It is taking the place of FW Hazelnut which was there to boost the nut and overall vibe, I just felt it wasnt needed opting for SV for mouthfeel and to match that ry4 vibe. The Cardamom *should* add to the overall flavor, blend in nicely but also remain a distinct, warm spice that plays both sides tobacco and bakery while highlighting the Arabian spice notes. Not like me to play it light touch and, if anything, I am proud of my restraint.\r\n\r\nDo mind the steep. I haven't actually pinned down when it gets best, 2 weeks is a minimum guess, 3 probably better.\r\n\r\nThanks to the support of the gang in MC for being such a cool group and always encouraging me to try new things!","steep_days":"14","temperature":"0","recipe_score":5,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:51:37.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"975","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Sugar Cookie","flavor_id":"115","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Hazelnuts & Cream","flavor_id":"6056","vendor":"WF","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Caramel Butter","flavor_id":"6046","vendor":"WF","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Smooth Vanilla","flavor_id":"8570","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":100},{"name":"Arabian Tobacco","flavor_id":"4383","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":300},{"name":"Cardamom","flavor_id":"498","vendor":"FA","millipercent":200}],"reviews":[{"user":"kitu5","text":"The sugar cookie, the buttery side of the caramel butter and the Arabian stand out. The hazelnut just kind of gets absorbed in all the creaminess, helping along the baked taste (though the cream adds to the oh so rich buttery goodness). The smooth vanilla  is nice, and adds to the bakery notes. The caramel note in the caramel butter adds that slightly well-cooked flavor and texture that you get with a very, very good cookie. The cardamom is frankly inspired. It adds that… little touch that just brings home that homemade feel. A truly inspired idea that takes this thing to the next level.&#xD;\n&#xD;\nHoly crap man this is... just... wow!&#xD;\n&#xD;\nIt hasn't even been a full day and I'm almost out. That's 10ml in less than 24 hours. &#xD;\n&#xD;\nUtter banger."},{"user":"fieldgreens","text":"I was lucky enough to get to test this recipe prior to it becoming public, so I'm going to copy here what I wrote at the time.&#xD;\n&#xD;\nI'm going to come right out and say it: this is the best recipe made this month.  It's a fucking masterpiece.  It's a delicious cookie, smooth and buttery and dark.  The Arabian is a great compliment, lending literally the perfect tobacco compliment for the cookie, which is something I never thought I'd say.  And here's the kicker:  I absolutely LOVE the cardamom note in here, and I don't like cardamom.  It's just enough to lend the slightest touch of flavor and spice to this.  You should sell this.  It's everything, the kitchen sink, and then the rest of the kitchen and house too.  If I were you, I wouldn't play with the recipe any more, I'd print it on expensive paper and frame it on my wall.  This is an absolute beauty."}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"197505","name":"Arab Mom's Butter Cookie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
