All the best stories and ideas start with alcohol involved. This one would be the later. We had all the makings for a traditional smore on my last camping trip as well as the liquid ingenuity on tap. We also had Reese's peanut butter cups and bananas. Get where I'm going with this now? You would think the combo was thought up by someone under some other flammable influence. \r\nChocolate-peanut butter-banana smore\r\nChumbawumba\r\n3% tfa peanut butter I get creamy generic peanut butter from this when the batch is a good one.\r\n1% cap peanut butter brings the creamy peanut butter closer to the jif or Reese's type I know and love. \r\n.25% flv milk chocolate this gives the Hershey's type milk chocolate syrup note to help give the melted milk chocolate taste of a smore. \r\n2% tfa double chocolate clear while flv milk chocolate is good on its own right it can be a bully and we want some of that chocolate bar-not quite melted all the way taste. \r\n3% fw graham cracker used this more than the usual 1% I tend to use it at to keep the crunchy Graham cracker present in this Uber smore. \r\n2% tfa toasted marshmallow tgives you that perfectly even browned ocd compliant toasted campfire marshmallow taste. \r\n3% tfa banana cream if you haven't tried putting sliced banana on a smore I recommend giving it a try. There isn't a plain ripe banana concentrate (that I've had to date) that doesnt get a \"runty\" note. This a treat and as such I want it to be candyish in terms of sweetness but creamy too to compliment the marshmallow. \r\n1% .9% saline solution optional but I feel if you have any recipe with chocolate in it you'd be doing yourself a disservice without it. \r\n.5% cap super sweet another optional one but the malic acid that it has and maltol tend to be another must have to help chocolate flavors. \r\n\r\nBest after 5 days mainly due to the banana cream and peanut butter but surprisingly shake and vapeable. \r\n","steep_days":"5 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"total_reviews":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-05T17:43:06.000-05:00","best_vg":"80%","views":"2172","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Peanut Butter","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Peanut Butter","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Double Chocolate (clear)","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Milk Chocolate","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":250},{"name":"Graham Cracker","vendor":"FW","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Toasted Marshmallow","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Banana Cream","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Super Sweet","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":500},{"name":"Saline (0.9%)","vendor":"OTHR","millipercent":1000}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"45974","name":"Chumbawumba"}}}
