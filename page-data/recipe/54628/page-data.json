In said article he has the percentages listed for his \"constant\" with Ry4's and then descriptions of each Ry4 and it's percentage and so forth. \r\n\r\nI've only just started playing with tobaccos and specifically TFA Ry4 double (of course) and I'm hooked, my next flavor order is laden with varieties of tobaccos so expect more tobacco based recipes. \r\n\r\nAs I said this is just a percentage tweak, after mixing up the \"constant\" with 5% Ry4 double it's an exquisitely smooth and warm and just moist enough while still being just dry enough to give an incredible pipe tobacco flavor with some real smokiness in there.\r\n\r\nHowever I am obviously in love with butterscotch ripple so I switched it at 3% with the Ry4 at 5%, creating something entirely new and slightly sensual. \r\n\r\nThe name is tongue in cheek but I find it to be super accurate. This is a luscious, velvety smooth, butterscotchin', caramelin', definitely nutty, maybe slightly earthy/dirty, dusted with spices, desert \"tobacco.\" I'll call it that, at least for now.\r\n\r\nI'm honestly a shake and vapin' fool, I just can't ever wait to taste, but this has an awesome flavor immediately that only comes together more and more as time goes on. I really enjoy this because it's such a good sultry vape, I get tired of overly sweet flavors and this has its own sweetness without being over the top. \r\n\r\nAlso I typically mix my flavors and then 10%PG, 3mg/nic and top the rest off with VG but that's just me, I'm not very well read in VG/PG percentages so whatever your preference may be. \r\n\r\nI've been mixing for a little over a year now and am recently feeling very comfortable with and enjoying my recipes but I'm still quite the novice so please any tips, tweaks, comments, critiques, remixes etc are most welcome.","steep_days":"7 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"total_reviews":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-05T11:04:51.000-05:00","best_vg":"0%","views":"1315","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Butterscotch Ripple","vendor":"FW","millipercent":5000},{"name":"Ry4 Double","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Graham Cracker Clear","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Caramel (original)","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Peanut Butter","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Almond","vendor":"FA","millipercent":500}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"54628","name":"Grampy's Smokin' Pipe"}}}
