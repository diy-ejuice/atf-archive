Rather than just a citrusy cranberry vape.\r\n\r\nFLV Cranberry: Its my favorite of the 2 cranberries I own and it seems kind of like an unsweetened cranberry juice to me.\r\n\r\nFLV Lemonade: I picked this up just for the purposes of this ADES month. It’s a really great lemonade and it doesn’t kill my throat which is a HUGE PLUS.\r\n\r\nFLV Lime: I have a love hate relationship with this flavor. When I single flavor tested it ages ago my dumbass tested it at 1% and I wanted to vomit from the taste of Pinesol. I was gonna throw it in the trash but never did. Then Noted had their LIME week and everyone said how great it was you just had to use it low. So I gave it a second chance and it’s a damn good lime. It really helps to sale this more as a limeade instead of a lemonade.\r\n\r\nVT Russian Vodka: This stuff smells exactly like cheap vodka, but it has a fairly strong citrus note when vaped. Which lends itself perfectly in here.\r\n\r\nWS 23 30%: The idea warm lemonade/limeade just didn’t seem good to me. So I knew I wanted to use some WS23. Originally I used this at 1% in this mix and it was super cold more like a frozen Limeade. So I cut it by 60% and it seems more like an chilled Limeade now.\r\n\r\nHope you all enjoy","steep_days":"5 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"updated_at":"2020-12-05T18:48:17.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"1037","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Cactus","flavor_id":"647","vendor":"INW","millipercent":250},{"name":"Cranberry","flavor_id":"2493","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":1500},{"name":"Russian Vodka","flavor_id":"8957","vendor":"VT","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Lime","flavor_id":"634","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":250},{"name":"Lemonade","flavor_id":"636","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":2500},{"name":"WS-23","flavor_id":"8085","vendor":"OTHR","millipercent":300}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"110422","name":"Bottoms Up (Cranade) "}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
