CDS and RY4D are used to bring the spices of the horchata to where they need to be. VWC helps boost the creaminess while adding a touch of vanilla to the mix. Strawberry ripe isn't my preferred strawberry for this mix but it gets the job done. The apple helps round out the strawberry and bring  some freshness to it. I feel with more refinement, this could be an excellent mix.","steep_days":"14","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"total_reviews":null,"updated_at":"2020-12-07T10:43:08.000-05:00","best_vg":"80%","views":"1498","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Strawberry (ripe)","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Vanilla Whipped Cream","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":2500},{"name":"Ry4 Double","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Horchata","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Fuji","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Cinnamon Danish Swirl","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1500}],"reviews":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"18224","name":"Strawberry Horchata"}}}
