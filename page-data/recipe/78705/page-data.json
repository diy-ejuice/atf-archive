Mas­ter Chef Bruce has embold­ened the essence of this fla­vor into a stately and smooth aro­matic fla­vor that amazes and inspires all who taste the wealth of the Jour­ney experience.” There’s no mention of banana there, but from reviews I gather that there is a bit of banana in there. \r\n\r\nI have not tried the original, but created this based off of the description and reviews, and it ended up being pretty delicious. Not so much a tobacco flavor, but it’s good. \r\n\r\nA note on FE Cigar and TFA RY4 Double: this is a really good combo. A few commercial juices I have tried taste like they are using this combo. The Cigar seems to fix up the RY4 Double and make it really pop. There’s a few RY4 recipes I’ve been playing with lately that I’m using this combo in, and it’s really good. The ratio used here is around where I like to keep them. \r\n\r\nINW Brandy has been discontinued, but FA Brandy works just the same.
