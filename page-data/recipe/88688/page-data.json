However it is very delicate and gets lost very easily especially with a steep. So I set out to make a recipe with as few flavors as possible to keep it the main note. \r\n\r\nNot a lot of explanation needed for the choices. Milky undertone does exactly that. Keeps itself underneath the cereal but providing a nice cream. Cereal 27 adds some lacking texture and grain taste and the meringue sweetens and enhances the cream. Give it a go, after all it’s toucans last call!","steep_days":"3 (SNV)","temperature":"0","recipe_score":0,"total_reviews":1,"updated_at":"2020-12-05T12:08:43.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"1862","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Fruit Circles","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":8000},{"name":"Cream Milky Undertone PG","vendor":"OOO","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Cereal 27","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Meringue","vendor":"FA","millipercent":500}],"reviews":[{"user":"Mr-G","score":"none","text":"can't wait to try it"}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"88688","name":"Toucans Last Call"}}}
