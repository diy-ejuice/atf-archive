It's just delicious! ðŸ¤¤ \r\nSo here is a simple & delicious Strawberry Cupcake Batter vape for y'all to enjoy! Ingredients are pretty self explanatory, but go like this in a simple (3,2,1)&(4,2,1) format...\r\n\r\n(Strawberry Ripe / Strawberry Sweet / Juicy Strawberry) provide the strawberry mixture for the batter.\r\n\r\n(Cupcake Batter / Custard Premium / Vanilla Cupcake) provide the ooey-gooey raw deliciousness of the batter itself\r\n\r\nMeringue bridges the gap between, and Super Sweet because you should...\r\n\r\nBelieve it or not it was rather difficult to find a pic of a beaten Strawberry Shortcake on the internet, (it's actually taken longer than developing the recipe! ðŸ¤ª) but I managed to pull through.... So here's credit for that as well... https://www.deviantart.com/bloodthirstyzompire/art/Strawberry-Shortcake-68796692\r\n\r\nHope you all enjoy this one! ðŸ¥´\r\nEither way if you mix it up, let me know what you think!\r\n\r\nðŸ–• The Flavor Ban! Keep mixing up delicious vapes! ðŸ‘Š","steep_days":"7 (SNV)","temperature":"187","recipe_score":5,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T00:51:22.000-05:00","best_vg":"70%","views":"1001","recipe_flavors":[{"name":"Strawberry (ripe)","flavor_id":"271","vendor":"TPA","millipercent":3000},{"name":"Strawberry Sweet","flavor_id":"4745","vendor":"JF","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Juicy Strawberry","flavor_id":"8779","vendor":"FA","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Cupcake batter","flavor_id":"2596","vendor":"FLV","millipercent":4000},{"name":"Custard Premium","flavor_id":"9118","vendor":"FA","millipercent":2000},{"name":"Vanilla Cupcake","flavor_id":"2314","vendor":"FW","millipercent":1000},{"name":"Super Sweet","flavor_id":"2384","vendor":"CAP","millipercent":500},{"name":"Meringue","flavor_id":"530","vendor":"FA","millipercent":500}],"reviews":[{"user":"TheJuiceJackBuilt","text":"Great recipe!
