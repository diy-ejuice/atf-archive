He wanted a Hazelnut, Caramel, Vanilla Cream, Brown Sugar, Tobacco, and that's exactly what he got.  It is mostly a dessert tobacco, mild but very saturated with brown sugars, hazelnut, and vanilla cream.  If you want a more bold tobacco, we suggest adding a bit of FLV Sweet and Smoky, or FLV Red Burley.

This is awesome. The sweetener doesn't touch the tobacco like others do (which it shouldn't imo) but the creams and hazelnut are sweetened right where they should be. I also love what VT vanilla cream is doing in here. I may try adding in that new VT Sahara tobacco, it smells like something that would work in here. its very similar to inw 555 so I think it could push the hazelnut a little more. Vaping this in a Kayfun."}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"205627","name":"Hazelnut RY4 | DEVELOPED"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
