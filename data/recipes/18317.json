    "description": "Quick recipe to get into the competition. Wish I knew before hand to do some testing but here it is. Apple pie ala mode. A nice Apple pie with a scoop of ice cream and caramel\/strawberry drizzle. Enjoy!\r\n\r\nCap cinnamon Danish swirl adds some cinnamon and helps with the crust \r\n\r\nFa Fuji is the Apple filling. One of the best apples \r\n\r\nTfa strawberry ripe is used to add a little sweetness to the recipe and it actually plays nice with the Apple.\r\n\r\nFa Apple pie is mainly there to add the crust and it helps with the Apple alittle\r\n\r\nTfa vanilla bean ice cream is the much needed cream in a Apple pie recipe. It helps round the edges of the cds.\r\n\r\nFa caramel helps with the sweetness and is a nice addition to a pie\r\n\r\nSweetener is a must for me with desert flavors and at 1.5 it does a good job.\r\n\r\nSteep time 3+ days mixed at 70\/30\r\n\r\nWish I had more time to work with this alittle more. Turned out quite nice for the limited\/mandatory flavors. \r\n\r\nWhen vaped you will get a nice Apple pie with plenty of crust and a nice ice cream, with hints of Caramel and the strawberry right behind the Apple.
