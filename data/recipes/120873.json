Calipipitter Chow is such a great flavour and already pretty complex so just adding the equally lovely JF Bavarian Cream was genius. I made a 10ml tester and tried it after letting it steep for 4 days. It tastes like a big bowl of thick cream with a really great caramel mixed in, caramelised roasted nuts and wafer biscuit sprinkled on top- that\u2019s what I get anyway. It\u2019s not too sweet but just sweet enough. "
