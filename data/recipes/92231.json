    "description": "A very simple creamy tropical fruit recipe.\r\n\r\nPUR Tropical Blend is a great creamy coconut and pineapple flavor. It is a great single flavor. It was missing something. I wanted a bit more tropical feel so I threw some CAP Golden Pineapple on top and it. Thought about trying to layer more flavors into it. You know, it needs at least 5 more flavors to be legit. After vaping it for awhile I realized it was great as is. It is tasty off the shake and melds together a bit more the longer it steeps.",
