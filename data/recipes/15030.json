  "description": "I think this tastes like a cheesecake drizzled with honey wrapped into a mild dessert tobacco.\r\n\r\nTFA Mild Black and TFA Black Honey were my first tobacco flavors besides ry4 double. When I first mixed those 2 up I thought they tasted like the Backwoods Sweet and Aromatic cigars that I used to really like. I immediately thought they would go together really well for a dessert cigar.\r\n\r\nTobacco \r\nI wanted the 2 tobacco flavors to shine though with out being overwhelming. Honey black brings a very honey forward light tobacco and the mild black brings a darker deeper tobacco flavor.  The INW gold ducat rounds out the other two tobaccos nicely. None of these flavors are in the realm of cigars you'd find in a humidor, more like ones you'd find in a gas stations but lend themselves well in this recipe. At these percentages each is able to come through while allowing the other flavors to come through.\r\n\r\nNow I have always liked vanilla cigars but I knew the vanilla would need something to bind it to the tobacco flavors so I went with cheesecake.\r\n\r\nCheesecake\r\nI don't think the cheesecake, graham cracker clear,  vanilla swirl would make a good base for most recipes but in this it works without getting overly complicated as its still primarily a tobacco flavor.\r\n\r\nVanillas\r\nThis is the first recipe I used holy vanilla in and it really works well in here, especially paired with the vanilla swirl. The vanilla is there but plays in the background.\r\n\r\nI started off going for a more tobacco forward eliquid. This ended up having a more subtle tobacco flavor and more of honey cheesecake with tobacco notes. I'm really happy with the way this turned out even thought it's not exactly what I started out for. But in the words of Bilbo who also liked a good toke \"You step onto the road, and if you don't keep your feet, there's no knowing where you might be swept off to\"\r\n\r\n",
