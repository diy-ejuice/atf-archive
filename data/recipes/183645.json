  "name": "Skull Candy",
  "description": "This is a mixed fruit candy with a light taffy effect (think airheads) that I am really enjoying. Raspberry, strawberry, grape, peach, and watermelon combine to make one of my personal favorites. This started as a reimagining of one of my favorite store bought Eliquid's which is a grape peach hard candy (from Stache Vape) that I have been vaping for years and it morphed into skull candy. I actually like this more, I can vape it all day without loosing flavor and it's great on coils. I hope you enjoy it and leave feedback if you are so inclined. It's great as a SnV but 4-5 days and it really pops.",
