    "description": "#####**Description & Setup**\r\nBlue Razz Slush is one of my favourite profiles, and I've been meaning to make a nice one for MTL \/ Pod users. There was one original recipe I remember vaping when I first started DIY, so I decided to take that and work from there - considering even the author said it could definitely be worked on more. This is one of my more complex recipes especially for a Pod \/ MTL setup. SnV Certified\r\n\r\nTested on a Cthulu 1928 & Smoant Pasito, 2.5mm 6 wraps Round Wire SS @ 15w. 25mg\/mL Nicotine Content\r\n\r\n#####**Notes**\r\n**OSD Blue Raspberry Slush & LB Blue Raspberry** - OSD Blue Raspberry slush came from the original recipe I built from. It's a pretty damn good blue raspberry flavour, and I highly recommend anyone who loves blue raspberry to get it. I did think it needed a bit of support though, especially in lower power devices, so thats where LB Blue Raspberry comes in. These two together make a really nice and sweet Blue Raspberry taste that is pretty upfront, and OSD Blue Raspberry Slush also somewhat brings in the slush mouthfeel.\r\n\r\n**INW Raspberry WG & INW Lemon Mix** - Foment has always commented on how INW Raspberry WG really brightens and ties together OSD Blue Raspberry slush. That is the main point of being here, it also brings in a bit more sweetness that was definitely needed. I also added in a bit of INW Lemon Mix considering it was in the previous recipe (but using Lemon sicily which just faded too quickly) and I found without it, there was a slight citrus tone missing that really made things feel like an artificial blue raspberry. \r\n\r\n**CAP Hibiscus** - I stole this idea from @Apexified. He used it in his Blue Frost recipe and I was hooked from there. CAP Hibiscus at this % really brings in a sticky and sweet mouthfeel that just really makes things stick in your mouth even after vaping. This is perfect for representing a slushy for obvious reasons, and works very well even in a pod \/ MTL setup.\r\n\r\n**WS-23** - Slushies needs to be cold obviously! You can adjust the % of this if you want, but I found 1% in my pasito \/ cthulu was enough for me. \r\n\r\nHope you enjoy! Please leave a review if you try out the recipe :)",

The lemon mix is just enough to almost give the tart feel on the tongue without turning it into a blue lemonade liquid! Will definitely mix again! I was iffy about not adding any sweetener but it tastes great as written!"
