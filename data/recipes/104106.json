  "description": "A creamy Graham Cracker Marshmallow dusted with powdered sugar.\r\n\r\nA mate of mine loves his Graham Cracker Marshmallow, which is a commercial juice. I bought it out of curiosity but couldn't get over the amount of sweetner it was laced with; by the end of the day I had to rewick as my cotton was black and coils gunked up. To redress this issue and to demonstrate the merits of DIYing, I made up a more palatable version of that commercial juice for him.\r\n\r\nVersion 2 Changes \r\n\r\nA few events necessitated a revision of the original recipe. Vaping ID10-T's Lucky's Charms converted me to FLV Marshmallow so I used his Marshmallow Holy Trinity which is: 0.50% FLV Marshmallow;  0.50% FLV Whipped Cream and 2% FA Marshmallow. \r\n\r\n(The above holy trinity can be found in his Holy Peepus recipe on this site). Consequently, the Marshmallow in this version of my recipe is far more prominent and more jet-puffed than the original recipe. It's lip-smackingly delicious.\r\n\r\nI also happened to get my hands on CAP Graham Cracker V1 for the first time and found it far better than CAP Graham Cracker V2, which is the DX (Diacetyl free version ).No surprises there.  So 1% CAP Graham Cracker V2 was subbed for 1.5% CAP Graham Cracker. It doesn't take the lead in the recipe, just complements the Marshmallow with gentle cinnamon cracker notes on the exhale. \r\n\r\nWhile CAP Cake Batter can add volume and yummy sweetness, it was dropped to bring the marshmallow more forward in the mix.\r\n\r\nTFA Meringue, the powdered cereal sugar, was lowered from 2% to 1.5% to let the marshmallow shine more; it was overtaking this layer too much.\r\n\r\nTFA Whipped Cream was kept for its blending properties. It also has no Ethyl Maltol, unlike the Marshmallows and TFA Meringue, so you avoid overdoing it as it can turn a recipe sickly sweet. \r\n\r\nFinally for that commercial sweetness and to boost the marshmallow,  0.50% FLV Sweetness.\r\n\r\nThis is good to go after a day but give it 3 days for the marshmallows to shine and for the Graham Cracker to blend in. \r\n",
