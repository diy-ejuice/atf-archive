    "description": "Mamasan Guava Pop was one of the first juices I ever vaped. I didn't like it at first, but ended up really liking it. I tried cloning it a few times with no success. When I started playing around with a few POG recipes I started getting that taste I was looking for.  ENYAWREKLAW's POG Remix recipe was the one I was mixing when I found the flavor I was searching for. Thank you Wayne. I added and subtracted, back and forth. This is what I came up with. I may tweak it a tad in the future, but this is tasty.. These fruits just blended into just what I was looking for. In the end I actually like this one better. I get a little more orange flavor. The juicy lemon brings this one together IMO. Good shake and vape. It really comes together after a few days.",
