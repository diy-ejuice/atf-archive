  "description": "Comforting crumbly buttery vanilla Scottish shortbread, great as a stand alone or as a base for fruits, creams and all sorts of other flavours.\r\n\r\nI enjoy this fresh but if you find INW Biscuit too raw the mix really starts to settle after three days getting richer as it ages. \r\n\r\nCAP Sugar Cookie and INW Biscuit - they are great cookie bases that pack a punch. Together they work well at mimicking a proper butter shortbread.\r\n\r\nAP brings forward the grain of the mix, adding just the right amount of bite and the CAP V.Custard (v.1) keeps the mix from being too dry on the pallet giving that overall buttery feel.\r\n\r\nINW Vanilla Shisha added for its inherent bakery notes and general vanilla decadence.\r\n\r\nFeeling lazy?

A real buttery, dense, true Shortbread. I like it most times how it is, but its also usefull as a base for i.e. fruits.&#xD;\nIts a must have, if you like this kind of flavour profil."
