  "description": "**Inspired by the description for Londinium by Roman Haze. I've never tasted the original but this blend is truly delightful. An earl grey tea true to it's name, doused with a lush vanilla cream. I wanted to make a simple recipe that delivers flavor that will keep you coming back**\r\n\r\nDevelopment Notes:\r\n\r\nEarl Grey Tea Base:\r\n\r\n*FA black tea/FA bergamot/JF lemon juicy*\r\n\r\n**FA black tea** can be very dry and unpleasant at higher % but here it sits perfectly. I found that 1.5% was not enough for the tea to shine through, so I landed at 1.75% and it is juuust right.\r\n\r\n**FA bergamot** is for the bergamot oil on our tea leaves, 1.1% is right where I want it. We want to avoid the bergamot becoming overpowering or spicy but we also do not want to lose it in the mix. **JF lemon juicy** is here to provide juiciness for the whole recipe while adding a lil something to the bergamot. \r\n\r\nSimple Vanilla Cream Base:\r\n\r\n*INW shisha vanilla/TPA marshmallow*\r\n\r\nI wanted to make this more of a thick vanilla latte feel rather than vanilla and milk. **INW Vanilla Shisha** was the first thing that came to mind when I was thinking of doing a vanilla earl grey tea. It's got a deep, lightly earthy vanilla flavor that compliments tea and bergamot so well. The first version used 1.5% shisha and it was too much vanilla imo.  I also tried using Holy Vanilla but that version was not as satisfying. \r\n\r\nInstead of getting complex with the cream base I decided to keep it simple and attack the main problem child here: **FA bergamot** can be rough around the edges so I landed on **TFA marshmallow** to complete the cream. This is such a useful ingredient and here it was the last touch to the recipe, it brings the citrus down into the body of the mix and allows for the black tea to shine through on the exhale. It's also adding density to the delightful shisha vanilla. Marshmallow also adds a ton of sweetness which makes this mix all the more comforting. (cannot sub any other marshmallow, this one does too many things here)\r\n\r\nThese two ingredients provide a solid cream base and a perfect pairing for Earl Grey Tea.\r\n\r\nThere you have it. 5 ingredients, right under 5% on flavoring. This is a recipe for tea lovers, cream addicts and vanilla heads alike. I think this is something that anyone can enjoy and I hope that you do.\r\n\r\n\r\n*Before anyone asks, the only sub I can see working is for another lemon flavor, CAP juicy lemon comes to mind. There is absolutely no other vanilla that will taste like this one, so that's out. I think all these ingredients are vital but I understand that no one has all the flavors. I hope you do have these because it's fuckin tasty.\r\n\r\n\r\nEdit lowered the % on cream base\r\n",

I would like to experiment with my new bottle of flavorah black tea in place of FA black tea as I get a bit of a dirty taste from it. Not to say the recipe isn't absolutely delicious(which it definitely is!) but it would be a perfect recipe to test it out on. 5 stars easy on this one. Great job and keep up the good work!"

I tried this with a bit of FA Black Cherry in a second batch to mimic the profile a juice I saw zophievapes mention in her recent vids, at a tiny percent I don't get much of any medicinal cherry flavor as it's blanketed perfectly by the citrus and tea here. Killer recipe that's surprisingly flexible!"

Haven't changed flavors yet, probably will finish the sample before I change flavors already mixed 30ml, and... likely I am going to be making a lot more. I can see this as a perfect morning vape for me. &#xD;\n&#xD;\nThis tea has an amazing balance of bitterness, it really just absolutely nails it. It also juuuust lingers on your tongue after the exhale and then creates for this mouth feeling that is....... Just like you took a sip of tea. Just the lightest creaminess to it I guess from the shisha/marshmallow, nails it, and the sweet/tart/juiciness... It's just so accurate. &#xD;\n&#xD;\nFWIW, I never have tried the juice this inspired this recipe, but, I knew I had to try it from the great description here -- a well thought out and designed flavor, and worth picking up the exact flavors."
