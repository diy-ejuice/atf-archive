  "description": "A bowl of milk and bananas with a bit of soft honey nut cheerios.\r\n\r\nOn the inhale I get a very accurate honey nut cheerios that has sat in the milk for a bit, exhale is like banana slices in a bowl of the leftover milk from aforementioned cheerios. I've vaped through a ton of this and it's my favorite dripper recipe at the moment. As my first public recipe on ATF with limited mixing experience it's by no means a work of art and I give much of the credit to @folkart\r\n\r\n\r\n1% TFA Hazelnut combined with %1.5 FLV M&H gives a really authentic soft cheerio note to me. \r\n3% LA Banana Cream works with TFA's offering to give a more realistic banana and bring it to the forefront.",
