  "description": "------\r\nINW PITAYA IS CHEMNOVATIC PITAYA\r\n-----\r\n\r\nHere's the flavor breakdown. THANKS FOR FOLLOWING! üòÅ\r\n....\r\n\r\nFLV mango paired with Cap sweet mango is a perfect pairing. Brings a nice mango touch to this recipe on the exhale, with a natural tasting not too sweet mango that doesn't have the skin taste of mango which is good in recipes but not for this one.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHEM- Pitaya is frickin delicious cactus fruit. Has a watery taste that is so unique, its the real star of this recipe. Handles the dragonfruit job on it's own. This is a dank flavor that rides through both the inhale and exhale to give body and wetness to the mix, while not being too overpowering. Needs a day or two steep to settle down a little throat hit. \r\n\r\nINW Pineapple is an amazing bodied pineapple that adds to the Sugarloaf to bring a nice featured pineapple taste to the exhale. VT Sugarloaf helps support this by adding some nice fresh cut pineapple wedge taste. \r\n\r\nTPA sour is used here in a small amount to provide a little zest to the fruits \r\n\r\nEnjoy! Let me know what yo think in the comments. Shout-out to the FB group for being a part of the live mix. ",
