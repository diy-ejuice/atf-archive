      "text": "I actually have to revise my review, I initially gave it 5 stars &amp; a rave review however, I had made some intentional and unintentional subs.  First off, I subbed CAP GF for FW (natural) ruby red GF (which btw, so far is the ONLY realistic GF I have found next to INW GF, and I have tried them ALL from common to obscure), I really find CAP GF to have very little flavour even at high %.   Second, I used INW grapefruit instead of white GF which I didn't realize until I ordered from a different supplier were different flavours.  So I recently made this recipe exactly as directed, no subs and am really disappointed with the results, more so likely as I am comparing it to the mix I accidentally conjured up and went through bottle after bottle for several months.  So, as it is, 2-3 out of 5.  with the subs I made, 5+++ out of 5.     I should note. if you try FW RRGF make sure its the natural one.  the other one tastes like tang... blech....  Even though I'm unhappy with the results, I still thank wayne for his hard work, I couldn't have made my now, favourite mix without this as inspiration! :)"
