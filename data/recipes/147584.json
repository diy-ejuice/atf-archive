  "description": "**Everbody Get Sconed**\r\nThis is a raspberry jam scone. \r\nSomething that I have attempted, but until **FLV Starch Base** it just never seemed to come together.  **WF Jam Scone** is a great base to start with; however, it needs a little help with the density which Starch base really seems to provide. **JF Biscuit** also assists with a nice buttery note for the scone. \r\nI went with Raspberry for the fruit in this scone. I used **PUR Sour Raspberry Candy** and **VT Raspberry Jam**.  The Purilum Sour Raspberry Candy, is not that sour, but it gives that great bite of raspberry you would expect to get when biting into a cooked raspberry in a scone, especially combined with VT Raspberry Jam. \r\nThis is a delicious all day vape. Add sweetener to your preference \r\nYou can also switch the fruits out to your favorite fruit. \r\nEnjoy \r\n\r\nFacebook - https://www.facebook.com/groups/diydownunder/\r\nDiscord - https://discord.gg/kH4Fqbc\r\nYoutube - https://www.youtube.com/diydownunder \r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/user/frank1360",
