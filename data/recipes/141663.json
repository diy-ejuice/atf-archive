  "description": "**All Flavorah **\r\nCreated using the new FLV Sweet and Smokey Tobacco. This is a sweet tobacco with some ashy notes. I paired it with fLV Tatanka which is a dark sweet cheeing tobacco. Butterscotch is used to make it more desserty, and pairs perfectly with Smoked Butterscotch. To enhance a bit of nuttiness from the tobacco i used Kinako Soy, and this needed a fruit to bring in some sweeter notes, so Fig was used as an accent. Of course FLV Cream is perfect to blend together and smooth any off notes. So take a ride with me and try this delicious tobacco. And if it was meant to be, leave your thoughts. ðŸ’œðŸ’œðŸ’œ. \r\nhttps://youtu.be/zDo0H8Fm7d0\r\nMusic to listen to.  Meaning to this song. ðŸ’œ",

Running this on an Addy Tuney Kayfun with his patented flavor build. .3 ohm coil at 45 watts and itâ€™s the perfect vape for me with this mix. Thank you Tam for all you do! Xoxo"
