  "name": "Lemon Meringue Pie (Vape Mail)",
  "description": "I once had the chance to vape an ejuice from my friend premium collection and i liked it. It was Vape Mail eliquid and it was yummy lemony juice of sort. I only tried couple of vapes from his tank and decided to mix something similar.\r\n\r\nSo the taste is something close to Vape mail and i liked it so much and made some friends try it and they did also liked it. But still feel it needs some boosting, in the meanwhile if anyone decided to try it let me know how it goes with you.\r\n\r\nDo appreciate feedbacks folks.\r\n\r\nThe one thing im sure about is catalan cream is spot on in this recipe, it has that lemon note to it and it indeed assist LM pie great deal",
