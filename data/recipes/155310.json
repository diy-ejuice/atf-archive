  "description": "A bowl of frosted chocolate ring cereal with full fat milk.\r\n\r\nA lot of people know my struggle with chocolate vapes, as a main flavour, chocolate to me is still a big no no but with cereal being the main star and chocolate being the secondary I can totally do that... especially in this case :)\r\n\r\nStarting with the cereal, the first thing I thought of when I tested cookie bite was “weetos” I had nothing else in my mind, only weetos because the chocolate note in cookie bite is identical, I backed that up with WF cocoa puffs to really bend it towards a cereal. The meringue and starch base contribute to the “frosted” element while the starch base also contributed to that wheaty vibe you look for in a cereal, the milk is self explanatory, FA milk is by far the best milk concentrate I’ve tried especially if you’re just looking for that full fat milk. The sweetener is for my tastes and is totally subjective, it just helps me test and work with chocolate based concentrates.\r\n\r\nIf you like what I do and this recipe then please rate and review ;)\r\n\r\n \r\n",
