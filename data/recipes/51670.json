I love passion fruit in this mix, the guava shines, the tangerine supports the guava and the juicy orange perfectly. The dragonfruit is here to make this mix juicier, so is the orange, and I just can't stop vaping this thing. My favorite fruit\/tropical recipe of all times. It might be a tad sweet in the beginning, but with time, that just become a smoothing agent. I really love this mix on its own, I've never had the original and I don't feel like I need to, now that I've had this."

For me, the orange is very prominent in this recipe and would like to taste a little less orange and a slight more dragonfruit and guava: very small tweek. I would recommend giving this recipe a try for any fruit and citrus fan. "

Nevertheless this mix really brought me into fruity vapes. Upfront you get a sweet and vibrant Passion fruit flavor. If i pay more Attention to taste you really get how the orange and guava flavors blend into the Passion fruit and support it to a Point where you just cant stop vaping it. What impresses me the most is how two very harsh flavors for me (FA Passion fruit &amp; CAP Sweet Tangerine) are tamed here. Im really sensetive to throat hit but really NO harshness in this recipe. Thanks Wayne for making me able to vape FA Passion Fruit "

Such a delightful fruity vape, perfect for summer. Wayne, how you get so little reviews for some of your work is beyond me.  I felt the need to put a review up as I'm starting to make it a habit to review every recipe I mix, because reviews on any recipe are so crucial for the mixers and for the community.  Keep doing what you're doing, this recipe is bangin'.  "
