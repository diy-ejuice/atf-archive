  "description": "Here's my attempt to do a 1 2 3 mix. I've taken it a step farther and used all FLV flavorings. This is a creamy mimosa drink with hints of coconut. It has a nice spring or summer feel to it. So if you need a break from some of those heavy bakeries, this is it! Steep for 1 week.\r\n\r\nVisit Freedom To Mix on Discord https://discord.gg/SmSc8Ef\r\nVisit Freedom To Mix on FaceBook https://www.facebook.com/groups/415341418920740/ \r\nPlease comment, mix, and or rate,....it makes us all better mixers. Enjoy :)",

I am not a coconut fan like at all, but this is more like if you took the coconut out of an Almond Joy/Mounds, threw it in a thick cream and sprinkled a hint of orange zest on it. Definitely left field for me, but I am enjoying it on these semi warm cool Wisconsin days."
