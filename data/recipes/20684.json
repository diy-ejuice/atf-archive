  "name": "Mango Iced Tea",
  "description": "Nothing fancy here, just the nailing of a profile that's long been on my DIY bucket list but wasn't possible before sweet juicy FLV Mango, black tea sweetened with mango syrup and served over ice. There's more than twice as much Koolada in here as I would usually add but it's nothing to be afraid of. Some flavors don't seem to appreciate being Koolada'ed but FLV Mango and FA Black Tea are not among them. Short steep needed because the tea comes on too strong as an S&V.  \r\n\r\nBrief notes posted here: https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/5am6a3/november_2016_recipe_thread/",

Simple, quick mix, throw it in the drawer for a few days and you have yourself a nice refreshing mango iced tea. I don't personally get a lot of cooling factor out of Koolada, maybe I just got a weak batch and need to up the %. I'm going to try throwing 2% WS-23 in here next time. "
