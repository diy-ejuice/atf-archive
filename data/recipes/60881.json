  "description": "This is a delicious \"berry-mix\" candy, similar to Wild Berry Skittles but with a softer texture and balanced flavor.\r\n\r\nFW Gummi Bear / FW Razzleberry / Blue Raspberry Cotton Candy : These three flavors have unique candy properties that perfectly meet in the middle to create something both gummy and hard.  A crisp layer of sweetness coats the outside but doesn't take away from the delicious core. \r\n\r\nFW Razzleberry / FA Forest Fruit Mix : This flavorful duo brings an exquisite mix of berries, all mingling together without overpowering the flavor of one another.  Intense and sweet all in one bite; the ideal candy.\r\n\r\nCAP Sweet Strawberry / CAP Italian Lemon Sicily : I added this to counterbalance the effect of stepping on the blueberry cotton candy since it tends to lose some sweetener properties (more like any EM) and also helps to pop some sour edges to add an extra dimention to the berry mix.\r\n\r\nSalud!",
