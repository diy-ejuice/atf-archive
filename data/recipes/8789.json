  "description": "Tons of strawberry with a bit of cream to round it out. The sweetener can easily be omitted, and the strawberries can be subbed and miss matched all you want. Shisha strawberry has to stay to get that candy/jam like flavor going. Dragonfruit adds a touch of sour or citrus flavor to give the strawberries a little somethin' somethin'. ",

Reminds me of when you put icing sugar over fresh strawberries and let it sit overnight in the fridge to get those sweet syrupy strawberries.  Creams sit quite far in the back and just give it some body and hold it together.  I've been meaning to try switching up the strawberries like mentioned in the blurb but honestly, this is so good I doubt changing it up would make it any better."
