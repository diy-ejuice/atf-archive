  "description": "Simple no steep custard. Well 3 days steep really. Didn't mean for this to be a 1-2-3 recipe. I think the VT Sweet Cream brings it all together\r\n\r\nEDIT: I changed the sweet cream to 1.25% from 1%. I rarely change a recipe after posting, but I think it makes a difference. Also this is a good SNV and  short steeper, but It is ton better at 1 week and 2 weeks.  Even though this is way better at 2 weeks I feel no regret in vaping this before that time.  I vape this and another recipe no all day now. If you mix a lot of recipes sometimes your ADV being simple is a super nice thing.",
