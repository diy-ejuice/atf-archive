    "name": "What the Heck is Iced Rooibos Tea? ",
    "description": "And yet again the weather  calls for snow this  weekend - I am so wanting warm weather and nothing says summer to me like an ice tea  blended juice beverages.    So this is my take on one of my favorites.   A  Rooibos, Ginger, fruit and mint  Iced Tea.  Rooibos is  not actually a tea leaf but an herb native to South Africa and   when harvested and dried can be brewed into a reddish-brown herbal infusion.  Some of the flavors that you can get from it  are  sweet, woody, grassy, vanilla, floral, geranium, honey, herbal and caramel\r\n\r\nI used the Red tea from FLV  for the Roobios tea base.  That is what I get from the red tea a pretty accurate  Roobios tea.  \r\nFLV hibiscus, brings the fruit and the tea together and adds a slight citrus note to this mix.   \r\nThen I wanted to add some  bright fruit   top notes to  infuse with the tea. - FA white peach and   VT shisha peach  - which is a pretty solid full ripe yellow peach. . (A dash of lemon\/ lemonade is also a nice addition but at a very low percent) \r\n The ginger is a nice spcie \/ earthy base note .  \r\nThe golden syrup  provides that sweet honey mouth feel.  \r\n The dash of artic mint provides that hint of mint with cooling on the exhale  barely noticeable.\r\n\r\nSweetner if you want - I like a sweet tea \r\n\r\nThis  benefits from  a steep for these flavors to blend together to make a  fruit tea  infusion beverage  5 - 7 days \r\n",
