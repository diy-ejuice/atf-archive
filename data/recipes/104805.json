  "description": "**Water Malone** from Liquid Barn's [Tastemaker Collection](https://www.liquidbarn.com/pages/diy-or-die). Mixed at the recommended 10%, I liked this quite a bit. I’d heard it was a super authentic juicy yet pulpy watermelon and I had to see for myself. It is that, it tastes like a bold yet realistic sweet fleshy watermelon - but doused with a bit of apple juice. There’s some apple flavor in there and I’m definitely picking that up, both overnight and after steeping for two weeks. It’s like biting into a huge hunk of watermelon... that someone had spilled a little apple juice on. So, natural watermelon with a slight apple off-note. Spilling apple juice on your watermelon is a bit of an odd thing to do, but as off-notes in watermelon flavors go, apple is not a bad one to to have! This solves a lot of the problems many other watermelon flavors have in that it’s realistic not candy and has body but isn’t dry. Very much like biting right into a crispy fresh cut slice of watermelon, except for that little apple taste.  It’s refreshing and light like actual watermelon, but with a full fruity mouthfeel and serious depth to it and a lingering sweet watermelon finish. Awesome stuff. I was more interested in how this might work as an ingredient than in having a watermelon one-shot, though. So, I made a fun little recipe with it. What are you going to do with a watermelon that has a hint of apple? Make a Strap-On of course. Wound up dropping it down to 6% to make some room for other flavors while still retaining all of its qualities. \r\n\r\n**FA Red Touch** At first I tried to be fancy and use FA Pazzo Jack - imagine, a recipe made from not one, but two things intended to be one-shots. That was abandoned as soon as the first batch turned out just a bit soapy. I went right back to the tried and true FA Strawberry from the original Strap-On. 3% didn't stand up as well to all that watermelon and apple but 4% does put the Str in Strap-On. \r\n\r\n**FA Fuji** Tried enhancing Water Malone's apple off-note with CAP Double Apple at first but didn't care for the result. It was too much and rather than mess around with concentration levels of that, we're again back to the OG Strap-On's apple. \r\n\r\n**That's a very funny photoshop, but how does it taste?** \r\n\r\nIt tastes like a well-balanced Strawberry-Apple-Watermelon fruit punch. Like something that you'd expect to find in a Capri Sun pouch. Delicious, sweet, juicy, refreshing. I don't recommend actually shake and vaping it because you might get some harshness from the Fuji, but it needs only an overnight steep to settle down and settle in. \r\n\r\nThanks, D. Keff for the photoshop work.   \r\n",

I didn't have the Water Malone concentrate, but I had all the flavours to mix it and combined with the Fuji &amp; Red Touch, it's a great recipe. You are welcome for the Photoshop work ID10-T, It was great seeing all the different versions on Discord. =]"

I prefer a much lighter Johnson in the summer anyway. I'm vaping it now at the 10 day mark and the apple and Watermelon are still holding up well. Great job. "
