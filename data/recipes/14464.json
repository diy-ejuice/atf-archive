One of my go-to recipes when I don't feel like mixing. \r\n                                    \r\nI wasn't happy with the Unicorn Milk clones around so I just had to come up with my own. Now, while this isn't a clone, it's the exact same profile so call it what you will. \r\n                \r\nI mean, you *could* shake and vape, but it's not going to be as amazing as it is after a solid 10-12 days.  Just hide it and wait for the vape-gasm. \r\n                \r\nI designed this recipe specifically to be steeped so that the creams are nicely homogenized and I wanted the strawberry to last all the way through as a top note, which is quite difficult paired up with those heavier creams but I think I managed by just pure intensity....so please, ENJOY!\r\n::for best experience, wait until it turns a golden amber color...I promise you won't regret it::",
