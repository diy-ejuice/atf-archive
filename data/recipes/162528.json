  "description": "Profile: Yoghurt Drink with Matcha\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nI'm a giant fan of Lime Drink (http://alltheflavors.com/recipes/151335#lime_drink_by_maxsavage) made by @AlfredPudding and @SavageMax so much, so it inspired me to make this.\r\nCompared to their original recipe, I adjusted the numbers for the VT Yoghurt Drink a little, to not overpower the FLV Eisai tea too much.\r\n\r\nThe idea of adding FLV Eisai to the original recipe came to me the day I first tried Eisai. I found it fitting so well, that I had to try and see if my nose was onto something good here.\r\nThe FLV Eisai tea adds a nice earthy Matcha flavor to the mix, that I find go super well with the remaining ingredients in this.\r\n\r\nI fiddled around with the lime a little, tried a few different ones that I felt would perhaps go well with the Eisai, and I landed on VT Persian lime, as I find it to be a perfect mixture of sweet and zesty for the Eisai. \r\n\r\nTo add a finishing touch, I added a little vanilla into it, as I in the past have experienced with adding vanilla to the Lime Drink recipe and where I have tried a few, everywhere from FA Vanilla Bourbon, CAP French Vanilla, CAP Vanilla Custard, CAP Vanilla Whipped Cream, FLV Vanilla Pudding. But I finally settled on INW Shisha Vanilla, as I find it to give that nice vanilla top note that doesn't bully around so much.\r\n\r\nI have tried to not stray too far off of the original recipe, but I think this what I have here is pretty enjoyable.\r\n\r\nGive it 2 days steep for it all to blend in nicely, but works fine as SNV.\r\n\r\nEnjoy!",

      "text": "When VT Yoghurt drink became all the rage, I tried it as a single flavor. It was just OK, I really didn't see what all the hubbub was about. Max's Lime Drink is an amazing recipe, just two flavors and it took VT Yoghurt Drink to a delicious level. I honestly like yours better! It took the original recipe in a whole other direction. The Eisai Tea, as the main note, transforms a basic citrus/cream vape into something else altogether. The lime and cream just compliments the earthiness of the Eisai so well. Very well done! This is some good sh**!"
