  "name": "Strawberry Coconut Milk ",
  "description": "This is a a very balanced and good coconut milk with strawberries the initial inhale you get a strong strawberry right off the jump then its immediate followed by a thick and creamy coconut milk. I know a lot of people \"HATE\" TFA Coconut Extra but at a responsible 0.10% it adds a creamier feel to the FA coconut and it folds in nicely into the Cap vanilla custard this is definitely an ingredient i would say if you need to lower it to 0.05% go for it but don't take it out lol (OK.. OK... IF YOU MUST I GUESS YOU CAN SUB FOR FLV SWEET COCONUT).  Do not look at the 8% Strawberry Ripe and think there is a way to lower it because if you do you will loose the separation and the strong Strawberry vibe. Its hard to distinguish were The strawberry ends and the the coconut begins but there is a definite separation and you get both flavors in a very good separated way. If you enjoy tropical island vibe with your strawberry this is a must try",
