      "text": "This is very nutty literally and figuratively. It’s a nearly Grack-Juice level of weird-but-good. It’s very sweet but also dirty and boozy, smooth but stout.  Full-bodied with a thick creamy feel but no of the usual creamy flavors’ tastes. The creator says it defies the needs for fruits, but countering the toasty nuttiness and boozy brown sugary sweetness I get just a touch of fruity nuance with the lemon from torrone and interacting with the hint musty grape from brandy. What it absolutely does defy for me is the need for a recipe to be a facsimile of some kind of food or drink. It’s a masterpiece of “weird” or abstract mixing. Definitely mix this up for something out of the ordinary that’s as warm and comforting as a big manly bear hug. "
