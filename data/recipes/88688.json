    "description": "After trying many different cereal flavorings CAP fruit circles is my favorite because I don\u2019t get the pledge taste from it. However it is very delicate and gets lost very easily especially with a steep. So I set out to make a recipe with as few flavors as possible to keep it the main note. \r\n\r\nNot a lot of explanation needed for the choices. Milky undertone does exactly that. Keeps itself underneath the cereal but providing a nice cream. Cereal 27 adds some lacking texture and grain taste and the meringue sweetens and enhances the cream. Give it a go, after all it\u2019s toucans last call!",
