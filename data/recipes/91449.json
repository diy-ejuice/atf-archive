  "name": "MBs Rustic Pear Tart #DIYdownunderMarchChallenge",
  "description": "\r\nThis was made for a DIY Down under face group mixers challenge in which pear  needed to be the main ingredient.  if you are interested in joining the monthly challenges you can find the DIY down under group here https://www.facebook.com/groups/diydownunder/\r\n\r\nTop note: I wanted the pear to stand out in this mix not the cream so pear candy will boost the FA pear nicely. and also add some sweetness to the mix \r\n\r\nmid note: Hangsen ice cream has an almost caramel buttery note @ 1.5-2%. which is what I wanted to add to support the golden syrup and buttery note The FA custard combined with the ice cream and sweet coconut  create a lighter cream base that I was after ..( the coconut is not necessary but it adds a bit of sweetness and fluffiness ) NOTE: can sub out regular FA custard but will give you a bit a citrus note which actually works  to  bring the the pear forward.  \r\n\r\nbase : The shortbread and cookie create the buttery crust for the mix and add the base notes. The fig and golden syrup   contrasts the brightness of the pear and create a fig  glaze that coats the pear.  ",
