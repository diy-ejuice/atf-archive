Then I discovered OSDIYs Lucky Shot!\r\n\r\nIn the strictest terms, a Gold bar doesn\u2019t have any chocolate in it at all, due to not actually containing any cocoa... which is handy considering all white chocolate concentrates taste of arse... \r\n\r\nGive this one at least a weeks steep so the caramel & cream flavours have time to settle.\r\n\r\nMix \u00a9 Betamax (Ella Robinson)",
