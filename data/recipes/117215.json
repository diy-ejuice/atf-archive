  "description": "It took me the better part of a year to come up with a caramel coffee profile that did not taste like burnt asphalt to me.  Admittedly this is far more heavy on the caramel than the coffee but so is the one from the fast food joint that I modeled it after.  I used the FLV-Toffee and the VT-Toffee Ice Cream to add some darker layers to the Caramel.  The VT-Toffee Ice Cream also helps to thicken it up a bit.   The FW-Butterscotch accents the brighter caramel notes as  I wanted a full range of caramel lushness in this one.  The WF-Brazilian Coffee adds a bit of coffee to the mix along with the VT-Coffee Milk Froth which also adds a hint of butter to the caramel and helps cream it up a tad more.  This is much better after a good steep so that the flavors can meld together.    \r\n\r\n***The PUR-Caramel Coffee w/Sweet Milk is rather sweet on its own so you may not need any other sweeteners in this one.  Test it first and see.*** ",
