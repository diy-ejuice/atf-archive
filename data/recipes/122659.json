    "description": "*An Arnold Palmer spiked with Bourbon.*\r\n\r\nThis is not really my recipe. It was supposed to be a collaboration with me, @AlfredPudding, and Isuamadog. But you know how there\u2019s often that one guy on a group project who does all the work? Yeah, that was not me. This is really AlfredPudding\u2019s recipe. If he tries to protest and declare otherwise, don\u2019t listen to him. He\u2019s only being overly humble and modest.    \r\n\r\n**FLV Lemon Tea** is the heart of this thing, the star of the show. \u201cWhat? But it\u2019s only at 1% and TFA Sweet Tea is at a whopping 14%?!\u201d\r\n\r\nYes. Usually using one flavor to bend another involves adding a small amount of something to pull another flavor in one direction or another or turn it into something it isn\u2019t. But in this case, the relatively strong Lemon Tea is getting pulled slightly by the stupidly weak **TFA Sweet Tea**. Things taste different when they\u2019re heated and Lemon Tea tastes like hot tea with lemon and no sugar. TFA makes it more of a half-sweet tea with lemon, that tastes more like iced tea. TFA Sweet Tea wouldn\u2019t work for this by itself because it doesn\u2019t have the backbone to stand up to these other flavors, but Lemon Tea does, it just needed to get bent. We don\u2019t just want tea with a lemon wedge, though, we want lemonade. **INW Shisha Lemon and CAP Super Sweet** does that. The Shisha Lemon sits on the fence between candy and natural lemon juice. Pairing it with some sucralose and preservative magic transforms it into a solid lemonade flavor. The result tastes like lemonade made from a powder mix, but with few lemon slices added for that fresher flavor thanks to Lemon Tea\u2019s more natural lemon flavor. \r\n\r\n**The Bourbon Trifecta:** The triple bourbon flavors were used because they each have their own strengths. **VT Bourbon** gives us that boozy top note that lets you know right away this is a cocktail. Think about it; if you raise a Back Nine, Dirty Palmer, or whatever you want to call it, to your face, the first thing you\u2019re going to notice is that there\u2019s bourbon in there, along with the lemon if real lemons were involved at all. VT does that. But this drink is shaken or stirred and the Bourbon isn\u2019t just sitting on top. There\u2019s a deeper, sweeter flavor mingled with the lemonade, one where you can almost taste the corn used to make the sour mash that eventually became Bourbon. That\u2019s where the **TFA Kentucky Bourbon** comes in. Finally, there\u2019s the flavor of the charred oak barrel in which the Bourbon was aged mingled with the more astringent, earthy aspects of tea. Only **FLV Bourbon** is capable of that delivering that. The Bourbon Trifecta. \r\n\r\n**FA Polar Blast** was a final addition meant to make this refreshment extra refreshing and make the \u201ccold things should be cold\u201d crowd happy. It was chosen over WS-23 because it\u2019s a more of a back-end cooling that doesn\u2019t get weird with the VT Bourbon\u2019s warm booze top note the way WS-23 does. It still had to be used relatively lightly to also avoid interfering too much with the tea at the end, but is present enough to be reminiscent of an ice cube sliding over and touching your lip just before you lower the glass after taking a drink.",

The coolant here is perfection. i suggest mixing this up as is. Do yourself a favor and do not mix a small amount of this. It will dance on your tongue with a variety of flavors and then get washed down with a bit of chill to let you just want to pull another drag. It really is a great light vape with lots of flavors. I would totally have bought this and adv vaped this when I first started."
