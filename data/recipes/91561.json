This was updated to a higher VG content like the original Eight Bells and Mild Black changed to TPA Black Mile as they don't make Mild Black anymore. Needs a 2 week steep minimum. \r\n\r\nATF doesn't list TPA Black Mile as a flavor, just know that is what you will have to use to make this. You can't find Mild Black anymore. ",
