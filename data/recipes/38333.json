  "description": "I'm in the group of people that can't taste Strawberries. So this started out as a \"shits and laughs\" recipe, but I ended up finding a strawberry I can taste. I ended up loving it so much that I spent the next few months making tweak after tweak until I found an ADV S&C.\r\n\r\nStrawberry:\r\nThe strawberry I can taste is RF Strawberry (SC). Using TPA Strawberry  Ripe ehances the RF Strawberry (SC). TPA makes the strawberry pop.\r\n\r\nCream:\r\nI tried different mixes involving Cheesecake,  butter cream, custard, but TPA Bavarian Cream with a touch of FLV Cream is perfect; creamy, creamy perfection. \r\n\r\nI prefer this at 60/40 after a 7 day steep. Best after two weeks.",
