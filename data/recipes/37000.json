    "description": "I was single flavor testing Zeppola last week and was starting to notice the \"citrusy\" off notes others have mentioned. For me this was actually more of a coconut like flavor, and reminded me of the crumb donuts I lived on in high school.  so I decided to try and bring that out more with the coconut extra. I use the sugar cookie and graham cracker to try and get more of the crumb texture.\r\n",

I might try increasing the TPA Graham Cracker Clear to 1-1.25% next time, as I found the crumb flavor to be a bit too far in the background."
