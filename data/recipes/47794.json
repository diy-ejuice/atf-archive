    "description": "USED CAP FUJI  FOR THE RECIPE\r\n\r\nThis is a mash up of two of Shindo's recipes I've enjoyed( D Cream and Cantrips). Took the VBIC and lowered it a little to tone down the density and DAP, paired the FA Pear and CAP Fuji to create a bright apple (CAP Fuji has less of the alcoholic note than FA Fuji and is also a bit softer) and then put in a dash of Honesuckle to boost the fruit florals and a bit of Key Lime to brighten the fruits.\r\n\r\nShake and vapeable but you will probably like it best after a 3-5 day steep.",
