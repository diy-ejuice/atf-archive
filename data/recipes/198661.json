Let's meet in the middle and make something nice and tropical to take our minds away from the chaos and to sunny shores. Very pineappley recipe\r\n____\r\n\r\nVT - Sugarloaf : If you haven't made yourself aquainted with this flavoring, you're missing out on something big. This pineapple is outta this world. Shame the Aussies are getting fucked over right now with vaping, because God damn they make some da'gum good flavors. At 2.5% this will make it the star of the show as VT flavors are quite potent and INW pineapple will back it up plenty \r\n\r\nINW Pineapple - I love this flavor. I bounce back to it time and time again whenever I need a reliable pineapple for a fruit mix.\r\n\r\nFLV - Cream : Been favoring this cream a bit lately as it carries a nice dairy note to it which really gives it an authentic cream feel. Brings up the middle body of the flavor quite a bit and takes some bite off the pineapple and hides any offnotes\r\n\r\n",
