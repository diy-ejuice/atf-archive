    "description": "I couldn't think of a clever name so I thought of a cool one. None Shall Pass sounds a lot better then Apple Cinnamon Strawberry Iced Cookie. So that's the profile. I used the basket ingredients with enough percentage that they would be noticeable and to my surprise it actually helps this recipe. I added the biscuit from Jungle flavors to get my cookie and it worked wonderfully. I boosted the ripe strawberry with jungle flavors sweet strawberry and added FA meringue to give me that iced topping effect. So there you have it this profile is an apple cinnamon cookie Sweet strawberry icing. It's a very tasty recipe with no enhancers I hope you all enjoy it. (((((Mix 70\/30 with a 4 day steep))))))",
