  "description": "So this was requested by a Reddit user looking for something similar to Jam Monster. I thought it was a good idea and interesting profile, so off to work I went. This is version 2.25 after my 7th revision. This is more or less the final version, thanks for looking!\r\n\r\nAnother edit: AP at 0.5% thanks to chewymidget\r\n\r\nSome notes:\r\n\r\n*The Jam* \r\n\r\n* This one is simple enough... TPA ripe and INW shisha strawberry show up here as nice and jammy. Some kind of magic with the other ingredients is happening to really get that jam aspect across because I tried this combo by itself and it's not nearly as jammy.\r\n\r\n*The Toast*\r\n\r\nJF Biscuit + AP + FA hazelnut + FA carmel\r\n\r\n* JF Biscuit and AP are the base for the toasty part. Hazel grove at a low % is just contributing some dry, lightly nutty notes to really make the bread seem like dryish toast to be buttered. FA carmel is the last touch to finish our toasted taste. This might be the guy working magic to the strawberry but I feel like its some sort of combo of this and AP and the hazel grove.\r\n\r\n*The Butter*\r\n\r\n* If you're avoiding acetyl propionyl or acetoin just go ahead and skip this recipe. It would be nothing without the butter and TPA butter has got to be my favorite butter flavor. This guy at this % is giving us the perfect amount of butter without getting in the way of everything else.\r\n\r\n\r\nGive this one at least one day to come together, 3 days even better. Let me know what you think, or what you'd do differently.  Thanks and happy mixing!\r\n\r\n\r\n*I have not tried this with INW biscuit but I would sub it at 1% if you must*\r\n\r\n\r\nEdited : subbed out fa strawberry and used INW shisha strawberry instead ",

The toast is just a tad bit too subtle for what I want personally. Having a hard time finding anything that doesn't unbalance the whole mix. In its current state this is still well worth mixing up using common flavors so if you don't have them get them. I personally like this at .5% AP. The newest revision of Shisha Strawberry is a winner. Perfect combo with Strawberry Ripe for a jam flavor. Great mix; very well done!"
