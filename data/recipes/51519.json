    "description": "Custard Humble! My take on a Cr\u00e8me Brulee. May I humbly say,.... what a delicious vape,...WOW! With the high percentage of CAP vanilla custard this recipe needs to steep for a few days, but well worth the wait. It can be a shake and vape but only gets better with time. A rich vanilla custard with a nice eggy note combined with a nice crunchy caramelized top layer. The TPA brown sugar with the FW butterscotch ripple takes this simple custard to a new level of tasty.  \r\n\r\nPlease comment, mix, and or rate,...it makes us all better mixers. Enjoy :)",

And if there was a guru for this way of life I'd subscribe to folkart and his \"less is wayyyyyy more\" approach.   Maybe thats where the screenname comes from.  Folk =Simple\/Ordinary    Art= Art???  Or maybe his real name is Trak Lof.    Where most custard recipes feature 8% Custard, this ones total flavor comes in at 8%.  I'm very much a novice and still learning things but true talent is obvious to all.   Anyways enough stroking Trak's ego.,  The mix is good, Damn good with an unexpected sweet turn at the end.  I've never had vanilla custard, and I've never had creme brulee but they make a great vape."
