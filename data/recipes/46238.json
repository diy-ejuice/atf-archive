    "description": "So I have to eat gluten free which sucks!!!  During spring time my local grocery store gets in gluten cheesecake!  Yummy, It's always a treat but so damn expensive. So I said WTF why not vape it and enjoy whenever I want.  The cheesecake body is credited to Wayne Walker for his knowledge on cheesecake bases. Tweaked a little to my liking. The lemon, the lemon, the lemon ugh!!!  I tried them all from Cappella to inw.  The best one Imo is FA Lemon Sicily only downside is it doesn't last and fades into the mix but still present after a week.  That's why I suggest the 3 day steep to maximize your lemon addiction which is at its peak balance with TPA Vbic. Now you all are probly wondering about the almond. Well the almond.. this particular cheesecake uses crushed almonds in the bottom base crust. FA Almond is used at a very low percentage in the mix to give a subtle almond nuttiness to keep the authentic taste of this particular cheesecake that keeps me coming back for more. In closing the meme is just a inside joke for me because it reminds me of those old dirty ghetto bastards I have to stand behind in line at the grocery store just so I can get my cheesecake fix. Hope you enjoy as much as I do. ",
