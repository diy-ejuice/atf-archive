  "description": "This is a light white  sangria that is perfect for the summer.  Sangria is a  summer drink of wine, mixed fruit,  brandy, sugar and a clubs soda or ginger ale\r\nThe Ginger ale creates the base  for this mix.  While the ginger is a weak note it does add some sweetness and  adds the impression of the ginger spice at 4 - 5 % \r\nThe cranberry apple create the mid note of  this mix  and blends well.  The FLV cranberry apple is a very strong flavor and needs to be used low  %  but could be boosted a bit more if you want a more prominent cranberry note.   \r\nThe brandy and  Sparkling wine helps to bring that grape booze note forward that is part of  sangria along with the  blood orange and sorbet to bring that cooling sensation .  \r\nThe lime and sorbert   create that citrus  and acid balance to the sweetness of the mix\r\nNOTE: The basil does not have to be added but works really well as a note that is present on the exhale  and is similar to what you may experience with mint but  slightly sweeter and not  as  overpowering. \r\nAdd sweetner to taste \r\nLOOKING for a group to learn about  mixing your own juice check out these groups and youtube channels  \r\nhttps://www.facebook.com/groups/diydownunder/\r\nhttps://www.diydownunder.com/ \r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/user/frank1360\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0xkeZFSG04",
