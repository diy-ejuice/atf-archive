  "description": "This is my second attempt at a very specific French pastry on SaturDIY'ing with fresh03 and Friends! We are doing lesson 2 in French pastry and I had completely messed this up on lesson 1.\r\n\r\nA cannelé is a vanilla rum brûlée custard cake that's dense, spicy and a bit rum heavy. It's incredibly well balanced and gourmand and in its special shape it's a two-bites treat and I've loved it my whole life.\r\n\r\nWF Rum Baba/FA Jamaica Special = THe spicy rum. I don't have VT light rum, so that might have worked better but I like this combo as it is also.\r\n\r\nFLV Vanilla Pudding/LB Vanilla Ice Cream = That's Fresh quick's custard which does not require a 21 days steep like any other custard out there. The vanilla pudding gets the egginess out of the vanilla ice cream and in my mix, it works very well for taste and texture.\r\n\r\nINW Crème Brûlée/TPA Brown Sugar = A strong and brown brûlée a cannelé needs.\r\n\r\nWF Angel Cake = it's such a wonderful cake flavoring, and my cannelé is a custard cake.\r\n\r\nDFS Holy Vanilla = it's a lovely vanilla but if you don't have it, you can sub it with FA Bourbon Vanilla at 1% ir another vanilla of your choice.\r\n\r\nSo there you have it, my French touch pastry. Let this steep a couple of days so that everything settles and meddles as it should.\r\n\r\nEnjoy, be queer and vape on!\r\n\r\n[Photo credit: Wikipedia]",
