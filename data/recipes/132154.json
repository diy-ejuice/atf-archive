  "name": "The Godfather Cookie",
  "description": "Anise cookie is a traditional sicilian (Italy) cookie. It has a well cooked body, not too sweet, and the refreshing flavor of anise. We use it with red wine for dessert (like Marsala wine). I grove up with this cookie (without wine, of course).\r\nFor the cookie, after many trials, I find the perfect combo with an high 2.5% of FA cookie and a 1.5% of JF cookie.\r\nFW pie crust work well to give a brown, hard crust to the cookie.\r\nGolden butter essentially make a wet contrast to the dry biscuit base.\r\nFA Anise is a strong, violent, flavor. So, even if it is the profile of this recipe, you can not use more then 0.75%.\r\nTPA Pistachio at 0.5% is the perfect husband for the marriage with anise in order to give a nutty constituency to the recipe.\r\n",
