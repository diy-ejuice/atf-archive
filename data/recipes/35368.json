  "description": "Iced Volcano Gin is an interesting recipe which breaks a lot of your weekly routines and your all day vapes\r\n\r\nI created it to use is in any good rda, rta or even good sub ohm tanks, just make sure that you maybe lower the VG % if using it in subohm tanks.\r\nI crafted this recipe mainly on a dotmod petri and the hadaly.\r\n\r\nThe flavor profile is strong, floral, sweet and unusual.\r\nMaybe a fresh breeze in all the creams, candys, custards.\r\n\r\nFA Marshmallow - you all know what it does, binding the flavors together, balancing sweet and tart\r\nTPA Cotton Candy - sweetens up your life\r\nFLV Lemon Grass - well it does something to this mix, the exotic floral note really gets me here\r\nINW Sparkling Wine - no seen very often but this also gives you a new tasting sensation\r\nFA Gin - the lower, stronger note of my Gin \r\nFM Gin Orange - suprising cool flavor, floral and unexpected\r\nFA Hypnotic Mist - adds that special something to the mix, used it for the first time and i like it \r\n\r\nMix it at 70/30 and steep for 5 days or more\r\nIf the recipe is too strong for you, lower both Gin's a bit\r\n\r\nHope you all like something experimental and new\r\n",
