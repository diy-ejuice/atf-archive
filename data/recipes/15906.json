  "description": "This a vanilla ice cream base with a hint of strawberry with a forward cinnamon apple pie filling mixed in. The strawberry is used both for the flavor and to lend it's sweetness to the apple.\r\n\r\nThe base\r\nImo if you are making an ice cream you need TFA vbic. The FLV cream accentuates the vbic nicely.\r\n\r\nStrawberry \r\nThe TFA and JF at those percentages make a nicely rounded strawberry combo.\r\n\r\nApple pie filling\r\nI tried several iterations and the main problem I had was nailing down the cinnamon to apple ratio. At these percentages we get a nice filling were you get just enough of each aspect with out getting the cinnamon to be super forward.\r\n\r\nI give you Strapped\r\nI was originally going to have Straple in the name but my auto correct kept wanting to change it to Strapped so I went with it.\r\nI know the total flavor percentage is high but I tried cutting it in half and the flavor just wasn't there.",
