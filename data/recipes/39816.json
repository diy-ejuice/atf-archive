  "description": "This Recipe has come a long way from where it started.  When I first started with it I wanted to taste the Blueberry Jam (CAP) so I mixed it up, that wasn't good so I added sweetener...that was good but lacking so I ordered Bilberry (FA) and that was very strong so I remixed it with wayyyy less Bilberry and added Creamy stuff.  It was great.  In the meantime I was testing the Creamy Yogurt (CAP) on its own.  I vaped it along and I loved it and thought \"this would go great in the Blueberry Cream stuff I made\".  And that is my brilliant conception of this Recipe...lolol  I use the word Brilliant very lightly...lol  Anyway, it's good, you can go more or less on the Yogurt depending on how you like it, I love it.   You can use Greek if you like that flavor instead but the whole thing is  yummy and great mouth feel.",
