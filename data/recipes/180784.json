    "description": "An Autumn and Winter concoction that warms the soul and gives you the flavor fix you're looking for. A blend of Apple, Pear, and Fig with a hint of Caramel. This mix is smooth and enjoyable. \r\n\r\nCAP Double Apple - really recreates the crispness of an apple, as opposed to FA Fuji which is much smoother. \r\nFA Pear - Another layer of crispness and also imparts a slightly tart and but mainly sweet flavor.\r\nFA Fig Fresh - This adds another level to the mix, as well as binding the Apple and Pear.\r\nFA Caramel - Who doesn't like caramel with apples???\r\n\r\nCould easily be your new ADV!\r\n ",
