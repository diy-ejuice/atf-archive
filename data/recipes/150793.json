  "description": "Mixer Showdown #1 on the DIY discord entry submitted by the RED team @mLnikon, @AlfredPudding, and @Vishousvapez on 5/9/19. \r\n\r\nVoting ends 5/11/ 19 at https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/bmqjm0/the_mixers_showdown_finish_line/emz2gid/\r\n\r\n\"Zoe is the orange monster from Sesame Street, Cookie Monster absolutely loves his cookies, and one of these things is definitely not like the others. This is a bright, citrus jam covered cookie made for the first ever Discord Mixing competition. It utilizes the jammy texture provided by CAP Hibiscus while completely obscuring the flavor. CAP Sugar Cookie is filled out with FA Pistachio and TPA Cheesecake (Graham Crust) to provide an excellent rich cookie base. We hope you enjoy it.\"\r\n\r\nCome join us on Discord! https://discord.gg/ufVTyAQ",
