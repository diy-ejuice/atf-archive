This recipe is based on a recipe for an African Horned Cucumber sauce recipe:\r\n http://www.theafricangourmet.com/2013/02/african-horned-cucumber-sauce.html\r\nIt is an interesting mix of fruits with spice.  I really enjoyed it.\r\n\r\nThis recipe must be steeped 2 weeks.\r\n\r\nI forgot to write the description when I was testing it, and all I remember is that it was pretty good.",
