  "description": "A real tart blue raspberry type candy vape. No doubt, this is a candy.\r\n\r\nLaying down wf sour blueberry candy as the base at 5% gives this a really strong foundation.\r\n\r\nWf blueberry gummy candy to add depth to the \"blue\" as well as candy notes, and wf sweet and sour rhubarb gives this a very deliciously tart/sour back note similar to a fresh stalk of rhubarb and the tartness that brings, absolutely delicious and unique at 2% in this recipe.\r\n\r\nTpa dragonfruit at 1% adds the juiciness i want in this, i didnt want apple or cactus, peach woulda brightened it up too much i feel.\r\nCap sweet candy at .5% to really just drive that note home and Cap SS used higher than normal for me at .75% for the candied effect of sucking on hard sugar.\r\n\r\nMy gf loves this stuff n i was really happy with it as well i hope you enjoy!",
