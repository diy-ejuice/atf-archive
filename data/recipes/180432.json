    "description": "#####**Description & Setup**\r\nIt's pretty obvious I love blueberries at this point, considering my two current public recipes are revolving around them. Now when you throw those suckers into a piece of candy I'm absolutely in love. That's where I got this idea from. SnV Certified too ;) Hope you enjoy!\r\n\r\n#####**Notes**\r\n**WF Blueberry Gummy Candy** - The star of the show. I got WF Blueberry Gummy Candy a few orders back and seeing there is no reviews, and only one recipe using it - I thought I'd make some notes about it, and create a recipe with it. This is a really nice blueberry gummy candy, but it definitely could use some support. It has a sweet gummy inhale with a lingering candied blueberry that floats about. Highly recommend checking out this concentrate if you like candy flavours. \r\n\r\n**TPA Blueberry Candy** - This is here to help the WF BB Gummy Candy's blueberry a bit. It isn't super pronounced and it needs a bit of a boost to really bring out that nice candy blueberry I was looking for. \r\n\r\n**CAP Jelly Candy** - A favourite of mine to use to make things feel more like a jelly-ish candy. This really goes nicely with WF BB Gummy Candy and is a perfect match up to boost its gummy mouth feel. \r\n\r\n**CAP Super Sweet** - I just like sweet things, this could probably be omitted if you want as all of these concentrates are fairly sweet by themselves. \r\n\r\nIf you are now interested, I've already made a second iteration of this recipe. You can check it out by click on the v2 below. I'm keeping this up because I think its a good recipe that is perfectly vapeable, but my second version brings it up a notch. ",
