  "description": "\"Gun show\" based idea. Daytime Frank came up with the idea of a 3 flavor, 3/5/7% idea so I went with soho as the start as soho is amazing at this %. Built it into a cheesecake and Raven Shadow Vapes wanted some blueberry, so there you go! its good of the shake, but I would let it sit about a week for the cheesecake to settle into the soho. ",
