  "name": "TWIG - a DIGBYS MUMS CUSTARD remix",
  "description": "The term clone, invented by J. B. S. Haldane, is derived from the Ancient Greek word κλών klōn, \"twig\", referring to the process whereby a new plant can be created from a twig.\r\n\r\nI was asked by a friend to remix one of the best commercial custards I have ever tried. I began with 8 flavors. But ended with only 2. If you only need 2 flavors then you should only use 2 (despite my urge/desire to add more). \r\nDigby's Mum's Custard is a 50/50 mix - old school. ",

      "text": "Surprisingly good for a two-flavor recipe. Tasted this one after 6 weeks after not giving it much thought and I'll be making another batch since it's so simple and easy to mix. The DDL lends an almost RY4-like touch to the VC without being too \"dirty\" with its tobaccos aspects unlike other plain RY4 mixes. If you like RY4 without the tobacco notes along with a darker vanilla custard that's not too complex on the palate, this is right up your alley."
