    "description": "INW Lemon Cake tastes like an authentic lemon cake that has been burnt and dried out. So here is a better lemon cake version.\r\n\r\nSlightly Buttery(Cap Golden Butter) With a little hint of fresh lemon(FA Lemon Sicily) and a sweetness (FA Cookie) added to the original lemon cake.\r\n\r\nThis a good standalone but also works as a good lemon base for other recipes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nYou are free to\r\nShare \u2014 copy and redistribute the material in any medium or format\r\nAdapt \u2014 remix, transform, and build upon the material\r\n\r\n(The licensor cannot revoke these freedoms as long as you follow the license terms.)\r\n\r\nUnder the following terms:\r\n\r\nAttribution \u2014 You must give appropriate credit, provide a link to the license, and indicate if changes were made.
