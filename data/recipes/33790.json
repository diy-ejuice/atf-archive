            "text": "Very simple and very easy to make.  Even tho there's way more peach than grape, the peach lays the foundation for the grape to act on.  However the grape isn't loud or vibrant enough.   One drop of Capella Super Sweet in my 10 ml tester, really wakes it up, and really doesn't make it too sweet.  Its missing more grape tho, there's not enough of the acidity and raisiny sweetness you get from the carton of juice.  I think this makes a fine starting point.  Great idea using the peach as a base!  Have you though about using other white grape flavorings to supplement or replace FA?  FA seems to have more of a floral topnote that I don't get from a carton of Welch's. I'm guessing there's been no further development?   "
