    "name": "Tropical eggnog (Coquito)",
    "description": "Inspiration for this recipe struck after working on a pumpkin pie ice cream. Looking into it tropical eggnog, it is actually a thing!!! In Puerto Rico it's called Coquito After looking at a few recipes decided this was something I needed it my life. and trust me when I say you need it yours. Smooth creamy eggnog with a coconut kick, what's not to love?\r\n\r\n\r\n FLV eggnog- this is hands-down the best eggnog flavoring I have tasted to date. smooth and creamy custard, with nutmeg and  cinnamon. An obvious choice for a solid base to this recipe.\r\n\r\n FA custard -  wanted to add an extra layer of custard without the spices. I tried several different variations including, CAP vanilla custard, and FLV custard, flavourart custard was my favorite. CAP vanilla custard ended up muting all of the spice notes, but was still very tasty. FLV  custard was also very tasty but didn't add any complexity into the recipe.\r\n\r\nCoconuts - all three of these flavorings have their strengths and weaknesses. The combination of these three, at these percentages, highlights all of their strengths. To be honest you could probably get away with just using one (my favorite was sweet coconut at 3%.) That said this combination is far more complex, and was definitely my favorite.\r\n\r\nFA Jamaican special- frankly how can you have eggnog without rum? And when looking at rum flavorings if a Jamaican special, also known as Jamaican rum is definitely at the top shelf. This concentrate has a great rum flavor, that pairs up perfectly with the eggnog. I was hoping it would bring a little warmth to the recipe unfortunately, that is not the case you could always try a little TFA Kentucky bourbon, it does bring a level of warm but can't get past the off notes.\r\n\r\nFA marshmallow - does a few things here, for us helps soften the harsh notes, the nutmeg can have as a shake and vape, along with adding a fluffy texture, and adds an extra level of sweetness.\r\n\r\nWhen I was blueprinting this recipe before doing any research on the topic I had banana in the mix. After researching and tasting a reference. Decided to keep this traditional, oddly enough the combination of eggnog and coconut does give me a banana flavor, and TFA Banana Foster would fit in here very very well.\r\n\r\nCriticism and feedback, are much appreciated. Thanks for reading, I hope you enjoy.",

            "text": "It\u2019s smooth and rich and rummy with a nice subtle spice on top and coconut throughout. I really appreciate the way that marshmallow comes in with the thick sweet finish. But, that citrus from the FA Custard pokes out some on top. I wouldn\u2019t have guessed that it would, because I\u2019ve tasted it covered up completely in several recipes, but it comes out a little on top and the coconut top note (the richer, basier coconut is great, tough) is slightly marred by it. It doesn\u2019t taste like it really belongs here. It seems like this could be fixed by swapping it out for a different custard, but notes say a couple of different custards didn\u2019t work so well. Maybe covering it up with something else? The darker rum flavor is lovely in the base here but doesn\u2019t really bring the warm boozy top notes - maybe adding something like VT Light Rum would improve that and simultaneously overpower that lemony thing the FA Custard is doing? &#xD;\n"

This stuff, on the other hand...the eggnog is eggnog. Thick, rich, as it should be, especially with the help of marshmallow and custard. But then with the addition of coconut and rum...damnit. This is tasty as hell. Seriously delicious. I can have my tropical fun and holidays all in one? Brilliant!&#xD;\n&#xD;\nRidiculously tasty. Nicely done!"

Honestly just smelling this recipe gives me a very satisfying nostalga. Such a smooth coconut rum vape. The density of the vape also keeps me satisfied. Great job."
