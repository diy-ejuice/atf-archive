    "description": "FA Cream Fresh at 1 for the light creaminess it imparts \r\nFA Meringue at 1.7 for that milkiness that it has. Also I like using this in milks because even though it technically is a meringue cookie, when mixed with other creams it becomes very much like a thin milk. \r\nTFA Dairy\/milk at .2 to help thicken it up a little bit. Your milkbase will taste like around a 2% milk\r\nTFA Strawberry Ripe to give strawberry some body. It is slightly fleshy with a nice fresh juicy berry tone but it can get lost in the mix so... \r\nINW Shisha Strawberry at 2% as it's a really bright and vibrant berry. It will help the ripe stick around and really bring out the flavor in the berry. \r\nSweetener helps finish it off and tie it all together. Provides a bit of juiciness on the exhale that the strawberry milk needs. \r\nSteep 2 weeks for best results. ",
