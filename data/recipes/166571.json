    "description": "Vanilla caramel \u201ctobacco\u201d with notes of toasted almond. I\u2019ve been chasing the cafe racer lucky 13 \/ lucky bastard RY4 profile. I can\u2019t remember the original actually tasting anything like tobacco. It was just a pretty rich and satisfying  RY4 profile. Working from sense memory here as I\u2019ve not had the original for a few years. \r\n\r\nThis is a stripped back version; the original is said to have contained \u201c13 flavours\u201d. I\u2019m not convinced about that. Although the versions I made with 13 flavours were delicious, I wanted to hit all the main notes with as few flavours as possible here. Like the original, this pairs beautifully with an IPA. My personal favourite pairing is the Gunpowder IPA by Innis & Gunn. But anything with Cascade or Citra hops will work well with this stuff. \r\n\r\nSteep: works surprisingly well off the shake, but I\u2019d suggest leaving it 4-5 days before digging in, as FA Ry4 does develop some interesting notes over time. \r\n\r\nTL;DR if you bought FA RY4 and don\u2019t know what to do with it, this is a good way to use it up. \r\n\r\nPhoto from the [Rustbelt series by Kalie Frisky](http:\/\/www.kaliefrisky.com\/rustbelt)",
