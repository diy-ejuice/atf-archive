  "description": "Lychee fanatics rejoice! \r\n\r\nA very soft, smooth well rounded lychee focused blend with soft gummy mouth feel. Not too sweet, not too floral, absolutely balanced, fresh and different. The best Lychees come from Fujian, and this is the best Lychee I’ve ever tasted. \r\n\r\nThe jobs: \r\n\r\nNicotine River’s pacific cooler provides a hint of coconut, pineapple and is reminiscent of the blue ocean water flavor if you’re familiar with that. I think you can still buy them at sonic. \r\n\r\nCapellas sweet lychee fills out the middle of the recipe and provides some sweetness. \r\n\r\nWs-23 gives it a cool exhale without muting the delicate blend of flavors. \r\n\r\nI chose Flavorah sweetness because I’m really trying to avoid sucralose. You could sub with .5 super sweet but try sweetness. It’s good. \r\n\r\nNicotine River’s blue raspberry taffy helps the blue concept of the mix, and provides some tangy, almost chewy mouthfeel. \r\n\r\nFlavorah’s lychee helps the sweet lychee  stand out by filling out the top notes of the profile. \r\n\r\nI hope you enjoy it!
