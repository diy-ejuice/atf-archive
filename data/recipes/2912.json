For my first few bottles, I used FA Anise at .5, and I took the Black Currant up to 1.0 since I didn't have the Absinthe, and it was still delectable albeit a bit skunky.  Now that I've got the Absinthe , I can review this amazing conglomeration.  Idk how the hell you came up with this, but you are a fracking genius.  It does gunk my shit up a bit, but it's entirely worth rewicking, if only to fill with more Glaistig.  Thank you Runt."
