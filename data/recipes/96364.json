  "description": "I revisited this after awhile and wow! This is so delicious! This is a must try!!  \r\nSimple yet flavorful! The Flv green tea goes well with cream and Milk % honey !!The teas are a great addition to any flavor stash! \r\n \r\n tastes like a wonderful tea with some cream and a very tasty creamed honey note.  it all marries and blends together at about 1 week and steeps out beautifully!!\r\nThe green tea really is great with the milk and honey! It gives the green tea a wonderful flavor and the flv cream which is one of my favorite creams really helps blend the flavors realm well into a delicious creamed honey.. This is wonderful trio and has alot of flavor considering the % is so low.  I can't stop vapng it its so delicious!!\r\n\r\n Give it a mix if you have the flavors.  Its a simple recipe with Low percents but it sure does taste fantastic!!  It has to steep at least a few days.  I didn't add  sweetener, it doesnt need it, it sweet and very bright!",
