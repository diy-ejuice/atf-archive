  "description": "I am not one to enjoy Banana profiles too often, but i saw this profile of Banana pie with caramel and thought I would give myself a challenge, and I love it. \r\n\r\nI broke it down into layers, Banana Pudding, the pie shell, the caramel inside, and topping.\r\n\r\nBanana Pudding:  i wanted a good base that could be used in almost any banana dessert profile, I went with Solub Arome Banana Custard and FLV Vanilla Pudding. These 2 together created a delicious banana pudding.  \r\n\r\nPie Crust:  This combo is one of my favorite graham pie crust to use for a basic buttery graham crust. fA Graham Crust with JF Biscuit. \r\n\r\nCaramel Filling:  pleasantly surprised with these flavors Solub Arome Caramel Butter with Sulub Arome Caramel created a delicious creamy buttery caramel perfect for this profile. \r\n\r\nTopping:  pretty simple with this, Cap Vanilla Whipped Cream. That was all that was needed for this topping. \r\n\r\nYou might like more banana layered in, add some Molinberry Soft Banana or WF Banana Puree. I love it like this. \r\nAdd sweetener to your preference. \r\nEnjoy ❤️",
