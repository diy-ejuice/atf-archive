    "description": "The classic Brazilian Guava Mousse recipe. \r\nIt's different than a bonafide french mousse, but it's certainly delicious.\r\n\r\nI use FW Yogurt and CAP Italian Lemon Sicily to bring the smooth tartness that this recipe needs.\r\n\r\nCAP Sweet Cream + FA Meringue + Creamy Yogurt  are the creamy notes. You can replace CAP Sweet Cream for 1.5% of CAP Vanilla Whipped Cream for a sweeter vape.\r\n\r\nFA Marshmallow brings more texture to the mix, making the vapor chewy.\r\n\r\nAfter giving it a good shake, sit it in a warm bath for 30 minutes and it's good to go.",

            "text": "Is it just me or is CAP Sweet Guava in a league by itself?    Seriously every recipe that has Sweet Guava comes out great. This is no exception.  I'm a heavy Custards and Tobacco Vaper and need to break up the same ol same ol with some fruit once in a while.  While I find some fruit recipes to be quite good they don't seem to capture my taste buds to qualify for an ADV.  When I vape this I get a nice sweet guava that is very smooth and slightly creamy, pudding like exhale. I don't really taste any tart or lemon, but the end result is still great. Nice recipe and thanks for posting something good!"
