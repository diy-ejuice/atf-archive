  "description": "So yes this is an expensive bunch of flavors to obtain But they are all great flavors and are a must have must use!!!! \r\n\r\nThis is a passion fruit creme brul√©. The passion fruit is on the lighter side of things. The recipe I was following  only uses passion fruit juice to add a little complexity to a creamy rich treat. I created this passion fruit juice with Flavorah passion fruit and lime wedge. The lime wedge is used to brighten up the passion fruit a bit because flv passion fruit is a lighter flavor that needs a little kick.\r\n\r\nMy creme brulee:\r\nI used an obvious combination of inawera creme brulee and custard. This combination could probably pull off the recipe alone but I personally like them with a little creaminess and sweetness. I used flavor art meringue as if it was my sugar and I used Flavorah sweet cream to add creaminess. The meringue helps the sweet cream with the creaminess as well. \r\n\r\nNow this is delicious directly after a shake but it is slightly better after a 3 day steep. Enjoy!!! And sorry about the price. But I don't think you can put a price tag on delicious!!!! Not to mention even with the price of these ingredients your still paying less than $2 a 30 ml of mixed juice SO STOP BITCHING and mix this delicious recipe!!!",
