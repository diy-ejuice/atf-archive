  "description": "A Rum & Raisin Ice Cream blend.\r\n\r\nRaisin is a very potent flavour, so not much needed here to bring it to the front.  The Cranberry is present to \"juice up\" the raisin flavour and to separate it from the Rum.  The Rum itself should be prominent and offering a noticeable alcohol flavour.  Using any of the VBICs standalone just doesn't do it for me.  They're too thin, too flat and don't bring much to the table on their own.  I want some opulence and richness in my ice cream base.  The best cream out there for creating mouth feel and \"weight\" is CAP Butter Cream IMO.  We are not looking for flavour from it, just it's rich creaminess and dense mouth feel. CAP VC v1 is bringing everything together and adding more thickness VBIC doesn't really bring to the table for me.  Together, this is a very opulent, rich and creamy ice cream base that balances out the tartness and alcohol from the rum and fruits.\r\n\r\nKoolada is optional of course.\r\n\r\nSteep at least 10 days to let the creams come through and the fruits to soften",
