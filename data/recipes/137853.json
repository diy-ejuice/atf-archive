    "description": "So, I didn't have everything for [MaxSavage's Golden Boy](https:\/\/alltheflavors.com\/recipes\/136243#golden_boy_by_maxsavage), but it sounded delicious.  Therefore, I mixed his idea with my Long Gone Lonesome Blues (minus the blueberries and lemon), adding what I had that was \"all things golden.\"  Thus, Stay Gold, Ponyboy was born . . . I thought I would share.  I've been vaping it all week on the ride to and from work and felt like it was ready to share . . . not to mention, after a long week, I've had a few and have been listening to [Dinosuar Jr's You're Living All Over Me](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=mjOVICqIpjQ&fbclid=IwAR0OqsSSOOF77wfJw7dy5VsnOpkDW336k3mTLKkfRIJszMCMcn8-u36PcVM) and [Sonic Youth's Sister](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=Z2G-gw1pogg&feature=youtu.be&fbclid=IwAR05RVoa25lyzuaT1Gmumg5d5B2GGFHmjQ6HGa1LDzC75bGotRS_NmHAQ0Y) on repeat . . . 1987 was a truly a golden year for music.  I'm feeling my oats. \r\n\r\nThis is a dessert tobacco . . . a creamy, golden dessert tobacco.  ",
