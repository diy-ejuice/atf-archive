  "description": "We all have one. This is mine. A tasty strawberry ice cream with a cookie exhale. I'm not a flavor reviewer so I'll do my best.\r\nJF Sweet Strawberry/TPA Strawberry Ripe is my go to when I want a candy and syrupy strawberry base. No real strawberry here.\r\nFA Cookie adds a nice cookie exhale to the vape.\r\nHS French Vanilla Ice Cream/LB Vanilla Ice Cream is a base I use often with fruits like blueberry and raspberry. It just works.\r\nFA Meringue is there as a sweetener and also adds a little extra element to the ice creams.\r\nFeel free to sub TPA VBIC @ 3%. Unfortunately I found out I was a pepper taster after I bought a 4oz bottle(scotch and flavor orders don't go together). \r\nEnjoy.\r\nedit: French vanilla ice cream HS lowered to 0.25%.\r\nThanks for the advice mlNikon.",
