    "description": "This is a very rich intense chocolate milk. When i was making this i actually messed up adding the choclate this was supposed to be a lot lower. But rather than tossing it i just let it sit. After a weej of sitting i tasted it and thought i was in choclate milk heaven with Hersheys liquid chocolate pouring all down mg body. The flavor was rich in chocolate and simply fantastic. I cant get enough of this mix. If you like choclate milk mix this up your taste buds might go as wild as mine did. I\u2019d figure I\u2019d release this as Wayne\u2019s love for chocolate. ",
