That's the taste after the initial mix, and when first on fresh cotton. After a few weeks, it's more like a custard made with that cereal milk...a light, sweet, almond strawberry custard with a hint of cereal marshmallows. This is some seriously good stuff!"

Then something beautiful happens and a nice thick vanillaee, marshmallowee flavor and mouth feel dominate you very gently. The strawberry fades away and its flavor that can be missed with whatever else you dip.  Im a lazy squonker so if I have gotten tired of whatever I eleaf l filled up with, I just grab this and drip right on over it."

As a shake and vape, the INW Marzipan provides nice, creamy, fluffy notes straight-away. As time passes, the body of the profile fills out, becoming even more fluffy and sweet, without at any point becoming cloying or overpowering. It's mentioned in another review that this doesn't have much flavour. I kinda agree, but don't view this as a negative at all. It's a lovely, subtle &amp; nuanced recipe. The subtlety is what makes this stuff work as an ADV I can keep coming back to. It just never becomes fatiguing. Awesome work right here. "

      "text": "Great recipe, cereal marshmallow flavor very foward in the first week, after a 1-2 steep the flavors meld into what I can best describe as a lucky charms cereal custard.  I have mixed this with and without the 1% sweetner, and also tried both 10% sucralose solution and TPA sweetner which is 5% EM / 5% Sucralose solution...It is definitely best mixed with the 1% TPA Sweetner, just a tip as the sweetner isn't even mentioned on this page"

I think there is too many ingredients being used in an attempt to accomplish what should be a simple profile. The strawberry seems buried beneath everything else. However, the flavor isn't a bad one and I believe I'm in the minority. "
