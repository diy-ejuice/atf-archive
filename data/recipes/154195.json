    "description": "Cream heavy cheesecake, with a buttery crumbly crust and dragonfruit pieces on top! This is not a fruity vape, it's more of a full cheesecake with just a little fruit to make it more interesting! \r\nI've seen people using FA Dragonfruit on a higher percentage than what I use on this recipe, but I find it to be overpowering over everything else when you use it higher, making it hard to balance it when you want to create a fruity vibrant mix, making it difficult to mix it with other fruits. But with all the problems it can create, it is a really realistic and tasty dragonfruit. ",

            "text": "I don't like this at all, but I think it's the entire concept rather than the execution that isn't doing for me. Mentally separating the two parts isn't easy, but when do it, that cheesecake base is absolutely delicious... But it\u2019s quite buttery, and the buttery flavor up against that hibiscus-like floral from the dragon fruits floral makes me nauseated. I've thought in the past that maybe any cream with a lot of dragon fruit needs to be a light cream, now I'm more convinced of that. But, I'd love to see this exact cheesecake base with a different topping. "
