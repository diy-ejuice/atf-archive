No nic salts though, sorry. &#xD;\n&#xD;\nThis is a very vibrant and juicy lemon, with the tiniest hint of sweet and creamy thickness on the inhale. The exhale is the barest hints of that lemon, but a wealth of mints, coolness, and yet, a thick and creamy taste on the exhale. Very different from the normal juices I come across for this kind of device, but a very welcome difference.&#xD;\n&#xD;\nThis is for lemon lovers, people who love their mint, and those who like it so cool, it's friggin brisk!&#xD;\n&#xD;\nI like my lemon, but not the usual sting, which this lacks. The mints are very refreshing. Color this one an ADV. Nicely done!"
