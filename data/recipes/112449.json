  "description": "Some mornings move too fast for my morning cup, So instead I have my morning bottle. This recipe is recommended for a dripper. Make no mistake, this is for you if you're the type of chick (erm I mean dude) that frequents coffee shops.\r\n\r\nAdd sweetener if you like your java really sweet. WF & FA Caramel provide the level I'm satisfied with.\r\n\r\nAdditionally you can add .15% of FLV Irish Cream for a more bold coffee flavor, but it's not absolutely necessary.",

Great mouthfeel too because of the cream and marshmallow. Because of the caramel and the slight vanilla notes it almost tastes like an RY4 that has the tobacco replaced with coffee. Well done. "
