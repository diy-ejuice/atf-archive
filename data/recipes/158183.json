A few days or a week is best and helps the flavors pop imo. I add 1% WS-23, otherwise recipe is mixed as is. I\u2019ve already gone through about 100ml of this and it is now my ADV. just mixed up 240ml "

I mixed this up about 3 days after it was posted (mail time) and off the shaked all skepticism vanished. On the inhale I get that unmistakable \"Blue\" flavor that you would expect to be paired with Raspberry. Then...Surprise!!! Pineapple. Aaanndd it was AWESOME! I vape it in my Kennedy 25 with a .17 build and this is my new ADV where nothing else is even close! Thank You DIYorDIE. "

Sure it can't be compared with a real thing but so what, that's what makes this fun. Flavour and texture is 100% and just lovely!!! I enjoyed this on a Recurve dual RDA at 0.14ohm 65W. Thank you!!! "
