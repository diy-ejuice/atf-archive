  "description": "This mix started out as a bourbon cream and ended up with us pouring some of your granddad’s “special drink” into a McDonald’s chocolate shake (on those rare occasions where their ice cream machine is actually working).\r\n\r\nThis mix was a collaboration between @Foment_Life and I on the DIY eJuice Discord\r\n\r\nThe first draft was 3% Bavarian Cream, 2.5% TFA Kentucky Bourbon, .1% FLV Rich Cinnamon, 1% FA Madagascar (Vanilla Classic), 2% VT Chocolate Mousse, and 1.5% TFA Marshmallow (but we both “oopsied” the marshmallow to about 1.8%).\r\n\r\nWe agreed that it already pretty much tasted like a McDonald’s shake, but wasn’t really what we were going for. We threw around a few ideas, and eventually landed on TFA Toasted Almond at 1.5%. This ended up adding a nice bit of smokiness that really helped sell the bourbon that was lacking a bit. The only problem, and maybe it was because I was dehydrated, but the mix started making my mouth super dry. We decided to let it sit a few days and see if the cream thickens up and helps out with the dryness.\r\n\r\nA few people tested it out for us and really seemed to enjoy it, but we still thought it could be improved. We tried it after a few days steep and the cream really helped moisten the mix up. The dryness issue was pretty much eliminated. Really, the only thing that we thought could be improved was the bourbon. Unfortunately, I only had TFA Kentucky Bourbon to work with, but we both agreed that FLV Bourbon would be a good fit after Foment described it as a more woody/smokey bourbon than TFA Kentucky Bourbon. So Foment mixed up the new bottle and thought that was it. I added the FLV Bourbon to my cart, mixed it up, and fell in love. \r\n\r\nQuick notes:\r\nTFA Marshmallow, TFA Bavarian Cream, and VT Chocolate Mousse make up our chocolate milkshake base.\r\n\r\nFA Madagascar (Vanilla Classic) is there to help bolster and add some richness to the chocolate.\r\n\r\nTFA Kentucky Bourbon and FLV Bourbon are the secret ingredient.\r\n\r\nAnd last but not least, the FLV Rich Cinnamon and TFA Toasted Almond are there to add some extra smokiness and spice to the booze.\r\n\r\nNothing is going to taste bad if you vape this early, however it does take about 7-10 days to reach its peak. \r\n",

      "text": "Booze at the Malt Shop&#xD;\n&#xD;\n Hello Chocolate Milkshake! I'm getting a fantastic thick malty chocolate milkshake with a touch of booze. Not an in your face booze but just kinda mixed into the milkshake. I really like the use of FLV Rich Cinnamon to add a bit of spice to the Bourbon. I'm a little torn here, as I kinda despise TFA Toasted Almond because while it does a great job selling that toasted spice, it leaves me with a noticeable dry finish at the end of the vape. Now, that's not exclusive to this recipe, it's just something that I've always experienced with that flavor in mixes. It very well could be a \"me problem\" but I figure it's worth mentioning. The more and more I vape this the more the bourbon begins to become more prominent which is pretty neat because at first I was kinda feeling like it should have been more forward. This is honestly a really cool recipe and my only real gripe/thing I'd change would be dropping TFA Toasted Almond all together."

      "text": "I get a strong chocolate milkshake with maybe more of a booze flavoring than a booze heat which I was somewhat strangely looking forward to. So maybe don’t expect that. Instead, you’ll get a milkshake that is a thick mouthfeel creaminess halfway between pudding and heavily malted shake with a modest chocolate flavor. It never quite leans either way, which I really don’t mind in the slightest. The only changes I think I would make if I mixed this up again would be to drop the Toasted Almond altogether as it always seems to bring too many unwanted notes for me than the wanted ones, and I’d bump up the FLV Bourbon to bring more of that boozy heat."
