    "description": "This was a request from a buddy of mine, he wanted a heavy coffee with a noticeable chocolate. Also, I will add that this recipe was designed to Vape MTL, as he uses an original Nautilus. I found it very difficult to get this profile down, keeping both notes present without creating any off notes. At the same time I feel that I\u2019ve achieved this profile, and it is absolutely delicious! \r\n\r\nCrispy Coffee WF + FA Up:\r\nThis is used to create the coffee notes, and does a great job at doing so without giving any muddy\/off notes. I started with Brazilian Coffee WF and noticed that flavor would be the ideal replacement if this were a DTL recipe, but too muddy to be MTL\r\n\r\nDouble Chocolate Clear TFA + FLV Milk Chocolate:\r\nThis creates a very nicely balanced chocolate flavor that is more of a chocolate syrup as opposed to a cocoa which would seem more \u201cdusty\u201d. These shine right through the coffee base very nicely. Another thing I found difficult to achieve. Started off with JF Milk Chocolate and realized it was too muddy, along with INW Milk Chocolate. Better for DTL. \r\n\r\nVienna Cream + Vanilla Cream Extra:\r\nThe dairy base, also enhances the chocolate flavors a bit. I find that Vienna cream is almost required in a coffee flavor. \r\n\r\nSuper Sweet:\r\nI like my coffee black, but not in my vape. Gotta taste like something, and super sweet helps pull it all together. I highly recommend using this even if you\u2019re not a fan of sweet flavors, as I\u2019m not. Very important for the chocolate imo. Started with FLV Sweetness, noticed it\u2019s not the best sweetener for MTL flavors, just feels underwhelming in comparison to sucralose. Sweetness is my go to for anything DTL though. \r\n\r\nI myself Vape this out of the innokin Ares mtl tank at around 4-4.2 volts. If you Vape it under 4 volts you will taste more chocolate than coffee, go 4-4.2 volts and you get much more coffee. I wouldn\u2019t recommend going higher than that. \r\n\r\nMix it up and enjoy!",
