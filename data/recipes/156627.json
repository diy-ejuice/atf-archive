    "description": "Simple and tasty chocolate and banana cream mix.\r\n\r\nI don't think the flavors needs much description, apart from **VT Devon Cream**, which has a fantastic chocolate note to it. To me it's a full-out chocolate flavor. **MB Glamour Chocolate** a lighter slightly milky chocolate, and it's the reason why this needs around a week of steeping, since it takes a while for that chocolate flavor to fully develop.\r\n\r\n**Sweetener** is highly recommended for this mix, TFA 1% or CAP 0.5%.\r\n**WS-23** works here too, if that's your thing.",
