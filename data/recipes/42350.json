  "name": "Leche de Coco (Coconut Milk)",
  "description": "*Sweet, thick coconut milk*\r\n\r\nI had given up on coconut vapes a long time ago. I enjoyed using FA coconut but I never was able to get a good mix that featured coconut. I cannot stand TPA's coconuts so I never wasted my time with those. I recently ordered a 5ml of FLV sweet coconut and fell in love, thus spawned this recipe. Here's some notes:.\r\n\r\nThis is another recipe that kind of just built itself, the flavors just make sense and the result is great. Shake and vape ADV for me.\r\n\r\nI saw a post about someone saying they get a coconut taste from graham crust. I'm not sure I get it too but the bottle does smell a bit like coconut. I decided to throw it into this recipe and it just works.\r\n\r\n**FLV Sweet Coconut** a stellar flavor. Before this I couldn't make a coconut vape that I found enjoyable.  I mixed it at 2% solo and it tastes like coconut milk, it's just creamy and delightful coconut. Reminds me of coco lopez. I threw some other things in here just to help it become even more decadent. \r\n\r\n**FA coco** a nice coconut that's light and reminds me of coconut flakes, threw it in to backup the FLV\r\n\r\n**FA Cream Fresh** adds some light cream to the body of the milk. Really fits here nicely, I tried to use Holy Vanilla or Vanilla Swirl here but this works better imo.\r\n\r\n**TPA Bavarian Cream** so I tried this with a couple ingredients like FLV vanilla custard (1%) and CAP VBIC (1%) but Bavarian cream is the answer. Its got a light brown sugar or what some describe as maple nuance which I'm attributing to the Cyclotene in it. A bit of vanilla from the BC also just shines here. Works very well with the coconut to thicken up the milk and compliment it so perfectly.\r\n\r\n**FA meringue** An additive, this recipe doesn't need help being sweet but meringue definitely helps this come across as thick sweet as fuck coconut milk.\r\n\r\n**TFA cheesecake graham** kind of an additive, any higher and it would take away from the milk but its a perfect counterpart for everything else going on. Contributes to the body of the recipe, to me its like 50/50 on the graham vs cheesecake.\r\n\r\nI mix this at 65% VG feel free to go up to 75%, shake and vape is awesome and it just gets better over the first week. \r\n\r\nIf you want it sweeter I recommend erythritol (0.5%) but you can use your favorite sweetener or a drop of TFA marshmallow per 30ml helps sweeten things up too.",

Pretty good off the shake but this is excellent after 3-4 days once the creams start to thicken up and the the tiny bit of harshness I get dissipates. This reminds me of a certain thick and creamy coconut water with small coconut chunks  I get sometimes. A bit linear to be an adv for me but I would like to test this out with a small addition of FLV Mango or some TPA Jackfruit. Great job on this one!"
