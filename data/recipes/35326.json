  "description": "This is an attempt to clone a recipe that a local vape shop mixes called \"Creamy Bakers Delight\". Their mix has a toasted marshmallow note with a creamy vanilla cupcake-like note. It's very good but too expensive $20/30ml.  So since I'm a cheap ass, this is my version. I hope it's just as good....or maybe better :). Enjoy\r\nMaxVG",
