  "description": "My husband got the real New York to Paris juice in a VapeBox back ages ago when he was still getting it and he LOVED it. So I was given the task to try and come up with a mix like it. It took a long time to find the right brands of each of the flavors but I am certain and so is my Husband that I have found the right flavors. He couldn't be happier about this mix. He says it is so close to the real thing. He has vaped 2- 60ml bottles of it over the last few weeks. This one really was a labor of love and I am glad I have finally gotten close enough to be able to lay this quest to rest. lol... \r\nLindbergh Vapor Company New York to Paris: Flavor Description- Exotic Fruits and Cream. A sweet unique blend of Peach, Lychee, Coconut and Cream.\r\nWe smell and taste a light Graham Cracker finish in the original as well so that is why there is Graham in this mix.. Give it a mix and let me know what you think, have I gotten as close as my husband says I have?",
