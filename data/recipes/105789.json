Very good food item to be paired with coffee, and would love to see if I can translate this into vape well enough.\r\n\r\n.05 Rich cinnamon is ONE DROP in a 30mL.\r\n\r\nOk, this is VERY good off the shake, so if you can't wait, you can vape it up. I prefer to let these ingredients sit 1-2 weeks, but its all up to you. Will just get better over time!",

The sugar cookie does a nice job filling that Belgian waffle out. The flavor is pretty accurate, you did a great job. There's a slight dryness to this, but it's not overbearing and to be honest if it didn't have it you would lose that bit of snap it has. I'm curious to see how this will do in an ice cream base next. Solid job!!"
