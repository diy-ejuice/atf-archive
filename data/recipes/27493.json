I don't even think 6% Sweet Raz would be palatable without it, so that's a pretty damn neat trick. Sharing this trick is a special kind of community service for people who don't have access to better Blue Raz flavors such as OSDIY's Blue Raz Slushy. It doesn't really taste as \"blue\" as I want it too, but it's quite bit better than TFA and FW Blue Raz flavors. "
