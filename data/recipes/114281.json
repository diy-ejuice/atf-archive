  "name": "Apricot & Jasmine Macaron",
  "description": "I am not sure who gets credit for the basic macaron recipe as I have seen several mixers using similar ingredients/percentages.  However Shyndo's The Pink was the first one that I tried so I suppose I will give him credit lol.   \r\n\r\nThe floral notes are light and blend in smoothly with the Apricot in this macaron.  If you are looking for something different give this a try.  The Honeysuckle helps blend the Jasmine and the Apricot together and adds a touch more sweetness.  It took me several tries to balance the florals and the apricot into something that would not taste like perfume nor overpower the bakery notes.  I hope you enjoy this as much as I do.  ",
