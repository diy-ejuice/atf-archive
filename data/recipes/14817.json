  "description": "This is the beginning of one of the many attempts at using Watermelon Crack ingredients somewhere else so I can use them for something. I enjoyed watermelon crack but my time with it is over and I'm left with some pretty niche flavors to try to use up. \r\n\r\nSO, this is a shake and vape recipe. Tastes pretty good with the cactus being very prominent. After a few days steep the cactus calms down and everything kind of meshes together. \r\n\r\nIf you don't have INW Anton Apple, bump FA Fuji to 3%.",
