  "description": "Hi all,\r\nI'm a big fan of \"Vapetasia Killer Custard\" and with @folkart's great work, I saved a lot of money. \r\nAfter trying the original honeydew version, a lot of things were clear to me - a bit sweeter and definitely TPA Honeydew.\r\n\r\nI didn't do much, the whole praise goes to @folkart.",
