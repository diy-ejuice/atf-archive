    "description": "This is the first recipe in my new series of Simple-juice, Banana Pudding. (TPA) Banana cream is pretty much already banana pudding, so this recipe is just about balancing the other ingredients perfectly so that it tastes like a perfect Banana Puddin' and not just Banana Mush. (CAP) Sugar Cookie give it that sweetness and lightness to keep it a pudding and then (FA) Meringue is a perfect eggy, sweet, component to make this juice a little more complex. Simple-juice is making e-juice better and more simple. \r\n\r\nKeep mixing!",
