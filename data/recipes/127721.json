    "description": "The 2 strawberries and the vanilla bean ice cream were new flavours for me so I threw this experimental 30ml 50\/50 3mg mix together to try them out and rather wish I'd made 200.\r\n\r\nIt's been on my ADV shelf since birth, vaping in an Aequitas dual clapton 0.23 ohm rig for 6 days, it started well (if a little sharp on the TPA strawberry) and has improved steadily since.\r\n\r\nThe TPA strawberry has calmed down a little, no longer a distinct flavour to the Shisha strawberry, and the whole thing is smoother and richer, very nice.\r\n\r\nI've nearly run out so am trying to persuade myself to put it away for a week so I can see how it steeps, or maybe I'll just mix some more and cane this one !\r\n",

I did make 2 substitutions that was the Bavarian cream I used tfa instead of cap, and the sweet cream I used cap instead of tfa and it is still delicious. Highly recommend this recipe for those strawberry lovers out there. The Bavarian cream really does tie the vanilla bean ice cream together. I always felt tfa vanilla bean ice cream was lacking something found it with Bavarian. Thank you for this recipe I will save it, and enjoy it for many vapes to come."
