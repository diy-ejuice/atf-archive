    "description": "Got this recipe from a gentleman from Indonesia on the DIY or DIE facebook group. Took me like a month to find a place with the butterscotch tobacco (DIY Vapor Supply), and then another month to steep. Gotta say, the first whiff of that flavoring reminded me of MY Great Grandfather, he smoked a similar flavor of pipe tobacco, and I only met him the once back when I was 8...over 30 years ago. Trippy.\r\n\r\n Anywho, as to the juice: It's definitely a tasty, sweet cigar. The butterscotch tobacco blends well with the creams, marshmallow gives it a very full mouthfeel (I assume that's why it's there). It's sweet, lush, creamy, and yet, somehow simultaneously light and airy and dense as hell. Run through my flavor chasing tank or RDA, I would totally call this a dessert tobacco.\r\n\r\nNow, I also have a penchant for throwing any tobacco flavor I have into my Icare2, because it's what I use to run higher nicotine through (need an extra punch to help keep me off cigs sometimes...damned stress), and because I normally run tobaccos through it, I had to try it. As it operates more or less like a closed system device, it simplified the hell outta the profile. In that one, it becomes a dense sweet butterscotch cigar. If that's what his great grandfather smoked, Kra nailed it.\r\n\r\nSo, if i were to do the traditional stars thing, this would be a 5 star. This has become an ADV for me, and I don't even like cigars. Go fig.\r\nThis recipe is for: tobacco fans, dessert lovers, people who like butterscotch or cream. \r\n\r\nIt's everything I thought it would be.\r\n\r\nPermission from the creator given to post this.",
