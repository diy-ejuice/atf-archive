  "name": "Best Damn RY4",
  "description": "This recipe combines two of my favorite concentrates, TPA RY4 Double and CAP Vanilla Custard. Vanilla Swirl and Caramel OG boost the best properties of both the RY4 and the Custard, and a touch of Butterscotch Ripple helps tie it all together. Due the high concentrations of the stars of the show, this one is a long steeper. I give it 2 weeks minimum before I break into it, but at a month the real magic happens, and you have the best damn RY4 I've ever tasted.\r\n\r\nOptional - I like to add 0.5% of CAP Super Sweet to appease my sweet tooth. I've also added 1 drop per 15ml of MTS Vape Wizard to enhance mouthfeel, but neither is needed for this recipe to be delicious.",
