  "description": "It really doesn't get easier than this.  I threw this together just to see if I could make a simple recipe out of the flavors.  It worked.  I know it seems to easy to taste great, but until you try it you won't believe me.  So give it a mix and let me know what you think.  The recipe is pretty self explanatory.  ",
