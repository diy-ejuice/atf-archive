  "name": "Long Gone Lonesome Blues (Blueberry Creme Brulee Tobacco)",
  "description": "Plump blueberries, smooth, custardy creme brulee, and earthy tobaccos.\r\n\r\nA little bit of EdibleMalfunction's Blueberry Trinity (minus the Bilberry) with a kiss of FE Lemon to make the berries pop (per EdibleMalfunction as well and  as evidenced by ID10-T's Viserion).\r\n\r\nThe body of the creme brulee is FA Custard Premium and WF Vanilla Ruyan Custard.  The OOO Creme Brulee is there to add the torched sugar top to the custard.  The creme brulee part of the recipe, with the Vanilla Ruyan and burnt sugar of the OOO Creme Brulee really plays well with the FLV tobaccos.  It bridges the gap between the bright, sweet fruit notes and the darker, earthy tobaccos.\r\n\r\n[Long Gone Lonesome Blues by Hank Williams](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-qcSj97CQU)\r\n\r\nWhere the name Lonesome Rhodes comes from . . . [Elia Kazan's A Face in the Crowd](http://www.tcm.com/mediaroom/video/499661/Face-in-the-Crowd-A-Movie-Clip-Lonesome-Rhodes.html)\r\n\r\nMixed at 60vg/40 pg and well-shaken, this performs admirably as a SNV . . . a day later, and it is still great.  I literally went to bed looking forward to waking up to try this with coffee . . . the experience did not disappoint.\r\n\r\n",

The tobacco and cream base are excellent. I feel the WF ruyan was the perfect ingredient to bridge the 2 together. "

It's the layers. The bright blueberry just bursts out and then there’s this torched sugar and caramel mingled with tobacco that’s reminiscent of RY4s, only better,  with a measure of smooth vanilla custard underneath. I am in fucking love with this recipe! It is now enshrined alongside Cardinal and Abuela as the best tobacco recipes I have ever tried. "
