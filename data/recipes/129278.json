  "name": "Milk Tart Milkshake",
  "description": "This recipe was inspired by a beverage served at one of my local restaurants. Once I had my first sip I knew I HAD to recreate this!\r\n\r\nIf you are unfamiliar with Milk Tart (or Melktert in Afrikaans), it is described as a South African dessert which has a sweet pastry crust and a creamy custard filling made from eggs, flour, milk and sugar. Cinnamon is generally sprinkled on top.\r\n\r\nIn this recipe I am trying to recreate a Milk Tart blended with thick vanilla ice cream.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Milk Tart:\r\n\r\nTPA Acetyl Pyrazine, CAP New York Cheesecake, TPA Cheesecake (graham Crust) and FA Cookie combine to form a delicious crust.\r\n\r\nThe CAP Butter Cream, FW Cake Batter Dip and CAP Vanilla Custard form the essence of the \"eggy\", deliciously creamy custard filling that all South Africans know and love.\r\n\r\nCAP Cinnamon Danish Swirl and FA Meringue gave me exactly the right amount of cinnamon sugar-sprinkled touch to finish off the Milk Tart.\r\n\r\nThe Milkshake:\r\n\r\nTFA Bavarian Cream, FW Milk and FA Fresh Cream plays delightfully with elements of the filling to create the milkshake aspect of the recipe.\r\n\r\nTFA Smooth is used here to emulate that thick, satisfying mouthfeel and to help blend all the flavours (all the flavors, lol, I know!) together.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis took me a few iterations to perfect and I would like to share the joy this recipe brought me with you all.\r\n\r\nIt is fairly decent right off the bat but really comes into it's own after a good 2 week steep.\r\n\r\nPlease give it a mix, comment or rate.",
