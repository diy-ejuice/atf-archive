  "description": "I've always thought TFA Blackberry & INW Grape would go well together, and because I'm having a bit of a love affair with WS-23 right now, I decided to mix up a darker take on a Tiger's Blood Snow Cone. This is only the first stab at it, so I'm wondering if I should lower the FA Forest Fruit a bit and maybe add a touch of Dragonfruit as an emulsifier, but, for the moment, it's fun and tasty enough to share as it is.\r\n\r\nThis is a shake & vape, but, if you're at all squeamish about INW Cactus, give it 3 days, and the actual flavor of it will disappear, leaving behind only the exquisite juiciness.",
