  "name": "Teleos The Milk Redux",
  "description": "Teleos' The Milk was one of my all time favorite juices. I had always tried making it with TFA Fruit Circles because that's what I had on hand. The boys over at Developed have sparked my interest again and I popped for some FW Fruity Flakes.\r\n\r\nFind the inspiration here:\r\nhttps://alltheflavors.com/recipes/145443#teleos_the_milk_remix_by_developed\r\n\r\nMy original version I used 1.75% of FW Fruity Flakes because it's definitely in there, barely lurking behind the sweet milky goodness. 1.75% is too much though...1% feels much better.\r\n\r\nFor my tastes this is pretty close to the original.  The milk needs a little more work.  OOO Cream (milky undertones) might be the trick.",
