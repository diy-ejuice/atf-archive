  "name": "Soho Time (SNV New Skool Tribeca type)",
  "description": "Tribeca was one of my favorite mixes from Halo ecigs and even after I was mixing I would treat myself to a bottle every now and then. This isn't a 1 for 1 of Tribeca but it is very reminiscent of it without being overly sweet like the original was.\r\nCan it really be a Tobacco S&V YES!! Yesss it can!!! I know this is just two ingredients I know Meringue looks high as hell and Soho looks like too much. I know it's hard to believe, but try it! It works and was my ADV for about 3 months. Not only was it my ADV but it's still what I vape when I cant taste anything else. This is a recipe is not mine originally a good friend shared the correct % with me after I tried his juice but he doesn't post on forums and does not want his name on the recipe.  My friend is in groups and knows I share this forward and I wanted to share it here too!   ",

I found a Tribecca clone that is very close, and I think this will complete it...though with how simple this mix is, I may just run with this one!  Thank you, and again, well done!"
