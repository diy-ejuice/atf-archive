    "name": "Layerz - Purple Mango",
    "description": "We spoke about it in this video : https:\/\/youtu.be\/nDlyaa2zQ0M\r\n\r\nThis is not a complete recipe, just a layer - but there is tons of things you can do with it. Its a delicious full bodied juicy mango - with a purple black currant finish. Oddly these two fruit belong together. You are going to need a smidge of Super Sweet to in this combo - trust me. It works very well. \r\n\r\nPotential applications:\r\nIce cream - Perhaps something like LB Vanilla Ice Cream\r\nCocktail - look for a white rum, or vodka base\r\nIce Lolly - Bang some ws23 in here, and you are going to have a party\r\n",
