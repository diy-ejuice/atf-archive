  "name": "Hello Biko",
  "description": "\r\nBiko is a Filipino rice cake made of sticky rice, coconut cream, coconut milk, and brown sugar. Some recipes include butter; which is always a welcomed addition in the recipe, but not required. This is a traditional Filipino sweet and sticky rice cake that was often eaten during the holidays or during parties when I was small.\r\n\r\nFor this recipe, I wanted to capture this rich, delicious, and very much loved dessert my mother would make for us.\r\n\r\nIt is very tasty right away but 1 week steep would be optimal.\r\n\r\n♥️ I hope you enjoy it ♥️\r\n_______________________________________________________\r\n★Q & A \r\n\r\n• Question: Is this very sweet?\r\n• Answer: Yes. On a sweetness scale: 1 (not sweet) - 5 (very sweet). I would rank it a 4.5.\r\n\r\nNote*\r\nIf you do not prefer added sweeteners like Super Sweet - feel free to substitute with Meringue. Or feel free to leave the sweetener out. It is nice & sweet on its own. \r\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - \r\n• Question: Can I mix at a higher VG ratio?\r\n• Answer: Sure thing. 70/30, 80/20, whichever you prefer. However I would increase the steeping time. Approx. 1.5 - 2 weeks.\r\n\r\n______________________________________________________\r\nPhoto Credit: Maria K",
