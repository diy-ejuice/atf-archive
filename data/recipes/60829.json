  "description": "I've struggled to taste strawberry and have mixed alot of strawberry and creams. This recipe was another attempt but looking outside the box. I was at nic rivers purchasiing nicotene and noticed there new strawberry biscuit flavor. I thought the biscuit might hold on to the strawberry longer and make the sweet cream taste more like a rich milk. The results where a nestle quik strawberry flavor and most of all I could taste the strawberry. This was huge for me and is my ADV now. Vaping on a tesla nano 120 with a vaporesso pro tank .5ss ccell 35 watts. Regards all.",
