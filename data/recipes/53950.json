      "text": "This is a well balanced mix. I just finished my 15ml tester and it's time to give my thoughts. I want to start with the vape experience. This has some nice volume  to it. It's rich and full, the mouth  feel has a nice dense almost chewy quality that is important to the profile. The zeppola that's in FA wow does a great job of blending with the CAP glazed doughnut and hiding that play-doh flavor so what you're left with is a nice sweet doughnut and no off notes. So if anyone reading this is concerned about that, no need to worry here as long as you let it steep the recommended 5 days. The strawberry combo was the right choice and is one of my personal favorites to use. The cream is binding this mix well, it was a good choice here as it's helping separate the strawberry from the doughnut so you're left with a filled doughnut and not a strawberry cake type doughnut. The only thing for me personally I would change is the CAP CDS. I completely understand why it was used, it does a great job of filling this out and that pastry note is great in this, but the cinnamon is a bit distracting from the profile. For the most part it's hidden but I can still pick it up. I'm not saying that it's bad, I actually enjoy that bit of depth it gives. It just pulls me away a bit from that clear distinction of a strawberry filled doughnut. All in all this is a great recipe and I'm really enjoying it. I'm glad this is the one you suggested, and if anyone likes a doughnut vape I'd recommend they give this one a try. An easy 4/5 for me."
