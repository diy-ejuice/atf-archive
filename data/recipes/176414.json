  "description": "This recipe exists because of Foment_life's spectacular pear trinity, as found in his recipe [DAAPled Pears](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/164335).  The combination of FA Pear, TFA Pear, and FA Fuji is hands down the best, most realistic pear I've ever had in vape form.  I'll repeat what I said in my review of DAAPled Pears: it is a smooth, sweet, crisp work of art.  \r\n\r\nI wanted to see what this pear trinity would do in a Placid-esque recipe (I assume everyone is aware of Adirondack's Placid . . .if not look it up).  I combined the pear trinity with VT Persian Lime, WF Strawberry Gummy Candy, TFA Honeysuckle, and LA Cheesecake.  I wanted a cream presence in this recipe and find LA Cheesecake to be a perfect neutral cream.  It has a heavenly aroma and adds a full, creamy mouth-feel to this bright fruit/floral mix.  It turns this into a creamy, sherbet-like version of Placid.  I could also see this pear trinity working with VT Fizzy Sherbet and/or VT Yoghurt Drink. \r\n\r\nEven if you don't mix this . . . please don't sleep on the beauty that Foment_life has created with DAAPled Pears.
