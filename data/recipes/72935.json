  "description": "This was made as a simple 3 flavor recipe to prove that you can mix something lovely in under 3 mins with only 3 flavorings.  The wetness and authenticity of the peach in this mix because the apricot in this small % rounds the flavor and gives the moist lips feel here. The LB VBI is a gorgeous thick rich and lovely ice cream and the vanilla in that concentrate really offers a delectable bonus in this easy recipe. Enjoy! :) ",
