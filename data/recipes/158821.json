  "description": "So   I love when you are having a dicussion on flavors and spontanously  a recipie pops into your head .   @Freshepies and I were  talking about a SA grapfruit cream and   this mix   developed as we were talking     So I finally had a chance to mix it  .\r\n\r\nOn the inhale you get a sweet honesysuckle vanilla   cupcake  with notes of blood organge citrus at the finish \r\nThis is a light  profile  that works well on an RDA   tested  on a reload S rda at 55 watts with an .15  alien coil\r\n \r\nThe anglefood and vanilla cupcake create the body of the  for this mix   - angel food cake is a fantastic flavor but needs a little support  as can get lost in a mix.   vanilla cupake works for that  buttery  darker  vanilla forsting note  and adds some body to the cake part of the mix. \r\nHoneysuckle well  i just love it - it adds a lovey sweetness that just acccents the fruits  \r\nBlood organge champlage is a light bright  blood oragnge top note   and the grapefruit cream is  a  creamy slightly vanilla grapefruit note   that supports the citrus tart notes in this mix and sits in the middle \r\nTahitian vanilla  is a  lighter brighter vanilla to help  fill out  that vanilla through the mix\r\n\r\nAdd sweetner to your liking   although I do not think it is needed ..I would use FLV sweetness  .50 if you wan tto bring out some  of the  sweeter fruit notes ",

Itâ€™s largely covered up by all the other stuff here so you might give it a try and see if you get the same thing, but I get just enough hand soap from it to pretty much ruin what seems like an otherwise very delicious cupcake.
