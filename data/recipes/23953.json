  "description": "a Delicious and sophisticated Bourbon and Nut Custard.\r\n\r\n27/12/2016:\r\nDropped the liquid amber from 0.75% to 0.3% and upped the Butter Pecan by 0.5%. Also added some AP to bring out the nuttiness of the Butter Pecan and Torrone a bit.\r\nI felt that the mix wasn't sweet enough so added 0.25% sweetener.\r\nI'm happy with where it is now as a shake and vape, Will let it steep for 7 days and come back with my findings\r\n\r\n14/01/2017\r\nI gave the juice 2 weeks to mature as a week wasn't enough.\r\nIt's a rich custard with burnt sugar and bourbon undertones with a noticeable nuttiness on the exhale. The liquid amber carries the bourbon flavour nicely at 0.3%.\r\n\r\nAll in all I'm very pleased with the results. I don't see this as an ADV just because of how heavy and rich it is, but it's a satisfying vape.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
