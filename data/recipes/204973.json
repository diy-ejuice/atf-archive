  "description": "***NN APPLE IS VSO APPLE***\r\n***BF PEAR IS VSO PEAR***\r\n***OOO 50/50 CHERRY IS VSO CHERRY***\r\n\r\n\r\nthis was mixed live on Fresh03's channel on Saturday 9/5/20, on ELR it is called Martha Washington's Great Cake.\r\n\r\noff the shake this is very good. that SLIGHT anise from nonnas cake plays so well with the bourbon, which is very light, like you cooked with it, and the fruits. It darkens them like they've been cooked...The fruit is lighter than the cake note. And there is definitely a solid nutty note as well. Will be playing around with this more, but overall I am very impressed initially. Will also steep.\r\n\r\nv2 boosts all fruits by .5%\r\n\r\nThis is very good off the shake but would suggest a few days for proper homogenization.\r\n\r\n***AS ALWAYS add sweetener to your subjective persuasion***",
