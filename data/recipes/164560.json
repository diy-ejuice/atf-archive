  "description": "Shout-out to @ID10-T for this name, in Noted's episode for Booze Drinks he says that mixing Toasted Marshmallow with kentuky Bourbon is like having \"Sex In your Mouth\". \r\n\r\nI'm posting this recipe for every mixer that loves bourbon as i do, as this is really good and simple.\r\n\r\nAt this percentages, once is fully steeped (around 15-20 days), you'll get a good toasted top note, a slight bourbon note and a lot of marshmallow.\r\nAt this moment bourbon starts to fade a bit and toasted marshmallow thickens the mix, so test it and crank that bourbon to where you like it. ENJOY! \r\n\r\nPs: Super Sweet is not necessary but i like it really sweet.",
