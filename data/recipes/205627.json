  "description": "This recipe was submitted by Slushy for You Vote, We Mix.  He wanted a Hazelnut, Caramel, Vanilla Cream, Brown Sugar, Tobacco, and that's exactly what he got.  It is mostly a dessert tobacco, mild but very saturated with brown sugars, hazelnut, and vanilla cream.  If you want a more bold tobacco, we suggest adding a bit of FLV Sweet and Smoky, or FLV Red Burley.

      "text": "I don't think I can ever use another sweetener with a tobacco again. This is awesome. The sweetener doesn't touch the tobacco like others do (which it shouldn't imo) but the creams and hazelnut are sweetened right where they should be. I also love what VT vanilla cream is doing in here. I may try adding in that new VT Sahara tobacco, it smells like something that would work in here. its very similar to inw 555 so I think it could push the hazelnut a little more. Vaping this in a Kayfun."
