  "description": "Just started diy a few weeks ago and wanted to try my hand at this. I Enjoy cooking and wanted to see if mixing is similar. \r\nThe third flavor concentrate you can get from a website called Mom and Pop Flavor Concentrates.  I was told it is like (Cap) Premium Vanilla Custard, but richer, not heavy at all.\r\nYou can sub-ohm this mix but I mixed it to be vaped in a RDA. I intended to make an e-liquid custard style mix but wanted it to be light,,, not to weigh down.  The Cap sugar cookie helps a lot to bridge the flavors Together.   I believe this can be an ADV. \r\nI am squeaky new to this so any advice is welcome ...     (Can be shaked and vaped but may get a slight off note on the exhale from the honeysuckle,,, Best after 7 days). The longer,,, the better !!!  Peace",
