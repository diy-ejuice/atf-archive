  "description": "**A much BETTER version of my $100 Strawberry Custard**\r\n  \r\n**FA Premium Custard** is the most realistic custard on the market, hands down. Where CAP VC is oftentimes *too* eggy and weird tasting(though I enjoy the HELL out of it), FA's version is perfection. **TFA Ethyl Maltol** is used here because frankly, EM does a better job at not only sweetening custards, but also performs double duty by *thickening* custards. \r\n  \r\n\r\nRecommended steep: 7 days(but good fresh)\r\n\r\nRecommended VG: 80%\r\n\r\n*Please don't use this recipe for commercial gain*\r\n\r\n**E-JUICEMAKERS ONESHOTS**",

Is there really enough Strawberrytaste after a steep? &#xD;\nWill the vanilla and the EM not mute the Strawberry? I will give it a try and report and rate after steeping.&#xD;\nUpdate:  I like to add 1.5% OOO Strawberry Jam for the FA Juicy Strawberry, to make the other Strawberries a little Jam'ier.&#xD;\nBut its a solid, good recipe, how it is."
