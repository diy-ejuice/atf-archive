    "description": "This is a lightly baked banana with caramel and bourbon notes.  After a longer steep, a subtle earthy RY4 comes through in the middle of the exhale.  \r\n\r\nI've been eating bananas every morning before I leave the house, and for some reason whenever I smell anything that is supposed to have a \"Bourbon Barrel flavor\" I think of banana.  This flavor association seems like it would be a delicious thing to inspire an e-liquid profile   This time of year my beer of choice is a Bourbon Barrel Aged Stout, so I wanted to create a vape that not only paired with them side by side but also had enough nuance to vape all day and enjoy it.  \r\n\r\nThe core concept:   TFA banana cream\/TFA toasted marshmallow\/TFA Kentucky Bourbon\r\n\r\nThese flavors come together to create that flavor association I keep getting in real life.  It's smooth, creamy, and predominantly banana.  The TM\/KB combo serves to enhance that banana into something interesting.  It almost gets a bit baked by the combo.  I landed at these percentages because any higher on the TM\/KB and it got to \"warm.\"  The 3-1-1 ratio here is the sweet spot, at least for me.  Play around with those a bit if you want to adjust the bourbon to your liking.  \r\n\r\nI wanted to add a touch of earthiness and a boatful of dark sweetness into this recipe, so caramel and butterscotch bolster the sweetness of the cream base.  I didn't want to go completely tobacco, RY4 double along with the Butterscotch Ripple was a great couple of flavors for that.  If you let this steep closer to a month and beyond, those tobacco notes show up in the middle, subtle enough to really add something nice to the profile.  \r\n\r\nEnjoy folks, and long live winter!\r\n\r\n",

I'm giving it a 4-star review but the only reason is because I find the flavor to be a bit too weak, so I'll try upping the total flavoring for myself next time I mix this. &#xD;\n&#xD;\nOn the other hand, it should be a huge compliment that I've mixed this 3-4 times (including the earlier variant), because I almost never mix most recipes that I try again, since I'm one of those people that doesn't really have an ADV and just keeps mixing new shit all the time. So good job on the recipe!"
