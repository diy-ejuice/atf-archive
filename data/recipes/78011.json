  "description": "There's nothing particularly new going on here since this recipe is kind of a remix of Vurve's Birthday ice cream Cake (https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/16823) which I completly adore. I'm still learning the ropes but thought this was worth sharing.\r\n\r\nCake Base: The usual suspects, JF Yellow Cake and CAP Vanilla Cupcake.\r\n\r\nIce cream layer : ID10-T's magic formula, HS French Vanilla ice cream (0.5%) and LB vanilla ice cream (4.5%). This has been slightly thickened up and emulsified with Favorah Cream. \r\n\r\nAccents: I'm not a huge fan of banana but I love a hint of it in juices.  LA Banana cream provides a hint of candy/ taffy banana, as if the ice cream has ripples of banana syrup through it. However, FLV Milk and Honey does some magic here and combines with the banana to give the ice cream cake a lovely warm, slight boozy sweetness. TFA Toasted Marshmallow was added for mouthfeel but also to provide some brown sugar sweetness. It particularly  works well with FLV Milk and Honey, as I learnt from Cheeba Steeba's amazing Milk & Honey recipe. (https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/13546#milk_honey_by_cheebasteeba) \r\n\r\nAnd that's it! I'm sure more experienced mixers could do much more with far less ingredients than I have used here but the recipe tastes quite good as it stands. \r\n",
