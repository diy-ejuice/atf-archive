    "description": "Tres tropical= a kiwi and pineapple laced Tres Leches cake. I don't really think the ingredients need much explanation it's kind of obvious why I used what I did but here is short explanation. The tres Leches cake is the white cake and tres Leches fw. A tres Leches cake is a cream cake  of sorts so my frosting mixture actually helps with the cream cake profile. My frosting is made with a combination of cream cheese icing, meringue, and vanilla whipped cream.  It's a nice light frosting perfect for the profile. So the most obvious part is my fruit toppings I used a combination of kiwi, and pineapple flv and golden pineapple by cap. If you don't have pineapple flv just leave it out and boost the golden pineapple. Other than that I love this mix it's a delicious vape. A great fruity bakery for the summer time fun.. Enjoy!!\r\n\r\n\r\nI used .35 flavorah sweetness. You can use or don't use whatever sweetener you prefer but this is what I used.",
