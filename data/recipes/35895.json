  "description": "This is a simple bakery recipe the 3 flavorings work very well together to obtain this profile. The FLV Poundcake and FW Yellow Cake combine to bring that dense cake note and the FA Lemon Sicily pops out and lays right on top. I know you will enjoy this simple and delicious vape.",

This recipe achieves it with only 3, and it's still a full lemon pound cake. The cake notes are just right, and don't mute the glorious lemon. Great recipe, thanks."
