    "description": "Mixlife - Mixoff  Jarvis v Jerry -   Caramel corn cake pop with vanilla sugar orchid frosting.    After this steeped for about 4 weeks and even as it steeps further the sugar orchid turns into this lovely frosting note, the popcorn note is a bit lost in here, it's more like just a caramel cake, but that wasn't a bad thing, just wasn't what I was going for.  If you like light flavors with a creamy cake taste this is a lovely recipe for just that purpose. ",
