It's delicious both ways and worth ordering anything your missing to mix it up. It nails the cookies and cream profile so perfectly for me, the cookie in particular is stunning. Thanks very much for this!"

I really hope you keep mixing and sharing because I love how you use different flavor concentrates. I don't mind ordering new flavors because it really switches it up in a good way. I learned a lot from you on in the mix DIYorDIE YouTube and really appreciate it and hope you keep mixing. "

I have just mixed my third and when it is gone I will have vaped 360mL of this. IT IS GOOD. To me it tastes of sugar cookies and vanilla icecream one minute and Lofthouse Cookies the next. SO DAMN GOOD. Fantastic job on this one! BTW if you do not have Tahitian vanilla on hand just throw in Shisha Vanilla, it is the same good but slightly different. I misplaced my Tahitian bottle on round two of this and it was still banging with INW Shisha Vanilla&#xD;\n"

      "text": "ThaDentman sent me 30 ml of this juice for an honest review so here it is. This recipe intrigued me but I didn't have a lot of the oddball flavors so when Dentman asked me which recipes of his I'd like to review I selected this one. &#xD;\n    So right off the rip It's a light delicate and creamy flavor. As you vape it you get a strong vanilla flavor paired with the sugar cookie on the inhale. Not a shortbread sugar cookie and not a homemade sugar cookie, but one of those shitty supermarket ones with frosting and hard plastic sprinkles on top. Despite what this sounds like it's a really good thing in vape form, it just works and tastes delicious! You literally get every single aspect of it including the sprinkles and aerated sugar frosting. &#xD;\n    The exhale you get a creaminess that isn't too dense and reminds me of a dairy queen ice cream which just works with this flavor. It doesnt overpower the other flavors and comes across as balanced enough to all-day vape! A drop of this on the back of the hand tastes like sweet heaven. &#xD;\n      In summary this is easily a 5/5 well thought out recipe and worth the purchase of flavors. My only critique is I think this profile could have been tackled with more common and accessible flavors. Despite that this is 5/5 on accuracy and a fantastic vape. Well done Dent."
