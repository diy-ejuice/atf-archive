            "text": "I would say the kiwi and strawberry really get lost here but I don't care because this is easily one of the best orange flavors I've ever tasted. It reminds me of a tropical creamsicle and its soft, slightly thick, naturally sweet, and full of a nice orange vanilla pop with a hint of raspberry for some reason. I can't complain. It might even be a cream saver, it's really hard to tell but I haven't stopped vaping it since I received it."
