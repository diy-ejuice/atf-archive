    "description": "The single best froot loops you'll vape. \r\n \r\n2 week steep minimum. \r\n\r\nWho doesn't love fruit loops? \r\n\r\nFirst we start with our loop base. \r\nUsing Fw flakes\/loops and tfa circles make for a great sugary base. \r\nYou can omit the Fw flakes if you're scared of the sugar syrup. \r\nAP adds a touch of grainy flavor, you can sub 2% tpa or Fw rice crispy type in place of AP. \r\n\r\n\r\nCap lemon meringue pie finishes our loop base and starts our creamy milk. \r\n\r\nHoly vanilla is our secret weapon for our milk base. At this low of a percentage it has a fantastic milky flavor and is lightly sweet. \r\nSweet cream deepens out the milk flavor. \r\nVienna cream is a necessity of this recipe, it blends fantastic with HV And whipped cream creating a wonderfully unique and balanced cream\/milk flavor. \r\n\r\nOba Oba is the secret ingredient of this recipe. Honestly, I won't tell you what it does. You'll have to taste that yourself. \r\n\r\nThe Bavarian cream is here to complement the milk base and add more sweetness to the mix. The light caramel notes you'll taste create that sugar coating on the loops\/flakes. \r\n\r\nLooking for a great mixing group on Facebook?

What holy vanilla and oba oba do underneath this mix.... its like boobs, you dont know why they're so great but they just are.  I subbed in FLV sweet cream at 1.25% cuz its what I had but I cant see that making a massive difference.  Thank you so much for this well crafted recipe, Ive thoroughly been enjoying it, at the moment I am waiting on a new bottle of fruit rings cuz I actually ran out and I am just jonsing for it!   I have vaped it straight off the mix, after a warm bath and its good but certainly comes together nicest after 1-2 wks.  Gotta give that vienna cream time."
