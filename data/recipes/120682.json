  "description": "A thick, creamy, sweet, and spicy gingerbread cake with cream cheese frosting. Working on some simple seasonal/holiday mixes for the changing season and hit this one on the nose. Really loving this. Great as shake and vape, but gets better over time as the spice tones down a bit.\r\nCAP Gingerbread 3%- A great gingerbread flavor but leans a bit more towards a dry gingerbread cookie. I want cake.\r\nFA Jamaica Rum 0.50%- Adds just a touch of sweet spice and darkness.\r\nCAP NY Cheesecake 5%- I always grab this when I want something creamier and have more weight(mouthfeel). Also used it for the cream cheese frosting note.\r\nCAP Butter Cream 1%- Mixed with the NY Cheesecake it completed the frosting and added more creamyness.\r\nTPA Acetyl Pyrazine 0.25%- To give it a more grainy baked note.\r\nCAP Super Sweet 0.25%- Just a touch of sweetener to, well you know, make it sweeter. You may omit the sweetener and it is still great. Some may feel it doesn't need it at all.",
