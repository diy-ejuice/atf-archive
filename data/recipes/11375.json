  "description": "My version of the sicker than most clone.  Make it as a 35PG/65VG ratio otherwise the flavors don't really come out very well.  I always steep my liquids afterwards in a baby bottle warmer for about 15 minutes and then take the caps off and let them breath while they cool.  I then let them sit for about a week in a cool dark place.  Then vape and enjoy!  Let me know what you think.\r\n\r\nI have been able to make this recently with an 80/20 mix I just boosted the flavors of the blueberry, strawberry, and sweet cream by 1%.",

It mixes all the flavors making it difficult to spot the flavors, except for tangerine, that is detactable on the exhale. But it's sweet and creamy in general. I've made a 30ml bottle to test it, and it's already dry, in 2 days. I'm making a bigger batch now. Thanks man!"
