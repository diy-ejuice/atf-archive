    "description": "I am officially delving into fruits. I literally vape creams\/desserts 99.5% of the time, meanwhile fruits are the largest and most neglected part of my flavor collection. \r\n\r\nWanted to make something with my INW peach and she's the star here. I browsed through my flavor bible and saw that bourbon\/whiskey is a good pairing for peach. Needed a couple other fruits for body\/contrast so I thought a small amount of papaya would add depth and play well with the whiskey. Lastly, the pineapple is here for its sweetness\/tartness and it pushes all the fruits down into the body of the recipe. This allows the whiskey to shine in the top notes\/exhale. \r\n\r\nFeel free to bring whiskey up to 2% if you want it boozier. \r\n\r\nCertified shake and vape but I give it a day or two to homogenize a bit.
