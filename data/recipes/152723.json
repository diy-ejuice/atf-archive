  "description": "Lovely Creamy Vanilla Greek Yogurt topped with Honey Bee.\r\n\r\nCreated after a request made in a well known FB group, CF - The Kitchen.\r\n\r\nI used some of the finest aromas made available by FLV to create this smooth, slightly sour and vanilla rich vape recipe.\r\n\r\nThe base ingredient is FLV Greek Yogurt, upped the % to make it stand out from the vanillas used in the recipe, FLV Marshmallow Vanilla makes this mix so fluffy, while the combo FLV Vanilla Smooth and a little FLV Vanilla Pudding create a rich and full bodied vanilla taste.\r\nWho said layering flavours does not contribute to mixing? Let me prove them wrong.\r\nFinally added some sweetness and topped the mix with my all-time favourite honey, FLV Honey Bee, a very versatile honey with many faces.\r\n\r\nEnjoy this fine and delicate tasting vape.\r\n\r\nBeen on the shelf for awhile, no degradation in taste.\r\nSteep at least 5 days, gets better with time.",
