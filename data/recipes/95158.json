  "description": "Simple Orange ice cream using ID10-T's 1 2 3 idea.\r\nI'm still trying to figure out VT Mandarin. IMHO it is a candy orange but has an almost effervescent quality to it (ALMOST). I'm just getting into Orange vapes so my stockpile of flavors is limited. This is the most candy-like orange I have and it works pretty well here.\r\nFA Orange gets a bad rap but it's very realistic which seemed to balance out the VT mandarin's syrupy taste plus it's strong enough to show up @ 1%.\r\nLB Vanilla Ice Cream was a no brainer for me since I don't get pepper from it and it works well @ 3%. \r\nI didn't use sweetener because VT mandarin is very sweet already but it's DIY so if you like it sweeter then go for it.\r\nEnjoy",
