  "name": " Pistachio Brûlée - Soho",
  "description": "Soho and RY4D give this recipe tobacco notes but it is heavy on the pistachio extract notes. The creams in this mix give it a very nice, very smooth and creamy finish and the AP accent the bakery and nutty notes in the mix.  I would describe this a comforting warm deep desert tobacco vape.\r\nThis recipe has been very popular on ELR and was uploaded there in August of 2016 so there are a few comments there if you want to go take a look at what people are saying about it.
