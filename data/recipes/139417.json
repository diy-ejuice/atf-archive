            "text": "I really like this simple recipe.  Using Blood Orange to boost VT Pineapple Juicy ( nice flavour) is a clever flavour-pairing technique. The VT Raspberry jam certainly fills it out and gives a much needed inner jammy texture,  without detracting from the overall profile. This is my favourite pineapple gummy recipe by far. Really clever mixing. Keep on truckin dude!  Mix this up, you won't be disappointed. "
