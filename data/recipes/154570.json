  "description": "This is Dmc's first version of Boba's Bounty. I really enjoyed FE Black n Milk in this mix but Flavor Express no longing carries it. The sub for this and feel is close to the milk but has a little bit more chocolate.  \r\nFE Black Mile is the base tobacco used. It is a nice bold tobacco with hints of chocolate nice dirty tobacco cigar flavor that is mildly sweet.\r\nFLV Arabian is used to recreate the spicy earthy notes with hints of fruit raisins that I pick up on from boba's at first I went .5% but it was adding to much of a leather top note so I dropped it to .25% to let layer in the center of the vape.\r\nFLV Milk & Honey for the bakeries notes I chose this. I know its milk n honey lol but I immediately pick this profile from boba's and I do get underlying bakery profiles from milk honey not sure why but I do. \r\nSaline I chose this additive to give that slight wetness and center mouthfeel  I get from boba's as well to tame the Arabian. I know this will bring out the coco notes slightly but is not that noticeable. I feel we are on the right track with this mix. Phase 2 I may use some type of bakery that may be lacking a little but not far off.  Sugar cookie maybe? We shall see. This mix though by itself is pretty good where its sits as far as being a good dessert tobacco. With a few more tweaks  I feel it can only get closer",
