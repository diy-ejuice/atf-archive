  "description": "I remember my grandfather's pipe and how good it would smell every time he would light up that Prince Albert soft vanilla. It was this sweet tobacco that left a nutty vanilla scent just lingering in the air. It wasn't offensive like a cigarette, it was a smell I really enjoyed. It's one of those nostalgia scents, and when I smell it to this day it reminds me of him sitting on the porch just puffing away enjoying life. Prince Albert is a Burley tobacco, and until I tested FLV Red Burley, no other Burley flavors brought me back to that place in time, they all missed the mark of what Burley really was. So now that I found it, I give you...Prince Albert's ​Gold!\r\n",
