  "description": "Delicious Grape Jelly Gummy!! \r\nI tried creating a few grape recipes this year and they all ended up with a weird 'coiny'/copper aftertaste, so I almost gave up on grape.\r\n\r\nThis has perfect balance on the grape without leaving a weird aftertaste thanks to INW Grape and Jelly Candy Combo. This is a Delicious Grape Candy Shake and Vape that will leave any grape fans with a Smile!!\r\n\r\nI dont think this one needs much of a explanation. Just mix it up if you like grape or gummy Candy!!\r\n",
