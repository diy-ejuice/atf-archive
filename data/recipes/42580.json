  "description": "Always been a big fan of custards. Always been a big fan of butterscotch. Always been a big fan of vanilla. This is the outcome of a dirty threesome on a hot summer night in the bed of an El Camino during a drought. I present to you: Custard Fucker. \r\n\r\nJokes aside, this is my attempt at a thick, creamy butterscotch custard with vanilla that lingers in the mouth afterwards. I honestly wasn't expecting much when I was putting this recipe together but I was pleasantly surprised with the outcome. Please try this out and let me know how you feel about it, onwards to the notes!\r\n\r\nCAP VCv2, FA Custard, CAP Golden Butter and FA Meringue - These come together to bring the custard base. I wanted to make a more buttery custard for the base so that way the vanillas would really seem to pop and not just settle in with the base. CAP VCv2 is more buttery that the v1, and provides a decent mouth feel by itself. FA Custard is different because I feel like it has a hint of lemon to it, but at 1% the lemon doesn't intrude upon the rest of the recipe and just adds to the thickness. CAP Golden butter helps in making the custard more noticeably buttery and FA Meringue helps to add to that mouth feel. \r\n\r\nFLV Butterscotch and FW Butterscotch Ripple - I wanted a nice butterscotch that was somewhere in between a hard candy and a gooey drizzle. FW Butterscotch Ripple was an obvious choice because in itself it is exactly what I am looking for. However, I felt as though it needed to be more pronounced without taking over the recipe entirely, so that is where FLV Butterscotch comes into play; it just helps to make the butterscotch aspect more present in the entire recipe. \r\n\r\nCAP French Vanilla and FA Vanilla Tahity - These are the vanillas that I chose to incorporate in this recipe. Anytime I make a custard, I always use CAP French Vanilla due to it's richness and how well it works in custards; you can't go wrong with adding it to a custard. Like the butterscotch portion, I wanted to boost the vanilla and that is where FA Vanilla Tahity comes into play. At 1%, this helps accentuate the vanilla in the recipe without overpowering anything else. \r\n\r\nSweetener is subjective but I tend to have a sweet tooth. \r\n\r\nAnd there it is! Mix it up and please let me know what you think!",
