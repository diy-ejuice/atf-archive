    "description": "This is a collaborative creation by DEVELOPED: NaChef, Max Savage, Graham, and folkart. \r\nWe wanted to make a Red, White, and Blue themed recipe so this is our version of a  Blueberry, Raspberry Tart.  To add a bit of brightness, you can add FE Lemon at .25% and to make it a bit darker you can increase the JF Cookie to 1.5%. Full Development Notes at https:\/\/youtu.be\/NR731Ylixe8\r\n\r\nOur weekly episodes will be released at 6:00pm EST every Tuesday, and catch our live shows every Thursday at 6pm EST https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/c\/DevelopedDIY",

Not surprised that it\u2019s a very well balanced flavor, given that developed comes out with my favorite recipes, but for a recipe way out of my ballpark in terms of the profile, I can\u2019t put this down. It\u2019s so good. If you\u2019ve ever had epicus nebulas Blue General this is spot on to the fruit but also has a way better base. Keep em comin guys!"
