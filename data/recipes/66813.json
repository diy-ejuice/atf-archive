      "text": "Hot damn this simple little recipe is fire!!!! If you love jujube type candy then this is a must mix! This mix tastes almost 100% like those bright pink bunny head jujubes you find around Easter time. Coincidentally those happen to be my all time favorite jubes' so this recipe is like heaven to me. I believe that pink lemonade flavor was the absolute perfect choice for the jelly candy addition as they combine seamlessly and produce an extremely accurate jujube flavor and texture. The splash of dragon fruit gives it the perfect nuance to build on that jelly flavor and juicy mouthfeel. Cap ss is absolutely essential to this recipe so don't skimp on it ðŸ˜‰. An awesomely simple recipe that every candyhead should mix. Now I must go and order a 120 of pink lemonade!"
