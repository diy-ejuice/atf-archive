    "description": "Fresh banana & butterscotch topped with a dollop of fresh cream & chocolate shavings.\r\n\r\nThis is a deceptively simple recipe which packs a wallop of flavor! A simple combo of classic flavors recreates the childhood treat of banana with butterscotch  and cream.  \r\n\r\nFlv Banana  is a creamy, natural, ripe banana which permeates through the vape without trying to be the boss. The banana will eagerly accept the lashings of goodness about to be bestowed on it as it knows it needs a little help to shine.\r\n\r\nThe butterscotch & cream combo is a fabulously rich and decadent topping which provides a luxurious & classic flavor combo. \r\n\r\nFLV Acai is the secret ingredient here & plays a couple of roles.  This mysterious berry is the fruit of the Acai palm tree and its flavor profile is a cross between  blackberry, raspberry and chocolate. The inherent tartness and realistic, rich, berry flavour enhances the relatively linear banana, balancing the sweetness.\r\nThe chocolate shavings comes from the acai berry\u2019s natural cocoa characteristics  & provides a rich, natural chocolate note\r\n\r\nGibe this baby 5 days or so to fully develop & enjoy!",
