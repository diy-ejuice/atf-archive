    "description": "!!!! Updated!!!!! The addition of orange cream really Mary's the icing to the all the recipes. After vaping through 30 milliliters of the original in less than 24 hours I knew I was a fan of this recipe. The addition of orange gives you a lovely contrast and a little bit of that fruit flavors making this already great recipes even more addicting. Be sure to check out the original!!!! Fairly quick steep time on this one joy needs at least 24 hours to blend in with everything else after that it's good to go.",
