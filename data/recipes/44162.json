Scott was kind enough to get it into this month's Awesome Box for everyone to try, followed by Liquid Barn restocking this \"seasonal\" release. \r\n\r\n**No, you can't make any substitutions and arrive at the same result.**",

The mint is decadent as all get out, and the coffee...it's nice and strong, but not overpowering. This stuff is so good, i wrecked my 30 ml inside of 4 days (which is a record for me), and I kept scorching the cotton because it's so tasty, i'd keep hitting it until \"oh, hell.\"&#xD;\n&#xD;\nTwo quick questions: Did you get these cookies off the girl scouts Wednesday Addams jacked?&#xD;\n&#xD;\nand more importantly:&#xD;\n&#xD;\nHow in the name of all that is holy am i the first one to review this?!?&#xD;\n&#xD;\nSublime stuff, man."
