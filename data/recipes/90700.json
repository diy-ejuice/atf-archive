  "description": "Inspired by waynes sweedish fish recipe, trying to highlight CAP 27 fish. This is just me trying to take a recipe and turn it to something I can enjoy since I tend to have a hard time tasting things. Tried to give it a bit more gummy body and push forward the top notes. if youre like me and can taste 1/18th of a drop of blackcurrant then youll want to give this a day or two for that top note of it to fade away a bit and let the main things take over. let me know what you think.\r\n\r\nPS...this seems to work better at lower wattages. When I used it in a series setup it was pretty muddled and just like sweet heat. But when I use it in my entheon around 42.5 watts its so much better and you can actually get more body and not just a muddled flavor. I assume its because of the EM content in some of the flavors. Once the power is high enough to volatilize it then it just doesn't work well. Rookie mistake yes but I still love this recipe.",
