  "description": "A delightfully Dark and Rich vape with cherry chocolate nuances and a touch of chewing tobacco layered on a classic tobacco pairing. \r\n\r\nTatanka is interesting as hell and quite a polarizing flavor. I couldn't find a tobacco that paired better with cherry or chocolate in the entire flavorah line. Layered on top of a classic combination of cured and red burley it really shines. The red burley really adds a touch of nuttiness and wonderful tobacco body and the cured just goes hand in hand with it. \r\n\r\nCherry Extract is surprisingly light at 3 percent and really helps brighten up an otherwise dark and rich vape. It can also really help those chewing tobacco notes from Tatanka pop and keep them interesting. That touch of cherry also reminds me of that lovely red fruit note you get from some of the really nice chocolates like valrhona.\r\n\r\nChocolate Deutsch lends an all-encompassing dark rich chocolatey body for everything to settle into, turning this into a lovely vape to have with your morning coffee. It really also helps dry out the vape a bit and keep it in that lovely tobacco realm. Some people get a light coconut from this flavor, I think the cherry and tatanka mask it quite nicely making this more of a rich dry chocolate back note with a slight hint of riesen. \r\n\r\nThank you FEAR and Graham for testing it for me and telling me to release it ASAP, and LonesomeRhodesTN Ckemist and Chemical Burn Victim for keeping it real in the tobacco world.

I tried this without Chocolate Deutsch initially, subbing in VT Chocolate Custard at 1%, which was wonderful, but nothing compared to the magic that happens with Chocolate Deutsch. That flavour is the perfect match for this profile. A luxurious vape. Amazing work. "

I donâ€™t really get any cherry, but the chocolate coconut tobacco is good enough for me.  Your tobacco combo was an excellent choice its hard to go wrong with FLV Red Burley &amp; Cured. I have SF tested Tatanka but I have never tried to mix with it. After trying this I will mess around with it. "

The cherry actually taste like it's baked right into the cake. Very well layered and balanced. I typically don't vape tobaccos all day but I can't see myself putting this one down any time soon. Awesome job shyndo!!"

Off the shake there is a slight mustiness that's common with most tobaccos. Just give it a few days and everything blends nicely. Great job Shyndo!"

SO, on the shake, this stuff is amazing, day two this stuff is amazing. It is very tobacco upfront with cherry chocolate notes playing nicely in the back ground. It is a bit chewing tobacco forward at times, which I quite enjoy. All in all 10/10"
