  "description": "Another recipe taking layers and putting them together... This started out as a test of the Strawberry Trinity and was then turned into a lovely ice cream. Super Smooth and really smack you in the face Strawberry. This vape only lasted a few days and was gone. The Ice Cream is a pretty standard Ice Cream layer I use in a lot of recipes and backs up this berry really nicely. It is all Strawberry on the inhale, smooth thick and creamy mouth feel - followed by a hint of cream on the exhale. Already mixed up more of this and is steeping away in a dark corner. Let me know what you think ... this was my first recipe with ID10T's trinity mix ... love is an understatement.",
