  "description": "Coffee & Mango?\r\nYes i am crazy, BUT i came to this idea while i was sipping a good nespresso coffee the other day, everytime i took a sip, i got that floral smell in my nose.\r\nSo i went to my flavor stash and started opening bottles and holding them to my nose and voil√† mango and coffee tasted very good.\r\nSo i made a short experiment and now after some time, i took out the steeped result and i have to say, it tastes very good, a bit strange, but good!",
