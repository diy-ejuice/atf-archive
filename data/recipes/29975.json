  "name": "Lemon Cream Cookie",
  "description": "@Tootall has a version very similar to mine, so if you aren't a fan of FA Custard definitely try his. I worked at a B&M about a year ago and this was made for a co-worker of mine. I still make it from time to time for myself and a few others. Roughly a week steep time just to let the custard and icing meld things together and let the lemon mellow out.\r\n\r\nCookie base - FA Cookie and CAP Sugar Cookie mixed is always a winner, no explanation needed here.\r\n\r\nIcing base - FA Lemon Sicily is the main attraction here, but the mix between the LA Cream Cheese Icing, FA Meringue, and the FA Custard really make it a nice sweet and creamy frosting.",
