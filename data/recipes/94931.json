  "description": "Juicy hawaiian cocktail that just hits the spot. Looking for that refreshing exotic fruit juice ? Mix it up and try it. Good after a heavy shake but better after 3 days.\r\n\r\nInspired by LiveMixing ricipe P.O.M. by Wayne. Liked the mix alot, but i found, the slight waxy taste to much. DRAGONFRUIT made it soooo much more juicy and fresh. Plus i found the mango more in ballance here. Really a nice punch. \r\nSo BIG thanks to Wayne for another buildingblock recipe. ",
