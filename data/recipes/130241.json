  "description": "I had some butterscotch pudding a few weeks back and I was like mmmm thatâ€™s a great flavor. So I started to mess around until I found the perfect Recipe to Excite my taste buds. This stuff is so good after a 3 day steep. Mixed at 70/30. Give this a whirl you might like it. Thanks reviews are always great feedback. ",

Used CAPs Golden Butter at same percentage.   ***Update****  This is one that gets better and better with age.  Hands down the best Butterscotch recipe I've mixed to date.    NOV 13 update.  This is my #1 ADV.  It keeps getting better and better with every vape.  Its delicious, rich, savory, thick creamy mouthfeel and its converted a few of my friends who pretty much stick to fruit flavors.  Just goes to show that a great recipe like this one can get people out of their comfort zones.   This recipe is under appreciated on this site.  "
