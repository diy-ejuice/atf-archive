  "description": "This is part 2 of a 3 part recipe dump regarding the main flavor Cap Golden Pineapple.\r\nPART 1: Simple Pineapple Cheesecake https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/138490#stupid_simple_pineapple_cheesecake_pineapple_dump_1_3_by_rockyharlow\r\nPART 3: Stupid Simple Pineapple Ice Cream https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/140190#stupid_simple_pineapple_ice_cream_pineapple_dump_3_3_by_rockyharlow\r\nAnyhow, on to part 2.\r\n\r\nRunning with the theme of pineapple bakeries: I opted to work on a cookie that incorporated chunks of dried pineapple, the style you may find in many generic trail mixes. Chewy, nearly fibrous, with a flavor unique unto itself. The end result here is nearly as close as I am able to come, at least with the resources available to me at the moment.\r\n\r\nOur dried pineapple chunks are sourced from CAP Golden Pineapple at 4%. At this level we find pineapple at the top of the mix, but not so overdone that it's all we taste. Any lower and we start to lose the pineapple to the cookie base. While generally potent, I have noticed that CAP Golden Pineapple does have a way of falling out against bakeries.\r\n\r\nOur cookie base is a simple one that seems to be much more complex than it should be with only two flavors. 4% CAP Sugar Cookie is our main, soft chewy cookie note here. \r\n\r\n1% of FA Cookie adds a “snap” to the mix that emulates the crispy edge of an ever so slightly over-baked cookie. The FA Cookie really rounds the mix out and balances the texture. CAP Golden Pineapple, though its actual flavor is reminiscent of dried pineapple, is a very wet feeling flavor when used at 4%. This is beneficial in tropical recipes but not so much in a warm, fresh baked cookie mix. The FA Cookie essentially dries the wet notes up beautifully, without impacting the actual flavor of Pineapple too much.\r\n\r\nFinally, a mild splash of CAP Super Sweet at 0.5% really seals the deal on a light glaze on the finished cookie and almost adds a dusting of granulated sugar to the finished product. The addition of sweetener is totally optional of course, but I find that this is one of those times where a little coil wrecking sweetness really does benefit the whole mix.",

So i am sure if i tried it sooner the pineapple would been more forward. Great job and thanks for sharing. "
