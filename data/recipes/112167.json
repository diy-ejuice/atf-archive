            "text": "Let me start by saying this isn't a bad recipe to my tastes. It is very cream forward, and that part is done well. I love Vienna Cream in all ice creams, just gives an almost authentic flavor to me, LB is an amazing ice cream as well. The issue I had with it, the pairing of Cookie Dough, and Cream and Cookies, turned into a very coffee-esque taste to me. I love cookie dough, solo and in mixes. I feel the addition to the cream and cookies turned it into a burnt coffee for me. The mix was a great ice cream though, and in my taste, if I enjoyed coffee vapes then this would be even better, but it missed the mark to me. "
