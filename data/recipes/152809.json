    "description": "TPA-Blackberry-(0.15%)-This is a very potent flavor be careful when using it really potent i tend to stay under 1% with this one but under that percentage it gives the blueberry hint i need(my first ever mix was using this at 5% was not fun at all couldn't get the taste of blackberry out of my mouth and tank for a week) \r\n\r\nINW-Dragon-fruit-(1.50%) this is the closest thing to genuine dragon fruit on the market and it gives you the dragon fruit hints you would get from the drink\r\n\r\nLorAnn-Lemonade-(3.00%) this in my opinion is one of the best lemonades on the market give a nice mouth feel as well and is tart which the blackberry counters give the mix a nic lemonade base to work off of\r\n\r\nTPA-Strawberry Ripe-(1.00%)just a hint of this to help bring everything together and brighten up things and make everything pop\r\n\r\nCAP-Sweet Mango-(1.50%) i tend to stay under 2% with this one because it starts starting overripe at higher percentages for me at least\r\n\r\noptional sweetener & ws-23 to your liking I use one drop cap SS per 15 ml (Thats the only thing i measure in drops) (Wayne Recommends 0.5% of CAP-Fizz Pop) \r\n\r\nhope you enjoy as much as i did btw if you haven't tried this from Starbucks try it:\r\n(Venti mango dragon-fruit refresher with lemonade base add blackberry inclusions ,you will want the venti size also it has same amount of caffeine as a cup of coffee)",

It is about as close as you can get to recreating the actual drink in vape form. I added 1% WS-23 and .5% CAP SS, but I like my teas cold and sweet. For \"normal\" people, you probably don't need more than .25% sweetener, if any."
