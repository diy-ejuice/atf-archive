    "description": "a nice blend of berries and melon. normally don't do fruits but just got a bunch of new flavors to play with and need to stop vaping bakerys and creams all the time haha! \r\n\r\nINW Cactus  adds moisture and complexity.\r\n\r\nCSL Candied Watermelon perfect melon candy not too sweet and does very well with other flavors no off notes.\r\n\r\nFA Forest Fruits adds a nice berry aspect to the melon adds nuance to the profile.\r\n\r\nFA Lemon Sicily adds brightness and help bring out the berry.\r\nsweeten to taste with go to sweeter and your good to go! SNV, but best after a 2 days for flavors to develop \r\nHope anyone who mixes this enjoys it, and please leave comments about what you thought.",
