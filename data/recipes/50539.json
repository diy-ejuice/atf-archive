    "description": "A lightly caramelized Apple and Peach combo with sweet ice cream on the side.\r\nI find these 2 peaches combine to give a nice rounded flavour paired with fuji is a really nice profile. There is no caramel flavours in this as none of the ones i have seemed to fit as i didn't want a candy style, just melted sugar in butter, so i went with the butterscotch ripple as i feel this has a caramel flavour at low percentages, plus it helps with the creaminess of the vbic. Apple pie and CDS in low percentages are there just to add a light spice to the fruit. Needing a light alcohol backnote i went with 1 percent kentucky bourbon which for me is just the right amount to give it some warmth ( you may like it a little higher but for me this is perfect )\r\nNo sweetener as such, that's what the meringue is for, to give a light sugary sweetness to the fruits.\r\n\r\nAfter a 3 day steep the profile is just what i was aiming for.\r\n\r\nQuite a lot of flavours but nothing unusual.\r\n",
