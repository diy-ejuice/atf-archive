  "description": "Reminiscent? To me yes. FLV Tatanka Tobacco what can I say.....  At first I was hesitant because I had a bad experience on a tobacco vape early on in my vaping adventure.  Sad that I waited years to revisit. I cracked open this concentrate and it was instant remembrance of  my pipe and chewing tobacco (redman) days.  I paused for a minute to reminisce.  Flavorah's website states this  and sure as shit its spot on,    \"Tatanka Tobacco flavoring concentrate formulated from the ground up for vape manufacturing and creating DIY ejuice recipes. Bold and strong like an American Buffalo, Tantanka is the Native Siox word for buffalo. FLV Tatanka is a tobacco with strong caramel, sweet dough, and rich tobacco notes. Low ash, and low on the musty moisture scale, tatanka is like a fresh opened bag of redman chew. Blends well with other tobaccos, or stand alone. \" Wow this concentrate is so good to me I can vape as a stand a lone at 1.  To keep this simple and keep the greatness of this flavor,  it is accented with FW Salted Carmel and FW butter pecan.  The salted carmel adds richess  to the all ready carmel notes coupled with the butter pecan to bring out the ash.  Yummy !!! Great job Flavorah  Don't let the percentages fool you!! This is a bold full flavor vape. Enjoy!!!!",

      "text": "First time (and last) I had Redman chewing tobacco I was about 13 years old at the LA County Fair.  My buddy's dad finally entertained our request to some of his chewing tobacco.  He opened the bag with a slight grin on his face, and now I realize it was in preparation for what happens to most first time chewers.  After being told not to and trying my damnest not to, I swallowed.  Long story short I stayed away from chewing tobacco. &#xD;\nThis recipe reminds me of the wet and sweetish taste of Redman.  It sparked my memory to a day long forgotton some 20 years ago.  The butter pecan and Salted Caramel make this a great tobacco vape.  Best part thought,  Your allowed to swallow!!  Keep em coming dude!"

      "text": "Holy hell this is great for such a simple recipe. Just testing this right off the shake, you were completely right about the deceiving percentages. You did an excellent job using salted caramel and butter pecan to bolster those notes in the Tatanka. This really does taste like a bold, nutty, caramelized tobacco, right down to the chewiness aspect. It's delicious SNV, hopefully I can leave it alone long enough to see how it ages but I know this is a good mix right off the bat.&#xD;\n&#xD;\nGreat work!"
