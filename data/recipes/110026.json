  "description": "Description: Pears cooked in a sweet bourbon sauce infused with spicy fresh ginger.\r\n\r\nThe Pears: TFA and FA Pear work nicely together when you want a main pear note.\r\nThe Bourbon Sauce: TFA Kentucky Bourbon is a nice base for the bourbon sauce, but it needs some support. Enter FLV Bourbon; gives the KB a little char and carries the bourbon flavor. TFA Toasted Marshmallow adds sweetness to the bourbon sauce and works some voodoo when mixed with KB that is delicious.\r\nThe Gingers: NF and FLV Ginger work well together to keep the ginger from hiding.\r\n\r\nI've submitted this to MC in March of 2018 but we've got a brand new group. It was not a public recipe at the time because I wanted feedback before sharing it.",

      "text": "It's Coop's Kiwi Bourbon with oak, ginger, and pear instead of kiwi and I love it. Just love it. I will refrain using the recipe's name as an excuse for inappropriate comments. But still, this recipe can get in my facehole and stay there all day long. One of the things I enjoy most about this is the way that ginger + pear tastes and the way it is woven though the vape. Other notes come and go but I get the ginger pear from beginning to end at the same time, ending with a sweet, juicy ginger pear finish. I get ginger pear/booze, ginger pear/chocolate, ginger pear/thick rich vanilla-ish thing for just a second, and then that finish. Wait, chocolate? Yeah, I did an olfactory double take and checked the recipe. I get everything I'm supposed to get based on the the description here and I like it, but I also get just a whisper of chocolate. It's weird but something about the way that toasted marsh and FLV Bourbon intersects with everything else, reminds me of chocolate. I know it's not just those two together, because I've had them together and didn't taste chocolate, but there's something chocolately going on there now. The warmth, sweetness, and boozyiness reminds me of ginger-spiced cooked pears with a bourbon glaze and a decorative bit of chocolate syrup. I kind of want to add some actual chocolate flavor to it see if it will work as blatantly chocolate covered bourbon glazed ginger pears, as insanely busy as that sounds, versus the slight and errant hint of chocolate. I don't get any harshness or anything like that. It's tasty AF and smooth as a boozy vape can be.  "
