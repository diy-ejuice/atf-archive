  "description": "** DFS Holy Vanilla is DFS Vanilla Ice Cream Coffee**\r\n\r\nA creamy and light vanilla ice cream adorned by a delicate splash of fresh coffee. \r\n\r\nThis is a magical, simple little number which will make you fall in love with simplicity and effectives of solid flavours. \r\n\r\nDFS vanilla ice cream coffee is a superb flavour and been in my stash as a replacement for regular VBIC for a while now. This incredibly smooth and rich ice cream has beautiful, rich vanilla notes to which combined with a dash of coffee, is absolutely heavenly! The coffee sits pretty in the background and contains skunky notes whatsoever. The coffee is not trying to be the hero, it rather lauds the hero while being the unsung hero.\r\n\r\nAlthough the DFS Vanilla Ice Cream is a solid contender, I wanted to take this baby to the next level by boosting the creaminess with a touch of HS Ice Cream. Combined, this is a formidable duo who will kick big name brands in the gonads - and then some...\r\n\r\nThe sugar cookie adds just a bit of extra dimension in the background without being noticeable, the mystery ingredient if you wish.\r\n\r\n\r\nGive this 5 days or so for this to become your new ADV!!! \r\n\r\n ",
