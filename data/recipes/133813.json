  "description": "I was looking at Guava mixes and found @mlNikon  guava empanada mixed it up and fell in love! it is fantastic! https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/64495#guava_empanada_by_mlnikon   This  was made up for  Daytime  Franks Show Mixin in the kitchen  Bakery episode\r\n\r\nThis is my updated 2019 version of that concept. This is a fried crispy outer shell with soft dough on the inside, filled with a cream cheese and Guava paste . On the inhale you get the cream cheese notes that transitions to the fried dough with some dark pastry notes and a bight sweet tart guava finish. This is best on an RDA at around 55 - 65 watts \r\n\r\n**FLV sweet dough** is ideal to create the empanada dough inside - it does have some dark sweet notes which works in this situation.\r\n\r\n**FA joker** works perfectly for a fried crisp pastry note, and lends some authenticity here . it is noticeable on the exhale and leaves that slight fried dough after taste \r\n\r\n**INW Yes we can Cheese cake and WF Mascaropne** work to create that cream cheese feeling. I used the mascarpone here since it has a really nice tang and provides a full creamy body to the mix. yes we can cheesecake helps to add some density to the cream that is needed..     The cheese aroma  of the mascarpone does dissipate over several days  and the tang does fad a bit.   if you dont  what that strong cheese tang note then CAP cheese cake is an option here at 2% \r\n\r\n**WF Butter cream** is the light glaze frosting on top of of the pastry - that also adds a slight waxy mouth feel that you get when you eat an actual empanada. \r\n\r\n**CAP sweet Guava** has that balance of sweet tangy and works well in this application. You can also push it up without off notes and it holds up to the other heavier notes \r\n\r\n**FLV pastry zest and FLV Rich cinnamon** are used here to help guava pop and add some authentic accents . The combination of Cinnamon and guava is amazing and not something I would have thought of  combining. Thank you MlNikon for that find!! \r\n\r\n",
