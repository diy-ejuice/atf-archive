    "description": "A decadent vanilla custard crowned with caramlised sugar and aromatised with fresh, sweet blueberries.\r\n\r\nBuilding on my br\u00fbl\u00e9e infatuation, I decided to try my tried and tested brulee base with one of my favorite fruits = Blueberry.\r\nThis is a natural combo of sweet and tart which translates phenomenally well in a vape.\r\n\r\nThe Blueberry combo was not to difficult to nail but I wanted a little twist and veered away from the Holy Trinity of Blueberries and instead opted for INW Raspberry to complete my trio. The Raspberry cuts though the often monotonous notes of the Blueberry and offers a refreshing angle to this mix. \r\n\r\nLet the berries mingle for at least a week before enjoying this baby!\r\n",

            "text": "Let me start off with: This is tasty af. Like, really freaking good Your addition of Raspberry had me worried at first, but after it settled down, it plays with the blueberries so well, I love it. I will probably take this idea to switch up my berries too honestly. I love the INW custard\/brulee combo, one of my favorite combos, which is why I mixed this up. I get no off notes from Brulee being this high, where I know some will. The reason I gave it 4 stars, was more of confusion though. The title is Brulee, but in the description you called it a custard, but then you said it was using your brulee base? When making this, I personally expected a Brulee, which unfortunately I don't get a brulee, as much as I do a rich creaminess. I feel for me, the berries cover some of the notes that the brulee is supposed to give off. If this is supposed to be more of a custard, then I would say 5 stars. No matter what, this is freaking lovely and I love it. "
