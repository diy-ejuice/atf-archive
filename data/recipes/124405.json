If I had to describe it, I'd say it's like an orange, but a perfect orange. It's succulent and sweet with the absolute perfect amount of tart. Every friend I've let take a hit off my vape does a double take when they taste this, like god damn... Is this for real..? I've probably made four batches of this and each time I too do the double take when I take that first drag. Truly a masterpiece. Thank you for sharing it with us !!!"

The lime\/lemon combo is on point and yet doesnt overpower the Orange combo at all. doesnt need sweet, doesnt cry for coolant. it's lovely as is and still has room to grow. Next time I may add some grapefruit to take advantage of that lovely perfect sweetness because we can't have nice things like this."

When I need a solid fruit mix, I go to this recipe's wonderful creator and he never disappoints. Then you throw in some orange citrus with FW Blood Orange and CAP Sweet Tangerine and head to flavor town. I also like to add .5% FA Bergamot to really drive the citrus home. Not that this recipe needs it, I'm just that into citrus. "
