  "description": "Trying out some different accents for my last recipe, this is one of them I really enjoyed. Just going to go over the differences,and why I pick certain ingredients.\r\n\r\nThe first and most obvious got rid of the peach, and put in green apple. CAP  green apple hard candy, is a great green apple candy flavor, that pairs perfectly with, FLV fire cinnamon. Also added a little FA pair to accent the Apple and melon.\r\n\r\nReduced the amount of vanilla swirl in this recipe. I made 120 mil test batch of mrs. Claus dirty melon milk, and it's gone ðŸ˜‹ so obviously I really enjoyed it. That said,  I knew we should get away with reducing the vanilla swirl by a few percentage points.\r\n\r\nSincerely hope you enjoy, happy holidays!!!\r\n\r\nBonus recipe, this one was from last year, and still one of my favorites.\r\n\r\nhttps://alltheflavors.com/recipes/67091#tropical_eggnog_coquito_by_chrisdvr1",
