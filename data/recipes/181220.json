  "description": "Started with Silky's Gonzo, and substituted Blueberry Juicy Ripe for the candy flavor to add a realistic blueberry note, and substituting OOO Milky since I don't have FA Milk.\r\n\r\nI haven't stopped vaping it since I made it so I'm posting it for others to enjoy.  Credit to Silky for most of this.\r\n\r\nGood as an SnV but the mouthfeel is noticeably \"denser\" after a day's steep, almost like a blueberry donut.  Haven't been able to let it sit for longer than that so YMMV with longer steep times!",
