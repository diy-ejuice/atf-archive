  "description": "This recipe is still in the developmental stages, but tastes pretty damn good at this point so I thought I would share.  My favorite treat as a child was a butterscotch milkshake from a little mom and pop ice cream shop.  This is my attempt at recreating that experience and is coming along nicely. This is a very rich, heavy mouth feel type vape, the same thing you would experience with a nice thick milkshake, I think I have the milkshake base down pretty well, now perfecting the butterscotch is my mission. I have found FW butterscotch ripple to be the closest tasting butterscotch to what I had tasted in the milkshake, so I am working on deepening the butterscotch flavor. It's pretty good as a shake and vape, but the butterscotch will start to come out more after a couple days of steeping. Any input is welcome, let me know what you think. I will update any revisions I make in the comments section. ",
