The texture in this is amazing, from the almost grittiness of the sugar and cinnamon to the yeasty deliciousness of the donut. I like that there wasn't an actual cinnamon flavor in this because the zeppola and the deep fried tasty dough take you there, without overdoing it. One of my favorite recipes now, thank you so much !"

But even I don't get any cinnamon from this recipe. Adding 0.25 – 0.5% CAP Cinnamon Danish Swirl puts it right in \"lightly cinnamon donut\" territory for me."
