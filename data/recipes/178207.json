  "description": "During   the holidays   starbuks has a cranberry bliss bar that I just love.     it is a  sweet soft thick cookie base with sweet candid  cranberries  and  chalky white chocolate chips  cover in the thick sweet vanilla cream cheese icing; i it is VERY VERY sweet.   - this is my take on it  \r\n\r\nOn the inhale  you get the creamy vanilla icing  top notes that transitions to the cranberry  and finishes with a full buttery bakery  and touch of  tartness. This was tested on a reload RDA at 65 watts in a .14 ohm alien coil  `\r\n\r\nThe  bakery  bar base is   more of   soft  thick cookie then a  a cake - so the combination of  yellow cake, sugar cookie and cookie butter    do the trick  along with the light bakery note from the cobbler \r\nVanilla custard  cheese cake when combined with VT  sweet cream   gives me a   vanilla cream cheese  icing \r\nThis bar  has chunks of white chocolate in it   which     is hard to get to stand out as a noticeable note   in this mix  but it is there on the top \r\nNOTE if you want more of a  bright cranberry note feel free to use  FLV cranberry instead of sweet current   but the  the sweet currant adds a nice tart note that I wanted along with that sweetness to add to the candy aspect of  cranberry from cobbler ",
