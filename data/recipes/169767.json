    "description": "In my list of quick flavor profiles that I'm often asked for pods\/MTL vapes, pineapple is the most recent one. I decided to go for a pineapple juice, but I really wanted a sweet, strong and fleshy fruit.\r\n\r\nWF Pineapple Candy\/VT Sugar Loaf Pineapple\/CAP Golden Pineapple = the pineapple. WF pineapple candy comes off strong, but it settles down after a couple of days and it's sweet. Sugar Loaf has good mouthfeel and middle body qualities and Golden Pineapple is good for juices yet loyal to the fruit.\r\n\r\nCAP Lemon Lime\/WF African Horned Cucumber = the African horned cucumber is the juice in this recipe. It acts a bit like TPA Dragon Fruit if you will. Lemon Lime is a great trick to make your tropical fruits pop, and pineapple is no exception.\r\n\r\nIt'll work in 50VG\/50PG for a pod\/MTL vape and at 70VG\/30PG for sub-ohm tanks and RTA\/RDAs.\r\n\r\nMany thanks to @MECHMODRN ( https:\/\/alltheflavors.com\/users\/MECH_MOD_RN ) who is, as always, a great sounding board and support.\r\n\r\nEnjoy, be queer and vape on!\r\n\r\n[Photo credits: www.webstaurantstore.com]",
