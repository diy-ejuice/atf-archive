    "description": "my recipe was Mixed live on the DMC youtube podcast yesterday, and Noonas Cake was found to have a strong Anise flavoring on the exhale ,which is not what i was wanting , heck i tasted the anise just didn't know what it was, but i actually enjoyed  the Mix ..after collaborating with the crew on what needed to change we came up with the above changes ,which we feel will really set this cake up and give it the Authenticity it deserves... Thanks to Tam,Luadr,Shake and Folk for their input on this ...\r\n\r\nHeres is what i was Envisioning. \r\nA caramelized outer layer much like a Blonde Brownie, with a chewy custardy middle layer and a pie cake like bottom layer with a Sweet buttery creaminess across the entire recipe ...well i hope everyone enjoys this recipe and shout outs to all ..peace\r\n\r\nVisit DIY MIXERS CREW on Discord https:\/\/discord.gg\/kUJGkHt\r\nVisit DIY MIXERS CREW on FaceBook https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/groups\/456512471380574\/\r\nWatch DIY MIXERS CREW LIVE on YouTube every Sunday at 4:30 pm EST https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/channel\/UC1ENB0bSNrG_1KETYwZ154g\r\nPlease comment, mix, and or rate,....it makes us all better mixers.",
