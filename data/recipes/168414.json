  "description": "I was watching the great british baking show and one of the contestants made an Indian barfi. The main ingredients of plain barfis include condensed milk and sugar A few of the famous varieties of barfi include besan barfi (made with gram flour), kaaju barfi (made with cashews), pista barfi (made with ground pistachios), and sing barfi (made with peanuts). \r\nThe ingredients are cooked in a vessel until the mixture solidifies.\r\n\r\nBased on this desert I came up the combination of rose and pistachio, which is fairly popular pairing.\r\n On the inhale you get a sweet milky creamy coconut note that transitions to a nutty light rose finish . It is unique and really lovely.  tested on a reload RDA at  65 watts on a .16 alien coil \r\n\r\nThe combination of oak milk and condensed milk is just lovley.  Iit is full creamy sweet and slightly nutty and almost woody.\r\nPistachio note is there at the middle and exhale and is made more noticeable by the oak note of the oak milk\r\nThe coconut and Thai rice seem to fill in the middle nicely here and just adds some wonder full fullness and body to the profile with out distracting form the pistachio and rose profile to much\r\n\r\nThis is fairly sweet on its own so does not really need sweetner - although touch of cap super sweet seem to get the rose to sit a bit more on top",
