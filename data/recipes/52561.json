    "description": "I called this one Churros? because I can't remember what a real churro tastes like.  So maybe this does, maybe it doesn't.  The original recipe seemed to think it did.\r\n\r\nOrig Recipe - http:\/\/e-liquid-recipes.com\/recipe\/1226583\/Secret%20Strawberry%20Churrio%20%28The%20best%29\r\n\r\nAdded TFA Strawberry Ripe instead of CAP Sweet Strawberry\r\nAdded a couple % of TFA Sweetener\r\nRemoved TFA Meringue - It's pretty rough on my throat even at low %s.\r\n\r\nI may still test removing the TFA Acetyl Pyrazine too.  I haven't mixed it too much and honestly, since I usually only make 10-15ml at a time, I don't like having to futz with such small %s.  If it doesn't make too much or any difference to me I'll remove it from here.\r\n\r\nListed it at a 7 day steep even though the original says SnV\/3 as it was better to me after having more time to sit.",
