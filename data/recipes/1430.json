I personally have a hard time chain vaping strong fruit flavors, so I wanted to mention here that if I were making this again, I would probably drop the Blood Orange/Orange Cream/Tangerine percentages down a little.  That is a personal preference thing only, though, because this recipe tastes like the real deal. "
