  "description": "You got Banana ice cream and you got Oreo cream ice cream , NOT oreo ice cream but the cream of the oreo . I got this idea when i went to five guys over the weekend and i wanted to create it in a vape. Now if you go to give guys ask for a half oreo “cream” and half banana milkshake and this is what it will taste like . It’s just amazing . It’s a fat kids dream . I give you Oreo banana cream milkshake !  I got some of these percentages (well most) from “Lumi likes it thick” on all the flavors . Enjoy. ",
