  "description": "*FLV Prison Wine finally found its partners in crime.*\r\n\r\nI love FLV Morning Mimosa, even though it really does taste like pretty much like prison wine. Or maybe because it tastes like prison wine. Brings back memories of my more miscreant youth. \r\n\r\nVape Train has created a ridiculous concentrate in Blood Orange Champagne. It's a remarkably accurate champagne flavor that tastes like it has blood orange flavoring added to it, rather than actual orange juice or blood orange juice. Which means it’s kind of weird, but it’s not unpleasant. It’s sweet and bubbly (which is pretty freakin cool) and actually tastes like champagne more than the other champagne/sparkling wine flavors I've tried. Specifically it's a light and sugary champagne like Spumante rather than Brut or Dry. It's definitely not as boozy as it should be, nobody is getting tipsy at this brunch, but it's fizzy enough for a change. I wish that champagne flavor was sold separately, because why would you add blood orange flavor to that? I don’t know, it’s mind-boggling. It’s specifically blood orange, but it tastes like the same blood orange flavor you get from store brand blood orange flavored zero calorie sparkling water, and not like the San Pellegrino Blood Orange sparkling juice beverage that has real juice and yummy sugary calories.  \r\n\r\nWF Orange Juice has its own issues. Here's a flavor that pretty much actually tastes and feels like OJ, which is apparently quite a feat for oranges. And then they go and add sucralose to it. Unless you like put splenda packets in your OJ, this is a problem. So much sucralose that it doesn't work by itself as an OJ, it gets offensive before you can use enough to really fill out an orange-forward profile like a mimosa. But just a little bit of it here at 2% helps the fermented orange in Morning Mimosa make up for the silly blood orange flavor in that VT concentrate. Sweetener level seems about like adding 0.25% CAP Super Sweet to your recipe. Detectable, but not obscene by any stretch. \r\n\r\nFLV Morning Mimosa's orange zest notes mingle with and nearly overpower that blood orange flavoring, which WF isn't zesty enough to do alone. Down at this 1% the baser orange juice doesn't get too fermented when mixed with a brighter orange, so it doesn't bring it into jailhouse hooch territory. Meanwhile, its somewhat funky but otherwise accurate champagne flavor gives VT's some more boozy character that it needs, but doesn't weigh down its superior effervescence.   \r\n\r\nIf you're in the \"cold things should be cold\" camp, add some of your favorite cooling agent to this at your preferred strength. 0.5% WS-23 (30% Dilution) works for me.
