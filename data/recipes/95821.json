  "description": "Total flavoring 17.50%. Steep 2 weeks. It begins to come together after 4 days. After that magic happens and is complete at two weeks, and holds it flavor for at least 10 weeks. That is as long as a bottle has lasted so far, before being emptied.\r\nChocolate\r\n\r\nWhy just chocolate as a name for a recipe that is obviously intended to be a Nutella attempt? Well, it just didn't get close enough to claim the name. What is does do though is present to you a chocolate vape that does not blind your taste buds after three hits or thirty hits. For some reason the other ingredients help hold the flavor intact for each hit. I suspect that the FLV Milk Chocolate is largely responsible for that.\r\nIngredients:\r\n\r\nTFA Double Chocolate (Clear) is a very tasty chocolate for the first few hits, then your tongue gives up. I first noticed this in early 2015 in a Butterfinger recipe I found in a ECF thread. The same thing happened with other chocolates I tried. I gave up, rightly figuring that I just don't know enough about mixing. Then, a year ago while reading this forum I found a lot of excited discussion about a couple of Flavorah chocolates; Milk Chocolate and Chocolate Deutsch. I picked up a bottle of each and that changed everything. I chose Milk Chocolate over Chocolate Deutsch simply because I don't like Chocolate Deutsch. It tastes harsh and peppery to me, which is probably just me.\r\n\r\nFlavorah Cream. At the same time I purchased the FLV chocolates I purchased FLV Cream. I have always been a proponent for FA Fresh Cream, and I still am for it's immediate cream flavor that requires little to no steep time. I began switching out Fresh Cream for FLV Cream in some recipes just to see what would happen, and have found that it, after a week or so, delivers a full bodied cream with a richness that FA Fresh Cream lacks.\r\n\r\nFW Hazelnut. This again is a personal choice between FW and TFA Hazelnut. I tried both and found that the TFA variety is harsh and peppery. I see a pattern here and am sure it is my problem and not TFA's\r\n\r\nTFA Vanillin. I read the label on Nutella and right there under ingredients it says \"Vanillin, an artificial flavor.\" Good enough for me.\r\n\r\nTFA White Chocolate. I felt the recipe needed a bit of smoothing out, and this is what I used. It seems to have worked.\r\n\r\nTFA Cotton Candy and CAP Supersweet. Both Chocolate and Nutella are very sweet and I used these two to achieve that.",
