  "description": "Imagine, a rich rum flavoured vanilla ice cream with raisins scooped on a freshly baked Belgian waffle.\r\nBuilding blocks:\r\nIt must be my 26ste version, never got it right but here it is, a real treat.\r\n\r\nFLV Raisin Rum aroma, used as a base for this delight. the raisins are rich and sugary. and the spicy rum tones are just about right and gives the vanilla ice cream that caribbean sense of joy. I added RF SC Coconut Spiced Rum to support the FLV Raisin Rum it needed for this recipe..\r\n\r\nFW Butter Rum adds that rich buttery feeling and taste to the mix\r\n\r\nLB Belgian Waffle is by far the best i used till today, yet i felt it needed some support from FA Maple Syrup. It gives the waffle a smooth buttery taste and the maple goes nice along and give that extra 'spicy and sugary and nutty mouthfeel to the waffle.\r\nFA Maple  used 1 drop per 10 ml!\r\n\r\nRF SC  Vanilla ice Cream and TFA VBIC are paired, together they really shine as a rich and thick creamy ice cream. \r\n\r\nRF Butter Toffee – SC added 1.25% a syrupy and sticky cover on top of the waffle.... it's the finishing touch and rounds of this superb summer ice cream mix.\r\n\r\nOptional:\r\nfor a sweet tooths like me.\r\nCAP Supersweet (1 drop per 15 ml) because this recipes screams for calories :D\r\n\r\nGood after 4 day's, better around 7 days mark.\r\n\r\nShare and rate this if you like it.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
