  "description": "\\\\\\Steep Time: 14 days\r\n\\\\\\Mixed at: 70VG/30PG\r\n\\\\\\Note: This uses CAP Vanilla Custard V1\r\n\r\nThis is my Boysenberry Parfait, now I know these are usually yogurt, but parfaits are known for using custard as well. I guess I have really been on a custard kick lately, with Mighty Beard being my last recipe release, but I think you all will really enjoy this one!\r\n\r\nFruity Fruit McFruitFace: I actually did try other fruits with this, but I knew they were all fruits that everybody used already and a lot of people have parfait recipes out there. So I figured I wanted to try something a little more original, which is how I arrived at Boysenberry. FLV Boysenberry at 1% is a more tart boysenberry and when combined with PUR Boysenberry preserves, helps create a sweet and jammy boysenberry with just a little bit of tartness.\r\n\r\nDem Creams: CAP Vanilla Custard V1 really helps with a nice dense creaminess that we are going for in a Custard parfait. When paired with FLV Cream, it helps smooth out the eggy notes a little bit and helps support Cap Custard V1 as well. \r\n\r\nDem Grains: I had been trying to figure out a recipe for FLV Granola since u/ConcreteRiver put a review up for it about 6 months ago, and it really works great here. By itself it is a bit dry and bitter, but it has a great granola flavor. Combined with a little bit of TPA Cheesecake Graham Crust it helps create a sweeter granola flavor. This is also why CAP VC v1 is so high, FLV Granola really fights against other creams. I realize that 0.66% is a weird % to use, but at 0.5% you can't taste it at all and at 0.75% it overwhelms the rest of the recipe. It's simply perfect where it's at. \r\n\r\nThe Holiest of Holys: Holy Vanilla is really just a great addition. It helps sweeten up FLV Granola and helps support the creams as well. \r\n\r\nThe best part about this recipe? You can easily sub the boysenberries for a lot of other fruits. I would probably avoid strong citrus flavors, but things like strawberry, blueberry, cranberry, and maybe even apple cinnamon would make great replacements. \r\n\r\nAnyway I hope you enjoy this! I look forward to your reviews and constructive criticisms.",
