  "description": "Since everybody seems to be obsessed, with fake rubber penises, I thought I'd  help you guys out with some lubricant.ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚\r\n \r\nSo all kidding aside this a classic fruit combination. Strawberry, apple, and watermelon, all play well together. It's been a blast, to see all the different variations of this recipe. And although I'm late to the game I thought I would try my hand at it.\r\n\r\nLA  lemonade along with JF juicy lemon combined to give for my lemonade base. \r\n\r\nLA lemonade-  hands-down the best lemonade flavoring I have found to date. \r\n\r\nJF juicy lemon- is a great accent for the lemon-aid, while providing a boost to the lemon, it also added a candy lemon flavor to the mix\r\n\r\nLA watermelon, FA stark apple, and TFA strawberry ripe where my choice for the fake rubber penis part of this recipe.ðŸ¤¤ðŸ¤¤ðŸ¤¤\r\n\r\n  LA watermelon- I chose because it's the only watermelon flavoring I have.ðŸ˜ŽðŸ˜ŽðŸ˜Ž Lorena's watermelon a great watermelon flavor and I've never had a need to buy another.\r\n\r\nFlavour art stark Apple- I feel that this is an underused apple flavoring. Delicious with a slightly sharp note, it really works well in this recipe. But I have toyed around with other Apple flavorings, and Fuji works if you don't have it.\r\n\r\nTFA strawberry ripe- so I chose Strawberry ripe for a few reasons. first it's delicious works well in this recipe, and ethyl maltol in the flavoring really helps soften the watermelon and lemonade.\r\n\r\n",

Like having a fancy bunch and only having Countrytime lemonade to serve your nonalcoholic guests, which just wouldn't do, and then having genius idea dig round in the crisper for fruits and float some diced red delicious apple, watermelon balls, ripe strawberries, and a few slices of real lemon in there... and having the result wow everyone and leave them asking for your secret recipe. Thanks for finding a great use for that Stark Apple!"
