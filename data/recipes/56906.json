  "description": "A sweet strawberry lemonade. I used the same ratio of strawberries as SkiddlzNinja's God Milk recipe. Made for my wife, she prefers the lemon to sit behind the strawberries. Will update as it steeps, but very good right after mixing.  \r\n*update...removed some ingredients after testing. Had too much going on and it took away from the profile. Also too sweet so I removed all extra sweeteners.",

I was never in to cooling before this but I went through 30ml in a day or two so this is now one of my favourite recipes. Rating this at 5 but I think the koolada is essential. "
