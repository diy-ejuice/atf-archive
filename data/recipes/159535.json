  "description": "A POD variation of my recipe, Leopards Blööd. I didnt know how this would taste in my breeze 2, but I am very happy with it. I can taste all of the elements that were incorporated. I haven’t given it time to steep yet, but I am sure it will improve with time. Great as a SNV IMO. ",

Just a very solid recipe!!&#xD;\n6 months later, still my ADV. Tried messing around with it but just keep making it worse. Leave well enough alone I guess.&#xD;\nAnd, another 6 months passes by.
