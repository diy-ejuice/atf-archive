I can taste all of the elements that were incorporated. I haven\u2019t given it time to steep yet, but I am sure it will improve with time. Great as a SNV IMO. ",

Just a very solid recipe!!&#xD;\n6 months later, still my ADV. Tried messing around with it but just keep making it worse. Leave well enough alone I guess.&#xD;\nAnd, another 6 months passes by. Still my all day vape!!"
