  "description": "I have been wanting to try the Stixx Mixx coffee line.  As I have not found a coffee flv that really checked all the boxes for me.    Some  have a really bad after note of plastic or burnt rubber  or they hare really a choclate that give you the impression of a a coffee \r\nThis is a simple elegant mix  after doing some single flavor testing and MAN OH MAN   I am in my coffee heaven . \r\nItalian roast and chock-full of nuts -  the combination of these too give me the BOLD coffee  that I am after with some of the subtle nut and chocolate notes I wanted \r\n\r\n WF  hazel nut adds some  nuttiness and sweet  cream to  pull out the nutty back not from the  coffee.  \r\n\r\nThe FLV milk and honey was added  for some body,  and volume  but it also has  some chocolate/ coffee notes that I can pick out at higher percentages so I thought that would  compliment the profile I wanted here \r\n\r\nI have to say I am really happy with these  stixx mixx coffee flavors  -  I really cant wait to  try some of the teas and make up some more  simple elegant mixes ",
