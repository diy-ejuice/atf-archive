    "description": "*aka Pretend Prickly Pear*\r\n\r\nI hadn't used CAP Cantaloupe, TPA Honeydew or TPA Marshmallow  since my first flavor order, wanted something nice and fruity, a farewell to summer on these lingering warm October days. Ironically, I enjoy melon vapes more than the actual fruits, at least these two, though I do love me some watermelon. \r\n\r\nI've never had the privilege of enjoying any prickly pear fruit, however, based on the descriptions and not being able to call it a fruit I've had, I settled on naming it Morty's Mega Melon Meltdown, aka Pretend Prickly Pear, because \"A melon-esque gum vibe\" just didn't have that same ring to it. \r\n\r\nCantaloupe is the main note here, blending with honeydew nicely, and the cactus adds a whole extra juiciness and intriguing fruit note. Banana Cream is here for a nice, creamy, tropical supporting note for the melons, Blueberry I honestly threw in initially for the hell of it, I figured it'd sweeten it a bit and blend right in and it definitely does. Marshmallow adds a lovely texture, nice and fluffy, and it's this fluff coupled with the juiciness of the cactus that gives me what I'll call a \"natural bubblegum\" mouthfeel.\r\n\r\nIt's great as a SnV, but I think a few days are required for everything to coalesce and for the fullness of the vape to really come through. \r\n\r\nFeel free to add a touch of E.M. or Sweetener to your preference!\r\n\r\nAs always, any suggestions, tips, ideas, reviews, criticisms, etc are most welcome! The more feedback, the tastier the vapor!\r\n\r\n**If you enjoy this mix, split some off and try adding 1% of CAP menthol for a surprisingly refreshing experience!**",
