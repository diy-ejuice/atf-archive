  "description": "This recipe does NOT contain strawberry! This is a ginger bread blondie with maple, or a ginger blondie, hence the name!\r\n\r\nWhen I was a guest on Mixin Vixens the profile was a maple nut blondie. I mixed one up. It was pretty tasty. But Emily suggested the brilliant idea of doing a ginger blondie since I am coocoo for ginger! So, challenge accepted! V1 was good enough to share and post.\r\n\r\nCAP Gingerbread: The perfect starting point for a ginger-based bakery. It's sweet and spicy and fits in the profile perfectly.\r\nFLV Ginger Snap: Continues to build on the ginger and provides some dark molasses notes to complement the maple.\r\nTFA Butter and Brown Sugar Extra: These are the components of a blondie that replace the chocolate and turns a brownie into a blondie.\r\nFA Cookie/JF Yellow Cake/CAP Cake Batter: Together these make up the base of the blondie. Like a brownie, a blondie is a little bit cake and a little bit cookie. When I want to add a hint of gooey-ness to a bakery I like to add a bit of cake batter to the mix. These 3 flavors work nicely together to provide a solid blondie base. Without them it would just be a ginger snap type vape.\r\nFA Maple Syrup: This is our maple flavor. It works perfectly. It's delicious and provides sweetness and depth. Plus the room note is wonderful. Expect compliments on how good your vape smells!\r\nTFA Bavarian Cream: This blends it all together, keeps it from being too dry, and supports the maple a bit.\r\n\r\nI get just a touch of cinnamon with this as is. It is quite good and works well in the profile. However, for me personally, as always, I want MORE GINGER! I feel like that bit of cinnamon is trying to compete with my ginger. I plan to make 2 more versions of this; one with 0.5% FLV Ginger and one with 0.5% HS Ginger. I will update later with the one I like best with it added as an optional flavor.\r\n\r\nAs for steeping: It's good the next day. But FA Maple tends to build with time. It shows up nice and strong around day 5. But it's still a bit on the dry side. By day 10 or 11 the dryness is gone. So if you want this to be at its best, give it a good ten days in a dark place and you won't be disappointed!\r\n",
