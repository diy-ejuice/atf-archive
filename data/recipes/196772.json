    "description": "this is an attempt to clone one of my favorite vapes that got it all started for me, Strawberry Kiwi lemonade mix. very good summer time vape. \r\n\r\nShisha strawberry is a clear cut winner here. its bright and one of my favorite strawberry flavors. \r\n\r\nFW Kiwi & TFA Kiwi Have both kiwi's so I figured I would throw both of them in to support one another.  FW kiwi is a bit more authentic and works well here. \r\n\r\nGreek yogurt adds that tart ness to this and brings it all together. \r\n\r\nMix it, vape and fall in love with it. \r\n\r\nSweetener is option but definitely not needed here. \r\n\r\nThis is SNV, MTL and RDA certified. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
