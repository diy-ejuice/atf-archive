    "description": "A thick, rich coconut custard with a boozy bourbon edge.\r\n\r\nI used to hate coconut, but after I started vaping it I've become a bit obsessed! I've made a lot of coconutty recipes and I think has to be one of my favourites. Bourbon and coconut is such a delicious combination. I'd put bourbon and\/or coconut in everything if I could! \r\n\r\nCustard: with this being an all FLV mix the obvious choice was Vanilla Pudding. Cream adds creaminess and mouthfeel. A little Coconut adds a ton of richness. White Chocolate works really well in this mix. It seems to be acting as a kind of bridge between the coconut and custard. I tried consolidating the number of flavours in the custard layer, but it just wasn't as good. \r\n\r\nFLV Bourbon has a nice touch of booziness and darkens the whole mix. It works really nicely with Sweet Coconut. \r\n\r\nBest after 14 days. \r\n\r\nTested on Hadaly, 0.6 ohms",
