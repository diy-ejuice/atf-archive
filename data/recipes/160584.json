    "description": "Juicy and refreshing mix of quince and peach, great for a hot summer day. This duo creates a magical synergy. Juicy Peach by Capella is little bit of a underdog in the peach flavour realm. I prefer it over the others for the syrup like properties (the second one is the JF Honey Peach, different, but amazing). Think a peach ice tea without the tea. Quince give this mix another dimension. Double Apple is here to add more juiciness. Little bit of Dragonfruit for the bleeding.\r\n\r\nIt is a SnV, but give it at least 3 days for the peach and quince to calm down and blend. \r\n\r\nAdd sweetener or cooling agent of your choice and preference, SS by Cap works the best for me around 0.15% (1 drop\/10 ml). I do not like cooling.\r\n\r\nTested on NarCA RDA, 42W, 0.3 Ohm, Framed Staple Ni80.\r\n\r\n",
