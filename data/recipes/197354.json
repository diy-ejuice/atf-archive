  "description": "Welcome to Canada! Right over here is our favorite pub, the Woozy Moose. Hockey is on 24/7, except on Boxing Day. They only serve Labatt beer, but they've got 35 different flavors of maple syrup on tap. And over here is the Silky Beaver, the neighbourhood Canadian ballet, or as you folks might call it, the strip club. It's all above board, the ladies who work there make a decent wage and get free healthcare just like everyone else, but feel free to toss them a toonie or loonie for a job well done! And then, everything else is just ice: icicles, snow, and a big frozen lake. Throw on your best flannel, light up your legal cannabis, and mix this ode to the maple leaf, the proud and majestic moose, the Royal Canadian Mounted police, a bunch of hosers going ice fishing, hot tubs filled with sticky hairy men, and polite, apologetic sex. \r\n\r\nTLDR: Made a Strap-On (**Str**awberry-**Ap**ple-Watermel**on**) out of Canada-based Wonder Flavours for all you hat people and it is delicious lung candy. Sorry. \r\n\r\nI didn't bother trying this with the WF Strawberry Gummy Candy or WF Baked Strawberry.  I was afraid the Gummy one would be weird with Thai Apple and the baked one would be weird with the Sour Watermelon Candy. The Juicy Strawberry, I thought, would fit with them both, and it tastes like I thought right this time. This is only V2 - the first one had a little too much watermelon at 4%, but at 3% is better balanced and still plenty of flavor. This does not need sucralose. I could be wrong, but I'm pretty sure the Sour Watermelon Candy already has some in it, and regardless, the recipe is candy sweet without it. Kinda tastes like a Capri Sun that doesn't exist, but should. ",
