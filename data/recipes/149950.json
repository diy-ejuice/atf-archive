  "description": "On a trip to the beach years ago we stopped at a small bakery that had a coconut and nut cookie with bright lime and mint flavor. It was the perfect summertime treat. It is a popular cookie in Mexico called Piloncillo Cocada, but it will always remind me of those days playing in the sand on Galveston Island.\r\n\r\nThe Almond Cookie SC and Coconut Candy form the base of the cookie. \r\nThe Persian Lime and Double Mint leave a refreshing aftertaste, but are not overwhelming.\r\n\r\nTesting: 60/40 mix, OBS Nano, 0.32 ohm ss316, 45 Watt",
