  "description": "I added all the fruit flavors at 2% thinking I could adjust one another up if need be but wow right off rip they were where I wanted them.  Originally it was good but I wanted to cream it up.  So they were kind of milky like cereal would be.  Guys and Gals this is seriously amazing.  I really think I've got ahold of a winner here.  If you like cereals than this is your vape.  Good luck and vape on.  P.S If you don't like sweetener leave it out but kapn krunch berries is very sweet.  So sweeten to taste.  Best after seven days but honestly good on the shake.",
