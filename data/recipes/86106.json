  "description": "Simple Italian Pear Custard Crostata\r\n\r\nINW Biscuit & FA Cookie = a buttery shortbread-style cookie crumble base\r\n\r\nFA Custard Premium:  if you have not yet tried this flavoring, it is a classic Italian crema pasticcera flavor without the heavy citrus notes of their regular custard and it is delicious! I somehow messed up and had this at 3.5... but it should be 2.5.\r\n\r\nINW Shisha Vanilla:  originally with FA Vanilla Classic, I like it better with INW's fare.\r\n\r\nINW Pear & FA Pear = FA's Pear is here to sweeten the recipe and after some steeping bring more creaminess to the mix...it also tames the much brighter INW Pear down a notch...the combo is very effective.\r\n\r\nOptional:  as always sweetener is subjective and at higher VG, I normally avoid using it.\r\n\r\nSteep this 5-7 days to allow the sharp INW Pear to settle into the mix.",
