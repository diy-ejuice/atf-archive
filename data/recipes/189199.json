  "description": "This e-liquid was a thing for me time ago and since then i tried to make a remix as close as possible but playing with coffee concentrates makes you hate mixing.\r\nNow i think i got close enough to share it.\r\n\r\nSalted Caramel Machiatto has a top heavy caramel/ Butterscotch note, bright and dark at the same time followed by a butter milky note and a lot of sweetener.. A LOT!! with a subtle coffee note lingering through the vape.\r\n\r\nI have been trying a lot of coffee concentrates to find the exact one and finally realised that VTA Hard Crack Toffee is the coffee note in this e-juice and is not an actual coffee concentrate( this shit happens so much).\r\n\r\nCoffee is barely noticeable in the original and so in this mix,\r\nadd 0.25% at a time to reach your own sweet spot. I personally like it more at 2-2.25% but trying to get close to the original 1.75% is enough.\r\n\r\nThey call for salted caramel but i get a Butterscotch sour tangyness with some bright Salted Caramel so thats what i did. I think the caramel note is better here than in the original while being a bit thicker and richer( not a bad thing though).\r\n\r\nFor the Milky Buttery Cream part im pretty sure its just  VTA Coffee Milk Froth as its pretty subtle but noticeable and this flavour, with just a touch of it , delivers a nice rich butter creamy feeling.\r\n\r\nThe sweetness in this juice is nearly offensive for me now.. but back in the day i vaped just commercial juice and didn't think it was that high. \r\n\r\n0.75% super sweet it quite spot on for my mix but i think 1% or even higher is used in the original helping that bitter/sour note i get that comes from super sweet.\r\nSo adjust to taste but 0.75%-1% is where you get closer to the original.\r\n\r\nAdditional notes:\r\n\r\nYou can SNV as nothing needs to steep out or feels harsh or rough. I think its pretty tasty but after a week it gets better.\r\n\r\nI may tweak some % as steeps a bit more so keep in mind this is not a 100% finished recipe.",
