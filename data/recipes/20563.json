I used Flavor West, but you can use whatever brand you have on hand. I wanted a true apple flavor, and this one hits the spot. Tastes like a mix of apple jolly rancher (minus the sour) and a sweet fresh apple. The pear is very subtle, used more to smooth out the flavor. I've heard nothing but enthusiastic responses from my friends who have tried it.\r\nI've only made two batches of the recipe below @ 40/60 PG/VG, but I'm doing a batch of the original sweetener-less version and another with less flavoring (keeping the sweetener @0.5%\r\n\r\nSteeping: 1-2 hours  in crockpot on warm (glass bottle with cap), let cool with cap off, shake and vape.
