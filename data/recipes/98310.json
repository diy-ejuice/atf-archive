  "name": "Melon Horchata",
  "description": "Liquor portion inspired by https://alltheflavors.com/users/Juicefairy and her delicious Tipsy Coconut (It's great!), but I bumped up the \"call an Uber\" factor a smidge to make sure the creams don't drown that aspect out.\r\nFA Cinnamon Ceylon for good measure.\r\nFLV Wild Melon and FLV Cantaloupe make up the melon profile.  FLV Wild Melon is great, but I've not used FLV Cantaloupe before...no time like the present.\r\nBavarian Cream, Cream and Vanilla Swirl complete the recipe with a thick and rich milk base to tone down any sharpness found in the liquors and tie the whole recipe together.\r\n\r\nThis recipe was originally called Red Hot Melon Horchata and I used FLV Red Cinnamon which is a fireball/red hot candy type flavor.  I thought it would be a good twist but even at 3 drops per 30ml it took over the entire recipe.  I was forced to go with a safer FA Cinnamon Ceylon.\r\n\r\nThis was created for the #theyearofmixing weekly challenge.  https://www.facebook.com/groups/flavorpro/ http://flavor-pro.com/the-year-of-mixing/",
