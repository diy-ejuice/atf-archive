    "description": "Is it fried ice cream? Is it a snicker doodle cookie? Is it cinnamon toast crunch? I don't know\r\nIs it delicious? YES\r\n\r\n**\\\\\\Steep Time: 10-14 Days**\r\n**\\\\\\Mixed at: 70vg\/30pg**\r\n\r\nUpdate: Don't feel like toying with getting the Rich Cinnamon right? CAP Cinnamon Danish Swirl v1 at 1% is a perfect substitute.\r\n\r\nMy original goal was to try and make a Mexican fried ice cream; Which is a big ball of ice cream, covered in corn cereal, flash fried, sprinkled with cinnamon sugar, and then immediately put in a freezer. When served they add a light drizzle of sugar syrup.   \r\n\r\nAfter many iterations I came to this, but this is a strong independent recipe, and it don't need no locked down flavor profile. I'll go over my flavor notes anyway\r\n\r\n**Ice Cream Base:**  This really all started after **[eyemakepizza's ice cream base came out](https:\/\/old.reddit.com\/r\/DIY_eJuice\/comments\/b3fefh\/its_trinity_time_the_perfect_vanilla_ice_cream\/)**. I really wanted to make a fried ice cream, and I loved the hell out of this base. It's creamy, buttery, and has vanilla, what's not to like? When used with the other flavors in this recipe it can easily be misinterpreted as the buttery notes of a sugar cookie.\r\n\r\n**Fried Cereal\/Cookie Thing:** Depending on the restaurant , you can still taste a bit of the fried notes on fried ice cream, and to get that flavor I started with CAP Funnel Cake and Cereal 27, though at higher %'s Funnel Cake can be gross, soggy, and overpowering, at low %'s it is nice when you are wanting to add a slight friend note to a recipe. CAP Cereal 27 was to get the corn crunch that is usually on a fried ice cream, which when combined with CAP Funnel cake makes this interestingly crunchy but also soft texture at the same time. Which makes me unable to decide if it's a cereal, cookie, or fried ice cream\r\n\r\n**The Drizzle:** The fried ice creams I've had usually have a touch of cinnamon sugar on them with a light drizzle of a sugar syrup, which is where VT Golden Syrup and FLV Rich Cinnamon come into play. This is where it really makes it taste like a snicker doodle cookie, or a cinnamon toast crunch\r\n\r\nDepending on your palette and frame of mind this really could be a fried ice cream, a warm buttery snicker doodle cookie, or from the cereal notes a cinnamon toast crunch that happens to have some melted ice cream in there. So what do you think you'll taste from this recipe? Give it a mix and try it out!\r\n\r\nBe sure to leave a review if you like it!",
