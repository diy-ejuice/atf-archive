  "description": "Tony's future was bright. Spending years perfecting his talent and product, He had climbed the ladder of the cereal kingdom.\r\n\r\nHe had established himself as the \"face\". Ad revenue and screen castings were rolling in. Tony was on top of the world.\r\n\r\nThat was until the birth of those little ADHD assho... I mean the gnomes. The snapping, the crackling, the popping. It drove Tony MAD!\r\n\r\nChildrens and adults everywhere fell in love immediately. \r\n\r\nTony was forgotten. Pushed aside in favor of the new blood in the cereal game. Years passed, Tony dove deeper into depression.\r\n\r\nSitting, Alone. Disheartened. Defeated.\r\n\r\nThat was until he discovered a video on his wife's laptop. The video revealed the trio of noisy cereal characters had run a train on his wife!\r\n\r\nENRAGED Tony decided to battle back like Rocky! He would put those fucking midgets in their rightful place! His COMEBACK!\r\n\r\nThis, Is the product of his revenge. His one chance to take back the throne of the cereal world.\r\n\r\nAfter killing all of them, He had a revelation. What if he used their blood to sweeten the cereal!?\r\n\r\nThe results, amazing.\r\n\r\nThe Gnomes and that two timing whore of a wife are now to be enjoyed by everyone! THIS. IS. TONY'S REVENGE!\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n|||| FLAVOR NOTES |||| (Because creative stories are apparently not cool anymore)\r\n\r\nProfile Goal: Bottom of the bowl, drenched and drizzled, sweetened cereal milk.\r\n\r\nAcetyl Pyrazine\r\nWho doesn't know what AP is anymore?\r\nIt's an additive to impart a bready and grainy texture. At 1% it gives the mix a lightly baked characteristic.\r\nIt also covers the inclusion of slight berries some users report coming from Capella's Cereal 27.\r\n\r\nCapella Cereal 27\r\nThis is the foundation the cornflake is built off of. At 5% here it's dominant as we want it to be in the profile.\r\nLightly sweet with some oat grain. Authentic cornflakes.\r\n\r\nLucky Leprechaun \r\nFor me, this is more milk and marshmallow than cereal. It adds smoothness to the recipe and contributes\r\nto the experience by pairing with Milky undertones to add a thick milk base.\r\n\r\nOne on One Milky Undertones\r\nThis could potentially be replaced by FA Fresh Cream or another of your favorite milk bases, But OoO Milky\r\nUndertones fit the profile from version one so I stuck with it. It paid off by contributing a nice dense milky finish.\r\n\r\nTFA Bavarian Cream\r\nThis also offers to the rounding of the overall profile, Serving as a great blender and smoother for the grains and\r\nthe milky finish. It contains a nice low vanilla note barely perceptible but is a great addition to the milk.\r\n\r\nTFA Marshmallow\r\nIn this mix it thickens and sweetens. Traditional frosted flakes are sweet as hell, But this isn't the final touch that\r\ntakes this from a mediocre frosted flakes, To an authentic sweet bowl.\r\n\r\nCAP Super Sweet\r\nThis is it. This is what the initial mixes I was working on was missing. Being inherently against using sweeteners\r\nfor the sake of my coils, I was hesitant to try it. After it's inclusion it brought the entire mix to completion. At just\r\n.5% it works, But .75% was the sweet spot matched side by side with a bowl of frosted flakes cereal milk.\r\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nAccompanying Video for further notes and entertainment:\r\n\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-vvx5VKDiQ\r\n\r\nIf you wish to support me as a creator Bull City Flavors has been so kind to offer community recipe packs, It doesn't cost you any more to purchase from this link, but it sure helps me out.

It's the bottom of a bowl of frosted flakes and lucky charms. Little bit of wheat, shitton of sugar, and sweet sweet milk. The mix of bavarian cream and OoO totally makes a rich sweet milk, and there's more than a hint of the lucky charms in there. Don't get me wrong, I'm totally noticing the frosted flakes, but it's that hint of lucky charms marshmallow dust that keeps pimp slapping my attention towards it. Best damned cereal milk I've ever had. And I'm hearing this from at least 4 friends I've handed it over to.&#xD;\n&#xD;\nSeriously, Steam, you straight killed the hell outta this!"

I also mixed the version from BCF, which is malted milk instead of milky undertone, and was a bit skeptical at first. Malted milk has a tendency to take over a mix or just ruin in, but in that case, it does very well. "
