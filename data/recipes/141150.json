  "description": "**YAYY!! Its FLV release day! In honor of these marvelous & potent new concentrates, I present this all-Flavorah recipe called \"Melrose\"!!**\r\n\r\n**DESCRIPTION:**\r\n*A creamy melon mix with the right touch of rind to make it extremely authentic and \"fresh\" tasting. Rose Essence really distinguishes this mix from other fruit mixes & tastes like it was created for the sole purpose of living amongst the melons.*\r\n  \r\n**FLV Honeydew** has got to be the best fresh Honeydew on the market. These new FLV concentrates are potent, so low percentages are a must.\r\n  \r\n**FLV Cantaloupe** is added both for creaminess & for filling out the Honeydew in terms of body. \r\n\r\n**FLV Watermelon** was included here to bring out that \"fresh fruit salad\" flavor. This flavoring isnt very potent. But regardless, I kept it low so as to not take the spotlight away from the honeydew.\r\n  \r\n**FLV Wild Melon** I never get sick of this flavoring. Very fresh tasting and not too strong at this percentage.\r\n\r\n**FLV Rose Essence** and **FLV Melon Rind:** Let me start out by saying that I despise florals. I've just never appreciated them. But, FLV's Rose Essense seems to have infused itself inside of the rind layer somehow. Combined, they also produce a \"wet\" feel. The mixture of these two concentrates is...magical. \r\n  \r\n**FLV Sweetness** is the best sweetener for this mix. \r\n  \r\n**1 day steep**\r\n**70%VG used**\r\n\r\n...as a side note, these new flavors are so \"buildable\" that the only limit to their use is your own imagination. Seriously...they all seem to bring something new & unique to the table. I'm still experimenting but so far, I am really enjoying creating new and exciting combos!\r\n\r\n*and now for the usual request. please dont use my free recipes for commercial gain & please dont post to other websites without permission.*\r\n  \r\n**E-JuiceMakers One Shots**",
