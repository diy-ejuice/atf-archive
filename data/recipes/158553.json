    "name": "Elderflower Ice Cream",
    "description": "This is a relatively popular ice cream combo in Northern Europe, elderflower has been used here for decades (centuries maybe?), mainly as a spice to cover up the offnotes in moonshine, but it has also made its way in to ice creams, cordials and candy.\r\n\r\nYou might call this a lazy mix, and indeed it is. But as the vanilla is a main component here, there is no better vanilla ice cream base than the one by @eyemakepizza. It's elegant and tasty, and by adding the elderflower it gives a new interesting dimension to that rich vanilla yummyness.\r\n\r\n**FLV Elderflower** is an amazing flavor that works well with both creams and fruits.",

The FLV Elderflower here definitely tastes like it\u2019s very much in the showing off category.

The elderflower pairs so well with the vanilla ice cream that I was shocked when I first vaped this. It may be my new favorite ice cream vape. Great job on this one!"
