  "name": "Peach and mango - great all day vape",
  "description": "This peach mango and guava is a simple sweet juicy fruit mix. none of the flavors really stand out from each other but combined create a great ADV. Adding 1% mango (6%) creates a mango top note. Super sweet can be dropped to 0.5% any less and I get a slight bitterness from the peach.\r\nMany of my friends also all day vape this recipe. its my most popular recipe to date.\r\nSHAKE AND VAPE no steep required 60/40 is good in my sub ohm tank. 50/50 is good for MTL devices but I increase all by 25% (eg. Sweet mango 5% x 1.25 =6.25%)\r\nMy mtl mix is 6mg free base for a bit of throat hit and 10mgNS (smooth) to top it up. To me free base gets harsh over 6mg",
