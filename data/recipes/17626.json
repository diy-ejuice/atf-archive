  "description": "My first attent to make a juice from the ground up, not just blending other peoples recepies.\r\n\r\nMy goal was to feel the crispy deepfried shell and then an explosion of cinnamon drenched apple.\r\n\r\nHowever, the fresh apple taste came only on the exhale, and was a little weak.\r\n\r\nIts really tasty as it is, but still a work in progress, I guess. \r\n",
