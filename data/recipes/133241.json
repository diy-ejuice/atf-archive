    "description": "This is how much I believe in this recipe, and have faith that it is truly the closest thing ever mixed to the real deal Pop Deez. I paid for a membership with ATF just so I could share this recipe publicly for everyone to try!.. Give it a mix.. It was worth the $2 to share it with everyone...\r\n\r\nInstead of Creating a totally new recipe I opted to post my tweaks to this recipe here. Once I get closer and feel it is as close as it is going to get I will create and post a new final recipe version.  So here is my changes and tweaks for Version 2 :\r\n\r\nVersion 2:\r\nFLV- Popcorn- 0.75%\r\nFLV- Sweetness- 0.25%\r\nCAP- Golden Butter- 0.5%\r\nHS- Caramel Toffee- 1%\r\nWF- Caramel Butter- 0.5%\r\nVTA- Butter Base- 0.5%\r\n\r\nMy Husband and I rarely buy commercial juice, but when we do we always buy Pop Deez. It is our all time favorite juice. Period. So when I started mixing that was one juice I set out to try and mix. I have worked on recreating (cloning) Steep Vapor's Pop Deez for over a year now. I have tried every recipe that was a supposed Pop Deez clone and near every Caramel Popcorn recipe I have found. NONE of them have been anywhere near close. Nowhere in the ball park of tasting anything like Pop Deez. No recipe I worked out every turned out how I hoped and never even resembled Pop Deez. That was until now... I started investing in FLV flavors as well as a few other Higher Priced \/ Better Quality flavors. I knew FLV Popcorn was in it as soon as I smelled it out of the bottle. But even then I still hadn't nailed the caramel and butter aspects of it. That was until I got Hangsen's Caramel Toffee in. I immediately knew this was the caramel I was missing and what I needed for my \"Great White Buffalo\" Pop Deez... There is still a little tweaking I need to do with the sweetness and possibly the caramel as it is a caramel heavy flavor after a super short steep. I will know more after a few more days steep time but I truly believe it will need little to no altering. This is the closest recipe you will find anywhere to being Pop Deez. So if you are like us and love this juice then you def need to mix this up. No flavors can be substituted so if you don't have these exact flavors do NOT mix this, do what you need to do and invest in these flavors to mix it up. I promise you will not regret it... It is sooooo damn good and sooooo damn close to the ever illusive POP DEEZ! Give it a mix and let me know what ya think.. and yes this is my first and only recipe here on ATF.. Don't let that scare you off though, mix this up, I just can not stress enough how happy you'll be with this one.. ",
