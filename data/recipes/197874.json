  "description": "Darlin' if you ain't had a buttermilk pie, then you just ain't living! An old secret most southern women know, is if you run out of buttermilk, you can mix a little lemon juice with milk to get that flavor. Here we used Lemon and whipped cream to fake out that tangy buttermilk taste. For the crust we're using a trick I heard from Developed Cookie/Sugar Cookie. Custard gives it that creaminess you need, and without butter, well bless your heart you just ain't living! Don't go getting your panties in a wad, or jumping the gun, because it takes a few days for that lemon and whipped cream to mix. If you try this on the shake and vape you're gonna get a sweet lemon curd, which ain't half bad, but sweetheart, it ain't buttermilk either.",
