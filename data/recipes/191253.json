  "description": "Y'all just don't know . . . and probably don't care right now (I get it), but I've been trying to get somewhere with a strawberry RY4 for a long time.  I'm finally content.  Yes, it's a massive amount of flavoring . . . yes, it's made up of 10 different flavors.  However, I've finally scratched that itch!  I approached this in much the same way as my Long Gone Lonesome Blues recipe, in terms of layers.  It's a custardy, strawberry cheesecake with a beautiful tobacco backdrop.  The Vanilla Ruyan, Graham Cracker, and Red Oak kind of serve the purpose of bridging the gap between the two flavor profiles.  When I look at where my recipes usually shine, in my opinion, I'm pretty decent at dessert tobaccos.  This is exactly where I want it to be.  It was okay as a SNV, but , man, 3 days later it was absolutely shining (according to my palate).  This was a labor of love . . . I hope you enjoy it as much as I do.",
