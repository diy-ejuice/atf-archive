  "name": "Port of Beirut- Another Tripoli recipe",
  "description": "After three months of tinkering with more iterations than I care to count, I’m sending this off to the world. \r\n\r\nMy Three Cities recipe was made without ever trying the real deal, and after I received a sample from ID10-T, I became slightly obsessed with trying to clone this juice. There is just something about it that makes it pretty obvious to me why it’s a popular juice. \r\n\r\nTwo things really jumped out at me. One was the satisfyingly dense mouth feel. I started out with RY4 Double and FE Cigar from the get-go, but it wasn’t dense enough. I eventually tried tasting a few drops of the juice to try to find a clue as to what could be in it, and I pretty much only tasted vanilla. Skipping all the vanilla trials, I ended up admitting defeat and used CAP Vanilla Custard. Using enough of that to get the mouth feel right made the taste way too vanilla heavy, so I lowered that down a bit and used some CAP Sugar Cookie. These two ingredients make this absolutely not a 1:1 clone since they contain them diketones, but god damn it they are good. \r\n\r\nThe other thing that really jumped out at me every time I tasted the real thing was this sweet little tickle on the tip of the tongue. It almost feels like a cooling sensation, but not. Hard to explain. But there’s a few things that I think are coming together here to give that feeling. TFA Toasted Almond, FW Fig, and TFA Turkish. I had to go a lot lower with all three of those than I thought I would have to, but each one lends a little something to that sweet little tickly top note. \r\n\r\nI’m not going to say this is the perfect Tripoli recipe, but it’s the best one I can do.
