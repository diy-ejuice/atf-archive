    "description": "This my 3rd attempt to create a very rich caramel filling that you might mind in pastries. This recipe doesn't include any pastry\/cake notes to me, it's mostly a rich filling. definetly very creamy and rich. Might be too rich for an ADV but I love it. \r\n My notes are these:\r\nFW caramel salted is the star of the recipe, and definetly the strongest flavor, I really enjoy it but I think it needs support \r\nFLV cupcake batter I think it gives the body to the3 salted caramel adding  mouthfeel and general sweetness\r\nFA torrone and tosted almond this is my attempt to give some nutty note but avoid the dryness of general nuts, I think torrone and toasted almond do a god job in this\r\nFa meringue... I put this awsome ingredient in a lot of recipes and I love it, I think it enhanches the almond aspect without muting and adding mouthfeel\r\nCAP butter cream is in here because I'm trying to make a very creamy caramel, very vey rich, and not a too  dark caramel\r\nFw butterscoth ripple in my head acts as an opposite to the lighter tones of the caramel enhancing the deeper sugar notes\r\nTPA vanilla custard is there because I'm a big fan of custard and I didn't want it too hevay as CAP VC v1 but still present. This might be changed with vanilla swirl for a lighter version\r\nSweetener is there manily because I like it personally in this kind of recipes. \r\nThis is a work in progress and what I just wrote might be complete rubbish for most experienced mixers, any suggestion is highly appreciated. I'm a nobody and this is my first recipe published here so don't be too cruel!\r\n\r\n",
