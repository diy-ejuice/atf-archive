    "description": "Idea from the noted crew. Won the alchemist flavorah pack from fotw drawing and was researching red cinnamon from odies flavor facts. Found the cinnamon episode I had seen before but forgot the red cinnamon review as I didn't have that flavor at the time. I believe Dave or Emily mentioned apple option i thought sounded interesting so i thought of sour apple first to compliment the candy componet of red cinnamon.  Then wanted another apple to soften the sour and not more tart so ended up with inw 2 apples.  The last part was finding a bridge from red cinn inhale to apple exhale but it ended up being more of a binder. Caramel was the obvious answer. So used the old stand by with caramel candy to achieve a deeper flavor that's there but still let's the apple peek through. 0.25 percent on the red cinnamon provides a full sticky mouth feel and just works with the sour\/tart of the apples. Hope you enjoy, it's different and delicious. Shake and vape approved but the caramel will develop after a couple days.",
