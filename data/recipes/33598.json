Delicious sweet taste. Tastes the same throughout the entire day. I will probably only vape this for the rest of my life :) chills you to the bone. Really would like to see some variations"

I didn't have FW Menthol, so I subbed with FE Menthol at the same percentage, and *man*, this is fantastic. I haven't had a good menthol vape in awhile, and I've *definitely* never had one this good."
