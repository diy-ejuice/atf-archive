  "description": "A long time ago (2016, which is like decades in vaping/mixing years), I tried to make a pear recipe that captured my favorite type of pear, the Nashi pear or Asian apple-pear. I did the best I could with the ingredients I had at time. Here it is again, a little better. I've not eaten one of these pears in some time, but this is closer to what I remember. Here's what I used and why. \r\n\r\n**WF Ripe Pear** is the foundation this whole thing is built on. I used TFA Pear before but it's really too sharp and strong to easily bend into one of these sweet and mild juicy delights. WF Ripe Pear is softer and sweeter but still has the body. **FA Pear** makes it juicy. A touch of **TFA Honeysuckle** gives it just the right kind of sweet florality, it's that lovely speckled skin of the apple-pear and part of the sugary juice at the same time.  I used **JF Fuji** instead of the FA Fuji to get the appleyness right this time - the old recipe used FA Fuji but that kinda spicy skin too much and it was way too sharp. I smoothed it out with TFA Marshmallow before, but that pulled it off target a bit. Tasting the old recipe again, I get a hint of vanilla and creamiess from the marshmallow that just doesn't belong. Adding a bit of Marshmallow to sweeten, smooth over, and fill out things is *so 2016*, anyway. Just use better ingredients to begin with and you won't need to do that. JF being softer and not having that hard apple skin eliminated the need for all that mess. \r\n\r\n**CAP Kiwi** is a terrible kiwi flavor. Don't buy it to mix this, it's not worth it. It's not offensive, it doesn't even really even taste like a kiwi. But it's very sweet and just a touch of it makes this taste more like the the Nashi pear than the Ethyl Maltol I used to try to blend with Honeysuckle to get the flavor right four years ago. I'm pleased to have finally found a use for the stuff, and if you have it already, maybe you will be too. \r\n\r\n**This is not a boldly flavored recipe.** It's not meant to be. It's aping a fruit that has a pleasant mild flavor and is meant to be an ADV that doesn't stress the palate with intensity. I'll make a blow-your-face off recipe next, maybe. \r\n ",
