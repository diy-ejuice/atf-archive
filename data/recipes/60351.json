  "description": "As its invigorating tart kiwi bite quickly gives way to full-bodied juicy sweetness, this exemplifies the supremacy of the Arctic Beauty variety of the emerald fruit over its fuzzy brother. Served cold as the winds on the snowy slopes of Caradhras, it makes for a guaranteed refresher.",

Sometimes when striving for perfection or trying to recreate the wheel...we forget the pleasure of the simple things in life, like how good a glass of water tastes after going for a jog on a hot day. Well this is that glass of water (or cucumber water if you're a fancy rich person). It's mainly kiwi with the honeydew singing backup, not overly sweet or tart, and it's light, crisp and refreshing. While working outside yesterday in 95 degree weather, this was a simple pleasure to have on hand. "
