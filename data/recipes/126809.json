  "name": "Breakfast with A Moose  (crepes with an orange liquor sauce) ",
  "description": "Was at a brunch and  they were serving Crepes  with a Cointreau  sauce( orange liquor)  , and it was just plain old YUMMY .  So this was my attempt at  capturing this and it comes really darn close \r\n**WF Crepes** is just a great   sweet pancake/ crepe base with out any additional maple syrup notes   but needs a touch of  texture to add those darker notes.   So I added a bit  of  **FA joker** for that darker fried edges   and it works perfect  thanks @starsandclouds  for that recommendation.     I think you could use FA biscuit, or even hazelnut at a  low percent to capture that as well   \r\n**WF croissant and CAP  butter peacn**  adds those lovely creamy   butter notes and body that I wanted to add here     The butter pecan also add some more texture \r\n**VT Orange Marmalade, FA  Rum and VT golden syrup** create the  orange sauce .  Golden syrup is like a sweet  generic  pancake syrup  that is really useful   here adding that sticky sweet sort of mouth feel to the  Rum and Orange marmalade .  I used rum rather then  brandy here as I did not want the other fruit notes that brandy can have and  i  wanted some of the darker spice notes from  the rum \r\nI used   FW sweetener here at 0.05%   \r\n\r\n**NOTES/SUBS** while Joker is not needed it does add  the darker crunch  to the crepe .  Any dark cookie note could work at a low  percent .    if you want more of an orange   pop  top note you can a dd another orange/ citrus of your liking to the  Orange marmalade.  I did not want the orange to take over but to be more of a accent note .     \r\n\r\nThis  was made of Day time franks mixin in the kitchen Breakfast episode   \r\nLearn more about mixing here:\r\nfacebook - https://www.facebook.com/groups/diydownunder/\r\nDiscord - https://discord.gg/kH4Fqbc\r\nYoutube - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCTCwb7ULyfJALQlehomZZQA\r\nwebsite - https://www.diydownunder.com/\r\n\r\n",
