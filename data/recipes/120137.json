  "description": "https://youtu.be/N03waizZCng\r\n\r\nJust a simple chocolate cake on the inhale and exhale with a nice coco powder dusting finish.  created on DIYDOWNUNDER MIXING WITH ME MATES EPISODE 33.\r\n\r\nLB LAVA CAKE....Nice chocolate cake flavor up around 6 percent and up...use this lower for a nice chocolate sauce....initially mixed i got that same ole tootsie roll smell...but it does not vape that way...great flavor!!\r\n\r\nFLV POUND CAKE.... this is a great flavor to add to other cake concentrates for support and to ad density to the overall cake flavor/feel.\r\n\r\nFA COOKIE.... Lava Cake is a chocolate cake with a molten fudgey center...cookie is used here to help dry out that center of the cake and add more texture to the mix\r\n\r\nOOO powered sugar....used her to get that coco powder feel on the end of the exhale...i have been told that using this flavor over 1% will start to dry out the mix.\r\n\r\nFLV VANILLA BEAN..... Nice vanilla flavoring...used here because all cakes need Vanilla...\r\n\r\n",
