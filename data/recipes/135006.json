    "description": "I know there are hundreds of fruit and cream recipes out there, and most are delicious. I've tried, and enjoyed several of them.\r\nThere are also cream bases, and stones. Ever since I acquired CC Devon Cream, I had wanted to find other creams to blend with it.\r\nAfter mixing a few different ones together, I have found what I've been looking for!\r\nI chose FLV Boysenberry because to me; it's delicious! Truth be known; you could probably insert any fruit in here and it'll work.\r\nThe creams that follow are some of my favorite, and in my opinion; blend very well together. FLV Cream is delightful, and thick. FA Cream Fresh offers a thin, more dairy like note. CC Devon Cream is amazing, and is like no other. It can be used by itself, and if you like creams; it's a MUST HAVE!\r\nFinally, I added a touch of FA Vienna Cream. After a 10 day steep, FA Vienna Cream is simply delicious.\r\nTo me; they all seem to blend well, and with a little help from FLV Boysenberry' they make one hell of an amazing tasting vape!\r\nI'm a sucker for a good cream, and a big Wu-Tang fan.\r\nI suggest a 10 day steep.",

            "text": "Not bad, Id like to see the boysenberry pushed forward a bit more though, as it is, it just kinda sits as a lingering afterthought.  Needs to be pushed higher or given another fruit to make it pop more I think.  I also find it a bit thin for my liking.  Thinking I might try rearranging this mix to utilize FA custard premium as well, since, to me, no custard\/cream is complete without it!  Mix is definitely good as is, nice change from SB &amp; C's but has room for improvement.    edit: so I made some tweaks.... replaced FA cream fresh with 1.5% FA custard premium (this and devon cream are really the best cream combo bar none!) &amp; added 2% WF grenadine.  Also pushed boysenberry up to 3%.  might seem high but to get through the ever so thick custards in this, it works and really pops a bit more.  its outstanding and def something I'll keep in rotation.  So much thanks for the inspiration!  :)"
