    "description": "My idea here was to make a base layer for a Grape Juice or a Juice that can be used as a Moist Juicy layer for a fruity Fruit Juice! Inspiration is basically from how a grape and apple combo is used in most fruit juices as a background or base layer.\r\n\r\nMoscato @ 2% its is perfect to me as very visible White grape without adding funky or bitter dry notes that I usually get from white grapes. The texture from the Moscato really pops here too, much like a watery flesh layer inside a grape.\r\n\r\nFuji apple & Country apple combo here to create the Fresh apple juice that is then combined with the Grape.\r\n\r\nFA pear is only here for some moistness and a touch of texture wrapping up this profile as a Liquid.\r\n\r\nPairings:\r\n- Add some coolant if its an Iced Beverage or something that needs a coolant.\r\n- Berries (Strawberries & Blueberries)\r\n- Fruit Beverages\r\n- Fruity Vapes\r\n- Juicy Gummy Candies\r\n\r\nDiscussed it in this Vid:\r\nhttps:\/\/youtu.be\/zXbynCqGX-Y",
