Please leave feedback if you decide to mix it up\r\n\r\nFW Sweetener is optional, but I feel it contributes to the donuts authenticity",

Amazing amounts of flavor coming from this recipe.  Its a banger out of the gate and I'm intersted in seeing what the steep does here.  Probably should have made a bigger batch.  Well done and thanks for sharing !  So good I'm mixing up the rest of your recipes that I have all the flavors for."
