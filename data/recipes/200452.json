  "description": "Switching to blueberries from the Yuno base really changed this flavor. Fresh, mashed blueberries with some tart/peel is what I wanted from FA Blueberry Juicy Ripe and WF Blueberry Jam. I had to up that WF Macadamia from Yuno for it to comes across more since it’s what held the base together.\r\n\r\n***After a week steep, this mix did something that didn’t happen when I was testing it.  The blueberries and macadamia nut created a light dark chocolate note that sits right next to the berries.",

The cheesecake is not super heavy which is fine with me as it allows me to be able to vape on it more frequently during these still somewhat warm months. I also love what the macadamia nut does in this recipe adding a very slight almost chocolate note on the exhale, excellent work!"
