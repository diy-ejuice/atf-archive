  "description": "Pretty much a straight fwd üçìü•õ after it steeps out... It might need a lil more tweaking but it's pretty damn good now... Used MB Strawberry Milk for the ground work since it's basically a one shot, and everything else is to support and build up the rest of the recipe...\r\n\r\nI think some WF Cookie Butter could turn this into a nice cereal milk (maybe with an add of a lil custard) just cause I put this over some of Silky's Cookie Crumble Custard https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/188966 and it showed alot if promise to going into a cereal milk... Idk ü§™ experiment at your own expense... It's DIY mofos! Either way hope y'all enjoy... And atleast keep on mixing and keep the community alive! üëä",
