    "description": "*It's a turtle in bed with big tobacco.*\r\n\r\nI hope you only came here looking for a delicious dessert tobacco vape and not for anything resembling originality. 90% of this recipe is just Coop's nifty little [Salted Caramel Praline](https:\/\/alltheflavors.com\/recipes\/86940#salted_caramel_pralines_by_coop34) plus his own recommendation for turning it into a turtle-type flavor with Milk Chocolate, plus a hair more Salted Caramel. The other 10% is just the two FLV tobaccos from one of my all-time favorite recipes, [Cardinal](https:\/\/alltheflavors.com\/recipes\/24962#cardinal_by_fear), with a bit more Burley. The result? 100% so good I think I'll start a new religion based on it and turn DIY into a theocracy. I hope Coop and Fear enjoy being co-deities and don't demand too much from me in the form of blood sacrifices. \r\n\r\nSteep time here is 2 weeks because the Pralines and Cream and Salted Caramel really need a week to come together into a creamy caramel with pecans on top vs. thinner caramel with pecans and some cream that are more separated. Unfortunately that 7 days catches the tobacco in the wrong place at the wrong time, but after 7 more they're back where they belong. ",
