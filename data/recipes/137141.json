    "description": "This is a remaking of the original recipe I did a while back, I got some new flavors and thought they'd make a good mix.   Both mixes are good and quite different from each other but for me what sets this one aside is addition of the VT BLOOD ORANGE CHAMPAGNE & FIZZY SHERBET, I don't know how VT makes such a realistic fizzy texture but its amaze-balls.  Champagne gives a slight boozy note with a touch of orange to help out the fruits in the mix, sherbet adds to the bubbly-ness with a hint of lemon fizz.\r\nFLV SANGRIA is heavier in tannins than the RF offer & has more of a booziness to it, think of it as being a deep red wine compared toRF being a fruity ros\u00e9.  \r\n\r\nFA LIQUID AMBER tops off the boozy note and adds some body.\r\n\r\nMEXICAN CACTUS gives it some juiciness\/wetness \r\n\r\nBLOOD ORANGE, CHERRIES\/CHRRYL\/SHISHA LIME are for the fruits added to the sangria\r\n\r\nFIZZY SHERBET adds some more fizz and a touch of lemon.\r\n\r\nIts honestly sweet enough on its own but I enjoy it with some FLV sweetness or supersweet added to it and in the summer,  .50% WS23.\r\nSNV certified.\r\n\r\nI honestly rate and review every recipe I mix up on here (I consider it to be good etiquette) and would ask you to do the same!\r\n\r\nPlease do not post elsewhere without my prior consent.  You may not use this for commercial gain.\r\nHappy mixing!",

The Liquid Amber and Blood Orange Champagne really turn that FLV Sangria into sangria, and the missing citrus is added, beautifully. It\u2019s also legit fizzy. I\u2019ve never had a fizzy sangria, but I think I\u2019d like one after trying this. "
