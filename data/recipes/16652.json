    "description": "Steep Time: 3 Days. \r\nSo this recipe is my pride and joy. If you like absinthe mix this up, and if you think you don't like absinthe mix this up. I have had a ton of people try out this recipe for me as I've worked on it and even people who normally dislike absinthe enjoy this recipe. Simply put, DV Absinthe is in a completely different landscape than TPA Absinthe. TPA's version is very heavy on the anise note to the point that it overtakes a recipe, which can be good for an anisehead like myself but leads to most people disliking it. DV Absinthe has that anise note but that's only one part of it. It has a nice herbal blend of flavors that avoids being purfumy or overpowering which adds something special to a mix. While I won't go into too much detail on the other flavors in the recipe, the main goal was to make a citrus fruit and absinthe cocktail. The lemon, lime, and Mandarin combine into a nice citrus base that isn't overpowering or too harsh while also not focusing on one particular citrus flavor. The Kiwi provides a little tang and helps pop the mix a bit. The Pink Guava acts as the most noticeable fruit in the mix even at this low of a percentage. If you are sensitive to it drop it to .25% which one of my friends prefers but I like it at .4% personally. It gives a very solid Grapefruit flavor that helps with that sour\/tangy note and also works to balance out the sweetness in the recipe. The Spearmint Koolada combination adds a sweet minty flavor that blends with the herbal notes while not being too overpowering on the fruits. Lastly the stevia really is the best sweetener for this recipe. Stevia has a bit of a bitter\/herbal taste in its sweetness that normally is an off note, but in this recipe it really works with the absinthe and the pink guava. Overall this is a recipe I can vape for weeks without getting tired of and I would love to hear what everyone thinks.",

After a couple days, everything tones down a little and gets even more delicious, but this is a perfect shake and vape.  Like RuntDastardly said, DV Absinthe is basically perfect.  This is a complex blend of citrus and herbal, and it works incredibly well for those times you get vaper's tongue and need to switch it up."

FLV Pink Guava is a spectacular pairing with DV Absinthe, and one I would never have imagined would work so well together. Thanks for introducing me to this, frankly, perfect Absinthe flavor. I can't wait to see what else we can do with it!"
