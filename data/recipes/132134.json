  "description": "What is a Christmas Apple? Imagine a crisp fresh apple blanketed with melted \"sticky\" caramel. If that isn't drool-inducing enough-dip that caramel apple into a pot of warmed velvety white chocolate. Finish by rolling apple gently in crushed candy canes. THIS, my friends...is a Christmas Apple!!\r\n\r\nHealth Cabin Caramel & Caramel Apple are vital to this mix. You CANNOT sub them out because frankly, there is NOTHING that compares! Health Cabin caramels, in particular, are used in many \"older\" popular eliquids. I would venture to say, Neckbeard's Nectar utilizes Health Cabin Caramel. That was my favorite RY4 \"back in the day\" and now I can vape it by making my own thanks to Health Cabin. This is one VERY underrated flavoring company. \r\n\r\nRecommend 70% VG.\r\n2-3 hour heat-steep, then vape away!! \r\n\r\n**If you prefer a bit more candy cane, try \"Christmas Apple 2\" which is also uploaded here:\r\nhttps://alltheflavors.com/recipes/132144**\r\n\r\n  \r\n*As always, please don't use this recipe for commercial gain.*\r\n  \r\n**#E-JuiceMakers**\r\n\r\n \r\n",
