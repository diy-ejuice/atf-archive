  "description": "So I'm going to call it like it is.  I love Kookie Krunch and my local vape shop doesn't sell it anymore so I set out to get as close as I could to that recipe.  This is it.  For me it's better than the original store bought, to you it may not be, and that is how things work with so-called clones.  ",
