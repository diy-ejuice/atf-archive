  "name": "Deep Fried Carrot Cake Oreo Cookies",
  "description": "Ok so i’m using carrot cake as the main flavor here at 4 % because at this % it’s not too overwhelming or to underwhelming . It’s just right at 4% . I then used Cream cheese icing for the center of the oreo at 1% is just perfect . We’re using Jungle Flavors Cookie at 2% and Cap sugar cookie at 2% to give it some Oreo cookie texture and also the sugar cookie is helping out the deep fried part of the recipe. we are then using WF Deep fried pastry dough-SC for a obvious reason at 1% gives it a deep fried taste and feel . Then i threw some OOO corn bread on that bitch to give it some more “cakey” texture for the deep fried part again . And also some CAP vanilla cupcake V2 to give it more fried cake ishness , Thsi flavor also adds some frosting to the mix because who doesn’t want to dip there deep fried carrot cake oreo in some cream cheese frosting ??? . And Last BUT not least you can go ahead and throw some super sweet in there if you would like at 0.5 to 1 % i would suggest not going over 1% . For ME 0.5 is perfect . This mix dose not necessarily need sweetener at all but it definitely brings the mix out more . As a shake and vape it’s good but after like 5 - 10 minutes of sitting the mix comes to life but i am sure after a few weeks steep time the cookie parts texture will shine like no tomorrow . So have fun with this one and mix it up and give it a 5 star rating if you like it . witch i’m positive you all will . especially if you all liked developeds “Deep fried birthday cake “ . That’s actually where i got the inspiration for the Deep fried part . At first i was just going to make a Carrot Cake oreo . But i figured that was kind of boring . So shout out to the developed team for coming up with such a good deep fried base with there Deep fried birthday cake recipe deep fried birthday cake recipe .
