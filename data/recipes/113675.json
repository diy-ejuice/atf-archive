  "description": "I was actually tempted not to make this public as there is this whole stigma around mixing at high % and that we should be mixing low this imo is true for some flavors but with these flavors i like them high. I have let this steep for over a month and the only thing that dies down a bit is the strawberry. I also mixed it at half strength and a quarter strength wile its not bad it just doesn't have the same intense mouth feel as when there this high. I can see various reasons why you won't mix this like you can't afford it lol , you looked at it and thought thats way to high this guy is off his head, i am pg sensitive, i can't fit my pg nic in there ect \r\nBut if you like sweet intense mouth feel vapes and the perfect strawberry doughnut (imo) give this a try its good off the snv and just as good a month later. Mix it don't mix it its up to you as always.",
