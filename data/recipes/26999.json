    "description": "So long story short rules are rules. And even though I did my best to follow I got caught up in the moment, and did not check the website before I started. I used flavors that I know I had purchased the whole city in the past. \r\n\r\nBefore submitting I decided just to double-check and what you know it. Bull City stopped carrying flavor West black currant, which was the linchpin in my recipe. So as a hell Mary I had to substitute for flavor Arts offering. Which I don't own and have no idea how it's going to come out. But I can vouch for this recipe it is a great and unique makes of berries.\r\n\r\nGoing for an unique blend of mixed of berries here. Starting off with foresr fruit, adding a little extra current, to that flavor with FW black currant, and then giving you a little something unique with the cap fig.\r\n\r\nForest fruit- on its own is a fantastic flavoring, little harsh as a shake and vape, but calms down after a couple of days. Since we've been limited to three flavorings I thought I would go with flavoring that has multiple flavors. This flavoring is very strong and does a great job at 1%.\r\n\r\nFlavor West black currant-can come off very Floral, and wasn't sure it was going to work here. Turned out to be a fantastic pairing with really bringing out the berries in this fruit mix.\r\n\r\nCap fig- I've tried using this particular flavoring with little success in other recipes. Took a chance threw it in the mix and WOW, it compliments the other berries well while sweetening everything, and just making it very interesting.\r\n\r\nI'm super impressed with this combination of flavorings and can't wait to use it in a custard or Bakery.\r\n\r\nUsing my standard testing setup. Clapton coils coming out at .46 ohms, in my recoil testing at 70\/30 with 3% Nic. \r\n\r\nThis flavoring is dark and delicious and should hold up even without the nicotine.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
