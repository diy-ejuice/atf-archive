  "description": "If the recipe name and close examination of the recipe picture didn't make you smile then I sure hope this recipe will. This is one of the toughest profile challenges I have set my self to date. This is deeper in flavor than you expect. To get the right balance of sweet & savory where it works well is often a fine line however I think I have pulled it off here. Layering nut flavors is no easy challenge either but again with a drop of saline every 20ml it just works to make the nuts pop! Again, I wanted great texture feel in this recipe and I worked with different nut combinations till I got the full mouth feel of gorgeous syrup coated nuts in my mouth! This combination of nuts is a really lovely party mix of desirable nuts. It's a delicate procedure because when it's out of balance it could turn into a tea-bagging lol. The hero of this recipe is Vape Train's new Golden Syrup, without this, the recipe wouldn't be as enjoyable. It has blended well with a little FA Maple Syrup to offer a gorgeous sweet syrup.   The WF Honey roasted peanut and flv pistachio really work here while the others all play there part as you get seemingly different types of nuisances of nut flavors upon each exhale.    Allow around 3 days for this orgy of nuts to settle with the sweet syrup for the best experience. Tell me what you think but most of all enjoy discovering flavor, and enjoy Golden Nuts! \r\n#DIY Downunder \"Let's Discover!\"",
