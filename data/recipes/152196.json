    "description": "Blue Team's Recipe from Mixer Showdown #2 on the DIY_ejuice Discord. \r\n\r\nMixers: @NordicFlavours, @UnappreciatedRobot, and @eyemakepizza.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe stole the candy from Candy Mountain and stuffed it into a cupcake. We made sure to bury red team in the process. Since we're team BLUE... blueberry!\r\n\r\nJF Yellow Cake makes the base for the cupcake. VT Yogurt Drink makes the impromptu frosting loaded with delicious Blueberry from FA Bilberry and FW Blueberry. VT Fizzy Sherbet brings the pop rocks! All that backed by some lemon to brighten the Blueberry from VT Yogurt Drink and VT Fizzy Sherbet.\r\n\r\nCome join us on Discord! https:\/\/discord.gg\/ufVTyAQ",

I'm not sure this one translates to anything that exists in real life--it's not quite bakery, not quite candy, not quite fruity, but some strange unholy mixture of the three.  But whatever it is, it works and I keep coming back for more.  "
