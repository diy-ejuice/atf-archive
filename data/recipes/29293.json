  "description": "A tasty vape that emulates the delightful Maynard's Swedish Berries. This candy is extremely similar to the American red Swedish Fish with just a slight difference in texture and taste so if you can't find Maynards Swedish Berries, Swedish Fish will be a suitable reference. A search for the flavor of these candies will tell you that although many have guessed raspberry, cherry, fruit punch and even lingonberry, the exact taste is unique to the candy and of course, undisclosed. My palate detects a combination of  strawberry and raspberry so that is what I went with to get this delicious taste. I think you will find this to be a very authentic representation of this candy.\r\n\r\nTFA Raspberry Sweet - this flavor is sort of the center of this mix. I needed to pick a sweet, candy like raspberry and Raspberry Sweet fit the bill perfectly\r\n\r\nTFA Sour - There is just enough of this flavor in the recipe to give the candy a tartness that you find with the real thing and to make the fruit flavors pop. In fact you will see citric acid as an ingredient in the real Swedish Berries. \r\n\r\nTFA Strawberry - This strawberry, although not the first ingredient chosen, ended up being a better fit just because of how well it blended all the flavors together. I don't normally use this strawberry as it is not my favorite but it just works so much better in this mix than any others. It is a very sweet strawberry that is almost syrupy in nature, which is exactly what you want when trying to emulate a gummy candy. \r\n\r\nTFA Swedish Gummy - I used just enough of this flavor to carry over the perception of not just a candy but a gummy candy. This is what supplies not only the flavor but that unmistakable mouth feel.\r\n\r\nTFA Sweetener - As you all probably know, Swedish Fish/Berries are a very sweet, syrupy, cloying candy, and I needed help from this flavor to get the mix to that level.",
