  "description": "If you ordered a banana milkshake and someone accidentally added a scoop of mint ice cream to it by mistake you would think you would be pretty pissed, right? I know I would. But you know what they could throw in there that no one could get angry about? Chocolate!\r\n\r\nThink vanilla milkshake with chocolate-covered bananas blended into it. Mmmm. Chocolate. A girl's best friend and the most phallic of fruits make an orgasmic combination in this recipe made only from ingredients in the April 2017 Awesome Box. \r\n\r\nTFA Banana Cream - This creamy banana is the heart of this banana milkshake, but is also easily substitutable and augmentable. Go bananas with it. Do you prefer LA's version or find that the two of them are better together than either alone? Substitute 4% LA Banana Cream for the 4.5% TFA Banana Cream or use 2.5% TFA and 2% LA. I have reason to believe the DIYFS Banana Cream would also work, but you're on your own for a % on that one. Do you crave a bigger, bolder banana? Add 0.75% HS Banana or 1.25% FA Banana. Want less Runty, more natural-tasting monkey food? Add the HS or FA and drop Banana Cream to 3.5%.  \r\n\r\nFA Cream Fresh/CAP French Vanilla - Milkshake cream base straight-up stolen from @mlNikon's \"Here Come The Boys\" for this... homage? Parody? Call it what you like, it works. If you like your shakes like you like your PAWGs, extra thick, supplement this with 2% TFA Vanilla Bean Ice Cream or for pepper tasters and other weirdoes, the same amount of CAP VBIC, and eat it with a spoon. Want to be able to slurp your shake through a straw without blowing an o-ring? Leave it be. It's good.   \r\n\r\nFLV Milk Chocolate - What an attention whore this Hershey's syrup flavor turns out to be! It might as well be practicing deep throating on longnecks at the bar. While it tastes fine for what it is up to 1% without getting weird, I had to back it down in version after version all the way down to 0.08% to keep it from steamrolling over everything else. If you're working on a recipe and you want Hershey's chocolate syrup to be a secondary note rather than the main flavor, allow me to suggest making a dilution or seriously stepping up your \"half-drop by barely squeezing and then gently rubbing the nipple on the rim of the bottle\" game. \r\n\r\nFLV Sweet Coconut - There are only a few recipes that can't be improved by adding 0.25% Sweet Coconut. This isn't one of them. Here, it helps FLV Milk Chocolate taste less like Hershey's syrup and more like Magic Shell chocolate. Which, by the way, is something you can make at home by combining chopped milk chocolate and coconut \"it's not just for lube anymore\" oil and zapping it in the microwave.

      "text": "This is incredible! That banana cream % looked way too high until I tried this, oddly enough the FLV chocolate is the Star of the show here. The coconut seems to act as a sweet texturing agent, and the creams back up that chocolate perfectly for me. I have tried the recipe that seems to have inspired this (here come the boys) and I will say that this is by far my favorite of the two. The only thing this doesn't have is mint! (which for me is a good thing.) &#xD;\n&#xD;\nEdit: I used a tiny bit more than 0.08% FLV Milk Chocolate when I mixed this because I was too lazy to make a dilution. FWIW it is probably worth making a dilution for this recipe as I'm sure there are subtle things going on that the chocolate is covering."
