  "description": "Last year about this time I was working on a deep fried Cran-apple pie, but I never could create something I was happy with. Now that I got a few more flavors to work with I figured I'd give the profile another try.\r\n\r\nFLV Apple Filling: Brings a delicious apple pie filling with a dash of cinnamon.\r\n\r\nFA Apple pie & WF Deep Fried Dough: Make the crust of the fried pie.\r\n\r\nFLV Cranberry: Can't really have a cran-apple pie without Cranberry. FLV is my preferred cranberry.\r\n\r\nINW Creme Brulee: Adds some creaminess and some dark toasty sweetness.\r\n\r\nFLV Sweetness: used to sweeten the whole thing up a bit and keep the cranberry from being to tart.\r\n\r\nBest after a week steep\r\n\r\nPLEASE RATE/REVIEW IF YOU MIX",
