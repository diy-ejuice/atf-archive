    "description": "\"YALT\" Yet Another Lemon Tart! This is my second version of Lemon Tart Cracked! I found that the first version did not steep as well using the tpa lemon\/lime and fa lemon sicily. It had a very strong lemon\/lime zest to it making it bitter and harsh. This version still has a bit of a throat hit on the first few hits but smoothes out after a bit. And a few days steep it gets even better. I believe fe lemon is the correct lemon to use for this mix as it doesn't have a lot of the zest. \r\nInhale you get a slight zest from the lemon and on the exhale a nice tart and creamy lemon with a crisp \"graham cracker-like\" crust without having to use graham cracker. The fa apple pie and cap cereal 27 does this nicely. The tpa greek yogurt adds a very slight tanginess that sits well with the fa meringue, and who doesn't love meringue. Just a touch of sweetener to liven it up a little and you have a great adv for the hot weather to come. \r\nYou can also add .5% tpa vanilla bean gelato to add a eggy note to the recipe if you're looking to get a bit more of a custard flavor, but I prefer it without the VBG.\r\nGood as a shake and vape but only gets better with a few days steep. Please comment, mix, and or rate, it makes us all better mixers.\r\nPS I have a pg sensitivity so all my recipes are maxvg. I haven't tried this with adding pg, so if anyone mixes this with adding pg please let me know your thoughts. Enjoy :)",
