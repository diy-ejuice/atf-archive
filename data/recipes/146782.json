But, I do get a little tiny bit of raspberry floral that throws it off Swedish Fish just a hair. I heard it might steep out if left longer than the 3 days recommended here, so maybe it just needs a longer steep time. Also heard replacing 1% of the Gushy Candy with 1% FW Razzleberry might fix it. Haven't tried either of those things yet."
