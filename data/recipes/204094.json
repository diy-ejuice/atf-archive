  "description": "Introducing passionately punch my peaches ðŸ˜…\r\n\r\nPeach layer:\r\nCap juicy peach was used as our base for this recipe it provides us with a nice round punchy flavour. \r\nI originally used tpa juicy peach but it found it to give to much of a throat hit. \r\nFlavorah peach added in just to provide a bit of a brightness. \r\nInw peach is used to help push the peach into a more realistic flavour. \r\n\r\nPassionfruit:\r\n\r\nI originally used a 1:1 vt yellow passion:vt passionfruit but found that just using yellow passion provided me with all I need for a light twist of passionfruit.\r\n\r\nSweetener:\r\n\r\nI've been on a bit of sweet kick lately hence why I have cap ss at 1%.\r\nFeel free to lower the sweetener if you like.
