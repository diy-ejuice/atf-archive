Direct link: \r\n\r\nhttp://e-liquid-recipes.com/recipe/1895974/Jazzy%27s%20gummy%20bears\r\n\r\nFlavor description from ELR\r\n\r\nNotes\r\nIf you like gummy bears then you will love this because it tastes just like a gummy bear!! Its a snv with a very delightful fruity gummy bear inhale and candy flavor with no off notes at all. you wont be disappointed. It has a full mouth flavor and will keep you wanting more! \r\n\r\nI added super sweet but that wasn’t part of jazzys recipe. Feel free to adjust or remove it if you’d like! It really doesn’t need it but I’m a sucker for sweetener. ",
