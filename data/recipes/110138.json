The black currant comes through well with the help out the lemon you added. Your ice cream base is very good the milky cream and TPA VBIC blend together perfectly. I am not fan of really sweet juices so i only used 0.25% super sweet and its plenty sweet enough for me. Great job glad I stumbled upon this tasty recipe "

I am at 24hrs. post mix and can only imagine what some more time will do for it. No 'off' notes and the extra SS really compliments the Black Currant . Cooling took a while to get used to,but, won't change a thing when I mix a big bottle tom. Thanks so much! "

I may add a bit of flv Cream, or some Fresh Cream as @amouthforwar mentioned, just to thicken it up since I as well do not have OOO CMU.  Thanks and well done!"

Nice and tart berry blended with a tried and true VBIC. Ice cold, just how I like it. I've not yet vaped anything where blackcurrant was the main note so this threw me for a bit of a loop but it is delicious and I'm craving more!"
