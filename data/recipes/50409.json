  "description": "A tobacco modeled after a flavored Syrian Cigar I once had.\r\n\r\nThe spicy edge from Native and Turkish start this off. Turkish to bring in the Eastern influence, Native to darken it up more and lend a more cigarish edge to the mix.\r\n\r\nTurkish and Native can both get a bit dark, but also are not super complex on their own which is where Connecticut Shade comes in. It brightens while adding depth with it's naunced notes.\r\n\r\nThis is a spiced Cigar, and how can you have spiced without spice. I wanted a woodsy tone thus the Wood Spice, Pumpkin Spice is a great blend for a lot of reasons, used here for all those reasons :) FLV Clove, because, well, if you have not you should.",

I don't know where the creamy feel comes from though."
