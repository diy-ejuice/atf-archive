  "description": "I wanted a sweet, creamy Raspberry cake but with a really strong syrup like Raspberry flavor.\r\nThe main note is the Raspberry so I tried to build its fruity body with INW Raspberry and TFA Raspberry sweet but it wasnt what i was looking for.\r\n\r\nThen i mixed Clich√© recipe from @skiddlzninja and i really liked the way the strawberries worked with the raspberry so i played a little and got what i was hoping.\r\n\r\nThen I tried to give it a creamy cake undertone without taking away the sweetness and strong punch of the fruit so I went with FW cake (yellow) and FA Vienna cream.\r\n\r\nI think the Vienna cream adds that creamy layer without smoothing the mix too much, i wanted more like a fruity vape than a bakery. I think it still need some work and it will be great if you guys let me know your thougts about it.\r\n\r\nThis is my first original recipe so I hope you guys enjoy it the way I did creating it.\r\n\r\nCan work as a shake and vape but you will notice the bakery notes after 3 to 5 days.",
