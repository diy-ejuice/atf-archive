  "description": "So, only been hitting this in my pod, but holy freakin' hannah, this stuff is amazeballs. Cherry is nicely there, the cola flavor is just right. That dob of menthol mixes in well with everything else to both provide a sensation of cool, and i swear to god, there's a bit of that stab of fizz on the tongue (menthol and the cola syrup sparking the sense memory, i'm sure, but still...)\r\n\r\nThat it tastes this good in a pod system as is...can't wait to make a bigger batch for my other devices. I've already killed 1 ml in less than 24 hours, and this is in a pod system it usually takes me days to vape that much out of. Seriously good stuff!\r\n\r\nThis is for cola fans, cherry lovers, and soda fiends. An absolutely bitchin recipe, and easily an adv!\r\n\r\nPermission from slumberland to post.\r\n\r\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/5tmn2i/in_which_slumber_talks_about_nuka_and_long_term/\r\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/8xp0lo/aggressive_cherry_kola/                 newer posting",
