  "description": "this is like the milk left at the bottom of a bowl of cinnamon crunch cereal. it is a creamy sweet milk with a slight touch of cinnamon and caramel. This was made for a #DIYDOWNUNDER Milk challenge in which you had to use 5 flavors using only flavors available from Flvaorworld AU\r\n\r\n*CAP horchata* is a very underrated flavor. it is sweet creamy and has just a touch of cinnamon and it perfect for this type of application, and is noted on the back end. it is close to a cinnamon type pudding and could easily be used as such with a light custard to make a nice cinnamon pudding. if you want more of a cinnamon note you can add a dash of something like bakers touch or CAP cinnamon danish, RW cinnamon roll.\r\n\r\n*WF caramel butter*is a light creamy caramel, that blends right in - which is what I need. I did not want a dark thick caramel that stands out, the sweetness is noted on the front and carries through. You can also add some FLV milk and honey at a1% to support some of these notes \r\n\r\n*FA Vanilla bourbon* holds the middle of this mix together, it does not have any boozy notes it is straight up vanilla goodness \r\n\r\n*TPA rice crunchie* adds some of that cereal texture and sweet cereal notes to the mix without adding too much dryness that you can get from some of the cereal flavors \r\n\r\n*NOTES*: recommend to Use sweetener, lets be honest here - cereal milk is SWEET, that is why we like it!! Purlium super sweet is used here as it is a Sweetner that adds sweetness without adding an overly chemical sweetner note that I despise in Cap ( would prefer FLV sweetness here but alas could not use in the contest)    This is made for an RDA  flavors may be a more subtle in a  RTA  - this is  a bit of a steeper so you need to give it 12 - 14 days  \r\n\r\n. \"Learn more about mixing here:\r\nhttps://www.facebook.com/groups/diydownunder/\r\nhttps://discord.gg/kH4Fqbc\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCTCwb7ULyfJALQlehomZZQA\r\nhttps://www.diydownunder.com/\r\n\r\nTranslate",
