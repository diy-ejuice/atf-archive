      "text": "great recipe! 5/5. i settled on the TFA grape candy at 0.4% after 3 bottles. 1% really tastes like a pixystick and i get a whirring overflavored taste. went to 0.5% but it still didnt blend with the strawberry to create a single-layer fruit (grape candy is a very stark ingredient). at 0.4% it turns the strawberry into an almost raspberry candy flavor which is perfect. my personal preference is 0.25% CAP supersweet and 4.5% greek yogurt this makes it even better than the original in so many ways IMO. great, vivid mix though anyway you take it."
