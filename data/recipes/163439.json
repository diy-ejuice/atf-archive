  "name": "Vietnamese Coffee  Ice Cream  ",
  "description": "This ice cream is inspired by Vietnamese style iced coffee, which is typically very strong coffee served over ice with sweetened condensed milk.    Vietnamese Coffee  is just slightly lighter then French roast ,  smooth and not acidic.    \r\nOn inhale you get a   light vanilla  note that transitions to the  coffee/ cinnamon and ends with  touch of cardamon.    it needs a week for the creams to really fill out  and become a nice rich and creamy ice cream \r\nTested on a Reload RDA tested at 68 watts   on a  .16 alien coil  \r\nMade on Freshes show   on coffees   https://youtu.be/ZqN1wzWIFbw\r\n\r\nThis ice cream is  a custard styled ice cream - so @Freshepies   quick custard  base  ( LB ice cream and FLV pudding)   works ideally here. \r\nThe only condensed milk I have  had any luck with is PUR - it just really works  and worth picking up  and helps fill in the middle  of this mix \r\nFor the Coffee I wanted a darker roast that would hold up to all the creams  and  WF brazillian  can do that   -   the Coffee liquor  leans more to  a coffee sryup and  blends into the ice cream  base.  (Off the shake the coffee will be light but WF brazillian coffee  tends to grow   -  so wait a week before you decided to tweak this mix to you preference)    \r\nCardamon is used more in the middle east  with coffee but  a couple of recipes for Vietnamese coffee ice cream  I saw on line  included it,  so decided to add it and I really like some of the contrast it providers to the darker coffee notes \r\n\r\nOPTION: ADD WS 23  and sweetner to your taste - I wanted a touch more sweetener,  as  this   leaned a bit on the savory side without it to me .  I like a a little bit of cinnamon in my coffee - but not every one does  so add  the cinnamon brown sugar if it is your thing \r\n",
