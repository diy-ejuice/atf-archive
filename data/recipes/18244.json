  "description": "Pull on your yoga pants and sidle up to this delicious pumpkin spice latte! HS Pumpkin Pie is a concentrate I haven't seen many people work with at all, so I bought it on a whim to try it out for this recipe and it turns out it was perfect! Don't be alarmed by the 10%; it's a very mellow flavor and not overwhelming at this concentration. There is a tiny bit of spice to it but not enough to recreate the PSL flavor in and of itself, so our friends Holiday Spice and Ceylon are along for the ride to give us the essential cinnamon, clove and nutmeg notes. Sweet Cream and Cream Fresh make up the full-bodiedness of steamed whole milk, Vanilla Classic sweetens the mix without going overboard, and Dark Bean speaks for itself. :v",

      "text": "Having let this steep for a week, the pumpkin rind/popcornish heavily calms down, leaving behind a pleasant pumpkin flavor. In addition, the coffee nicely integrates with the creams, making a solid latte flavor. The one major flaw I see in this recipe isn't even in the recipe itself, but the naming; this just doesn't taste like Pumpkin Spice to me. Now, I've never used HS Pumpkin Pie before, so it's possible I've gotten a faulty batch, didn't shake enough before adding, et cetera, and the issue is entirely on my end. I don't think this is a bad recipe, and I'm not going to dock it stars for, to me, not tasting like the name. All the same, I feel like I shouldn't fail to mention that the name on the tin isn't quite what you'll be getting."
