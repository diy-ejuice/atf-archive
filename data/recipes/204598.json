    "description": "Really rich, thick, smooth coconut cream. \r\n\r\nI\u2019ve been trying to make a coconut cream on and off for a while, but the results just didn\u2019t match exactly what I had envisioned. This came out exactly how I\u2019d hoped. \r\n\r\nThe MB Palm Coconut and FLV Sweet Coconut make a lovely combo. I love CC Devon Cream. I\u2019ve found if you want to use it as a main cream note it\u2019s got to be cranked up a bit. \r\n\r\nI borrowed a couple of elements I really liked from Leche De Coco by hashslingingslashur. TFA CCGC adds to the richness of the cream and adds to the almost grated texture the Palm Coconut has. The FA Fresh Cream stops it being too dark. \r\n\r\nIt\u2019s best after 7 days steep for the richness and thickness of the cream to develop and the coconut to really blend in. ",
