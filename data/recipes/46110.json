I am a huge huge fan of Largo's Lament, and I am now torn on which one I like better. Largo's Lament has an amazing addition of white chocolate which I really enjoyed, but this is the perfect key lime recipe. At the end of the day, I have to give it to largo milk just for the fact that it reaches full potential in about half the time that Largo's Lament does!"

Refreshing yet creamy and smooth just like a bite of the real thing. I waited for it to steep and regret not making a bigger bottle right away. Fantastic. 10/10 would recommend"

Alot of ingredients and I mixed it as directed.  Don't know if I can pick out what everything is doing but all I can say its down right delicious.  It's been 7 hours and my tester is empty.  That just doesn't happen very often.  5 Stars not cuz its \"decent\" and could use this or that... 5 Stars means its getting mixed in the biggest bottle I have because it's perfect as is .  5 stars because its a no brainer ADV, and SHAKE AND VAPE Certified.  If your like me and a hard sell on fruity profiles, mix it now.    Lime....    really?    Hey honey, I like lime!!"

      "text": "Excellent work on this recipe!  The description says that it's \"heavy on the cream,\" and that's not false; but that richness cuts through the key lime beautifully to create a nice, balanced vape with just a hint of graham cracker mixing in with the bitterness of the key lime.  Delicious, and the recipe I always reach for when I need a fix of this type of profile."

I'll try to pop back with more notes when / if I get to the 5 day mark. Or (more likely) when I come back to my second bottle in a little while. Thanks for sharing! "
