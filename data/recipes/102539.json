So I'm going to measure this process by beers and who I was talking to at the time.\r\n\r\n1 Beer: Myself; Oh wow, this tastes really good. I should tell Method1.\r\n\r\n3 Beers: Method1: Oh yeah. I think Matt Wilham came up with that profile about 2 years ago.\r\n\r\n6 Beers:Me to Matt Wilhams voicemail: FUUCCKK YOU!\r\n\r\nAnd  that is story of this profile.\r\n\r\n~Fin",
