  "description": "6 months ago I tried to nail a profile for my cousin of Chocolate Covered Strawberrys. Could never quite get it to work, trying lots of different combos. With the new INW Milk Chocolate hype and the Chocolate Milkshake recipe I decided to give it another whack. (This would be sort of a mashup of Chocolate Milkshakes! and a smidge of inspiration from Milk was a Rad Choice which is on this VERY SITE! (and if I knew how to link it here I would...) \r\n\r\nMy test was 30/70 and steeped for 5 days was the best.\r\n\r\nFlipped to done. I considered messing with the chocolate but nah, this is good and I'm calling it!\r\n\r\nInput welcome, this is definitely the best I've gotten so far on this profile.",
