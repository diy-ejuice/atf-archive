  "description": "*Chartreuse: A shade of colour; a pale apple-green.*\r\n\r\nNormally I try to avoid making mixing random fruits, it's really tough to get the balance right and usually ends up a big mess. This recipe however started out as a request by a friend of mine, who really liked a specific commercial juice. Since the name of it was very nondescript and I hadn't actually tried it myself, I only had his description and the pictures to go on. The fruits that we could spot were; Pineapple, Melon and Dragonfruit. There was also grapes on some of the pictures, but since I can't stand INW Grape it was quickly ruled out. However when I did a first attempt on only mixing CAP Golden Pineapple (replaced by INW in the final version) with FLV Wild Melon and TFA Dragonfruit, I knew I had a really good base to work with.\r\n\r\nI made a total of 9 different versions before I settled on this specific combo, which I really enjoy. It's very sweet and I don't think you can distinguish any of the specific flavours, hence the rather wierd name, it simply tastes like \"Chartreuse\" ;). The final mix doesn't taste at all like the juice we based the idea off, but I'm still really happy with the end result.\r\n\r\nIf you want some more details on the different versions, please check out the reddit post.\r\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/jkm5hi/chartreuse_a_sweet_and_wierd_fruit_medley/",

      "text": "This recipe is indeed a weird one. I mean, it tastes great, it's thick and smooth and has a great mouthfeel and all good stuff; but it's not really fruity, it's not citrusy or tropical. It kind of has a bubblegum thing going on, but that's probably due to the wild melon in it.  That flavor always tastes like that to me. That is the only flavor I would be able to pick up on in this recipe. I'd never guess there was apple, pineapple and dragonfruit in it. Tasty as hell, but very weird. But I guess that's what you were going for here. Mission accomplished. Thanks for sharing!"
