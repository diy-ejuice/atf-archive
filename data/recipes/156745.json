  "description": "Something sweet for 4th of July. \r\n\r\nWhen i first started mixing I always wanted to make a bomb pop vape, tried a few different recipes already created. But never really thought they were good. After trying Fw Jawbreaker in the Hold Fast Jaws clone by C6-R, I decided it was a good candy and would fill in some body of the vape. Boom has always tasted ok but never struck me as a stand alone flavor. All the other flavors are to boost the aspect of Bomb Pop.\r\nSweeten to taste(its a candy, its supposed to be sweet).",
