  "description": "This recipe is so simple but so delicious \r\nDFS Cafe Napoleon  is a nice very light sweet caramel cappuccino flavor that Is so unique when mixed with creams and tobaccos and Vanillas. Here it comes through perfectly at 4%.\r\nRy4 Double TFA : This flavor brings that nice Smoky caramel flavor with just a hint of tobacco and some great sweetness that can make any sweet tobacco recipes shine. \r\nDFS Holy Vanilla: this flavor is a must have in your arsenal of flavors. Especially if you like a full bodied Vanilla. This flavor has a distinct Rich sweet vanilla flavor that makes the palette salivate. This simple recipe is awesome mixed together. You will be coming back for more and more. \r\n\r\nGood as SNV best after a full 7 day steep to really bring the flavors together to create unison. \r\n",
