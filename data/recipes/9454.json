      "text": "This recipe has performed a miracle: It has made a banana juicy. I mean, squeeze a banana. Put a banana in blender. Fucking take a hydraulic press to the damn thing. No juice, just baby food. But this has made possible the impossibility of biting into a banana that gushes so much banana juice it runs down my face. Like being transported into another dimension where bananas are as juicy as watermelons. That's as wonderful as it is weird. Thanks Philosaphucker for a recipe that will have a regular spot in my rotation!  "
