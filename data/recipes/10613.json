I thought it seemed ham fisted but somehow it works. Why is there 1% TPA VBIC? I don't know but it just works. I'd be  interested to see how FA Liquid Amber would affect the mix. Great job."

It was one of the first profiles that really hooked me when I started vaping and nothing has changed. /u/ID10-T 's recipe is absolutely delicious, and I'm glad I finally got around to mixing it. Not everybody like's the taste of Dragonfruit, but man it really makes Apple/Cinnamon Combo's sing, and this recipe is no different. It's sitting in my U-Well Fancier right now and I can't get enough of it."

Gone in 2 days.&#xD;\nI Mixed another 100ml straight away. Can't wait for it to be done steeping. :D&#xD;\n&#xD;\nThis juice really needs time to come together, give it that time and it will blow your tastebuds. So, so, so good. Thank you for sharing!"
