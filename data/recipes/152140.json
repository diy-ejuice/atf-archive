I am a big fan of this flavor that I believe is very under rated. Damn, I could just mix this with fruit circles and a bit of sweetener and be happy enough.\r\n\r\n**Body**:  CAP Silverline Fruit Circles- a relatively weaker flavor requiring some support.\r\n\r\n**Supporting flavors**: FW Fruit rings with the lovely WF Lemon Orange Rice Candy that brings some soft orange notes to the loops.\r\n\r\n**Icing** : FLV Frosting provides minimal vanilla compared to other frostings.\r\n\r\n Tested on RDA 0.28 Ohms, 55Watts",

      "text": "#ReturnTheFlavour - The texture and flavour is 100% on point for me. I can't see how I would improve this. The use of WF Glazed donut &amp; FW Yellow cake, although it appears low it tied in with the FA Metaphor to give a subtly to the bakery here. The FA Metaphor Kinda bridges the bakery to the other elements here really well and no doubts assists the FLV Frosting which helps to contrast with that lovely vanilla icing. That icing sits right in there with a wonderful use of Fruit Circles where WF Lemon Orange Rice Candy is used as like a booster to that edge of sweetness to the fruit loop. I can't ever normally say I have had or enjoyed a perfect recipe but this one I think is as perfect a recipe as one could get on a profile like this IMO. Nice work Luke!! "
