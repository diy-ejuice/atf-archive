  "description": "This is a simple Vanilla Bean Ice Cream base. I used Wayne's ice cream base he posted and added caramel. By adding LA Caramel, it gives a heavier richness to the VBIC. I think you could pair just about any fruit with this base. I am very new to mixing and would appreciate any critiques of this base.  Most of my recipes  are mixed at maxVG.",
