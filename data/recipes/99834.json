    "description": "This recipe has been my white whale my entire mixing life. I have always tried for that perfect cheesecake and have failed everytime. I've tried cherries,blueberries,strawberries and even black currant. I  believe that this recipe is my harpoon,that I shot right in the heart of this mammoth of a beast. 1st I used a common cheesecake stone CAP NY Cheesecake and Cap Vanilla CustardI utilized the FA Meringue as a bridge for the creams and Almond, to add a little more texture. Of course the TFA Graham Cracker Clear it the crust. The CAP Caramel adds a sweet and buttery taste. Cap Super Sweet self explanatory.",

This cheesecake is definitely different from the one's I've tried and not in a bad way. The use of CAP Caramel V1 to add that bit of buttery texture at the end has been very nice, and CAP NY Cheesecake\/Cap Custard v1 always taste great after a long steep. Personally I can't really detect the Graham Cracker Clear in this but maybe that's because I let it steep too long and the creams took over. Nonetheless this is a worthy edition to your mix list if you like cheesecake."
