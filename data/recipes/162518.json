  "description": "Y'all love banana custards.\r\nHow about a legit banana cream pie??\r\n\r\nFlavor notes:\r\nFor the base of this Pie i wanted a Graham Cracker pie crust. WF Flapper Pie makes a great base for a custard pie, at 3% it adds to the crust, custard filling and whipped topping. FW graham cracker at 3% keeps it present but not overtly so, and is an amazingly perfect graham cracker note. TPA cheesecake (graham crust) at 1.5% to fill blend the crust and custard. Tpa brown sugar at .5% was used as well to darken and sweeten the crust!\r\nFor the Banana Custard layer i went with what i had. CAP Banana has a really good artificial banana flavor and used low at 1% along with TFA Banana Cream at 3%, it makes what i think of when i think \"banana pudding\" as far as the banana taste goes. Artificial. FLV Vanilla Pudding at 1.5% and FA Custard Premium at 1.5% round out the filling very nicely.\r\n\r\nFA Marshmallow Vanilla at .75% along with TPA Whipped Cream at 2% both help add to the whipped topping as well as the custard inside.\r\n\r\nI vaped this off the shake with (1.5 cap banana 2.5 tpa banana cream) and the banana was a little sharp. Readjusted and this is vapeable after a day but gove it time and it will only bloom.\r\n\r\nI added .75% FLV sweetener (sucralose) to this, you can add sweetener to your own descretion!\r\n\r\nIf you like what i make please leave feedback!\r\n\r\nWe are all always learning :)",
