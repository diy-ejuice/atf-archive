    "description": "This is a delicious sweet cinnamon cheesecake chunk ice cream with strawberry syrup. \r\n\r\nThe cream. \r\n\r\nFW vanilla bean ice cream. \r\nThis is here for its full body and delicious texture. \r\nNot too heavy in the vanilla like cap. And not dry and airy like tpa. \r\n\r\nCC Devon cream. \r\nThis is here to add mouthfeel and eggyness to the creation base. \r\n\r\nFlv cream. \r\nHere to add fresh heavy cream flavor and tame the Flv rich cinnamon. \r\n\r\nTPA cheesecake Graham Crust. \r\nSweetens and adds a subtle complexity to the vape \r\nThe Graham Crust helps separate the creams and chunks. Caps NYCK is superior, but gets lost easily in this mix. \r\n\r\nFA meringue (pronounced MUR-ANG) \r\nThis adds depth and body. Finishing off the rich ice cream notes needed.. \r\n\r\nThe cinnamon. \r\n\r\nFlv rich cinnamon. \r\nNothing much needs to be said here. It's the main note of the recipe and is the lowest percentage ingredient... \r\nYou can hit this up to 0.15% if you're feeling dangerous.... \r\n\r\nStrawberry syrup \r\n\r\nCap Sweet strawberry. \r\nNot much to say here. Sweet, simple and delicious. This doesn't need any help holding it's own in this mix. And at 6% it keeps its robust flavor after curing. \r\n\r\nCap super sweet. \r\nThis help finish off the recipe and allows the sweet strawberry to maintain flavor over time. \r\n\r\n\r\n",

I had to purchase the flavor so it was a great reason to get even more flavors. I'm so glad I mixed this up! It's creamy, has nice texture, the strawberry is nice and sweet, and the cinnamon fills out the recipe perfectly. It's been 5 days since I mixed it up, and it just keeps getting better and better. Great job  on this! The lingering smell from the vapor is heavenly."
