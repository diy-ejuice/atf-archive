    "description": "Created several of these 6\/6 combos to learn more about CAP New York Cheesecake but this one is really delicious all on its own. I've been searching for the perfect Mother's Milk or Unicorn Milk clone for a couple years and this beats them all to me as a strawberry ADV. It's strong, sweet, flavorful and plain delicious. \r\n\r\nBest after a one month steep.",
