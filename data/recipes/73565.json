  "description": "Floral, citrus, fruity. These are the notes you can find in many IPAs. This is a mix I created to pair, and enjoy with my favorite IPAs.\r\nIn culinary, pairing isn't to create exact profiles. Instead it's to focus on complementing each element to bring something else out. I didn't want a juice that taste like a bitter pine tree. I wanted something to bring contrast, and depth.\r\n\r\nHoneysuckle- sweet and floral\r\nDragonfruit- lays into the citrus\r\nPear- fruity and juicy\r\nLemon Sicily & Juicy Lemon- tart and refreshing\r\nCactus & Sweet Tangerine- cuts through the hops. Forward, sharp, strong and bright\r\n",

      "text": "This is interesting. I get only a very light taste on the inhale, almost nothing there, just a hint of pear. Just the lightest sting of citrus. The exhale, however is chock full of flavor. Juicy and sweet, there's definitive tangerine and lemon, a hint of that musky sweetness that says dragonfruit to me, and the slightest hint of pear, wrapped in honeysuckle.&#xD;\n&#xD;\nPaired it with an IPA at my favorite watering hole. Yup, still hate IPA, but the same flavors cut through and made it barely tolerable. So, bagged a hard cider and *what* a difference. The pear bonded with the apple, the citrus bloomed, and the honeysuckle sweetened everything. Total seal of approval.&#xD;\n&#xD;\nThis one's for fans of florals, honeysuckle, interesting light vapes, or people looking to pair something up with beer or cider.&#xD;\n&#xD;\nBanger, man. Really dig it on its own, but yeah, it DOES do what it says on the tin, and go good with beer. Nice one!"
