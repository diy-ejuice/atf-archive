  "description": "I've been vaping this all week . . . it was great off the shake and remains great and unchanged 5 days later.  I'm an educator, so, coming off the break, I needed something for the ride to and from school.  I had not had much time to try some of these new flavors and just went for it.  I'm extremely pleased with how this has come out . . . smooth, thick, rich, sweet vanilla custard.  This is a new take on an old classic . . . fluffy custards, buttery bakery notes, creamy cheesecake, and extra vanilla.  I'm mixing up another 30 of this for the coming week!  If you mix it . . . I hope you enjoy it!!!",
