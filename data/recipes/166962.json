  "description": "I was inspired by Grimm Green beer tasting to create an eliquid based on the profile of the beer he tasted on the VLOG . I really enjoy this but the yakima hops may not be for every one - I find it really unique and interesting and the pairing of guava and yakima hops is perfect for me.\r\nTested on a reload  RDA on a .17 alien at 70 watts  \r\n\r\nOn the inhale you get the bright guava and pineapple that transitions to the hops and sweet gauva. It is sweet and juicy and just works\r\n\r\nSugar loaf pineapple is my Swiss army knife of pineapples it is ripe sweet and juicy and had a great body . it is not really a top note pineapple though and does sit a bit in the middle\r\n\r\npink guava provides a nice almost bitter tart bite to this mix that comes out at the finish\r\n\r\nSweet guava adds body and sweetness and creates the base for this mix\r\nFizz pop provides a life to some of the top notes\r\n\r\nHops add that sweet bitter note at the finish\r\nAdd sweeter to you likening",
