I don't really know what that means, I just had to write something to make this public.\r\n\r\nIf you have the ingredients, mix it up and give it a try, it's shake and vape certified, and yes, the TFA Pineapple will make it cloudy.

It has a nice body to it without being any bit of harsh.  I love that its quick to mix up too! I have to order cherimoya now and will be vaping this stuff often.  SNV no doubt!  Mix it up!!  You wont regret it!"
