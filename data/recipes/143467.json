    "description": "I enjoyed this on a single coil SST 0.25ohm at 60w on a Recurve RDA. \r\n\r\nWelcome to possibly my most left of field type of profile I have ever created.\r\nThanks to the numerous mentions of many flavours found in this recipe to Concrete river. He has created enough intrigue for me to at least try these flavours. However as usual I like challenging myself to take things up a level and see how I can use these in a recipe effectively. I am really glad I did because I think I have found a really pleasant fruity IPA beer like stone with the combination of FA Liquid Amber, FLV GInger Peach, VT Bitters  & Yakima Hops.  I wanted to add something a little refreshing to this so hence I added some Apple Cider, Cherimoya, Persian Lime & Mixed Mint. These additions  bring some depth of fruity contrast to this as the lime cuts through with the fresh notes from the mint. There was NO layering going on here! This was  purely a blend and learning what and how each flavour played together till I came up with something intriguing yet enjoyable. However I don't wish to understate this recipe or be pretentious, IMO its enjoyable!! \r\nTell me what you think & regardless just enjoy mixing something you enjoy!!!  \r\n\r\nLet me know your thoughts and most of all just enjoy mixing ?
