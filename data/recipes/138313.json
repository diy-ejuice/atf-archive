  "description": "So many yummy Mango's available in the DIY scene now.  I have many favorites, and favorite combos.  I find which Mango works the best depends on the profile you are creating.  \r\nFor this recipe, I used **FLV Mango**, definitely one of my favorite, for a realistic mouth feel mango.  Paired with this, is **WF SC Island Mango**, which is very sweet and tangy, similar to a citrus note, which is a note I was aiming for in this recipe along with a mango, so they paired together very well.  \r\n**VT Forest Mixed Berries** is one of my favorite mixed berry concentrates. And added to this is a touch of lime using **WF SC Lime**.\r\nTo create the smoothie, I used my favorite greek yogurt **FLV Greek Yogurt** and **OOO Creamy Milky Undertone**  \r\nThis creates a delicious creamy Mango forward smoothie.  Mixed Berry taste on the back end of vape.  \r\nFeel free to add sweetener to your liking.\r\nEnjoy.   \r\nThis is delicious off the shake; however, better after 3 days.  ",
