Mix this one up...\r\nIf you try it, I'd love comments or reviews. Thanks!\r\n\r\nThis recipe was tested and designed on the Haku single Clapton at .54ohms at 50W@s2k on ELR ",

I'm usually disappointed with Apple recipes because I find them too potent and sharp tasting, quickly losing my interest. I decided to take a chance and I mixed it exactly as listed. This blew me away! Right off the shake I realized it was exactly the pure and simple Apple flavour I was looking for! The combo of Double Apple and Two Apples is a winner! It's been 3 days now and it's only getting better. This one is going into my ADV vault. Great work."
