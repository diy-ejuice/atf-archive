    "description": "So, I had some help from a buddy of mine when I first started mixing to create this recipie. And I was only mixing for a few months before I came up with this. When I released it on all the flavors a while back its just how I created it back then. \r\n\r\nI mixed it a couple weeks ago and it was terrible. Not as in gross but just way to much of everything. I messed around with it and cut the percentagesame way down. So try if you like. \r\n\r\nIf you get just a dry soilish flavor add TFA sweetener at 1% or CAP Super Sweet at 1 drop per 10 ml. \r\n\r\nThe only reports of that I've gotten are from people who are used to shelf e-liquid, once sweetness is added they liked it alot more. \r\n\r\nBut yeah. This was my very first recipe and I'm glad I could cut it back to make it enjoyable again.\r\n\r\n",
