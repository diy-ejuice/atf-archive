  "description": "This is just one of my mixing ideas that turned out really yummy.  Looking for ideas to use HS Ginger (I love ginger), I came across [this culinary recipe](http://gnowfglins.com/2017/04/03/blackberry-ginger-peach-thm-e-rice-pudding/), which piqued my interest.  So I decided to make it into a vape. I went with an ice cream instead of a yogurt or rice pudding, mostly because this ice cream base, which I stole from Vurve, is easy and delicious and doesn't need a long steep.\r\n\r\nThis is a good ratio of FA Peach to FA White Peach for what I wanted to do.  HS Ginger, I've found, does a good job of toning down the floral (perfume-y?) notes in berries.  This amount of Ginger is necessary to taste it in this mix and it is really just a compliment.  As it sits, the whole thing really blends together nicely, no flavor is too distinct. \r\n\r\nLet me know what you think. Give it a day to steep.  Also, if you like sweetener like I do, 0.5% CAP Super Sweet hits the spot ",
