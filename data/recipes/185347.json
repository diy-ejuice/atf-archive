  "description": "Releasing this so that people pay more attention to FA Mango indian special because it is one of if not the best mango flavors out.  When you add flv mango with it it becomes a complex deep mango flavor that will blow you away.  The inw pineapple is used to add juiciness and sugarloaf pineapple is there because I love it. Anytime I am using pineapple I throw sweet coconut in because they work well together. Go get mango indian special trust me.",
