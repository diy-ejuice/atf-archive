  "name": "Torrone Cheesecake aka Hazelnut Cream in Disguise",
  "description": "This is a very simple mix, 3 ingredients and sweetener.\r\nFA Torrone is my favorite Hazelnut flavor as it transports a bit of a roasted smell throughout the mix.\r\nTo keep it creamy i added FLV Whipped Cream which isn't heavy on the vanilla note and Yes, We Cheesecake provides just the right cheesecake note to keep everything together.\r\nUsually i vape with less than 1% sweetener, but here i tried it lower and it was missing a bit of punch in the vape so i upped it to 1% and i like it.\r\nPlease adjust you sweetener level as you like it...",
