  "description": "This mix was inspired by a lovely B&BW candle. Main notes were cherry bourbon (I used cherry blossom because most cherry flavors taste like medicine to me), Chestnut, Pistachio (made a version with pistachio added and my dad and I both preferred it without) and sweet cream. I didn't want to add sweet cream because I'm not a big fan of that flavor but I did want to add that sweetness that I smell with the candle. I added CAP Sugar cookie and it was perfect. This is a nice and unique mixture. Everyone that I've had tried it has liked it. \r\n\r\n\r\n**I mix low so you may need to increase my percentages anywhere from 50-100% (double)",
