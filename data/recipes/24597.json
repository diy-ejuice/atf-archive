  "description": "Happy New Year.... since we're all squeaking out last minute recipes, here's something that I was working on for the beginner blending competition.\r\n\r\nGot rid of the banana because it just didn't fit the profile. Milk and honey and Bavarian cream come together to sweeten and give a little body to the rest of the recipe. \r\n\r\nSoho and tobacco come together for a fantastic cigar flavor. The addition of FLV peanut butter gives this recipe and almost cigarette flavor.\r\n\r\nThat little bit of whiskey finishes off the profile what is New Year's Eve without a little alcohol. \r\n\r\nParty hard my friends hope you enjoy.",
