The dark chocolate &amp; mild yeastiness of the Chocolate Deutsch  marries nicely together with buttery JF Biscuit; helped along with a touch of AP.  Although Chocolate Deutsch has a strong coconut flavor on it's own, I do not taste it in this recipe. Combined, these flavors make for a very tasty, well bodied, and refreshing vape. Wonderful job. "

This flavor profile is not something I would normally look to vape but between Id10t and fresh03 continuously swearing how good this was I was curious. So I placed an order for the chocolate Deutsch,  and creme de menthes. After receiving the flavors I mixed this and steeped for a week. I get a very taste Andes mint cookie. Great jod shyndo."

The combination of biscuit and AP really boost the Chocolate Deutsch and sell me that it's an Oreo cookie. The balance between the creme de menthes and CCI work perfect here. I'll have to pick up that Devon Cream to see what that brings to the table. Good job and thanks for sharing shyndo!"

I have to say, I definitely wasn't disappointed, and I will be mixing this very often and in large quantities. Everything here is balanced pretty much perfectly, and you get a pleasant chocolate bakery without any of the weird off notes commonly associated with chocolates in vaping. If this profile interests you at all, just go for it- you'll almost certainly enjoy it."

I got it steeping but brilliant use of the Creme de Menthe's and I can see it working now due to the fact that they are the only two worth using but different also so I'm curious if I can pick up the .2 FLV but with it being a strong flavor I bet it adds an a perfect background mint/chocolate note. There's a reason you're one of if not the very top of the food chain :-) This has given me inspiration to double down on the creme de menthe's which opens up a whole new pandoras box with so many iterations."

I love the buttery cookie right on top and then the deep, creamy chocolate mint. I can't get enough of it and could drink this! Planning to save some for a little steep because I'm a cream whore and would like the cream to come out just a bit more more but not entirely sure I'll succeed at staying out of it. "

And i have to say while i can vape Cuprian only on the hot summer days...this will fill the spot from fall over winter to spring. The chocolate mint part comes similar to Cuprian imo but the cookie is what gives this one a more depth and fills my need for something deeper on cold days. On the other hand with like 2 drops of WS-23 its also viable to vape this on the hottest days. Thank you 1000 times Shyndo for bringing this recipe to me, releasing the recipe for everyone and just beeing an awesome mixer. Im glad i dont have none of those concentrates so i will keep supporting you by buying the One Shot from chefs"
