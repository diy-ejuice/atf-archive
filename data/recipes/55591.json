    "description": "Peek-in Pie, my take on a home-made pecan pie! Who doesn't love that thick, sugary, syrup-like center of a freshly baked, toasted pecan pie with a moist sugary crust? Well, that's what I've tried to recreate. \r\nINW Biscuit and CAP Sugar Cookie. These percentages are my goto for a dense sugary, almost, graham cracker-like crust without using graham cracker.\r\nFW Butter Pecan and FLV Milk & Honey pair well together as the silky sweet center of the pecan pie. FW Butter Pecan has a slight nut shell bitterness and the FLV Milk & Honey tones this down a bit and adds a touch of balance to the mix.\r\nCAP Super Sweet is there to give it an extra boost of sweetness. You can mix this without it but,  I have a massive sweet tooth and I enjoy it this way.\r\nThis recipe represents the type of recipes I enjoy. I love creating recipes that simulate real-life recipes we all enjoy. I also try to use as few flavorings as I can. I've learned the more flavorings you use, the more muted the recipe becomes. And also, I try to use flavorings that most mixers have in their inventories so they don't have to purchase more flavorings they may not use very much; \"Recipes for the Masses\". \r\nSteep time is around 5 days but can be a shake and vape if you just can't wait.

Enjoy :)\r\n",

For my palate, that made a great recipe even more mouth watering.  much thanks folkart, Id not have thought about the addition of milk &amp; honey"
