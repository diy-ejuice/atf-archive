  "description": "This is my favourite juice that I have made so far.\r\n\r\nIt’s simple. It’s easy. It’s pretty sweet.\r\n\r\n(TPA) grape juice and (TPA) grape candy go well together to make a fairly synthetic/candy grape flavour. (CAP) jelly candy assists with this. I don’t really know what to say about (TPA) black currant... I suppose it’s kind of like Ribena and helps to round the flavour off nicely, I think. You can take or leave the koolada. That’s really a personal choice. It doesn’t alter the flavour profile, but I think it helps to make the whole thing pop.\r\n\r\nYou could use this as a shake and vape... I do. But I also usually make a second (bigger) batch to let it steep. I don’t usually touch that bottle until about 2 weeks.\r\n\r\nMix this one up, you will not regret it. As always, enjoy, and let me know how you feel about it. \r\n\r\nPeace ✌️ ",
