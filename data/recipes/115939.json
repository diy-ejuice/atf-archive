    "description": "This is my favourite juice that I have made so far.\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s simple. It\u2019s easy. It\u2019s pretty sweet.\r\n\r\n(TPA) grape juice and (TPA) grape candy go well together to make a fairly synthetic\/candy grape flavour. (CAP) jelly candy assists with this. I don\u2019t really know what to say about (TPA) black currant... I suppose it\u2019s kind of like Ribena and helps to round the flavour off nicely, I think. You can take or leave the koolada. That\u2019s really a personal choice. It doesn\u2019t alter the flavour profile, but I think it helps to make the whole thing pop.\r\n\r\nYou could use this as a shake and vape... I do. But I also usually make a second (bigger) batch to let it steep. I don\u2019t usually touch that bottle until about 2 weeks.\r\n\r\nMix this one up, you will not regret it. As always, enjoy, and let me know how you feel about it. \r\n\r\nPeace \u270c\ufe0f ",
