    "description": "Creamy cold peppermint vape.\r\nThis was the last recipe in a round of working with WS-23 30%. After testing the round with friends. This one was the most requested for more.\r\n\u00b7 LB White Chocolate Peppermint- This is one flavor I fell in love with after purchasing it for holiday recipes. It is very smooth with a great peppermint flavor. It finishes with a lite creamy white chocolate flavor.\r\n\u00b7 PUR Condensed Milk- Lite on sweetness and weight. Lite smooth milk flavor with no off notes. It mixes well with other milk\/cream\/chocolate\/cheesecake flavors for more depth. You can sub other condensed milks.\r\n\u00b7 PUR NY Cheesecake- Very silky smooth cheesecake with a nice graham note. I added it to give the mix more weight and a creamier taste with a bit of graham texture\/flavor. You can sub CAP NY Cheesecake at 2% but it won't be quite as smooth.\r\n\u00b7 WS-23 30%- another one I love. Blows Koolada out of the water. Cold\/frozen effect without changing the accompanying flavors.\r\n\u00b7 PUR Super Sweet- Great sweetener and is right there with CAP Super Sweet. It is a tad less sweet than CAP, but does better in cream or bakery recipes IMO. You can sub CAP Super Sweet at the same percentage or TFA Sweetener at 1%\r\nIt is great off the shake, but gets creamier after a week.",
