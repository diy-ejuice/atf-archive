  "description": "This was just a winging it type of thing. I got the New York Cheesecake a while back, but never used it. I figured I’d try to do something with it. INW Marzipan is pretty tasty, so in it went. Meringue just because. And Dark for Pipe because it’s got some of those dark fruit notes that goes really well with the Marzipan in my opinion. So this isn’t really supposed to be anything. I wasn’t shooting for a cherry cheesecake pipe or something weird like that. Just picked some flavors that I thought would work well together. ",

It is a shame that this recipe has 0 reviews so far - it is better in my opinion than others with 10+.&#xD;\n&#xD;\nThumbs up!"
