Very smooth but satisfying, not too sweet but sweet enough to keep you coming back for more.  Mix it up if your into this profile at all, its just has a uniqueness about it, im wondering if its the flavorah cream, this is the only recipe i have tried it in, certainly something intriguing going on for such a simple recipe.  Pure genius, i love it, thank you Vurve!"
