  "description": "I’ve messed around in the past with a Red Man chew flavor, but could never quite get it. It’s always involved the RF Molasses, but the rest of it was always a bit tricky. Red Man always tasted like molasses and raisins to me, so Raisin Rum started making its way in to my attempts. It’s not a straight up raisin, but the raisin that is in there is pretty good, and the rum aspect of it isn’t totally out of place in a recipe like this. While I don’t really get a whole lot of chewing tobacco from Tatanka, it does have a really nice, full mouth feel to it, which is important if you want to make it seem like your mouth is full of delicious and thick spit (have I sold you on this recipe yet?) Red Oak is here not so much because I ever got an oak taste from the chew, but I just wanted something a little earthy to go with the tobaccos, and Red Oak also has a thick sweetness to it for me. Gold for Pipe was an idea that came from @ebc88. He thinks it tastes like chewing tobacco, so I threw her in, and it came out quite nice. I was a little worried about it bringing some smokiness to this smokeless tobacco, but I think with everything else it does more for body than anything else. \r\n\r\nPack your cheek with some Kiksuya Chew today!\r\n\r\nI’d also suggest going with at least 70% VG to help with some more sweetness and body. Get thicc. \r\n\r\n@ID10-T got some dryness in the Mixers Club sample that I sent out. If you happen to also find it a bit dry, try .5% FLV Lovage. It was in earlier versions, but in attempt to trim up the number of flavors, it got axed. ",

      "text": "This Raisin Rum &amp; Molasses are in my next flavor order for sure. Many months ago when I first tasted Gold for Pipe in ID10-T’s mix I instantly thought this would go great for a chewing tobacco style vape. I played around with it, Tatanka, &amp; Native, &amp; got the tobacco itself to taste similar to what I wanted it to, but I could never get the sticky sweetness I wanted. Looks like my prayer were answered with RF Molasses &amp; FLV Raisin Rum. The TFA Red Oak is a nice touch as well adds a light woody note. Also the rum from the FLV Raisin Rum is coming through really well for me. It was kinda throwing me off at first before I read what flavors you used because I knew you made a chewing tobacco, and I wasn’t expecting a boozy note, but the more I vaped of it I could taste the raisin as well. As someone who used smokeless tobacco for 15+ years I can certainly appreciate a recipe like this. Now if you could just show me to make an unsweetened Kentucky Twist style chewing tobacco I could check that off my list as well."
