    "description": "I've been sick for over a week now, and was reading up on how INW Eucalyptus With Mint really does help sooth the throat. In Australia, our go to throat soothing lozenge has been Butter-Menthol's for the last forever. These are exactly as they sound, an icy punch with a nice soothing buttery follow up. My inspiration came at a time when I needed it most, and for me, this is spot on.\r\n\r\nThe Juice is best after a few days when the  Eucalyptus With Mint has had a chance to settle down, but I enjoy it straight off the bat. \r\nAn icy menthol blast, followed up by a buttery smooth exhale...if you're sick like me right now, give it a go.\r\n\r\nI hope you get better.\r\n\r\n*Hugs*",
