  "description": "I'm a fan of the occasional tobacco flavor every once in a while, leaning mostly towards RY4.  I ran across some information regarding the TPA Black Honey and heard some good vibes around it.\r\n\r\nI decided to pair up TPA Bavarian Cream evenly, percentage-wise, as a start and let it steep for about 3-4 weeks.  What happened was quite delicious in my opinion.  Within the public recipes available to me I've seen Black Honey as mainly an additive.  I wanted it as the top note because the honey carries well with this flavor.  Very forward in the flavor.  The Bavarian Cream, I think, is the vehicle that smooths out the ride.\r\n\r\nI added a quarter percent Super Sweet to brighten up the honey note and think it did so quite well.\r\n\r\nGive it a try and let me know what you think.  Play with it, if you wish, and give me some pointers regarding the original recipe and any tweaks you think might work well to continue refining this recipe.  Enjoy.",
