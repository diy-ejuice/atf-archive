  "name": "Banana pecan doughnut v 0.2",
  "description": "Super simple, but yet delicious banana doughnut sprinkled with buttery pecan pieces.\r\n\r\nGlazed Doughnut is the base of this recipe. As a Shake'n'Vape you won't notice much of it as it takes some time to settle in the mix.\r\nBanana Cream is a strong, candy like flavor. At first I had it at 3% which was way too much.\r\nButter Pecan fits in between the banana and the doughnut, adding some nutty flavors.\r\nFrench Vanilla is also an addition I added later on, it rounds up the whole mixture, without it something felt missing.\r\n\r\nCan be used as a SNV, good after 3 days, best at 7.",
