    "description": "I was trying to make a light fluffy white chocolate mousse on top of an Oreo cookie crumbled crust.  It really needed more time to steep though.  I would have loved to try the VT Chocolate Mousse but I have not bought that one yet.  This is fairly decent but the flavors are light by nature and hard to convey into an e-liquid.  This was my first attempt at a mousse profile.  It is hard to pull off that texture without using flavors that can potentially mute the white chocolate which is already an extremely light flavor.   I may come back and update this recipe later on after I see how it steeps.\r\n\r\n***You can add in some FLV-Sweetness to this as well if you would like it to be sweeter.***",
