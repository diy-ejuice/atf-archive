  "description": "This is the first recipe I made my own.\r\nIt has been made through my first steps in DIY. So dont be harsh at me :D\r\n\r\nThe main idea behind this recipe, is a pie which has strawberries as the main note, a crusty base with a hint of buttery biscuits (thats why I prefer INW Biscuit). Also there is a tone of caramel between the delicious Cream mixed with the Strawberries and the base of the Pie.\r\n\r\nMaybe for some people this Recipe seems a little wrong, but its taste is realy good and realy close to what I wanted to be.\r\n\r\nI will publish also a v2 of this recipe, where short of I keep the flavour result and I improve the using of the concentrates.",
