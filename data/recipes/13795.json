    "description": "Mixed for a user in the Weekly \"Suggest a Recipe for my flavors\" thread. This is an odd profile, a Creamy guava vape. It's pretty calming and smooth and a great vape if you enjoy the taste of guava. There are a few changes I would make looking back but this is the original recipe. Some changes you could implement : dropping FA Meringue (this milks the recipe up so drop it if thats not what you want), adding TFA Dragonfruit 1% (would help to bridge the fruits and make them just all around brighter), and maybe adding 0.75% of EM for those who need sweeteners.

A++, already mixing more."
