  "description": "A nice, light tobacco leaf vape. The Native has a little bite to it, but it's not too in your face. This was originally created to be a base for an aromatic blend with some fruity stuff on top, but I preferred it all by itself. If you want to play around with some toppers, just throw a little of whatever on top. I can't think of anything this wouldn't blend well with. ",

If you are looking for a first in tobacco, this one is a strong entry point. Also, native and gold can work so many other places at the same time so it's winning entry."

It compliments the earthiness and spice of the native incredibly well but also serves to sort of add some ever-so-slightly darker notes to a really authentic light and naturally sweet mix of tobaccos. Fantastic mix that I can vape for days on end."

      "text": "Solid tobacco recipe was my first time mixing with FA Oak Wood. It works well in here. Adds a nice wood note to your bacco combo. The Gold for Pipe and Native are an excellent they both remind me of chewing tobacco by themselves, but when you throw DNB on top of them it definitely makes them more of a smoking tobacco.  It is a nice mellow smooth woody tobacco vape. Excellent job as always chemmy "

      "text": "so this review isn't 100% on because I don't have INW gold. That said, this is a fantastic mix; easily my favorite tobacco blend. I have limited experience with tobacco flavors and this was a wonderful intro. DNB and Native Tobacco are a match made in heaven. Oak wood is so damn good. This is such a simple mix but its full in flavor and body. Woody, ashy, mellow, leafy; all describe this in some way. Tastes like a very fine pouch tobacco; Somewhere between a Nat Sherman and American Spirit rolling tobacco. Easy ADV and another one that I love with some wine or bourbon; basically the only alcohol I really go for. Feels really close to having alcohol and a ciggy &gt;=)"
