  "description": "As i was testing the NR Vanilla bacco, i tested it with 5% in a 5ml VG, steeped it for around 6 days, the flavor is light and delight.\r\n\r\nNR Vanilla Bacco has a light but noticeable sweet tobacco to it, paired with vanilla which is also detectable.\r\n\r\nThe flavor by its own is nice, but i noticed its a dry flavor as a standalone mix.\r\n\r\nThis is my first mix to try out, made a 25ml because i know its gonna be a good mix, due to my experience with the RY4 and Shisha Vanilla.\r\n\r\nWill let you all know the end result after two weeks and how it taste exactly. \r\n\r\nDay 2: This is a certified as SNV mix and its ADV for me. I like tobacco vapes and this an exceptional simple one. If you are a smoker or a tobacco vape lover, try it and you won't regret it and the Vanilla Bacco has a lot of mix potential folks.\r\n\r\nDay 3: The RY4 start to pop up and a nice sweet hint of caramel come to the surface, i mainly used it to sweeten up the mix and push the tobacco note up.\r\n\r\nOptional %:  You can adjust the Vanilla Bacco between 3-6 as you like.\r\n\r\nNote: No need for Sweeteners at all, unless you are over sweet lover, Plus although i said its a SNV mix, just give it a 4 to 8 hours before you start and shake it well after the mix guys.\r\n\r\nGroup test Note:\r\n\r\n                           The average vapors report back that the vanilla is so much, for me it's nice and seems balanced. But for you all mixers, you can start out with this percentages to tame down the vanilla flavor:\r\n\r\nVanilla Bacco 4-5%\r\nRY4 Double    1%\r\nShisha Vanilla 0.67% \r\n\r\nIMO those above percentages won't change the recipe taste, yet it will reduce the vanilla note a bit.\r\n\r\nKeep vapin...",
