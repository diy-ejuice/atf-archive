  "description": "So fruit loops seem to be getting popular again. This is one I've been working on for about 3 months. And it's fucking delicious. Fruit rings is important. It's much better than TFA fruit circles. I know it seems high, but it was important to keep it up front, and not letting it get drown out by the other flavors, while still letting them come through during the steep. On top of this, adding TFA berry crunch is going to give it more complexity instead of just lemon while keeping the cereal element there. Strawberry ripe is doing the same, adding a little more fruit to the mix. Metaphor was the diamond in the rough on this one. For me, fruit loops isn't just lemon. I get alot of orange out of them too. Metaphor lends that orange flavor, and the cakey notes to it help with the cereal texture. This was not the same without metaphor. And it made it perfect. The mixture of creams works great and gives it a sweet milky taste. I used FW VBIC because it is a little creamier, sweeter, and less harsh then the other 2. Sweetener is there, because, it's a sugary cereal. This doesn't put it in the too sweet category, just the perfect amount of sweetness, that really helps tame the lemon, and balances all the flavors together. This is a 2 week steep minimum and best after 3. Before that the flavor will be a bit weak, and the creams won't really come out. Hope you enjoy!",
