      "text": "So, was looking for tasty stuff I could make from things I already had, and I wanted something with dragonfruit, since I got a mess of the stuff. The name grabbed me. The picture SOLD me. Never underestimate a good logo/graphic. But I'm off track here.&#xD;\n&#xD;\nThe honeysuckle and dragonfruit meld together beautifully, with the pear bumping up the sweet and juicy nicely. A nice juicy floral sweetness that just grasps all of your attention and says \"Hi there!\" On the exhale, there's a noticeable, but still faint pinning of raspberry. I'm impressed that with as strong of a flavor INW Raspberry is that it's so soft here. It's the just right touch that had me wreck my freshly filled tank before the end of my shift. When a flavor is so damned good, you almost scorch the cotton on temperature control because it's so tasty, you have a winner.&#xD;\n&#xD;\nThis one's for floral fans, tropical fiends, people who want raspberry but are afraid of it, and fans of tasty fruity sweetness. Just mix you some, damnit. Seriously, even my one friend who always gets headaches from raspberry has been just killing this stuff. In an old school pen. Utterly an ADV, and going into my rotation as soon as i empty one of my 30ml bottles.&#xD;\n&#xD;\nYou straight killed this. Great job!"
