    "description": "This might not be the best or even great, but this is how I like my PB & Nanur Miskshake :-) \r\nI have tried a few and normally find the BP to be a bit over powering on the inhale for my taste, So if you like you PB on the lighter side, then give this one a try!!\r\n\r\nTPA Dx Peanut Butter Was the one I chose here because.... honestly its what I had available... and it worked\r\n  \r\nFor the Banana I chose TPA Banana Cream for obvious reasons, Its Awesome!! and layers in some more sweet creaminess into the mix.\r\n\r\nThe rest is basically what I would call my Milkshake base, I don't really like Graham Cracker in my Milkshake as most popular recipes do, because it tends to do what too much PB does for me too (Becomes overwhelming)\r\n\r\nSweetner, Can be left out if you like the dull and boring things in life.",
