  "description": "\r\n***5/12/2020 edit:  I added FLV Rich Cinnamon 1 drop per 30mls and this recipe just got a whole lot better***\r\nFW Palines n Cream is has always been a flavor I really enjoy vaping.   This recipe is tasty AF to me.   A lilttle bit of texture from the Cereal 27 and bit of that ripe cheese from TPA CGC lends itself nice.  FLV Cream for body and the rest add to milk things up even more and the end resulst reminds me of when the ice cream has melted and the spoon is no longer effective, and no one is watching.....  So you decide to tip the bowl and drink it straight from the source.  I enjoy this best after 5 days, but it's good to go and easily vaped after the shake.  \r\n\r\nThe correct amount of FLV Rich Cinnamon should be 1 drop per 30mls\r\n\r\n\r\n",
