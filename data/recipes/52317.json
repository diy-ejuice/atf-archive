I don't care how good your taste buds are.  No one is tasting all the individual components of a 10 ingredient recipe.  And since I have a hard time finding flavors in my inventory, its nice to pull out 3 bottles and be done.  My wife appreciates not having to help me find \"cream fresh\". Oh yeah its real good off the shake."
