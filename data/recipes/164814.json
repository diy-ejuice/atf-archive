    "description": "I suppose this is my virgin tobacco recipe since I'm giving it up for the first time. I subscribe to the less is more school of mixing and the 1-2-3 game makes it fun to do so.   Not a whole lot to figure out here though.  I've always liked TPA's Western.  I think it's underrated or at least I don't see it used very often. The Western seems \"familiar\" to me when vaped and it gives this recipe a little something dirty.  Oh yeah, FA Custard Premium is probably the best single flavor I\"ve ever tasted.  If you haven't tried, your missing out.  Nice smooth buttery, cigar like flavor. I tried it after 7 days and its pretty tatsty.  I'm sure it's only gonna get better.\r\nIf you mix it, please leave some feedback.  Always open to suggestions and shit... ",
