    "name": "Pride POG 2018 (Passion Fruit Orange Guava Juice)",
    "description": "A bright pink Hawaiian POG for Pride 2018 that packs all the tropical flavor of  guava and passion fruit but with the tang of a strong orange and the tart it was missing, brought by grapefruit.\r\n\r\nThe Hawaiian POG remix from @ENYAWREKLAW has been my ADV for many months now even though I've always missed a little tang from it. I then mixed @Dmilin recipe over on ELR. Both recipes were inspired by @Gwandrei Hawaiian POG Remix and the original by Naked, which I still haven't tried. I started mixing all these together but the recipe was still lacking in body and brightness.\r\n\r\nFA Passion Fruit: I really love the  flavor but it's sweeter than a real passion fruit, it's missing the zing of it. I like it strong, but you can take it down by 0.5% up to 1% if you need to.\r\n\r\nFW Blood Orange: a great orange that compliments CAP Juicy Orange very well because it gives it more body and compensates the watery aspect of CAP JO. The combination of both is a really tasty orange juice.\r\n\r\nCAP Grapefruit: brings the tang and tart, red flavor to the passion fruit, the guava and the orange that was missing for me in the all the Hawaiian POG recipes I've tried.\r\n\r\nThis recipe does well at higher wattages and in PODs alike. Don't be intimidated by the higher-ish level of flavorings in this recipe,  most of them have a tendency to need mixed at higher percentages.\r\n\r\nRepresentation matters in all aspects of life and in the vaping community.  I hope those of you who will mix this will enjoy vaping this POG and have a thought about social justice, equal rights, love and what it's like to be different in the world we live in, as you vape it.",

Sadly I did not have the  cap grapefruit only INW grape fruit but it worked perfectly in  this mix  ( i have ordered the cap grapefruit to see if there is a difference) .  if you enjoy  vibrant crisp clean  fruit mixes then this is for you .  Well  DONE  cheers!  "
