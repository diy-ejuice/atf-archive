  "description": "I got inspired by an eliquid that a friend of mine was freaking out about. Though that particular liquid, while good, just tasted full of sweetener, and syrup heavy flavors which turned me off to it a little bit. I mean, it still tasted pretty good but was just missing something. So, being a mixer of course, I decided to start making one for myself. One that I would want to vape anyways. The liquid was a peanut butter banana granola bar from a bear-y well known granola line of ejuice. The mix it is today, to me is  very close to a commercial style granola bar, even though there's lots of different variations of granola. When I imagine it, this is where I land personally. So, give it a mix, I promise if you enjoy banana nut type recipes, this definitely hits that mark and I can vape the hell out of this without it feeling too dark and cloying as the original. After about 5 days, the banana settles down a bit and leaves just a very tasty treat.\r\n       \r\n**TPA Banana Cream/LA Banana Cream** - Pretty self explanatory. Always a delicious combo for a nice semi-realistic banana flavor with a decent candiness that also brings along a well-rounded cream.\r\n        \r\n**CAP Cereal 27** - The perfect AP addition to any bakery flavors, also solidifies a very tasty oat note and also includes a subtle sweetness. Combined with FA Cookie it really puffs out to be pretty crunchy and sweet.\r\n            \r\n**FA Cookie** - Just a touch of extra AP and sweetness to sit up with C27 against the creams and nuttiness.\r\n\r\n**TPA Peanut Butter** - Also pretty self explanatory. Just a very true peanut butter flavor. Nutty enough to be pretty realistic and creamy enough to be delicious. It can overtake a mix pretty easily. A little goes a long way, especially being a flavor with ethyl maltol. If you use this flavor in lower amounts, it can really help some darker caramel-ish recipes with a very unique creaminess/chewiness, which can be quite useful. This is a DA/AP included flavor but TPA also has a DA/AP free version which is just as good if not better with a vibrant flavor. \r\n      \r\n**FA Nut Mix** - Simple nutty flavor. Very VERY powerful. If you use too much, this flavor can absolutely ruin an entire recipe IMO. Very similar in that way to FA Walnut though Walnut can be more forgiving. This is just an oily, nutty flavor. There's not much that can be said about it because the only time anyone would want to use this is very sparingly to back up some other nutty flavors and maybe as an accent. Not anything like peanuts, much more like almonds/walnuts maybe a little hazelnut mixed up together. Still, it's very good to add as a nutty accent. Sits very central on the palate leaving a nuttiness after the exhale. \r\n         \r\n**FLV Granola** - Now, before I added this flavor to this mix, I already had a decent granola type flavor. I took some ideas from a blueberry crumble recipe by [luadr](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/60759#olympia_an_addictive_blueberry_crumble_by_luadr). When I mixed that recipe, I could see what he was trying to accomplish (even though I was short one of the flavors, FA WoW) I tried out FA Nut Mix which really stood out as a nutty after-note and really went well with the bakeries. I loved the combination of those particular bakery flavors into a decently realistic crumble-like flavor. I used that same process with this recipe and I was pretty close getting to a granola-like note. Once I received FLV Granola however and added 1% in with this I realized....\r\nwtf did I just do? It was clearly way too much. But, once I brought it down quite a bit, that flavor really sets the bar for granola (not that there's much competition). Now, it's not perfect. There aren't many flavors that are, but used correctly and with a bit of extra help, it truly brought the mix to the next level. It wasn't so dark that it wasn't able to be lightened or \"softened\" up a bit with other blonder flavors. It also comes with a noticeable sweetness towards the end, which assisted a bit in the banana.",
