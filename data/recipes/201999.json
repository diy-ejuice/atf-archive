    "description": "Wanted to do this before now but whilst working on my Blueberry Cream Cake recipe i came to realise something, elements of it reminded me of OHW Rocketman.\r\nIm absolutley sure theyre using all FW flavours in it especially Blueberry, Yogurt and Tres Leches.\r\nNot going to lie but this is pretty spot on apart from perhaps abit of sweetner but i find FW sweet enough anyway.\r\n\r\nIf you feel this is a close as i do then leave a review guys, interested to see what you all think of this one",
