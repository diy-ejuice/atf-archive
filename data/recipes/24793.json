  "description": "This is one of my attempts to see if FLV is actually useful. And I guess it is this time. This is a Blueberry apricot vanilla muffin. The blueberry is the low note, while the apricot is the high note, and a touch of vanilla somewhere in between with a muffin finish. I was actually surprised with how much I liked this, but its still an early version.",

I can taste muffin, but like all \"muffin\" vapes, it's lacking something still.. maybe just muffin texture... I don't know.  Anyway, great flavor.  Really balances well and holds up as I have a bottle that has been steeping for a month or more and it's still good.  Good work."
