  "description": "Been working on this one a little bit. I like it enough to be my first public recipe. After trying Charlie Noble's Raspberry Ripple, I knew I needed to try my hand at it. This a pretty close to what I remember about it. \r\nThe raspberry sweet is obviously a great choice for a sweet, almost jammy raspberry, but lacked a little body. That's why I threw in the FA Berryl.\r\nThe rest is easy, just get a rich, deep, creamy vanilla ice cream. Feel free to sub out your favorite VBIC if you can't do the TPA. \r\nI feel like the white chocolate and the vanilla shisha provide a really delicious touch to the ice cream, with the shisha providing a very nice spice vanilla note on the finish.  It really does remind me of a vanilla bean ice cream with a generous swirl of raspberry puree in it.\r\nGive this one a good 5 days to come together, but as always, the longer the better. \r\nI mixed this at 70/30 vg/pg and vape exclusively out of a Hurricane 1.3 RTA and it's very flavorful.\r\nI really hope you guys dig this one. Please let me know what you all think, good or bad!",

      "text": "Nice recipe. Unfortunately I'm one of those damned black pepper tasters when it comes to TPA VBIC and WC so I had to sub those with LB VIC and FW WC instead. Let this one steep for a week and everything blends nicely. Raspberry is fairly subtle but a nice flavor, like a raspberry jam or syrup, with a nice rich ice cream base. The white chocolate goes nicely with the raspberry as I've found out in a white chocolate and raspberry kit-kat recipe I've been tinkering with. A nice little recipe to break my steady stream of chilled fruit vapes for the summer heat. Keep up the good work, look forward to more recipes."
