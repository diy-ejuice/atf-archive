  "description": "Melons and cream. The shining star in this recipe is of course the TFA Honeydew even at just over 1%. PUR and LA watermelon help to round out the melon base in the recipe to make it a more FULL and natural melon vape. LA watermelon is such a great tasting and strong watermelon aroma, alone it is more of a candied melon, so I use the PUR version here in conjunction to help soften the LA watermelon up a bit and make it more of a natural melon. FA cantaloupe is the foundation of the melons here. It just works, it seems as if its holding up the honeydew, and watermelon in a way that it is filling in any gaps and lower base notes that the other melons are lacking, giving us more of a full, wet and well rounded melon.  The whole goal of this recipe was to create a delicious melon and cream vape, using a cream note that was a little lighter and not overly heavy but not to light either. The final verdict was CAP Marshmallow as a main cream note for obvious reasons while also using FA meringue and  FA whipped cream to fill in the cream and give it a fuller mouth feel and vape experience. The cream is a lighter type of cream, which is what i was aiming for. Mix it up and feel it out. If you like it, leave a review. Thanks and enjoy!",
