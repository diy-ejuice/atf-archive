  "description": "This recipe was created for a dear friend, who loves vaping a vanilla cinnamon cookie more than anything else. I just couldn't resist and  had to add a bit of (FA) Almond to it. \r\n\r\nMy friend  just jumps right at it as a S&V. I would recommend a week tho, so the flavors can really come together. \r\n\r\nAny comments, suggestions and additions are highly appreciated. \r\nHave fun! \r\n",
