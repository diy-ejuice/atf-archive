You can put the fruit in any order and its still a great vape with the main fruit being changed.\r\n\r\nAs posted is my favorite variation however i like them all.  You can simply take for instance mix the watermelon at 2.25 the strawberry at 1.75 and the apple at 1 and it works still...just simple move the fruit flavors around in whatever order you want using these percentages and it works...hope you enjoy.\r\n\r\nOnly going to mention a few concentrates here\r\nCap Candied Watermelon -  As the name implies it is indeed a Candied sweet watermelon..i don't get any harshness from this at all..this could easily be used higher  IMO.\r\n\r\nVT Shisha Double Apple - This apple is sweet as well full of apple flavor and a tobacco note...now the tobacco note here is why i suggest the 10 day steep..as long as the apple is used in the 1% slot the tobacco note fades to almost nothing making it seem like a spice note in the background.\r\n\r\nHoly Vanilla - used here for some depth and Brightness ",
