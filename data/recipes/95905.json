  "description": "Wait a minute... wait a minute... hold the phone... I cracked the code. I found the answer that all diyers are looking for. I created the perfect recipe. We can all stop diying now because this is the recipe we were all looking for, even if you didn't know it. Mix it now while you can because as soon as Big Vapor finds out about this, they are going to shut it down. They are gonna take me out. But you know what? Even with knowing that, I am still willing to share this with you because it is just that good. I am really serious about this next statement, this recipe is simply delicious! ",
