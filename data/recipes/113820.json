    "description": "A cream-filled pastry that is unlike other cream-filled pastries.\r\nThank you @richard for the notes.\r\n\r\nThis isn't really a profiterole. More of a spongey Twinkie.\r\nDescribed as a 'Brown on the outside, half-baked on the inside pastry'\r\n\r\n*French vanilla Icecream\/Vanilla Whipped cream*\r\nThis is the inner cream, light and fluffy with a sweet vanilla end.\r\n\r\n*Yellow cake\/Cake Batter Dip* \r\nThe sponge of the bakery. Yellow cake is delicious and sweet, baked and a little greasy. The Cake batter dip, also a really good concentrate - brings the under-cooked taste to it. Swap out FW Yellow cake with JF Yellow Cake if you want to. \r\n\r\n*Custard premium*\r\nA richness bend to both the cream and the pastry. Can be substituted with another custard that's not too eggy if you aren't able to get your hands on this concentrate. INW would be my guess.\r\n\r\n*Hazelnut\/Joy*\r\nThis is to darken the pastry, add a delicious browning to it.\r\n\r\n*Pie crust*\r\nTo add the crunch on the outside. Possibly take it closer to a profiterole than a Twinkie.",
