  "description": "An authentic wet juicy and beautiful Peach that has an amazingly full mouthfeel. The Fa White Peach with Caps Juicy Peach make a lovely juicy peach stone but to take it to the next level I round the edges off with a little FA Apricot which also adds a little more moisture as does the INW Cactus.  I hope you enjoy this as much as I enjoyed creating this from these fine concentrates. \r\n\r\nSee it being made here:https://youtu.be/Yd8ch6jNYlM?t=1h15m\r\n\r\nCheck out what DIY Downunder has to offer:\r\nhttps://www.facebook.com/groups/diydownunder/\r\nhttps://discord.gg/kH4Fqbc\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCTCwb7ULyfJALQlehomZZQA\r\nhttps://www.diydownunder.com/",

Initially this one tested a little harsh, but I let it steep a couple of weeks, and it held its flavor well and mellowed out.  I recommend trying this recipe if you are looking for a peach for an AIO.   Good fruit flavor and mouth-feel even at low wattage."

The Cactus and Armenia are barely there, they just add that nice juiciness and depth.  I am loving this one!   Even with irritated lungs from seasonal issues, I had no noticeable harshness bothering my throat or lungs.  I love this stuff! "
