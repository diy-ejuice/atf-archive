  "description": "Shake and vape certified.\r\n\r\nI never really delve into the world of tropical treats and I had some flavours that I was yet to try. I was hoping for a juicy tropical punch with a bit of a creamy back end, did some research and then put this together and was surprised. It's yummy delicious.\r\n\r\nIt's a sweet juicy orange juice, subtle pineapple with hint of coconut and a slight and very faint bit of strawberry, the strawberry is admittedly a little lost, however, I don't want to remove it as I like what this is. Then on the exhale its less orange and a bit more cream. Then when you've finished your exhale, you get this faint banana around your mouth with some coconut sat at the back. All round, I like it and you might too!\r\n\r\nSUBBING - the only one I can think of is switching Red Touch for TFA Strawberry Ripe/Strawberry but maybe drop it to just 2%. I haven't tried it though and I don't really like the concept of subbing ingredients (BOOOOOOO!).\r\n\r\nSHAKE THE SHIT OUT OF YOUR CONCENTRATES BEFORE MIXING, ESPECIALLY BLOOD ORANGE.",
