  "description": "This started out as a attempt to clone Breakfast at Teleos Crunch, but honestly I always preferred Yeti Vapes Crunchy Black.  So I guess this was really trying to find a middle ground between the two juices.\r\n\r\nThis is better than both!\r\n\r\nBerry crunch is the main note obviously. I added the new TFA sweet cereal flakes to try and add some supporting cereal notes.  And the combo works quite we'll together.\r\n\r\nTFA Bavarian cream, CAP vanilla custard, FW yogurt make up the creamy milk.  FLV marshmallow vanilla (because who doesn't like some vanilla) and marshmallow support said milk.  I don't feel this combo adds any \"fluff\". I like FA marshmallow in cereal vapes because to me it tastes like the dry powdered outside part of a marshmallow.\r\n\r\nThis is not a shake and vape recipe. The first few days you cannot taste the berries in the crunch berries. But you do get the harsh scratchy crunchy pieces of cereal that tears up the roof of your mouth when eating the actual food.  After 4 to 5 days the berry comes through, the cream takes shape and smoothes everything out and is delicious.",
