  "description": "This is my orange cake for this weeks profile pic on mixin vixens. I wanted to take this opportunity to use some new wonder flavors. I love how dark and buttery this turned out and the orange compliments it nicely. Inw shisha orange is a very sticky sweet italian soda type orange that I thought would go well with the dark sweetness of the cake and used fa blood orange just to punch it up a bit with some brightness that is also deep.\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ay4CAgIMXCA&feature=youtu.be\r\n\r\nIf you like the vixens and want to support is in a fun and tasty way, check out our one shots at flavor jungle.\r\nhttps://flavorjungle.com/pages/search-results-page?q=mixing+vixens\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
