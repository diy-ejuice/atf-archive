  "description": "This is a eggnog custard pie with a graham cookie crust!!! I figured with the approaching holidays why not put out an eggnog recipe!! I made 7 different profiles and it was between this and a boozy eggnog ice cream that I enjoyed the most. I may still release the other eggnog profile I liked but for now this one takes care of my eggnog cravings. I hope you enjoy or at least get some useful ideas from this recipe.\r\n\r\nThe graham cookie crust:\r\nI used a combination of flavorah cookie and graham cracker with a little help from flavorah pastry zest. Pastry zest has a dual purpose it helps spice up the eggnog custard filling as well as the graham cookie crust. I find pastry zest likes to be used at a bit higher of a percentage for an additive ingredient like it is I think it shines in the 2% - 2.5% range here I used it at 2.5%.\r\n\r\nThe eggnog custard filling:\r\nFor this I used a combination of flavorah eggnog and inawera custard with a supporting hand from flavor art Vienna cream and a sprinkle of flavorah rich cinnamon. I made 7  different eggnog profiles while developing this recipe and I found that flv eggnog is much better in the 3% - 3.5% range when most are using it lower I think they are missing out because it is a much Fuller flavor at 3.5% and it is creamier as well and out of all seven of the profiles I ended up bringing the eggnog up to at least 3% because once I knew the difference in using this ingredient from 3% -3.5% there was no going back I had to use it at 3% - 3.5%. I used inawera custard because I wanted a creamy custard with no vanilla I only wanted the creamy custard and that's what I got at 2%. I used Vienna cream by flavor art because it is known for having eggnog like qualities at higher percentages. Now I didn't need any more eggnog flavor so I used Vienna cream at a standard 1.5% just to help conjoin the eggnog and the custard and help make them both creamier and it doesn't hurt that its an eggnog style of creaminess.\r\n\r\nSteep time: \r\nThis recipe tastes decent on day three but take my word on it just let it sit for 10- 14 days because once all the flavors conjoin together and become one this recipe really comes alive. \r\n\r\nSweetener: \r\nLike always sweeten to taste me I use flavorah sweetness anywhere from .25%-.50% in almost all my mixes. I am not putting it in the ingredient list because most of you use a different sweetener and that's fine that's what's great about diy no one can tell you how you want it!!! I used flavorah sweetness at .25% in this mix because it  doesn't need to be overly sweetened and .25% seems to be just right for my taste preference.",

Really tasty and perfect for the season.  Only knocked off 1 star b/c it didn't really have a specific taste all together... mostly got a cinnamony bakery treat, but I definitely want to vape it again.   "
