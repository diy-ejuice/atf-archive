  "name": "Pain aux Raisins for Fresh03 (Raisin Bread)",
  "description": "So today on SaturDIY'ing with fresh03 and Friends! we are celebrating Addy's retirement by doing a  Wishing Well! A wish for Mark Clough!\r\n\r\nFresh made a donation and requested a French pastry from me. I know Fresh is a breakfast pastry lover so I chose a traditional, delicious French breakfast pastry called 'pain aux raisins' or 'currant bread' in English. It's a lovely flaky pastry jammed with custard and raisins and a nice sweet sugar glaze on top. This is how we made it, with the help of @TamVapes:\r\n\r\nWF Croissant/VT Croissant/JF Biscuit = for the pastry which is strong and buttery.\r\n\r\nWF Caramel Butter = has the job of adding butter, that little browning of flaky pastry and some sweetness on top.\r\n\r\nFA Custard Premium/LB Vanilla Ice Cream/FLV Vanilla Pudding = that's Fresh's quick custard which is well eggy and vanilla reach which is what we want.\r\n\r\nFLV Raisin Rum/FLV Sweet Fig= for the raisins and the currants and that dash of rum in every custard-filled viennoiserie in France.\r\n\r\nI hope you enjoy it and Fresh too!\r\n\r\nBe Queer & vape on,\r\n\r\nC. aka Queer Your Vape\r\n\r\n[Photo credits = www.thespruceeats.com]",
