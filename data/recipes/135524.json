  "description": "Edit 5/3/20: This was made just as HHG v1 was going out of production. If you have v1, you wont be disappointed in this one. \r\n\r\nThe theme for mixer's club was Duets. I decided to take my love for Cardinal and try to see if I could get more tobacco out of it. My problem with Cardinal was always that it was just never enough tobacco flavor. So I decided to try it with Brigade 2506 by @ChemicalBurnVictim as like a peanut butter and jelly tobacco blend.\r\n\r\nThe results were strange. I first just lifted the holy holy grail ry4 and mixed it with BFP and TA CC. That wasn't working so I added back in everything on both recipes until I had a straight mash up of the two. For one tester, I just threw in some Am4a on a whim at 1%. for some reason that mix worked better than the others. The two recipes needed a bridge to pull them together and I'm guessing that the slightly creamy Am4a was able to bridge that gap between the caramelly HHG and the darker brigade flavorings. \r\n\r\nBased on feedback from @ID10-T, I experimented with the levels of Am4a to get it right. I sent him some samples to try with Am4a at 0/0.3/0.5/0.7/0.9% His feedback being that the Am4a stood out too prominently at 1.0 and I was inclined to agree. Testing at various levels we both agreed that 0.5/0.7 were indistinguishable. \r\n\r\nSo, here it is at the 11th hour as Holy Holy Grail Ry4 v1 fades into diy history... Sacrilege (Amped brigade 2506)\r\n\r\nAdditional notes:\r\n- I do like the 0.9 version as well. It leans more to that creamy bacco side than a mash-up and you can try that out too if you like more bacco and dont mind the distraction.\r\n- just want to take a moment to thank the Mixer's club for encouragement and feedback and to ID10-T for helping me to get the levels perfect and trying out some samples to nail it down.",
