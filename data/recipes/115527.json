  "description": "Tasty S&V Rootbeer Banana Custard inspired by Grimm Green & Fresh03. \r\n\r\nFLV Root Beer is an excellent Root Beer flavor used it at 3% so it would still come through over the cream but not completely over power. \r\n\r\nFLV Vanilla Pudding & LB VBIC is FRESH'S S&V Custard and it works well to bring a nice custard like base to the mix.\r\n\r\nWF Banana Puree: is a good banana flavor but has some strange off notes if pushed too high\r\n\r\nVT Banana Custard: is not a banana custard at all but it is a solid REALISTIC banana flavor.",

      "text": "It sounds bizarre but you can find recipes online for root beer and banana smoothies and root beer floats with banana ice cream, so it's a thing. A weird thing, but a thing. And this does that thing as well as it could be done, as best I can tell. There's some separation here, with both the stellar root beer top notes and as bold a creamy banana finish as you could hope for without going candy. Where they meet in the middle, there's a brief moment when it's almost chocolately, somehow, , but it's tasty so I can't find anything to complain about. Great flavor and lots of it even if it is an odd combo. "
