    "description": "A fresh citrus raspberry soda for y'alls!\r\n\r\nThanks to @EdibleMalfunction and @humanpuck from the DYI_eJuice discord, who took time to mix this up and also helped me find the missing pieces in this recipie.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n**FLV Citrus Soda & CAP Lemon Lime** acts as the soda base. I'm not sure if I'm imagining but I feel that the citrus\/sprite taste gives you somewhat of a fizzy feeling. It's also just enough % so that it gives a good contrasting flavor to the berries, without overtaking them.\r\n**INW Raspberry:** At 0.75% this flavor is amazing, just enough to get that bold sweet raspberry flavor, without becoming floral.\r\n**FLV Boysenberry:** Just a touch of this fantastic flavor is enough to give the raspberry more body and a sweet syrup-y taste that you expect a soda to have.\r\n**TFA Dragonfruit:** This works as the emulsifier, bledning all these flavors together to a unified soda.\r\n**INW Cactus** adds some wetness and complexity to the whole mix, it also helps tone down the bright citrus notes a bit. The first days you might feel a slight taste of it (not bad imo), but it will be much less over time.\r\n**WS-23** is optional, but I like my sodas COLD! Personally I use this at 1%, but I put a lower percentage so that it doesn't catch anyone by surprise, as it can be quite overwhelming if you are not used to it.",

I mixed this up without the cap lemon lime and it was still an absolutely banging summary vape.  The cactus is just enough to make the juicy and the %'s on the Rasp and Boysenberry are pretty much perfect.  I love how he got so much flavor out a low total flavoring %, well done."
