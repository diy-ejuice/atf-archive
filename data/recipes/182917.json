    "description": "So I've been waiting on some mixes to steep and was craving something tropical-ish to vape on while I wait. I've always liked Hawaiian Pog, but for some reason got an off note from the original, probably just me!! Anyhoo, this is my take on it and it came out pretty dang delicious! Awesome off the shake, and even better after a couple days...\r\nHAPPY MIXING, AND HAPPY VAPING!!!",

I think I may add some Aurora or a bit of Lime Tahity on the next mix to give it that tangy zest I desire.  Well done Soulchkn!"
