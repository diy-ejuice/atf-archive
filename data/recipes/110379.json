  "description": "             I am not big on tobacco recipes but occasionally i get an itch for a nice dessert tobacco type of recipe. I enjoy vaping tobacco's more at night for some reason so this is why i named it tobacco night's.\r\n             SO this turned out to be a rather chocolatey flavor when i didn't use any or intend for a full on chocolate vibe. I was aware of a slight chocolate type flavor from flv mocha but when its mixed with the smoked butterscotch it turns into a really chocolatey flavor and a good chocolate at that. I am curious if this combination will stand up to other flavors and  taste as much like chocolate mixed in another recipe? Milk and honey brings a creamy smoothness to the vape with a honey sweetness. Vanilla bean flv was  more or less just thrown in to add to the complexity and or because it plays well with just about everything. My tobacco's i went light but there is no denying this is a tobacco recipe through and through. I used a combination of oriental flv and tatanka flv. I am not the biggest fan of the more popular flv tobacco's. All the ones everyone uses aren't my first choices i really like oriental, Turkish, and tatanka by flavorah. Here i obviously only used oriental and tatanka  and it worked great in this situation.  Now i know i dont put out or make a lot of tobacco recipes but this one is pretty awesome and if you mix it let me know what think??? ",

It has so much flavor for a profile that is usually more muted in my experience. The flv mocha + flv smoked butterscotch combo is absolutely delicious, and it goes so well with tootalls choices of tobaccos. Love this one! "
