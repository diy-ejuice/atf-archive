    "description": "Big shoutout and thanks to @AlfredPudding (aka Malfred Puddage) for the majority of the inspiration for this mix and @Eyemakepizza for helping hammer out the percentages.\r\n\r\nThis is a slightly sour\/tart and sweetly delicious jolly rancher\/gummy type watermelon vape.\r\n\r\nCAP 27 Bears at a higher percentage to really hammer the fact that this is a Candy first and foremost\r\nThe WF Sour Watermelon Candy is one of my new favorite watermelon flavors and brings most of that melony jolly rancher taste here.\r\nThe JF Honeydew and FLV Wild Melon are tossed in to back up some of the melon notes and help you not forget that this is a straight up, punch you in the face watermelon flavor. \r\nWF Sour Gummy Candy to give it a bit more of that tart\/sour candy vibe.\r\nThe perfect watermelon vape has been my white whale for quite some time, but this is pretty close to what I\u2019ve been searching for all this time.\r\nI also added 0.25% CAP Super Sweet to give a bit of that \u201csugar lip\u201d but it\u2019s totally optional as this is plenty sweet on its own.\r\n\r\nThis is my first posted recipe on ATF and is still a work in progress, but let me know what you think so far.  Thanks!",
