  "description": "I am going to attempt to do full notes here the way the pros do it. I have been only mixing for about 5 months now so I am very new to this. And now for a disclaimer: I have never done single flavor tests. Why? Because I am lazy. And it sounds tedious. And I majored in physics and in science we use other people's hard work to support our ideas! With that said I am not afraid of a little, or a ton, of research. When I attempt to create or craft a recipe I do hours, sometimes days, of research to determine what flavors to use and at what percentages. I check flavor reviews on reddit, BCV, the ELR, etc. I look at other people's recipes and see what and how much they use, how many recipes use specific flavors, etc. I use combos of things I liked in recipes I have made and loved such as the three lemons I use here. So let's take a look at what I did with this one.\r\n\r\n CAP Juicy Lemon/FA Lemon Sicily/FW Lemon Meringue Pie: Obviously these make up the lemon part. I selected these 3 because I love @dazcole's Lemon Tart (A Dinner Lady Remix). It was one of the first recipes I ever made and it continues to stay in my regular rotation. I dropped the percentages because the lemon has to share the spotlight with the cheesecake whereas in Lemon Tart it's the star of the show. The LMP is also acting as sort of a bridge.\r\n\r\nTFA Graham Cracker Clear/INW Biscuit: The crust. Again I drew from dazcole's recipe. The crust note in that recipe is really tasty and I wanted something similar in my cheesecake.\r\n\r\nTFA Cheesecake (graham crust)/CAP NY Cheesecake: The cheesecake (duh!). Most cheesecake recipes I see use one or the other. I have used them both separately but not in cheesecake specific recipes. I feel like both have something to add but neither is enough by itself. NYCC has a nice cheese note. I wanted that but I didn't want it overly cheesy. The CC (gc) has sort of a dark, thick sweetness. Plus that extra crust note is almost always welcome. I always think my bakery recipes need more crust, dough, etc.\r\n\r\nTFA Sweetener: Cuz sugar lips! Adjust to taste of course.\r\n\r\nI gave this a full 25 days before I touched it because I haven't liked any of my recipes that use cheesecakes in them until they've had several weeks to develop. I think I have a hard time tasting cheesecake too so I wanted to make sure the lemon didn't hide the yummy cheesecake. You can probably get away with 2 or 3 weeks especially if you use less VG.\r\n\r\nThis recipe is very tasty. It is a thousand times better than any commercial cheesecake juice I've tried. It's sweet and creamy, the crust is delicious, and all the right notes are there. But something isn't quite right. It's almost like the lemon and the cheesecake hit my palate in the wrong order or need to change the position they fall on the tongue. I don't know quite how to explain it. It is tasty as is, but I will continue to work on and update the recipe because it is a tasty profile.\r\n",
