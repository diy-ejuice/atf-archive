    "description": "Holy Smoke if you love a smooth dessert tobacco. This is for you. This is made with Stixx Mixx Naturally Extracted Tobacco. Check them out @http:\/\/www.stixxmixx.com\/product\/a-blend\/\r\nN.E.T.\u2019s used:\r\nHonduran Ligero:  A great, smooth shag flavor. Lighly sweet, and very very smooth. \r\nNicaraguan Seco:  The building block of any great cigar always starts here. Mellow and smooth tobacco taste, with some nutty undertones help put this blend right on top in any cigar or pipe blend you can imagine.\r\nThese 2 N.E.T.\u2019s combined create a great boost for any RY4.   Giving thanks to @kopel for this discovery. \r\nAdditional concentrates:\r\nHoly, holy grail from DIY flavor Shack, in my opinion, is one of the best RY4\u2019s available. \r\nFW Butterscotch Ripple, this helps add that touch of butterscotch ever so creamy. \r\nFLV Smoked Butterscotch:  This gives a sweet, wood smoke flavor.  Very smooth \r\nFLV Graham Cracker:  to add a touch of texture ",

            "text": "Easily the best tobacco vape I\u2019ve ever had. Destroys recipes like Cardinal and anything involving FLV tobaccos (I do still love those FLV tobaccos though) Been vaping this for almost 3 months straight out of my Kayfun Prime. Wow what a fucking masterpiece. Delicious, even on the 3 day steep time, but I find that a couple weeks really brought out all of the buttery\/creamy notes from the NETs and the butterscotch. Seriously incredible. Side note, if you\u2019re a fan of chocolate vapes and enjoy this recipe as much as I do, plug in ID10-T\u2019s chocolate combo from raven. In my opinion, way better than the original raven. THANK YOU for this!"
