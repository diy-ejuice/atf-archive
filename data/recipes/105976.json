  "description": "6/17/18 - Mixin Vixens Show -  Our inspiration was a milkshake with what looked like toasted shaved coconut and toasted thinly sliced toasted almond.  I went for a butter pecan milkshake with a strong vanilla base, sprinkled with a topping of a caramel note that is brought in with the toasted marshmallow and butter pecan flavors, and a drizzle of chocolate that comes in at the end of the exhale and lingers a bit much like chocolate syrup does.
