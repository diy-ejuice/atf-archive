    "description": "\u270b      !!!FIRST READ THIS!!!     \u2714\r\nThis is not intended as a vape. I made this to be used as a flavor essence.\r\nSo no PG \/ VG is meant to dilute this. This will make you 10ml of Blueberry Raspberry Jam.\r\nIn Sweden it is called Queen Jam. Triple the batch and you get 30ml of it. Etc etc.\r\nI also publish three recipes including this jam. \r\nI can in no way register this as a flavor, so I will use the slot \"(TJ) Ice Queen\".\r\nAs there is practically zero use of that flavor and it has \"Queen\" in it.\r\n\r\nThe recipes I publish are these.\r\nhttps:\/\/alltheflavors.com\/recipes\/206935#queen_roll_by_wallebiela\r\nhttps:\/\/alltheflavors.com\/recipes\/206901#swedish_queen_jam_doughnut_by_wallebiela\r\nhttps:\/\/alltheflavors.com\/recipes\/206900#swedish_queen_jam_crumble_by_wallebiela\r\n\r\nThese are meant as examples of how to use this flavor.\r\nOne is mine, two are delicious bases I wanted to try it in.\r\nIf you like it, put it in your own favorite bakery, ice cream, shake or pancake.\r\nHave fun.",
