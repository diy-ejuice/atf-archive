  "description": "Moist, juicy and delicious. Ripe tropical Jackfruit and Mangosteen up front and Apricot nectar out the back. Add a splash of vanilla cream and a twist of dragon fruit to get everyone feeling friendly and you've got one hellava toe curling vape. Add 3 drops of super sweet per 30ml, it needs it and it creates it, this is supposed to be nectar of the gods, donâ€™t upset your maker.",

      "text": "Toe curling indeed! Mangosteen(FA) is a very strong flavor and completely takes over the mix. I would like to try this again but with maybe 0.5-1% Mangosteen. That aside, I still enjoyed this recipe. Anyone who is a fan of unique flavor profiles would probably enjoy this and moreso with the Mangosteen dropped a few notches to reduce that over the top piney-ness."
