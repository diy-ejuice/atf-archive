  "description": "Mixed for Mixing Vixens challenge, peach pie with ice cream.  Since it is the holiday season now, I decided to take a holiday twist on the recipe.  This is a peach pie thrown into a milkshake, as I wasn't able to get the separation that I wanted.\r\n\r\nIn the winter, my peach pies are usually made from peach pie filling canned during the summer, so I add a seasonal fresh fruit, persimmon, to the filling.  I also add warm spices to the filling.  I followed that path with this mix.  I chose the INW and Hangsen as they give me more of a cooked peach flavor.\r\n\r\nI wanted a soft, greasy pie crust, so I added JF Churro to OOO Pie Crust.  I may adjust this later, as after a 1 week steep, it is not where I want it.  It needs a little more browned crunch, and it does stand out quite enough.  If you have a suggestion, please leave a comment.\r\n\r\nI love dark sugar flavors with peach, so I used VTA Toffee Ice Cream, and to add a holiday touch, FLV Eggnog.  \r\n\r\nTested on Pixie SS 0.29 Alien @ 40 watts.  I do not recommend vaping this at low wattage.\r\n",
