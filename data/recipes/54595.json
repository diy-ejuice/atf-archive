    "description": "Check out the video on this recipe here:  https:\/\/youtu.be\/s1b-sL3Rm9g\r\n\r\nHere is one I put a good amount of time into. It's a sweet and creamy hazelnut donut. At first I was having a hell of a time getting the hazelnut where I wanted it. I wanted it to feel integrated with the donut instead of sitting on the side. After some trial and error, I found that TFA peanut butter was my answer. This made something closer to a hazelnut butter that give this recipe a feeling of a donut with hazelnut butter filling. I really can't put this one down, going to be one of my ADV from now on.",

I mixed this about a week ago and let it steep so the pb and zeppola can calm down, this turned out to be something I'll definitely be mixing a lot of. Thank you for an awesome mix!"
