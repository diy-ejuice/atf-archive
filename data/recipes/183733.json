  "description": "Y Ddraig Goch is Welsh for the Red Dragon. Ddraig goch Cwstard is literally Red Dragon Custard.\r\n\r\nTested on an Asmodus C4 Ni80 0.3 Flapton and a Profile 1.5 0.13 (60w) Mesh & 0.18 Mesh (75w) and Profile RTA 0.16 ohm Mesh.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLegend has it that centuries ago 2 ancient beasts lie beneath Dinas Emrys in Wales, locked in battle.\r\n\r\nAn ancient King tried to build a castle at Dinas Emrys in wales but this castle kept getting knocked down by unseen forces, he is told by his advisors to seek a boy with no natural father and to sacrifice him. The king finds such a boy who is also supposed to be the wisest wizard who ever lived (Merlin).\r\nThe boy upon hearing that he is to be put to death to end the demolition of the walls, is dismissive of this advice and tells the king about the 2 Dragons locked in battle beneath the foundations, the King excavates the hill freeing the dragons, One red and one white, the dragons continue their fight until the Red Dragon emerges victorious, the boy tells the King that the red dragon symbolizes the kings people and prophesies the coming of the greatest king Britain will ever see...King Arthur Pendragon.\r\nI wanted a full on thick and creamy Vanilla Custard.\r\n\r\nThis is a full on Vanilla Custard.\r\nThis was originally mixed with the OG Holy Vanilla then they discontinued it so remixed with Holy Vanilla V2 which was just as delicious. Feel free to use the OG, V2 or Reserruction at the same %'s.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Custard base us made up of FA Custard Premium, at 4% for that full thick and buttery custard, to this 6% CAP VC1 adds Vanilla and the egg notes I want from a custard.\r\n2.5% Devon Cream adds a thick dairy cream, I tried using it lower initially but it just didn't give the creaminess or mouthfeel I was seeking.\r\n\r\nHoly Vanilla v2 at 3% adds a dark, sweet spicy vanilla with it's caramel and lightly creamy notes for the ultimate Vanilla boost.\r\n\r\nEM added for a little sweetness, smooth and blend everything together\r\nAt 1% I the slight cotton candy like mouthfeel greatly enhances this profile.",
