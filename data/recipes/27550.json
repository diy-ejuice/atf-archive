  "description": "In honour of Emperor trump and his new world order I've created the ultimate grape vape . All other grape vapes are Fake but this is guaranteed to grab you by the pussy !\r\n\r\nWonder flavours sweet and sour purple is awesome but it fades quickly there's no actual sour effect that I can detect but the sweetness is perfect so I added FW grape soda to try to prolong and boost the overall purpleness ? it's ok but I felt a bit harsh so after a couple of trials I settled on oba oba to smooth out and twist the grape flavour slightly .\r\nInw cactus had to go in there because it's just  perfect with just about any fruits I've mixed and then just a tad of sweetener to again help any fading .\r\n\r\nit's better as a shake and vape but I'm still loving it a month + after originally mixing it .",
