  "description": "My take on a Hawaiian Punch.\r\n\r\nThe in initial recipe had 1% apple 3% guava and i felt that it was REALLY close but a little heavy on the guava, and i know sweet guava chills out after a day or two but i wanted a bit more apple in there and a little less guava so i adjusted.\r\n\r\nMy first adjustment bumped blood orange to 3% and it was a little too citrusy in that take so i took it back to 2.5%.\r\n\r\nLet me know what y'all think!!\r\n\r\nYou can shake n vape this but as with all things a few days really gives this a boost",
