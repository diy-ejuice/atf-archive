            "text": "Nice, not a bad or offensive recipe by any means, but tastes like it\u2019s missing something. Like it\u2019s all soft, slightly syrupy sweet base flavors that play well together, without something on top to really hook me in to wanting to vape more of it. It\u2019s like an excellent part of a recipe that\u2019s not quite finished. An easy route to something that tastes more complete would probably be something like adding just a little FA Cucumber, with that bit of green rind for more of a vegetal bite, or going the more melonious route and adding some FLV Wild Melon or something like that. And then there\u2019s the possibility of going the more creative route, more creative than I am, and going for something completely different and contrasting against this complementary mix. "

Despite the grief it's going to cause me when I finish this mix, I have to admit it's very light and sweet, and will definitely get another mix when the weather gets warmer."
