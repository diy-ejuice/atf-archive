    "name": "Vanilla Panna Cotta  with Rum infused   Dark Chocolate Syrup ",
    "description": "Dark spiced Rum and dark chocolate is  a great pairing as they share similar compounds  and really bring out the best in each other in this  trinity chocolate sauce.  \r\n**MB panna cotta** creates the base for this    with flv pudding for a light vanilla note and sweet cream to help blend these notes .  that come through on the inhale .  Panna cotta is light and smooth geletan based desert, it  not a really dense   and super creammy.     MS panna cotta does a nice job here for that , along with just a touch of FLV  pudding for  some body.  \r\n\r\n**FA Jamaica rum** adds some  rum spice notes   that sits in the middle  to the end of the vape  - bridging the pana cotta  and chocolate .\r\n\r\n**trinity for Chocolate syrup**  Lava cake at low  percent along with   VT dark chocolate  and A touch of love  is my new trinity.      they create a dark chocolate   creamy sweet syrup   that  is noticeable on the exhale \r\n\r\n**NOTES and SUBS**:  you can leave out the   VT dark chocolate and VT love but the combination add some depth  to the chocolate and a creaminess ,which  makes for a really lovely  dark chocolate sauce.   Adding a bright   sweet strawberry creates a really nice top note  in this mix.  Add sweetener  of your choice I enjoy Sweetness at  0.30%   \r\n\r\n **Learn more about mixing here:**\r\nfacebook - https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/groups\/diydownunder\/\r\nDiscord - https:\/\/discord.gg\/kH4Fqbc\r\nYoutube - https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/channel\/UCTCwb7ULyfJALQlehomZZQA\r\nwebsite -  https:\/\/www.diydownunder.com\/\r\n",
