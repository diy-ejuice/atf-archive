Paired up with the FLV really sells that baked quality and sits nicely in the back. The cream hear is thick with a light buttery note and some vanilla sprinkled in. This isn't a complex mix, it's just what it says...a blueberry cream, but it's balanced well and done right. Easily in the top 3 of the best BB cream mixes I've had. Definitely mixing this again. Great job!"
