  "description": "Slight adaptation of a clone I found on elr here http://e-liquid-recipes.com/recipe/1559375? That is pretty spot on. It's a really good sour green apple jolly rancher flavor, that I really like with a good bit of cooling. Feel free to omit the cooling for just a spot on swamp thang.\r\n\r\nIt's great on a shake and vape and pretty much no real changes to me after an overnight steep, only a tad smoother (though it is pretty smooth off the shake) due to the ethyl alcohol in tfa apple candy.",
