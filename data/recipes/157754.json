  "name": "PRIDE  (yellow) MIX:  Sweet, Sticky  Lemon Curd",
  "description": "I wanted to try and see how close  I could get to the an actually curd rather then a pudding or  custard and I think this is pretty darn close  to that sweet and sticky tart lemon curd.   I am happy with  this as it is pretty much what I had in mind. \r\nThis was mixed for the PRIDE fundraiser, for the Ali Forney center for LBGTQ homeless youth on Fresh03 channel https://youtu.be/5Xa1eZqfwK8\r\n\r\nThe Lemon Square   is pretty much full on lemon curd with alight bakery  but needs some support to help it fill out  - so this is  the base  for this mix \r\nCustard by FA is the perfect custard to bring out   some of the egg notes with a light lemon note  \r\nFe lemon, and  lemon Sicily   bring a solid realistic  lemon and a  nice  bit of lemon zest.  VT  sour lemon helps to  carry that  lemon to the finish with a bit of a  tart  note\r\nOrange  marmalade   helps to add some depth  to the lemon   with some  sweetness and sticky mouth feel \r\n27 bears  supports the sticky mouth feel that you get from a curd  ( thanks   @mlNikon  I think it worked well )   \r\nNOTE:  I added .5% of cap sweetner  to help bring  out the top notes of the lemon , and it really helps to give that super sweet  versus  a  tart contrast ,   you can also bump that   VT sour lemon  to 3% of you really want more of a tart note.    That tart note will dissipate some so this is best vaped with in the week of mixing , if you like a sour  mix/  ",
