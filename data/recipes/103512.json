  "description": "I wanted to make a mix that tasted like Brach's Maple Nut Goodies. This is a candy that my grandfather always had on hand and loved so I learned to love them as well. I think this mix comes pretty close. Mix it up and judge for yourself. If you do, please let me know how close you think I am. ",
