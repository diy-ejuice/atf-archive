    "description": "The pursuit for all day happiness in a chocolate vape is over !!! (in my opinion)\r\n\r\nI was going to do another chocolate dairy recipe but that was kinda so 2018 and when Folkart aka genius dropped Mayan Milk \r\nthere was no point. However I was fortunate enough to experience a \"Hershey's Chocolate Cream Pie\" recently so my focus changed faster than a \r\ngold fish loses its mind. With the experience in hand of working with a lot of similar concentrates over a combination of recipes of late and with the most amazing cookie concentrate in hand that I have ever used in \"Molinberry Cookie Bite\" I went to work on this profile asap.\r\n\r\nThe Chocolate Cookie base was a real feature as was the tones of the chocolate combining to bring the mouthfeel of this vape as close to what I experienced as possible. \r\n\r\nMB Cookie Bite was the starting point here and has proven to be solid with these flavours and holds up brilliantly. The texture of that home baked perfect cookie was amazing yet in this profile it needed to be tweeked a little using FLV Sweet Coconut to help me get to the authentic nnote and mouthfeel. \r\nFor the filling VT Chocolate Mousse was always going to be an obvious choice but needed come of those commercial chocolate notes and this is where\r\n Cap Double Choc. V2 was deliciously necessary. Yet it need cream & that \"cream pie\" feel. While not an obvious choice I'm glad to have taken an educated chance on INW Yes We Cheesecake to make that \"Pie Mouth Feel\" happen.  It lacked a slight creaminess and this where VT Devon Cream used sparingly offered that solution. A little super sweet IMO always plays well with Chocolate so this is one of the rare situations I felt a necessity to use it. Right off the shake  this is delectable. At 45w on a single 0.25ohm SST coil you get most of the textures of the base and flavour immediately. At 55-60w the chocolate creams shine and this becomes insanely real. This is magnificent and the only ADV chocolate I could do ever!! The best chocolate vape I have ever tasted even if I only think it's magnificent I will be beyond happy here. \"The best Chocolate recipe I have eve vaped\". If you also think so, let me know or if not let me know how I can do better so I can improve even more!\r\n\r\nMerry Christmas Everyone!! :) \r\n\r\nLearn more about mixing here:\r\nfacebook - https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/groups\/diydownunder\/\r\nDiscord - https:\/\/discord.gg\/kH4Fqbc\r\nYoutube - https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/channel\/UCTCwb7ULyfJALQlehomZZQA\r\nwebsite - https:\/\/www.diydownunder.com\/\r\n",
