Decided I needed to get back on the saddle and spotted this gem. Inawera Yes, we cheesecake is a great flavor, but the FW Yogurt is that indulgence flavor that works so well in these types of profiles. Really sets this off. Tried a second batch with WF Lemon squares and a touch of FE Lemon.  Lemon cheesecake from the Real was always my favorite industry liquid and I was pissed they moved on to the NKTR line and discontinued it. I feel Iâ€™m close enough to scratch that itch with this recipe. Great job guys. "
