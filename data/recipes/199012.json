    "description": "Profile: Creamy vanilla rice pudding with a hint of cardamom\r\n\r\nQuote @Zany: \"Unlike Traditional Chinese Medicine - This will actually make you erect!\"\r\n\r\nDevelopment:\r\n\r\nWe wanted to make a delicious rice pudding with hints of spices and vanilla without actually making it too thick and disgusting.\r\n@Zany aka. Dico and I sat down and looked over which flavors we had that would fit such a profile.\r\n\r\nThe very first version contained VT Thai Sticky Rice, FM Pistachio, VT Yoghurt Drink, FLV Vanilla Pudding and TFA Whipped Cream.\r\nTo begin with, we only had VT Thai Sticky Rice on the table for the rice base, but we kinda figured out that it wasn\u2019t enough rice so we introduced FE Sweet Rice to the mix.\r\nAt some point, we also had FM Pistachio in the mix, but the more we huffed and puffed, the more we kinda figured that it didn\u2019t really quite fit in for what we were going for.\r\nPretty early in, it was decided that FA Cardamom would maybe be an awesome addition, so it was added. It somehow didn\u2019t clash very well with VT Yoghurt drink, which also were just kinda weird, so we scrapped VT Yoghurt Drink early on.\r\nFinal addition to the line-up was FLV Sweet Coconut and it all just fell into place.\r\n\r\nConcerning the taste of this mix, it\u2019s not overly strong on the rice taste as VT Thai Sticky Rice comes with a hint of a spice note. It\u2019s there to add some depth in the mix.\r\nIn combination with some notes of vanilla, coconut, a little cream to bind it all together and a wonderful warm and round taste of cardamom as a finisher, it\u2019s a twirl of flavors that dances in your gob.\r\n\r\nPlease do let it sit for about 5 days to let it all blend in nicely together.\r\n\r\nEnjoy!\r\n\r\nThumbnail design by: @Zany",
