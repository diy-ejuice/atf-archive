  "description": "Heya, fellow mixers!  Since I started mixing, I have been trying to replicate my favorite flavor of snow cone.  In high school, my good friend turned me on to half ice-cream / half bubblegum, and it is an absolutely delicious flavor combination.  I have tried several different bubblegum concentrates, trying to find the right one.  I decided to go to the master (ID10-T), himself, for some help.  He suggested INW Bubble Gum (yc) as a good one.  I had finally found my perfect flavor.\r\n\r\nFor the \"ice-cream\" I was using TPA V.B.I.C alone at 4% in all of my trials.  It was good, but it lacked some depth.  Then I remembered how much I enjoyed ID10-T's \"Longing\"  I used his cream base and swapped the Honeysuckle for 3% INW Bubble Gum (yc).  The end result was nearly perfect.  Good enough to be my new ADV.\r\n\r\nThank you, ID10-T, for your hard work.  Not trying to rip off your recipe, just paying homage :) ",

To be honest I felt like the recipe is missing something.... a wetness i think.  Its not quite full yet, very rich and creamy but if you're trying to make what I understand you are; half BG slush half soft serve ice cream? (snow cone/soft serve swirl is a very popular ice cream stand treat in quebec, I got hooked on when I lived there, I don't get why I've not seen it elsewhere) Then its not quite there.... so close though and SOOOO good!  Im gonna keep tinkering with this one.  perhaps a touch of banana or pear..."
