  "description": "Tony would often mix Lola her signature drink before her show, the Copabanana... Lola didn't like to be drunk before her performance so he'd mix this drink for her virgin style.  But after Tony got shot and her career went into the toilet she became a drunk and would drink this blend in remembrance of Tony with a healthy dose of vodka in it.  You can vape Lola's drink while you listen to the iconic song and transport yourself to Rio while dancing around your kitchen. \r\n\r\nThis recipe is missing one ingredient from the list and when it gets added to the database I will update the recipe, but for now I will list it here. \r\nFA Blood Orange  0.65% \r\n\r\nYou'll get banana aroma on one inhale and Pink Guava and Soursop on the next, this flavor is ever changing as you vape it. Sometimes the banana will taste just a bit smoky too, even though there is nothing smoky in this flavor.  The Pink Guava dances between that guava note and a pink grapefruit flavor blending with the blood orange citrus notes.  When freshly mixed the blood orange is very much in front, but it mellows out after about 4 days. If you like the stronger orange flavor I would suggest boosting it up to 1% or 1.25% to have a more orangey note.  The touch of sour wizard adds a hint of tangy to balance out the sweetness, but FLV Sweetness is not in your face sweet, it is there just enough to make this seem like a natural fruit sweetness.  If you want a much sweeter version, you can add a different type of sweetener, but I wouldn't suggest going much higher than 1.25% on FLV sweetness, as it can start to cause muting.  A little EM could also be added if you need it sweeter, but to be honest, I think it is the perfect level of sweetness to mimic a virgin blended fruit drink.  The Polar Blast gives it a nice healthy dose of coolness, but you could increase that up to 0.5% if you want a blast you in the face cold drink. \r\n\r\nI've been vaping this non-stop for 2 days now and I will probably keep vaping it until I finish off this 120ml that I mixed and I'll be mixing another 120ml to have in rotation.  It is very good.  \r\n\r\nI didn't do anything special for this to steep, just shook it good and let it sit for 3 days.  I did test it shake and vape and once each day, but the flavors aren't quite right freshly mixed, and get kind of weird on day 2.  By day 4 the mix is pretty set in but the blood orange will continue to decrease in intensity over the course of 7 days.   After day 7 there hasn't been much change in the way it tastes. \r\n\r\nI generally do all my mixes at 70% VG but this one I went a little higher with the VG just to see how it works.  You can by all means go lower than 85% VG and the flavor will not suffer. You could probably go higher on the VG, but you may need to adjust the percentages a little bit, adding in just a touch more flavor for full max VG.   If you suffer with muted tastes, you may want to try a small sample of this to start with, as the percentages may be too low for those with muted tastes, but it doesn't hurt to give it a try low to see how it works.  If you can't taste it, it may need to be doubled on all flavoring components to keep the profile the same but just increased intensity. \r\n\r\n\r\nFor More Mixing Tips and Info Visit my Site and Youtube Channel: \r\nhttp://flavor-pro.com/\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCA6gV-5vxieuG2_TcIKpYCg\r\n",
