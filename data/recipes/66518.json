  "description": "I've been vaping tobaccos on and off for a while now.\r\nthis profile has got to be one of the oldest profiles on the history of vaping.\r\nMy take on a tobacco heavy RY4 made from scratch.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nCubano type is one of the darkest tobaccos I own and my taste on this type of profile is tobacco heavy (It does need a steep though)\r\nVanilla custard and marshmallow give it a nice creamy vanilla flavor without being overpowering\r\nTFA Hazelnut is kind of a dry nut to help give the recipe some grit\r\nCaramel brings the recipe together adding sweetness and the flavor from traditional RY4s we all love. \r\n\r\nLET IT STEEP: TFA cubano type is a horrible flavoring right off the bat, but it matures with time.\r\nAt least 15 days, better after a month.",
