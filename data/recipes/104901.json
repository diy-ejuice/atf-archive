  "description": "\r\nLet this Birthday Cake Milkshake bring all the boys (or girls) to your yard.  \r\n\r\nI need to give credit to @Freshepies for the Milkshake Base.  I tried other bases, but this just works.  Layering the LB Vanilla ice cream and Hangsen French Ice Cream to get a nice rich buttery ice cream flavor.  Cream milky undertone is to thin the texture of the ice cream to milkshake without sacrificing richness. \r\n\r\nFW Birthday Cake is used to give the Birthday cake taste in the milkshake.  As a add on concentrate, this works well.  It has the cake feel, frosting, and even sprinkles.  Using this flavor on its own, would be a bit tricky to build on, but in this recipe, it works well.  \r\n\r\nTo add to the sweetness of the milkshake,, I added some FA Juicy Strawberry and FW Sweetener.\r\n\r\nEnjoy!\r\n***. Special thanks to Ella Robinson, for introducing me to FW Birthday Cake. \r\nAnd for being an inspiration for all us female mixers out here. ðŸ’•\r\n\r\nhttp://e-liquid-recipes.com/recipe/2353934/Ella%27s%20Birthday%20Cake%20Ice%20Cream",
