  "description": "***I actually forgot about this until I cleaned out \"the drawer\" today to make room for my newer recipes. This was made back in June. And at 11 months still holds its Ice Cream Sandwich flavor extremely well!\r\n  \r\nI used LB Vanilla Ice Cream as the base just because it's so true to real Vanilla Bean Ice Cream. No pepper. No plastic. Just pure ice cream. I needed to pump up the thickness a bit more though, so I added 1% CAP VC1. 1% is all you need to perform this task.\r\n  \r\nRF Cookies & Cream SC was my choice for the cookie part of my ice cream sandwich purely for the reason that as a single flavor--C&C tastes just like the chocolate I was looking for. All the other cookie & cream concentrates didn't have the particular 'chocolate' taste I was hunting for. \r\n  \r\nAgain, this chocolate note needed a slight push in terms of texture. FW Hazelnut not only provided the texture I wanted, but also lended to the creamy texture of the ice cream. \r\n  \r\nCAP SS...obvious explanation. \r\n  \r\nYou can add FA Polar Ice to this if you prefer. I didn't add it(or any of the other cooling enhancers) because lately I find it distracts from my perception of flavor. This was a personal choice. So, if you want it-add it. \r\n  \r\nI didn't like this very much as a SNV, it was way too flat. 7 days steep was good. 14 days? Even better. \r\n \r\n  \r\n  \r\nPlease dont use this recipe for commercial profit. This is meant to benefit the DIY Community. \r\n  \r\nPlease dont post this recipe to other websites.\r\n  \r\n  \r\nMy continued thanks to the #EJUICEMAKERS crew for all of their support and love for what they do. They truly give more to the community than I am able to do. I continue to feel very humbled that I am included in such a knowledgeable & generous group of people!!",
