  "description": "This is my take on a deep and rich custard-like French Vanilla Ice Cream. I started off with CAP French Vanilla. It is smooth and buttery with hints of custard. TPA French Vanilla Creme is the custard part of this recipe. It's very thick and blends perfectly with CAP French Vanilla. OF course I had to pair these flavors with HS French Vanilla Ice Cream. It's got everything. It's Creamy and rich, buttery and sweet. It's very well-balanced. The star of the show that blends everything together is CAP NY Cheesecake. What can I say about it other than it thickens the whole recipe. It's so creamy and delicious. It totally enhances all the other flavors.\r\n\r\nIf you enjoy French Vanilla you'll love this!\r\n\r\nPlease enjoy and share your feedback!!",
