    "name": "NILLA PUDDIN POUND CAKE",
    "description": "The pound cake base used here uses Flv Pound Cake with WF Shortbread cookies for the buttery outer crust\r\nThe Vanilla pudding used:  Flv Vanilla pudding and VT Pudding base makes for a very creamy vanilla pudding, and 1.5% of FA vanilla bourbon to add to the vanilla experience. IMO Flv vanilla pudding needs a little help in the vanilla dept.\r\n\r\nThis is a creamy Vanilla pudding with a nice Pound cake flavor\r\nI mixed up a 30 ML tester and after 3 days Began to destroy it. After a week its already a nice smooth tasty vape.\r\nThis will be one of my ADVs.. For a while anyway\r\n\r\nPlease drop a review if you decide to mix this\r\nThanks for checking it out!",
