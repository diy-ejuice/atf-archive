Boy was I not let down. This is super sweet and smooth which just some hints of nuttiness, perfect for the time of year and for what I was craving. FLV milk chocolate is still more than enough to make this plenty chocolaty without it killing everything else in the recipe. &#xD;\n&#xD;\nKiller work man, chocolate vapes aren't easy and you nailed this."
