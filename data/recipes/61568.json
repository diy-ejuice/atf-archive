  "description": "This recipe is alittle different from the original worked with a different crust on this one. \r\nMy Thought Process on this recipe was trying to capture the sweet custardy layer along with the crucnchy sugar layer, and that graham cracker/and cake layer at the bottom , this is a derived version from my original and i dropped both versions at the same time to get the peoples opinion on the differences I like this version as it is closer to what I was looking for... But taste is subjective right.... ðŸ˜‰\r\nwww.diymixerscrew.com\r\nDiy mixers crew Youtube\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UC1ENB0bSNrG_1KETYwZ154g\r\n",
