  "description": "THE MOST AUTHENTIC RICE VAPE I HAVE EXPERIENCED !!\r\n\r\nThis is my take on a Thai Style Coconut Rice Pudding. I ordered the real life version at an Aussie Based Thai restaurant and it totally took me back to when I was in Sukhumvit where I enjoyed some of the best street food in the world in downtown Bangkok. \r\n\r\nBut how will I make this into something not only enjoyable but vapable?\r\n\r\nThe VTA Rice Base here has aromas and mouthfeel that could only be described as planting your face a freshly steamed bowl of rice complete with the starchy tones and has a wonderful mouthfeel but it needs friends. \r\nThe pairing up with FE Sweet rice really helped to offer a little base of sweetness and to pull the basic pudding rice mouthfeel together. \r\nTo bring home the pudding ice base and cream it up I needed to balance the lovely and authentic Purilum condensed milk along with Flavorah Milk. \r\nThis worked well but what bridged the creams and the rice together wonderfully was the FA Oak Milk. The Oak tones helped the mouthfeel of the rice wile the milk worked in to this very well. \r\nFinally the coconut simply had to be Flavorah Sweet Coconut for it's sweetness and 100% beauty. It's not overbearing and it plays a linear role that is gently applied in the middle of this profile. \r\nA gentle squeeze of the amazing VTA Persian Lime simply helps cut through the density oh so subtlety and is barely noticeable yet noticed when it's not in the recipe. \r\n\r\nAll up with a Minimum of a 5 day steep and vaping this on an RDA such as a Wotofo Recurve or similar at around 50-60w on a decent coil \r\n(I tested on a SST Alien) you should experience a lovely dense mouthfeel and gather the different nuances of flavour as described above. \r\n\r\nHowever, while I enjoy this as is, I have also tested versions of this adding with (separate versions)\r\n1/ 2% FA Juicy Strawberry\r\n2/ 2% WF Banana Puree\r\n3/ 2% FA White Peach\r\n\r\nand all of these versions were very pleasant. Maybe you may enjoy a little Mango on top or another fruit of your delight for something extra. Whatever you do I hope you enjoy this recipe just as much as I have creating it and let me know what you thought, just enjoy DIY &\r\nTogether Let's Discover !! \r\n\r\nFacebook - https://www.facebook.com/groups/diydownunder/\r\nDiscord - https://discord.gg/kH4Fqbc\r\nYoutube - https://www.youtube.com/c/diydownunder\r\nWebsite - https://www.diydownunder.com/\r\nInstagram & IGTV : @diydownunder",

Something magical happens around day 5 - 6  - it begins to smooth out  and softens a bit, and the  body of the dense  cream really comes forward with that authentic rice note.  This edges toward a almost savory vape and makes the  perfect base for adding the fruit of your choice as pippa offers.    Well done pippa really well done   "
