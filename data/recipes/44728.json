  "description": "I made this as a joke but it actually turned out pretty good.\r\n\r\nThis recipe is obviously a spin off of /u/ID10-T original Strap on and I wanted to create something with all Flavorah. Be sure to try the original! https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/6487\r\n\r\nIt has a very oddly addictive taste...and it's expensive as hell.\r\n\r\nIf you mix this up let me know what you think or did different!\r\n\r\nFLV Alpine Strawberry - This is a absolute fantastic strawberry flavor for a pure fruit type vapes. It can stand up to even the strongest of flavors and manage to punch it's way through. Really the backbone of this mix.\r\n\r\nFLV Apple Pop - This is going to be a more niche use flavor but I fell in love with the flavor the first time I mixed it. It tastes of a mix between a candy apple and fresh apple while still having a sweet candy finish. The most unique thing this flavor provides is a sweet candy apple finish with the flavor of the apple skin. Out of all their apple flavors this seemed to fit the best in this mix.\r\n\r\nFLV Wild Melon - As a fanatical melon lover this is my all time favorite melon flavor. It tastes like a mix of honeydew, cantaloupe and watermelon. Apsolutely perfect for this recipe as it sits it is the body of the mix; helping the watermelon.\r\n\r\nFLV Watermelon - This flavor will turn some people off. It has a candy watermelon taste while still bringing the green rind notes along with it. If you are not too keen on the green taste then drop this down to 1.5%. I personally found the flavor provided some interesting top notes to the mix. This flavor isn't really strong and lacks a lot of body but the top notes are great and really helped bring the recipe into a unique direction.",

      "text": "This is an interesting, extra juicy, full-bodied mix of natural and candy fruit that I would have been in love with if it weren't giving me a bit of a soapy note. Don't let that stop you from trying it. I have issues with soapiness from some other flavors (looking at you TFA Honeydew) that many other mixers don't get at the same %s. We all have our own little types of damage. I don't have enough experience with some of these flavors to identify the culprit or culprits, but once I do, I bet this combination of ingredients with one or two of the %s lowered will result in something I can't put down.
