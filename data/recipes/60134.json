  "description": "A creamy vanilla ice cream blended with Saffron and Rose with Pistachio pieces.\r\n\r\nThis is the 3rd of my Trinity of Indian flavor profile ice creams. This flavor profile was interesting to me so I wanted to give it a crack. Rose is such a delicate flavor, but very pleasant. The saffron, where to start. Used way too high, almost a burnt plastic or even gasoline aroma. Working with this was interesting. When used at the right percentage it lends a slightly floral hint, but what it does more is almost give some sort of...Umami feel. It's very hard to describe to be honest. I have tried this with and without, the change is noticeable but hard to describe. The only way I can describe it is have you go out, buy saffron, and try it for yourself.\r\n\r\nI would say let this steep about a week for the florals to fall into place and let the pistachio come out.",
