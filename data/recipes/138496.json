  "name": "Toffee Cookie Milkshake",
  "description": "A thick & creamy milkshake blended with sticky toffee and crushed cookies.\r\n\r\nThe milkske base comes with the compliment of @Freshepies and is, by miles, the best milkshake base known to man and alien alike. It is a thick and creamy vanilla milkskake and ticks all the boxes in the most realistic and indulgent milkshake department. Period.\r\n\r\nFLV Toffee is what it says on the label = thick, sweet and sticky toffee. Used low, it works well and devoid of the fruity and funky off notes some pick up. It needs at least a week or so to fully shine, so be patient, it will just get better and better.\r\n\r\nSalted Carmel boosts the Toffee just a tad by adding a buttery and rich caramel element which rounds the toffee off beautifully. \r\n\r\nJF Cookie is my go to fresh, cookie flavour and sits beautifully in this milkshake. A tad of texture and caramel sweetness, inhered to JF cookie, compliments the toffee layer stunningly.\r\n\r\nLet this baby develop for at least 7 days  - 2 weeks best. ",
