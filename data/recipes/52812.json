  "description": "A peach, mango, vanilla bacco, that's great for a summer ADV.\r\n\r\nI've been struggling to get INW Gold Ducat to work well in a mix for quite some time now and have finally struck gold! Shout out to Fear and his Abuela recipe where I took much inspiration.\r\n\r\nINW Gold Ducat- this is by far my favorite single flavor vape, but doesn't always like to play nice with others. For me It's a very complex tobacco with notes of molasses/honey and dry tobacco leaves. Similar to the way a Garcia Vega cigar leaf tastes, if you were to lick it for some reason ðŸ˜‰. Ive tried mixing it with apple, creams, desserts, and other tobaccos, with no success until I started thinking about Abuela. How well the mango worked to moisten the vape and still showcase the other tobacco flavors. So i went to the drawing board one last time to see what i could do, and this is what I proudly came up with. Enjoy!",

      "text": "This is a wonderful recipe that's butter-smooth and easy to vape. It's not as tobacco-forward as I expected given the references to Abuela but the Gold Ducat adds a fascinating sweet yet earthy and dark element to the mango/peach combo. It tastes like a formal evening event in tropical locale and I love it!  Note: I didn't have a chance to try this until after it had steeped for 11 days, quite a bit longer than the 3 days recommended. So let it steep or YMMV. "
