    "description": "Just a fun recipe using some of flavorah's newly released flavors. I figured I would put some recipes out using some of the lesser talked about new flavors.  Smooth vanilla is an extremely strong flavor .20% and there is no denying that its in the recipe. Vanilla bean is  a lot lighter of a vanilla than smooth vanilla but when added to sweet cream and cream it makes a smooth vanilla cream\r\n\r\nMy bourbon barrel: \r\nI used a combination of oak barrel, bourbon, butterscotch, and caramel. Oak barrel is a light flavor but yet a very accurate oak barrel with a little bourbon butterscotch and caramel added and it is transformed into a whiskey soaked bourbon oak barrel. butterscotch and caramel add to the sweet notes in the oak barrel.. I added a touch of sweetness to sweeten the mix up a bit. Feel free to use or not use a sweetener of your choice me I like flavorah sweetness!!!!\r\n\r\n\r\nJust a good smooth bourbon barrel vanilla cream with subtle butterscotch and caramel back notes and of coarse the bourbon oak barrel!!!$$$ let me know what you think in the review section. This is surprisingly good after a shake but definetly will get better with age. I would say a 5 day steep and it is 100% but definitely good to vape on a shake!!!  ENJOY!!!!",
