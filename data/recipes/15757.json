  "description": "My clone of Propaganda's Subliminal, a take on sweet and sour raspberry belts. This started out pretty complex but after trying to hit all the right notes it wound up being simpler than I would have expected. I want to continue tinkering and getting feedback but I'm happy enough with this that it's ready for public consumption.\r\n\r\nIt's ok as a S&V but really comes into its own after 2 days and it incredibly badass.",

INW Cactus really makes the Razzleberry pop and Ithe TFA Koolada helps it out quite a bit too.  Nice and simple flavouring that's by no means boring.  Best consumed fresh as the Razzleberry fades a lot faster than the Cactus, by the two week mark I found the Cactus a little over powering."
