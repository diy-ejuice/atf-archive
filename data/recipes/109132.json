    "description": "\r\nVanilla ice cream sandwiched between two shortbread biscuits. No faff, no bells and whistles, just a good ice cream vape. \r\n\r\nThis no-nonsense recipe is for indulging those summer ice cream cravings from childhood.  It's simple, tasty and sweet. \r\n\r\nCAP Vanilla Bean Ice Cream at 4% is nothing special. It's a generic but tasty plain ice cream with nice thickness. You can of course sub it with FW or TFA's equivalent. Have been growing fond of TFA Vanilla Bean Gelato lately. It's an old school flavour I've grown to like and thickens the ice cream base while adding some cheap but tasty bright vanilla notes; like in commercial ice creams.  \r\n\r\nAs it stands, the ice cream base lacks buttery creaminess, however, don't want to resort to CAP Vanilla Custard, which throws the recipe off. LB Vanilla Ice Cream is a better fit here as it's loaded with diketones and lends buttery undertones at low percentages. Only a smidgen needed though as it runs riot when used over 1%.\r\n\r\nFor the shortbread sandwich, 2 % WF Shortbread Cookie is a no-brainer. It's a buttery, light biscuit flavour and FA, Cookie, which was raised from 0.50% to 0.75%, gives some crispy crust it lacks. By the way, I avoided adding chocolate here- an ice burger's biscuit contains a hint of cocoa- as it was too rich: wanted to keep this recipe straight forward.\r\n\r\nFinally, to bump up that store-bought sweetness,  0.35% FLV Sweetness.\r\n\r\nBest after 3 days, when the light buttery biscuit peeps through , but that didn't stop me from digging in the next day.\r\n\r\nBoozy after-thought:  It's funny how smells and tastes can encapsulate and evoke memories: that's why vaping will always trump smoking any day.\r\n\r\n",
