      "text": "I was afraid of the 7% TFA Root Beer, but Vanilla Swirl, LB VIC, and a ton of CAP SS are all sin-eaters, so I thought, sure, I’ll give it a try. Nope. I get some plastic off-note and it’s very, very licorice-y, to the point that licorice overwhelms the vanilla swirl and ice cream and even, to an extent, the super sweet, so I’m left with this fairly intense sugar-free black jelly bean lingering finish. Sugar-free black jelly bean sugar lips. Ugh. The rest of this looks great for a simple root beer float, but it just really needs a different Root Beer flavor - FLV, FW, LB - all great options for root beer. "
