  "description": "I wanted to create that perfect summertime vape that is more on fruity side with a nice a good amount of sweetness while being sour enough to really make the perfect blend of fruit meld together\r\nAR-Blue Rasberry is a nice flavor that has a strong blueberry/ Raspberry profile that has a great amount of tart but also a nice sweetness to it. \r\nDfs Sour candy is not overly sour but it bring just a little more bite to recipe to make the flavors really pop out.\r\nFW- Green Apple is like a very sour Granny Smith apple this flavor adds some tart and some great flavor to the mix at 1% it works perfectly as you can taste that apple flavor without completely taking over the recipe.\r\nTFA Strawberry ripe adds a nice brightness to the flavor keeping it more of a candy profile while still adding a great fruit note.\r\nTFA Raspberry Sweet is a nice flavor that pushes the Raspberries to thier poentential in this recipe at 1% it really helps to make the recipe shine.\r\nInw Cheeries is a great flavor that brings in some much needed tartness while putting of a great Spicy authentic cherry to the recipe. \r\nFW blackberry is a very strong flavor but is also really good in flavor and really helps to balance the whole recipe out to really give this recipe s strong nice sour flavor. \r\n\r\nGreat as a Shake n Vape but best after 3 day steep. If you like your sour a little sweeter like me, add .3% of Cap Supersweet. \r\n(You can substitute with osdiy blue Rasberry slush as well. Also you could use Sour wizard at 1% in place of sour candy. I just prefer this version more.)",
