  "description": "\r\nLemon creamy goodness with hints of blueberry. \r\nI wanted to create this as the picture depicts. A creamy desert. Lemon ice cream like but not custard. I invisioned milk and heavy whipping cream based home made lemon ice cream with a little blueberry drizzle. To me the blueberry would only be a slight taste because it’s only a slight drizzle and mostly a semi sweet heavy whipped lemon ice cream base. I used black currant to keep the blueberries bright and the combination of blueberry extra and blueberry wild is a light blueberry combination that isn’t too much on the candy side I added a LA Lemonade because it’s a candy lemon flavor. I used tfa custard because it isn’t as vanilla heavy or as eggy as the other options. I enhanced it with cheesecake graham crust for texture and FA Custard for the Creamy lemon zest notes I added Vanilla Gelato because it has a real good ice cream type cream notes. A touch of yogurt brings a thickness to the ice cream without adding egg notes that heavy custard would bring. I have no idea what brought a buttery note to the table but there is definitely a buttermilk flavor in this mix. \r\nSweeten to taste. I personally think it would be good anywhere between 0.50% to 1.0% depending on your sweet tooth. (I used 0.5% FW sweetener)\r\nEnjoy.",
