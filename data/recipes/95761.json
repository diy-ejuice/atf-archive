  "description": "This is my first mix with FA Mango and INW Coconut.  So far this has balanced nicely.  A nice tropical flavour that is full bodied.\r\n\r\nFA Mango is the main flavour here.\r\n\r\nINW Coconut is here to add sweetness and creamyness to the mango.\r\n\r\nTPA Juicy Peach is added to try and 'ripen' the mango flavour.\r\n\r\nYou could use this as a SnV but I'm letting it steep for 5 days to see how the flavours settle.  So far it is a full body flavour with only 5% flavouring.",
