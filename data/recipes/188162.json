  "description": "A gin martini infused with fresh raspberries.\r\n\r\nFLV Juniper Gin: The resinous, piney flavour, inherent to the Juniper berry, is wonderfully balanced by citrus peel and a smidgen of spiciness from freshly ground peppercorns. There is a wondrous boozy element to the flavour which rounds the profile off expertly. The 'booziness' is not overwhelming in the least but rather augments the authenticity & overall Gin experience.\r\n\r\nThe raspberry combo is my go-to combo and just works so well together to provide a sharp, authentic raspberry note to elegantly infuse the gin.\r\n\r\nThe blood orange is there to provide a gentle spritz of orange, barely noticeable but adding to the overall experience...\r\n\r\nGive this baby 2 days and sheâ€™s ready...\r\n\r\n",
