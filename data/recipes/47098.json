  "name": "Peach Glazed Pie",
  "description": "**DESCRIPTION:**\r\n  \r\nIf you've ever had a peach-glazed pie, you know it is a sweet juicy treat! When I was a kid, my mom used to get them at \"Hahn's Bakery\" which closed a long time ago. After a 2-3 week steep(3 weeks or more is optimal), this is the most authentic peach-glazed pie I've ever tried in vape form. Somewhat strong crust, but with my taste buds, I usually find peach pie to carry more of a crust flavor than cherry, blueberry, etc.\r\n  \r\n**NOTES:**\r\n  \r\n**The Crust:**\r\n  \r\nI'll start with the easy part. TFA Pie Crust is used here at 1.5%. At 1% I had a very hard time even tasting it. But once you hit the right percentage, it's dead-on accurate!\r\n  \r\n**The Peach Glaze:**\r\n  \r\nIn order to achieve this, it was necessary to form the peach using several flavors. INW Peach has an almost 'nectar' like quality that added to the part I found lacking in FLV Peach. And the FLV Peach was used due to its' authentic fresh quality. I still found the peach portion needing a boost, and CAP Sweet Mango added that fleshy, sweet aspect to finish it out. \r\n  \r\n**The Extras:**\r\n  \r\nWhat can I say? I love brown sugar. It goes so well with peaches, pears, apples.... you name it! Brown Sugar makes ANY bakery taste better! \r\n  \r\nFLV Rich Cinnamon is a SUPER concentrated flavor and not for the heavy-handed! Just a touch is needed! That's not a suggestion. It's expensive, but believe me, as concentrated as it is, it will last a HELLUVA long time. It's used here at 0.15(equal to 3 drops). Any higher and it will ruin the mix. Due to its' high concentration, A STEEP IS NEEDED. At least 2-3 weeks, if not more. Try to vape this any sooner and all you will taste is cinnamon. FLV flavorings are rarely SNV flavorings and to use them as such is a disservice. It took me awhile to get that through my thick head.\r\n  \r\n**The Enhancers:**\r\n  \r\nFA Liquid Amber is a great way to give fruits that \"baked/cooked\" flavor. This is something you want in your flavoring arsenal. \r\n  \r\nCAP Super Sweet is added of course, to wrap up the whole dessert in sugary goodness!.\r\n    \r\n**65-70% VG recommended**\r\n  \r\n**2-3 week steep recommended.**\r\n  \r\n**No substitutions recommended. I don't know what to tell those of you who aren't willing to spend 11-12$ for the FLV Rich Cinnamon. There is nothing out there like it. And if you don't spend the money, you will have no idea of the perfection you're missing.**\r\n  \r\n**If anyone creates this recipe 'as is' with no subs, please try to remember to rate/review it & give it how ever many stars you think it deserves. Thanks & happy mixing!!**\r\n  \r\n\r\n**Do not take it upon yourself to copy and publish this recipe over to ELR.
