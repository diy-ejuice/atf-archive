  "description": "Caramel coffee cheesecake what else. An I say.?\r\nhttps://youtu.be/fnTvJmjqci8\r\nThe end result here is a rich hybrid of a coffee and a cheesecake vape.  I wouldn’t say it’s a coffee nor would I say it’s a cheesecake although both flavors are present. This one takes some patients tho it is a long steeper at around 30 days I found that coffee burnt note had subsided enough for me to make this my all day vape until it was gone....now the waiting begins again. When I ran out of this liquid I found myself wanting more which was a good sign to me that it’s a keeper.\r\n\r\nMix it up and give it a try if you have the flavors and 0ease be sure to rate or comment on what you mix...it helps others decide if they should try it and it helps the mixer to make better recipes in the future.  Also if you change the recipe or add to it or remove something leave that in the comments as well if it is better to you...this can be a group effort if we all play well together...LOL..\r\n\r\nI HAVE STARTED A YOU TUBE CHANNEL FOR PEOPLE WHO DRIVE A TRUCK AND LIKE TO MIX....this channel is going to show and/or give ideals or methods for drivers  to be able to mix on the road so hopefully again we can all learn from each other..take a look. My channel is called VAPIN TRUCKER.  GIVE ME A SUBSCRIBE AND OR A THUMBIN {bonus points if you know where I got that from}. ENJOY!!!!\r\n\r\nCarmel mocha HS.....As with most coffee flavors this on ha the burnt/skunks flavor slightly for me but after the steep in this recipe it pretty much goes away. It does not distract from the flavor profile for me.\r\n\r\nCreamy Yogurt CAP....used here to add some more cream and to help push the cheesecake note a little\r\n\r\n",
