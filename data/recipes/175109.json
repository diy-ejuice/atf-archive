  "description": "A plum infused tobacco with notes of toasted marshmallow and custard.\r\n\r\nWanted a new tobacco to vape on and had just recieved INW plum on my last order. \r\n\r\nFLV Sweet and smokey - spice note with a good tobacco base\r\nFLV Native Tobacco - adds a woody note and deeper tobacoo base\r\nINW Plum - some floral notes but after a couple hours it blended nicely in the profile\r\nINW Custard - my go to custard every since trying Holy Holy Custard by @ruderudi. INW Custard brings a fuller body with out weighing everything down.\r\nTPA Toasted Marshmallow - Cant go wrong with this flavor. Helps blend everything together as well as bring the toasted noted to it as well\r\n\r\nTested in the Billet Box w/ Xeta bridge. MTL tested.\r\nSteep for atleast 1 day",
