    "description": "This is a recipe for Wayne walker on the diy or die Facebook page. This is untested and my thoughts of a startvto his profile of a banana coffee chocolate w\/ cashew smoothie. If I had smoothie base I may add that aswell but its already on its way to becoming ferryfied so I will leave it out. Problems I can see with this recipe is the coffee is a strong flavor along with the chocolates the banana and almond will possibly get barried from them. The almond was used as a greasy nut that may help separate all the flavors to help you get each note. The ap is to help the chocolates and nuttiness. Another thought is you may be able to add some more banana with vta banana custard.\r\n\r\n*edit so on my hadaly with a fused clapton 2x26g n80 fused w\/ 38g n80 this is actually a pretty tasty vape the coffee and banana work well with each other I don't get much chocolate or almond but I was pleasantly surprised.",
