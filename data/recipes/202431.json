  "description": "Strawberry Cream Cookie Revised - \r\nAs a single flavour VTA Strawberry Custard is really good and i was pleasantly surprissed, wanted to use it in a recipe and decided to remix this profile.\r\nUsing Sugar cookie as the main base for the cookie with jf biscuit to lift some buttery notes and added nuts for authenticity. Meringue ups the sweetness and gives that powdered sugar type effect. The custard and butter cream make the filling, its thick with vanilla and butter notes and a very pink strawberry. The strawberry custard does need a good steep however to really shine.",
