    "description": "A nice warm apple pie.  I've been working on this recipe since I started DIY and I finally have the flavor profile I've been looking for.  The apple and cinnamon are at the forefront with a nice pie crust flavor on the exhale.  \r\n\r\nFA Fuji is the key to this recipe.  At 2% the Cinnamon from the Cinnamon Danish Swirl really stands out but below 2% you lose something from the CDS.  This is where the Fuji comes in.  Fuji helps the Double Apple pop out from behind that Cinnamon to give you that nice balance between the Apple and Cinnamon.\r\n\r\nI know a lot of people have issues with using CAP V2 flavorings but Apple Pie V2 and CDS V2 in this recipe tastes amazing.  You won't be disappointed.",
