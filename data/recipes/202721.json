    "description": "CAP Vanilla Cupcake is a really good cake on its own. At 4% you get a nice fluffy white cake with a little bit of vanilla frosting. I\u2019ve added the TFA Vanilla Custard II to add to the depth and make it a little darker.\r\n\r\nMB Glamour Chocolate works well in bakeries such as this one. It\u2019s a medium dark chocolate that benefits from the mouth feel of the cake and custard. \r\n\r\nWatch the Video Here: \r\nhttps:\/\/youtu.be\/4WploIH0Ti8",
