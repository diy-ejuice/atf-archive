This only needs to rest about a day.  it looks like it wouldn't work but it's very delicious custard with light vanilla candied rose.  It can be an ADV for sure.  if you mix it let me know your thoughts ðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜Ž",

      "text": "Delicious simple recipe, just four ingredients, and exactly as advertised. A vanilla custard with a light vanilla candied rose. The Marshmallow Vanilla and/or Vanilla Bean really candies those edible rose petals and even at 3% the Rose Essence doesnâ€™t become too intrusive or any sort of perfumy, it just makes it interesting so itâ€™s not just a vanilla custard. I put this one really high on my list because I love these simple recipes that are simply good. Itâ€™s no wonder FLV put this in their recipe book. Definitely one Iâ€™d mix again, itâ€™s just a lovely dessert with a gentle floral appeal throughout. "
