  "description": "Ok this is a remix of the the ever popular Philip Rocke Grand reserve now as far as flavor notes everything works magically it's Hazelnut Cream with a splash of arabica coffee. I gave this two weeks to blend and mellow out from what I remember the original was not as tasty it was ok but I loved the profile...thanks for checking it out.  *Note I dont have any suggestions for substitutes for the coffee Purilum caramel coffee with Sweet milk contributes to the entire recipe and blends everything to a creamy goodness..",
