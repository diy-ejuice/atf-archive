  "description": "My Idea here was to get a bold Strong tobacco without it being dry or scratchy on the throat or exhale but still leaving a strong tobacco after taste.\r\n\r\nIt was a bit difficult to soften the harsh/dryness until I found:\r\nHoly holy Grail, Such a nice smooth and Thick profile to 'cream' up a stronger tobacco in this case taming the Kentucky and Burley down a bit without taking form their profile.\r\nThe Shisha vanilla adds a further smoothness and 'warm' feeling while with just a tough of sweetness (a soft vanilla Sweetness, not sugary sweetness)\r\n\r\nThis has been through Many versions so far and is now at a point I would share it, BUT.......Its not done yet!\r\n\r\nLet me know if you like it! \r\n\r\n",
