  "description": "A recipe made for a friend on ATF. I find it humbling when I receive personal messages requesting a recipe due to that particular person enjoying my work so much. He‚Äôs a fan of custards so I wanted to make something a little different that‚Äôs definitely not your run of the mill custard profile but IMO tastes great. I like to think of this as a wintertime Creme Brulee  that kinda has some Christmas influences but not enough to put this recipe in a ‚ÄúChristmas time only‚Äù  category. I‚Äôm really enjoying this one it‚Äôs packed full of flavour without being to much for an ADV.  you can S&V this one however 3 days and up is where it‚Äôs at! Give it a mix and leave your rating and review for all to see. Merry Christmas bjorama and everyone else in our awesome DIY community and best wishes for 2020!!! üíô\r\n***SUBS***\r\nINW CREME BRULEE for VT CREME BRULEE @ 2.5%\r\nJF DULCE DE LECHE for TPA DULCE DE LECHE @ 1.5%\r\nCAP VC V2 for CAP VC V1 @ 3%",

      "text": "I could tell this one had some potential off the shake, but after a few days this one really turns into a winner.  Gingerbread mellows out and blends really well with the  cornbread and graham cracker.  Being a custard fan this one has a few curve balls thrown in that ended up  creating something really delicious.   It's almost like a spiced cake custard hard to describe.  I had to look up the definition of masala and that is a much better word to describe this tasty juice.  This is definately a FuriousMix top 3 juice.  I recommend mixing this one up and if you haven't already, mix up \"Game  Changer\" and \"Benito Del Custardo\".  Thanks for juice Furious, Xmas is a go now and New Years still on schedule!  LOL&#xD;\nI also forced one of my good friends who is partial to fruit and iced mixes to try this.  He told me it was the best \"custard\" I've forced upon him.  A bit backhanded but still a compliment."
