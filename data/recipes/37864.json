  "description": "Trojan! \r\n\r\nAfter getting involved with the DIY_EJUICE Monthly Clone Challenge, I ordered some Titan from the good people at Blue Dot Vapors.  Upon trying it, I feel it taste very similar to Amalfi by Bigglesworth Labs, which I've been working on cloning for quite some time.  Titan definitely has a lovely spice on the finish of the exhale, whereas Amalfi is more jam-like and consistent across the vape.\r\n\r\nI've had a multitude of Amalfi clones, and recently been taking it in my own direction.  Once I tried Titan, I simply removed FW Tres Leches and replaced it with CAP Gingerbread.   I also excluded FA Liquid Amber.  I'll tell ya what, even fresh, this tastes like it's going in the right direction.  Although I obviously haven't had a chance to see how it steeps, based on the previous iteration I expect it to be as delicious if not moreso, as the Gingerbread really adds the extra dimension of flavor.\r\n\r\nINW/FA Apricot-  I must say I'm a big fan of LA Apricot, but FA seems a bit tangier, juicier, and punches through longer during the exhale. INW lends that soft, almost peach-like quality.\r\n\r\nFA Torrone/Almond/Meringue-  While I used TPA Almond in my Amalfi attempts initially, FA's offering is less sweet and seems to be a bit more \"musty\" which works well in bakeries.  The Torrone adds almond as well, as well as a citrus zest that helps the Apricots poke through.  Also when combined with FA Meringue,  it steeps into a beautiful sweetness that seems intrinsic rather than sitting on top of the other flavors.\r\n\r\nFA Tanger- While this is a new addition to this recipe, I don't really know how it will play out during a steep.  A bit forward at the moment, but definitely well in the ballpark and adds a nice zing to the Apricots.  This may end up being reduced to .75%.\r\n\r\nAP/TFA Vanilla Cupcake/JF Yellow Cake-  This was my base for Amalfi (+FW Tres Leches 1%) and seems to be a fine fit here.  Initially, I used FructoseWild's Yellow Cake, but changed to JF because even though I don't mind, others may not wish to consume that concentrate.  TFA beats CAP Van Cupcake with a little extra sweetness, and a shorter steep time.  I feel the AP helps with seperating the layers of flavors, so fruit over bakery instead of fruit + bakery x blender= bleh.  \r\n\r\nCAP Gingerbread-  Again, a new part of the recipe that, at least fresh, seems like it will be in the right direction.\r\n\r\n\r\nDISCLAIMER- This is not meant to be an outright clone, just a modification on a similar recipe.  That, and my tastebuds are like that Turkish neighbor of yours that wears sunglasses at night, buys large amount of black trash bags, and drives a Chrysler Sebring convertible...AKA on the Not To Be Trusted List.  If you people knew what I put my tastebuds through...",

I have a really big problem with torrone for some reason it makes me feel a bit nauseous whenever its in something I mix up, however, it was covered up pretty nicely by the other flavors in this recipe. The apricot combo is really nice and its one that I have used in the past. That gingerbread really makes this recipe something special though and I feel it might be getting much more use from me. Nice recipe here, I can tell some time was put into the development."
