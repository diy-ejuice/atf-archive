  "description": "We put you in charge developing this lemon tart on our Interactive Mixing podcast.  We think it turned out pretty good, maybe not accurate to the profile, but it's a really good \"fruit loops\" type profile.  We love doing these types of podcasts.  There's always something to learn from these mixes.  Mix this up, improve on it, make it your own.   Full recipe notes on our Interactive Mixing podcast at https://youtu.be/-UjPmyYzb1o  .  \r\n\r\nWe also want to see what you can do with an all TPA recipe.  Create an all TPA recipe, tag it with #TPACHALLENGE in the name of the recipe and we will talk about the recipes next Thursday, 5-7-20 on our DEVELOPED ASSIGNMENT podcast. \r\n\r\nThis is a collaborative creation by DEVELOPED: NaChef, Max Savage, and Folkart.\r\nOur weekly episodes are released at 6:00pm EST every Tuesday, and catch our live shows every Thursday at 6pm EST.\r\n\r\nCheck out our website at https://www.DevelopedDIY.com - We now have Merch!\r\nFind us on YouTube https://www.youtube.com/c/DevelopedDIY\r\nFollow us on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/developeddiy/\r\nCheck out our FaceBook Page at https://www.facebook.com/developeddiy/\r\n\r\n![Legacy](https://i.imgur.com/97yskRE.png)\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you would like to support DEVELOPED, the best way is to check out our LEGACY one shot line at https://www.DIYFlavorChaser.com/developed",
