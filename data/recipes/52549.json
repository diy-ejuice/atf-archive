  "description": "Weekend Assignment:  6/25/2017  BLUE     When I think of Blue, I think of Joni Mitchell's album, Blue, that was released in 1971.  That was the year I was born.  This has been one of my favorite albums since the '90's.  If I am 'blue', Joni can always pick me up.  In her lyrics of the song Blue:\r\nWell there're so many sinking\r\nNow you've got to keep thinking\r\nYou can make it thru these waves\r\nAcid, booze, and ass\r\nNeedles, guns, and grass\r\nLots of laughs \r\nLots of laughs\r\nEverybody's saying that hell's the hippest way to go well \r\nI don't think so,  but I'm \r\nGonna take a look around it though Blue \r\nI love you\r\nHere in this recipe, I have emulated the time of the album (acid, booze, and ass).  This is a Blue Lemonade with some some coolness added with Blue Ice (Acid), fizz of pink champagne( booze), and the Whipped Cream (ass, use your imagination), adds a bit of creaminess and sweetness.
