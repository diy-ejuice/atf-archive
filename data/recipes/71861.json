  "description": "A wonderful mix of strawberry and blueberry with a nice creamy vanilla yogurt. \r\n\r\nHoly sh*t WF frozen yogurt is just amazing. Love this stuff. Very dairy heavy but it's a great concentrate. \r\n\r\nNotes\r\n\r\nFw blueberry - IMO the king of blueberries. 2% is all that's needed here. Nuff said.\r\n\r\nWf frozen yogurt - as I said this stuff is the bomb! 2.5% is a good amount in this recipe. Super rich dairy creamy yogurt.\r\n\r\nFa juicy strawberry - Another bomb concentrate. Juicy sweet strawberries for days. 1.5% of this stuff is just right to mix with the blueberry and yogurt/vbic.\r\n\r\nFa red touch - 0.5% just to back up the juicy and give our berries that little extra depth. \r\n\r\nTfa VBIC - This is here to add some vanilla and a little extra cream. \r\n\r\n",
