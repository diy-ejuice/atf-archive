  "description": "A s'mores milkshake. Rich and creamy. Vanilla Ice Cream and Milky Undertone is the milkshake base. I chose FW graham cracker because I like the spice notes I get from it. Glamour chocolate with a hint of sweet coconut reminds me of a Hershey's chocolate bar. Toasted marshmallow because it's an accurate toasted marshmallow. Sweeten to taste and enjoy! I had a video shot for this mix but my dumb ass didn't hit record!",
