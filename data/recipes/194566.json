  "name": "Fried Oreo",
  "description": "This has been a very long-standing creation. I based this recipe around O’s Cookie. It’s a lighter chocolate taste that lacks most of the “alcohol-like” flavor that most chocolates give you. I added cookie to elevate the “cookie” aspect of this recipe. The combo of butter and vanilla made for the cream center. Joy turned it fried! You need time, a lot of it, 30-60 day steep, but WELL worth it. Definitely not a SNV recipe. ",
