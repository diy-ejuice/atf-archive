  "description": "Sweet nectar milk this is good!!!  My goal for this recipe was to make a honeysuckle ADV.  It's always been one of my favorite flavors that i could never really get to work the way i wanted it to.  At 8% the honeysuckle has a little bit of harshness but also has a very sweet nectar quality that i wasn't getting enough of at lower percentages.  I went through a ton of different creams and found that some got rid of the harshness but most of them muted the honeysuckle flavor too much or just didn't pair well.  So in my search for the least muting cream i think it was Thadentman that turned me on to the milky undertones.  Seems to be a really good neutral milky cream flavor. I can tell this flavor is going to be a staple in my recipes for a while.  It's sweet, creamy, and pairs perfectly with the honeysuckle.  Bavarian is my go to light cream so a small amount of that and marshmallow smooth it out a bit more and add to the sweetness.  Ends up being a very sweet and smooth vape, i can finally add honeysuckle to my daily rotation!!!",
