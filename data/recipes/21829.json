  "description": "Inspired by the \"Feeling Peachy\" recipe by /u/grant_hatcher of reddit.  (https://redd.it/5azrq8)  With his permission, I made a couple tweaks and posted it here.\r\n\r\nI'm typically not a huge peach fan, but this mix of fruits blends together very well to make a very nice authentic peach flavor and irresistible cream combo. The peach flavor becomes smooth and relatively mellow after a 5 day steep.",

It's a nice rounded peach with the help from the strawberry. No bready note detected, and not overly creamy. A rounded peach, and lightly-spiced cream. Best after about 4 days imo. Well done, thanks for sharing."

Unfortunately this recipe didn't play nicely w/ my taste buds. The cds dried out the recipe while the strawberry added a competing sickly sweet note with the peach that just didn't sit well the dry bready cinnamon. I like the vapes in theory tho. So I'll probably play around with Cinnamon and peach. So thanks for that man. That being said it wasn't horrible. I vaped 15mls if it before deciding against it"
