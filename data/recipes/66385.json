  "description": "***SHAKE AND VAPE APPROVED***\r\n\r\nJesus Spacolie, you made another candy recipe. Well too bad. This was a throw in experiment I did testing the new CAP Silverline flavorings. And these 2 stuck out at me in particular in something I wanted to use. My thought was just stupid simple. And it worked.\r\n\r\nCAP Silverline Black Currant - There isn't a ton of Black Currants on the market, so I was curious about this one in particular. It had a artificial smell and taste as a standalone, so I thought this could be used in a candy recipe. And it does. At 3%, it's rather flavorful, and I think was a perfect amount used for a simple recipe like this.\r\n\r\nCAP Silverline 27 Bears - I would like to figure out what the hell these 27's keep coming from. But I heard rather good news about this one prior to receiving it. And I was not disappointed. It tastes like a gummy bear, plain and simple. And going off past experiences with other Gummies (FW Gummy Bear, NW Sour Gummy), I knew that these have to be at a certain percentage, otherwise these just fall flat. But once again, the Gummy Bear came through. 3.5% does plenty in terms of giving that gummy substance, and is one of a couple flavors that helps brighten up this Black Currant.\r\n\r\nFW Razzleberry - This flavoring was purely used to help with the Gummy Bear sweetness, definitely don't need alot of this, because it will start muting your flavorings pretty easily. And this also managed to help brighten up the Black Currant as well. So 1% is enough.\r\n\r\nTPA Marshmallow - Like in most recipes that are of this nature, I used Marshmallow purely for mouth feel. And it never fails\r\n\r\nCAP Super Sweet - Here we go with my sweetener.... Well this one you definitely could go without sweetener if that's not your style. But one drop of this, or a drop or 2 of less potent sweetener, will really razzle your berries in this recipe. \r\n\r\nJust a fun simple recipe if you're looking for something juicy like you've been chewing on a gummy for a minute, and wanna retain that sweetness from the initial bite. Solid right out the gate, but fully flourishes after an overnight steep. Just another one from the sweet tooth.",

What this reminds me of, is just like a black wine gum candy definitely chewy, gummy with a deep dark secret!     It did really turn me on to razzleberry though!  thanks for the recipe :)"
