    "description": "Sweet Paan e-liquid based on Paan shisha flavor \r\nI came up with this recipe when I noticed that there aren't any noteworthy interpretations out there which brings the Asian sub-continent's traditional chewing tobacco to an e-liquid. Original Paan is made up of mixture of herbs, spices, tobacco and sometimes dried up fruits and nuts which are wrapped over with betel leaves and consumed as whole. My interpretation is based on the shisha\/hookah variant which is much more palatable.\r\n\r\nMixing notes:\r\n>1 drop of MTS Wizard per 15ml is optional\r\n> You CAN technically achieve similar taste without Rose, Oak Wood and RY4 (and shake and vape!) but they won't round off well to give the floral tobacco-ish notes after steeping\r\n>Clove is a personal preference and not that necessary, it gives a pungent spiciness to complement the sweetness of Anise.\r\n>After mixing let it breathe for a few hours",
