    "description": "So this is pretty straight forward.  I love sour gummy candy and after being inspired by Noted's \"Gummy Candy\" and \"2019 Flavors of the Year\" episodes I decided I wanted to mix up some thing that was fruity, sour and sweet.\r\n\r\nI used the MB Big Watermelon to back up the WF Sour Watermelon Candy.  I didn't want it over powered by the FLV Peach Gummy.  Adding the candylike WF Strawberry(Juicy) gave me the mixed fruit combination.  It's a relatively simple recipe, but I enjoy it.",
