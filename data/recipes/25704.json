    "description": "Its a borbon biscuit goes well with a coffee :) good as a shake and vape but really settles in after 3 days:-\r\n\r\nInw milk chocolate \/ cap super sweet:\r\nThe main flavour of a borbon biscuit is chocolate and this combination really seems to hit the spot of the chocolatey flavour you get when you bite into a borbon\r\n\r\nInw biscuit\/ Cap sugar cookie:\r\nBest biscuit blend the inw biscuit can sometimes be a little bit too much so the sugar cookie really brings that down and gives you a really crunchy texture to the flavour amazing!\r\n\r\nFa cream fresh\/ tfa bavarian cream \/ cap vanilla custard:\r\nIn the middle of the biscuit lies the chocolatey creamy icing goodness and this combonation is just light enough to mimick this\r\n\r\nAs you can probably tell im not great at flavour notes but there you go this is still a work in progress but its pretty good so far a little tweaking and its going to be perfect but try it out and hopefully you like it!",
