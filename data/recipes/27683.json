    "description": "\/\/ Key Lime Pie \/\/\r\n\r\nThis is one of my favourite recipes since I started mixing. The profile is simple and the flavors well balanced (from my point of view) and the first time I tried this version had the same feeling you get from a strawberry milk or cheesecake, that refreshing sensation of something well balanced, with a very distinctive flavor that doesn't require too much thinking, just vaping and enjoying.\r\n\r\nThe combination of Sugar Cookie and Graham Cracker Clear creates a buttery textured base, not too fluffy or flaky thanks to the \"pie\" in the Lemon Meringue and the Key Lime Pie, which adds the kind of bakery you find in a FA Apple Pie (for reference). The star of the recipe is the mix of the two Key Lime and the Lemon Meringue, with a touch of Strawberry Ripe to bring those flavors forward and the NY Cheesecake to give body and bond all together. Finally, the topping is that sugary cream feeling from the mix of Lemon Meringue and Marshmallow.\r\n\r\nI hope you enjoy it and feel free to play with it and give your most honest opinion and suggestions!!\r\n\r\n(English is not my mother tongue; please excuse any errors on my part)",
