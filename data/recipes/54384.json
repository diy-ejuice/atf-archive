  "name": "A Good Book - Unabridged Second Edition",
  "description": "This flavor is inspired by one of the most glorious things in the existence of aromas, in my opinion . . . old books.  What I’m not trying to do: create a vape that tastes like an old book.  What I’m trying to do: create a flavor based on the findings of what aromas make up the smell of old books.  Scientists have studied the volatile organic compounds (VOC) that combine to create the aromas that people associate with old books.  This is intended to be a mélange of those aromas that has tobacco as its foundation with supporting notes from the other aromas.\r\n\r\nThe following are articles I read dedicated to the fabled old book smell.\r\n\r\nFrom the New York Times Op-Ed page: Some scents add monetary value as well as historical interest. A dictionary owned by Mark Twain still had a distinct aroma of tobacco in its pages. Twain, of course, was an incessant smoker of cigars and pipes.

Source: http://mentalfloss.com/article/31235/what-causes-old-book-smell#sthash.oyAVEY1V.dpuf\r\n\r\nFrom IFLScience: Compound Chemistry reports that hints of almond are created by benzaldehyde, while vanillin emits notes of vanilla. Sweet smells come from toluene and ethyl benzene, and 2-ethyl hexanol produces a light floral fragrance. Additionally, the book can also retain some odors it has been exposed to during its history, such as smoke, water damage, or pressed flowers between the pages.

But it was still surprising to see that reference come up again and again.”\r\nBembibre also tested what people thought of the smell of the library at St. Paul’s Cathedral, London, where the researchers gathered many VOC  samples. The smells recorded there were as a whole described by participants as woody and smoky more than chocolatey, probably because they were able to see the magnificent wooden surroundings. The library was chosen for a reason; the smell in that library is so famed that it often gets mentioned in guest books, and the curator insists that any conservation methods must preserve the distinct smell.

It is delightful as a shake and vape, but I'm eager to see how this changes given a little time to unfold.  As this progresses and/or changes, I will add more extensive flavor notes . . . at the time of this writing, I am early in the process (day 2).\r\n\r\nUpdate (July 2nd, 2017):  \r\n\r\nAddition - added FLV Connecticut Shade at 0.5% . . . it brings in some coffee/cocoa notes and just a hint of leather.  It feels like the perfect bookend (don't excuse the pun) to close out this recipe.  I think this is now near completion.\r\n\r\nMixed up a 30mL of A Good Book at a ratio of 60vg to 40pg and loaded it in a tank that is somewhere between a very restricted lung hit and MTL.  \r\n\r\nUpdated again ( July 29th, 2017):\r\n\r\nA slightly altered version of A Good Book.  I dropped the FA Up (will probably try out HS Hazelnut Coffee in it's place if I can find it in stock) . . . Connecticut Shade brings in some subtle coffee notes on its own.  Bumped up the Tatanka just a bit, as well as FLV Fig (which I replaced FA Fig Fresh with bumping the percentage up at the same time).  I dropped FA Oakwood for TPA Red Oak.  This is a slightly higher percentage mix, and it steeps amazingly.  This is just a slightly bolder version of the original . . . but I'm proud of both of them.  \r\n\r\nPersonally, I mix these 60/40 and put them in an EVL Reaper MTL/restricted lung hit, and I'm thoroughly satisfied by them.  I tested them at 70/30 in a Hadaly Clone . . . and thoroughly enjoyed it that way as well.  \r\n\r\n",
