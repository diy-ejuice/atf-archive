    "description": "Originally I wanted to make a coconut custard\/pudding but after tinkering around with the recipe I felt the chocolate element turned this into something truly delicious. If your a fan of these 2 flavours I really do recommend you give this one a go,I\u2019m really happy with it thus far. You can S&V this sucker but naturally it will only  get better and better. Please rate my recipe and leave a review for the world to see. Happy mixing \ud83d\ude00\ud83d\udc99",

Finally got coconut custard was looking for a play on that so ended up here as I had everything else. Was concerned about the flavor percent being low but made it up anyways in a 30. Now wish it was a 60! Creamy, flavors all play great together with coconut being the focus which is another reason for the 5 star. The name. What I get out of this is the chocolates adding to the depth of the coconut. It's creamy coconut done well. Yet another layer of depth to this mix is the toasted almond. It needs to be there as support. From inhale to exhale fantastic mix, thanks for sharing, adv for sure. Mixing more soon. I tried after a week steep and will let it sit a little longer to see what happens. "
