    "description": "Sweet and sour sugar peach, just like peach gummies, great summer juice.\r\n\r\nPS1: Peach with Stevia can be changed for following Super Sweet = 0.75% and Yellow Peach = 4.5%\r\nPS2: This percentages were made only for a 70\/30 recipe, you may need to adjust if vaping in other percentages.\r\nPS3: Tweaked some percentages, recipe inspired by \"diyvapor\" in the link \"https:\/\/www.99juices.com\/recipes\/3929\/\"\r\nPS4: Tastes great as shake n' vape but after a few days it gets better.\r\nPS5: Do not mix a giant batch because after a month or two the peach starts to fade away.\r\nPS6: If you want more peach and less critus you can down the Yellow Peach to 3% and up the Peach with Stevia to 2.3%.\r\nPS7: The recipe is not super sweet, if you want more sweet you may up the Peach With Stevia a little and the Super Sweet by 0.5%\r\nPS8: The Marshmallow is used to give some body to the juice.",
