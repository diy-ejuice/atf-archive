I set out to create a favorite childhood treat of peanut butter and coconut treats which we dipped in cooking chocolate, as upmarket chocolate was a scarce luxury in my neck of the woods. The OG includes chopped nuts but I decided to omit these as a true nut texture and flavor is virtually unachievable...\r\n\r\nThe TPA and FLV Peanut Butter combo works wonderfully well to create a very authentic, pukka peanut butter. Combined, this duo delivers a smooth, nutty and roasted (thanks to FLV) peanut butter with a dense & mysterious grainy mouth feel. The slight saltiness which FLV brings adds to the \"nut\" element of the OG concept.  A word of advice on the TPA PB - give it a good shake BEFORE mixing as it commonly separates when not in use for extended periods. \r\n\r\nThe coconut layer was a no-brainer...FA Coconut and FLV Coconut was born for this type of profile = dinkum, lightly sweetened , desiccated coconut. No more , no less. No mess, no fuss.\r\n\r\nI opted for the magnificence of HS Chocolate cream and the resulting masterpiece which is Mayan Milk. It effortlessly checks all the boxes for a world class chocolate and requires virtually no assistance to shine, as it does that naturally.\r\n\r\nThe butter does what it is designed to do and adds a bit of buttery goodness to the mix whilst the marshmallow helps stick all the bits together and add a bit of body and sweetness.\r\n\r\nGive this baby 7 days or so...\r\n",
