  "name": "Zombie (Apple Cranberry Cider)",
  "description": "Did I tell you I hate zombies yet? I hate zombies. But of course, we were doing Zombies on SaturDIY'ing with fresh03 and Friends! So I had to do something and the only zombie I like is the song by The Cranberries. Today is an apple cranberry cider. And really when I mean cider, I mean juice. I don't drink much of anything alcoholic and I like my cider sweet.\r\n\r\nFLV Apple Cider/FLV Ginger = the cider component. I feel the ginger brightens it.\r\n\r\nFLV Apple Cranberry/FLV Cranberry = that's a strong cranberry, I don't think any more would stay tasty, but it needs to be strong to stay bright in front of all the apple in this mix.\r\n\r\nINW Two Apples/WF Thai Apple = a strong vibrant apple that you just want to bite in.\r\n\r\nWF Starfruit/CAP Super Sweet = this is honey sweetness, it rounds the vape and starfruit also gives the mix that nice flesh body of the apple.\r\n\r\nIt's sweet, apple and cranberry with a golden honey touch. This mix is bright and it has character.\r\n\r\nEnjoy, be queer and vape on!\r\n\r\n[Photo credits: www.culinaryhill.com ]",
