    "description": "You Voted, We Mixed a Brazilian Lemonade!  With special guest Rugly, we mixed what in essence is a Creamy limeade.  This version was first mixed without PUR Condensed Milk and was pretty good. So if you don't have PUR Condensed Milk it's fine, but if you do, you'll find it fills out the creamy body much better.  See the full Episode and flavor notes at https:\/\/youtu.be\/S_EhltMj9hM .\r\n\r\nThis is a collaborative creation by DEVELOPED: NaChef, Max Savage, and Folkart, with special guest Rugly.\r\nOur weekly episodes are released at 6:00pm EST every other Tuesday, and catch our live shows every Thursday at 6pm EST.\r\n\r\nCheck out our website at https:\/\/www.DevelopedDIY.com - We now have Merch!\r\nFind us on YouTube https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/c\/DevelopedDIY\r\nFollow us on Instagram: https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/developeddiy\/\r\nCheck out our FaceBook Page at https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/developeddiy\/\r\n\r\n![Legacy](https:\/\/imgur.com\/LA0lhIG.png)\r\n ",
