  "description": "*Tribute to the Mother Of Dragons, Daenerys Stormborn.*\r\n  \r\n**DESCRIPTION:**\r\n    \r\nA mouth-watering strawberry-raspberry candy. Extremely flavorful. Enjoy!\r\n  \r\n**NOTES:**\r\n  \r\n\r\n*The strawberries I chose are for obvious reasons. FA needs to be high, as it's  a weak flavor. I enjoy the combination of TFA Strawberry & FA Strawberry.*\r\n  \r\n*TFA Coconut Candy was used as a slight accent, and is only shyly present.*\r\n  \r\n*INW Raspberry is the BEST raspberry candy out there IMHO. So, its' inclusion was obvious.*\r\n  \r\n*CAP Vanilla Whipped Cream & FW White Chocolate add body and texture respectively. I find that the CAP Vanilla Whipped Cream also serves to tame Inawera's Raspberry so that it's  not so much in your face*\r\n  \r\n  \r\n*Best at 65-70% VG(I prefer 70%). Best after 7-10 day steep.*\r\n  \r\n#EJUICEMAKERS\r\n\r\n*Please ask permission to post this recipe elsewhere, as it was made to only be shared on ATF. You may not use this recipe for commercial profit.*",
