    "description": "What's up guys, I'm back at it again with a remix of my good buddy @Highwind's Smokin' Banana. His recipe was the one that introduced me to tobaccos and it is honestly a simple banger of a recipe. If you haven't mixed his recipe up yet I highly suggest that you do. \r\n\r\nHighwind and I were discussing on things that could be done to improve the recipe or even take it in another direction. In his description, he mentioned the use of Yellow Cake to turn this into more like a banana bread recipe and I thought to myself \"hey, I could do that!\" So I did. \r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nTPA Banana Cream and LA Banana Cream - these two banana flavors give us our banana portion of the mix. I like my banana bread with sliced bananas thrown in so these two flavorings in tandem give us enough banana flavor to contribute to the bread, as well as standing out as to act like sliced bananas inside the bread. \r\n\r\nFW Butterscotch Ripple, FW Cake (Yellow), FA Carmel and TPA RY4 Double - these make us the actual bread portion of the mix. Yellow Cake is our base, Butterscotch Ripple acts as those swirls that one would get inside the bread, Carmel is used to boost the butterscotch note and add sweetness and RY4 Double is used to give us that \"smoky\" flavor, as well as add upon the caramel\/Butterscotch notes. \r\n\r\nFA Almond - I like my banana bread with chopped almonds thrown into the batter before it is baked. At .75%, it simulates that experience and you almost have to search for the almond. \r\n\r\nTPA Double Chocolate (Clear) - I don't know about you guys, but my mom always used to too our banana bread with some chocolate syrup as it was still warm before serving it to me as a kid. You could totally leave this out if you want to, just it reminds me of my childhood. \r\n\r\nTFA Vanilla Swirl - Highwind used this in his recipe and I believe it just helps blend everything together while adding a nice smoothness to the mix. \r\n\r\nAnd there you guys have it: a way more complex version of my buddy's super simple mix. Be sure to check out Highwind's recipe! This guy is good to go right out the gate, but I suggest a week steep just to let the bananas settle down a bit and for everything to really meld together. \r\n\r\nSubs - you could totally substitute yellow cake for the JF version, just I still have about 2 ounces of FW left so gotta get rid of it somehow \ud83e\udd14 Also you can leave out the DCC as I said, I just like it cause that's how my momma used to make it. \r\n\r\nDeuces.

            "text": "Mm mmm!! This is a tasty burger! Kudos to the homie Parkus for doing a killer remix. I've got a giant bottle of the original mix nice and steeped up so I just set aside some of it and added the new tweaks, I subbed FW Yellow Cake for CAP Yellow Cake and I hear it's a little more icing heavy and not so cakey so I added a half percent of cake batter to balance it out, but either way no worries because it's mostly supporting the pre-existing smoky banana nut bread notes. &#xD;\nWhere this remix really shines in my opinion is the chocolate and almond addition, they slip right in the mix and sweeten and add a touch of new cream and add their own complexities, I taste them mostly in the body and exhale with the banana still upfront which is a great flow. A sweet addition to a sweet mix, much love \u270c\ufe0f"
