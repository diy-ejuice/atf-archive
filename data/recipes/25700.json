    "description": "This is the spawn of an effort to make INW Exotic Roots palatable. Here, Exotic Roots is up front and personal with its ginger and spice notes (if you have had the pleasure of meeting it, you know what I mean). INW Black Currant plays with Exotic Roots to tame it a bit and lend some creaminess that sinks the whole thing into the sweet base (Guanabana). INW Rhubarb takes up the very rear in this recipe to provide a fresh taste to the finish. A little spicy, a bit sweet, a tad earthy, and wholly satisfying, it takes just 3 days steep to fully appreciate the mouthfeel on this random beauty.",
