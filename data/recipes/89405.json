  "description": "I am very happy to be able to share this recipe with all of you. While this is not an original recipe created by me, it is one of my favorites. A big shout out to Beaufort Batches on ELR for allowing me to share this recipe on ATF.\r\n\r\nThe profile is basically described as kettle corn tossed in a glaze made of strawberry gelatin, marshmallows, yogurt, brown sugar and half and half cream and sprinkled with crushed up crunch berries.\r\n\r\nWhat I get out of this is an experience very true to the profile description. The use of the kettle corn, biscuit, and AP provide a very nice authentic popcorn note, and all of the other flavors combine beautifully to mimic the glaze.\r\n\r\nThis is one of many excellent recipes created by Beaufort Batches and I highly suggest mixing this one up. It is definitely the best popcorn vape I've tried so far. If you decide to give this one a try please drop by ELR and show BB some love with a rating or comment. Hope you all enjoy this one!",
