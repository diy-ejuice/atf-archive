    "description": "Straight forward waffles with maple syrup. I must say that I'm loving this one. Goes great with coffee and I've been enjoying this one throughout the day. Simple, rich, delicious. Works as a S&V, but obviously gets better with time. \r\n\r\nLB Belgian Waffle: Clearly the star of the show here. This one is absolutely legit. I knew I had to work with this one as soon as I smelled it. Great waffle flavor, certainly the best one that I've tried to date. \r\nFLV Milk & Honey\/FA Maple syrup: Work together to create the syrup note. The FA maple syrup gives the authentic maple note. Milk & Honey has a certain dark sweetness that I can only describe as molasses. It lends some body and a dark base that fits perfectly. \r\nJF Bavarian Cream: One of my favorite creams to add a slightly dark sweetness, round out harsh edges and really pull flavors together. This one has become my Swiss Army knife. \r\nTfa Butter: I mean, c'mon. Who doesn't want butter on their waffle? Are you a communist? \r\n",

It definitely added that syrup like consistency to the vape that is always missing with the maple flavors. I like how you let each flavor shine. It\u2019s layered really well, and all of the aspects come through clearly. Thanks for sharing!"

            "text": "Very nice waffle vape! It's got all the things I love and am looking for in this type of profile. LB Belgian Waffle carries that toasty savory bready base while the bav cream and milk &amp; honey bring in a decadent unctuous creamy base. Then add a touch of maple to your delicious breakfast treat. The sweetener I could have done without but I see why it's incorporated. Give this one a good steep as the flavors will mend together well over time. "
