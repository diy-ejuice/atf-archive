  "description": "The idea originally was to create a simple cucumber/watermelon profile. But as I played with the flavors I concluded that, although it was tasty, it was a bit boring. Adding some cantaloupe and a 2nd watermelon was good for perking the whole thing up. Fresh cream and a touch of lemon made it a little more interesting. ",

      "text": "Mission accomplished for a thick glass of pureed mixed melon and cucumber, but it seems to be crying out for something kind of coolant. That CAP Sweet Watermelon is a bit candied and it’s interesting how mixing it with cucumber here helps it be more like a natural watermelon, but it comes across as warm and a little soupy as-is and isn’t as refreshing as it should be. I think that has a lot to do with the TFA Cucumber, but rather than switching cucumbers, seems like it could be addressed with a little WS-23 or Polar Blast or both for a double-sided cooling effect.  &#xD;\n"
