The Bourbon &amp; Red Cinnamon do a great job of being Fireball in these amounts/ratio and I’ll probably steal that if I never need a Fireball whiskey component in a recipe, but the coffee in FLV Irish Cream is coming through aplenty here and just makes it taste weird. I mixed this up thinking maybe it would be covered up somehow but nope, cinnamon whiskey coffee cream is what I get and the coffee flavor makes it weird and a little gross. I wish they’d made Irish Cream without that stupid coffee note in it. &#xD;\n"
