  "name": "Cool Lemon Cookie by ID10-T",
  "description": "So, I had a head cold, my sinuses were dead, and worst, I'd just mixed a bunch of juices, and nothing was steeped. Desperate, I went to the \"What Can I Make With My Flavors\" thread on diy_ejuice. ID10-T threw this back at me. It was glorious. Shake and Vapable, and it cut through my dead sinuses. It was even better after a week.\r\n\r\nI'd give it five stars if he'd have posted it, but since he gave me the go ahead, as  \"The truth is, I've never vaped that exact recipe, I just looked over your ingredients and pulled it out of my ass like \"yeah, I bet that will be pretty good.\"\r\n\r\nSeeing as this came out a lightly frosted, sweet lemon cookie that was very cool? His ass must be a more magical place than candyland.",
