  "description": "Was influenced by Fizzmustard's Mustard Milk to start playing around with VBIC at a high %. Then Shyndo gave me the idea to try out apple here: \r\nhttps://alltheflavors.com/recipes/38862#d_cream_by_shyndo\r\n\r\nComes out to a really nice BlueBerry Ice Cream with the nice sweet/tart kick of apple. As though there's a slice of apple on the bite of ice cream. I really really like this and I hope you all enjoy :)",

Ive now found my new adv after having the same one for a year as nothing else came close to beating it. And you've inspired me to experiment with blueberry a bit more!! Oh and this was only after a 24 steep so i cant wait to see how it develops!"
