    "description": "I chose Purilum's Country Apple because it's the quintessential base for ANY fruit juice. FA Fuji...way too candyish.\r\n  \r\nFA ObaOba is added because I found it made the FA Watermelon(Red Summer) into a more 'thick' or pulpy-type of taste(similar-but not exactly like a smoothie), if that makes any sense.\r\n  \r\nThis was specifically made for a higher VG percentage, thus the higher percentages than are typically used.\r\n  \r\nYou will find a perfect strawberry-watermelon balance with a slight cotton candy background & odor. No sweetener is needed. Can be vaped as a s&v, but the watermelon pops after one day and the Country Apple settles down a bit.\r\n  \r\nIf you enjoy this recipe as is(substitutions are NOT recommended), please leave a review!\r\n  \r\nEnjoy!\r\n  \r\n**Please do not share this with any other websites. I only post to ATF for my own reasons and hope this is respected. Also, you may NOT reproduce this for commercial sale. \r\n \r\n  \r\n#EJUICEMAKERS for life!\r\n  \r\n",
