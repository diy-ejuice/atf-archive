  "description": "A lot of times i release recipes that are appealing to the public with short steep times and popular profiles well this isn't that. This recipe is more of something i made purely for myself in mind and more as a challenge because i tend to mix for fun by chasing harder more layered profiles when i am making juice.purely for myself. This is not really even a dessert or at least i dont think it is? I basically thought apple butter and creme brulee would taste great together and they did.. I will say i find this recipe goof after a week steep but its great after a long 2-3 weeks. I figured  with fall approaching and the length of steep time that now was a good time to release this recipe. I used .50% flavor west sweetener i have also used tfa marshmallow for ethyl maltal  instead of sucralose and both were good. With the marshmallow it is slightly muted by the use of ethyl maltal but still good i went all the way up to 2% with the marshmallow  but I prefer it with the sucralose but use whatever sweetener you want to.its your call everyones taste is different.",
