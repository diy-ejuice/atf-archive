  "description": "WF Angel Cake is just about the best spongy white cake that’s out there and it’s my personal favorite cake flavor. It tends to get pushed around by other flavors so I’m using it at 4% here to get a nice full cake flavor it’ll need to steep for a few weeks. \r\n\r\nWF Baked Strawberry is incredibly unique and extremely pleasant. It’s exactly a dark syrupy/jammy natural strawberry flavor and it paid really well with bakeries and creams. \r\n\r\nSpeaking of creams this recipe needs a little so I’m using WF Bavarian Cream just at 1% here. Well get that nice sticky sweet creamy texture with a little vanilla. \r\n\r\nLastly, I’m adding WF Caramel Butter to kind of blend the texture of all three flavors and add some sweet buttery notes to the finish. \r\n\r\nSweeten to Taste. \r\n\r\nWatch the Video Here:\r\nhttps://youtu.be/qyYHCzvbJH0",
