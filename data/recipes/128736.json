  "description": "This a buttery soft centered  snickerdoodle type cookie filled with  a creamy vanilla fudge \r\nThe cookie base is made with Snickedoodle by LB which by itself is a solid cookie flavor, JF biscut was added for a bit of texture and buttery notes .  FLV cookie dough creates that soft cookie center  very well.  \r\nWhite fudge by CC is a fantastic flavor and can be vaped all on its own   it is sweet and creamy and spot on  the vanilla marshmallow was added for some body and  mouth feel  \r\nMacadamia nut and Almond were added for some  texture  on the back end of the mix along with some buttery notes  that come through with the macadamia nut   \r\n\r\nLearn more about mixing here:\r\nfacebook - https://www.facebook.com/groups/diydownunder/\r\nDiscord - https://discord.gg/kH4Fqbc\r\nYoutube - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCTCwb7ULyfJALQlehomZZQA\r\nwebsite - https://www.diydownunder.com/",
