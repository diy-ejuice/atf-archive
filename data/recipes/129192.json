  "description": "This started out as an attempt to make a Chocolate cake with peanut butter icing, but turned out the be a creamy chocolate peanut butter. \r\n\r\nDx Peanut Butter: obviously used for the peanut butter, but I chose over the OG Pnut butter because it is way better and doesnâ€™t have the peanut skin taste i get from the og TPA and Flavorah. \r\n\r\nLB Lava Cake: Used for a chocolate syrupy note. \r\n\r\nVT Devon cream: used for some creaminess also has a decent chocolate note. \r\n\r\nFLV Chocolate Deutsch: I usually like to use FLV Sweet Coconut with my Pnut Butter mixs to make them extra creamy, but i went with Deutsch because it gives a really good chocolate coconut note. \r\n\r\nFE Sun Seed: A trick I stole from Fresh03 just a drop or 2 will make the Pnut Butter taste more authentic. \r\n\r\n\r\nNeeds around 10-14 days steep for it to fully come together. Please rate and review if you mix it. ",
