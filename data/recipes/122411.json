  "description": "This recipe is my ADV. It is very good as a SNV. The recipe really gains character the longer you let it steep. I have mixed it from Max PG all the way to 70pg/30vg and it is excellent throughout. My favorite times in steep are 10-15 days and anything after a month as there is an awkward period from 15 days to a month. I have some that is 3 months old and is still at its best",
