  "description": "Update after a few weeks. After a few weeks steep recipe is steeping nice. I also have another version which I will just update notes Here. You can sub out the fw butterscotch ripple, wf caramel butter and replace it with TPA butterscotch at 3% and FA Carmel at 0.75% give about 2 weeks as well. It will be more butterscotch top notes and a deeper caramel flavor. Both are good imo but that's up to you on how you want to mix the recipe ðŸ˜‹ enjoy.\r\n\r\nDiy Mixers Crew attempt at Steep PopDeez. #DMC #cloningwiththecrew #popdeez\r\n\r\nRecipe notes here=====> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQTSOsd8pbg\r\n\r\nNew mixers always welcome=====>  https://www.facebook.com/groups/dmcdiy/",
