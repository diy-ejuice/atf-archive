    "description": "A popular biscuit, raspberry jam and set vanilla cream sandwiched between 2 blonde shortbread discs. \r\n\r\nStarting with the biscuit I used CAP sugar cookie, INW biscuit and WF shortbread... I then added vanilla custard for richness and dried it all up with Acetyl Pyrazine.\r\n\r\nThe jam is self explanatory and that consists of VTA raspberry jam and FLV jammy berry twists the bright raspberry to a darker raspberry whilst also adding more of that pectin content.\r\n\r\nThe cream isn\u2019t actually a cream in the real deal biscuit,  it\u2019s more of a powdered sugar barely moistened and then vanillafied which sets to a sort of chocolate-less ganache so Vanilla buttercream frosting was the perfect choice, used fairly high here to climb above the custard.\r\n\r\nI suggest using Sucralose here to aid the buttercream and the jam  but it\u2019s entirely down to your taste and is subjective :)\r\n\r\nIf you like what I do and this recipe then please rate and review :)",

I tried a few variations one using FA King and it slotted in really well and another using WF strawberry Gummy Candy and that was good too. This is reminiscent of Ella's Shortbread biscuit but better as  who dosn't like cream and jam with their biscuits."
