    "description": "So I've been looking for that perfect apple pie cupcakes and I think that I found it here with this recipe and I tried using tfa vanilla cupcake but I just didnt get that flakey white cake cupcake I was looking for so I tried cap vanilla cupcake and that brought out everything I was looking. For the apple pie part of it I decided to go with cinnamon danish swirl as the main note and backed it with double apple for the juiciness and apple filling for the stickiness of the apples which made a very delicious apple pie cupcake recipe give it a mix guys and enjoy",
