    "description": "This is essentially a chocolate custard style dessert with a caramel sauce. It's not a thick caramel, but more of a brown sugar and butter mixture type sauce. \r\nThe custard base here is a combo of both CAP and INW. The INW is more of a realistic egg custard that's true to the dessert. I add the CAP here to lend that buttery note that it incorporates with that rich vanilla. This worked better than trying to add TFA or CAP butter in this mix. That butter note lends to authenticity of the caramel sauce.\r\nFLV Cream helps build on the cream note, but it also works to blend the custard and the chocolate.\r\nJF milk chocolate and HS Australian make a great pairing here. If you have the OG INW feel free to sub that for the JF but the new version doesn't work. The buttery note that's in CAP custard also helps the milk chocolate here. JF milk chocolate is pretty good but it needs some sort of fatty richness to help cream it out if that makes sense, and that's what happens here. The HS gives it a little darkness to the chocolate layer so it's a bakers chocolate and not a Hershey bar.\r\nOverall this is a very decadent mix. It has a balanced creamy custard note with a nice chocolate and caramel back note. If you like chocolate or custard then you need to give this a shot. Best of all it you don't have to wait weeks, I've vaped it after just 3 days but it's blended at it's best after 5 days. I've gone through 3-30ml bottles of this so I figured I'd share it with the world. Enjoy!",
