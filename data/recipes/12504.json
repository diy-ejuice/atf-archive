  "name": "Dinner Lady A Lemon Tart Remix",
  "description": "This is my remix of the popular UK e liquid lemon tart by dinner lady e liquids.\r\n\r\nDIYorDIE Runner up recipe of the year!!!\r\n\r\nThis was a very long journey and i hope i've done some justice in attempting to copy it..... even if i did'nt ha i hope i've created a tasty lemon tart for you all to enjoy. I've managed to create its profile very well with sharp lemon curd followed by a creamy fluffy meringue finishing off with a buttery pastry crust.\r\n\r\nnotes...\r\n\r\nFW Lemon meringue pie\r\n\r\nI needed a profile to start with and this flavour seemed to work,its profile works very well with the other ingredients its lemon flavour is very bright and more forward and stronger than capellas offering. The meringue and pastry wasn't an issue at the time because i knew that could be worked on. The 3% was enough as a starting point without it taking over the recipe.\r\n\r\nFA Lemon Sicily/Capella Juicy Lemon\r\n\r\nThis was the most tricky part of the recipe theres so many lemons to chose from it was a minefield and completely had my headspinning. I tried them all in various percentages and combinations. some were to authentic taking on a sour aspect that didn't suit the profile. I knew i already had a good lemon within the FW lemon meringue pie,but it wasn't bright enough. Everyone knows FA lemon sicily is a fantastic lemon so i had to use it. I pushed it to higher percentage because the lemon was the main profile of dinner lady lemon tart. It's vibrant and not sour and it really started to work in what i was trying to achieve. Again this was probably enough to complete the lemon profile but i was concerned overtime it might fade so another lemon i really liked and thought it would complement is capella juicy lemon. Adding a small percentage just built on each other creating a bolder lemon with some added sweetness and juice. They really work well together and that was the lemon complete.\r\n\r\nFA Custard PI 3.14\r\n\r\nI needed something to create the curd aspect i tried alot of variations and to this day this is one aspect that still bugs me and is something i'll go back to. However this seems my best option so it stays for the time being. It seems to work very well with combining with the lemons and the pie. Its not a heavy custard like capella vanilla custard which i did try and to some degree it works,but it does add vanilla which i didn't want in the recipe. Custard pi gives it that creamy curd feel and the custard also has citrus notes which is a win win and really works well into the lemons to create a kind of curd.\r\n\r\nTFA Graham Cracker Clear/INW Biscuit/Capella Golden Butter\r\n\r\nThese 3 created the pastry base and worked excellent into the lemon meringue pie base. I love graham cracker clear and i think its in the original it lends to a nice creamy biscuit base and adding the biscuit at a lower percentage and the butter works its magic in creating a nice pastry filling.\r\n\r\nFA Meringue\r\n\r\nWe all now about this flavour it just works!!!! its in the original and it had to be in here. it's really forward in the original and pushing it to 1.5% is enough to give you that fluffy light mouthfull.\r\n\r\nSweetner\r\n\r\nI added 0.75% mainly down to it being mainstream juice the original is sweet so why not,a little of whats good doesn't hurt . I also feel it tones down the lemons and turns them more into a cooked lemon rather than a sour fresh squeezed lemon. you can leave it out should you wish its still great without it.\r\n\r\nTFA Bavarian Cream\r\n\r\nI added this at a small percentage just to combine the whole recipe ,it also works well into the custard and lemons and hopefully ups the curd aspect aswell as adding a little glue to the recipe and not drying it out.\r\n\r\nSTEEP TIME 3+ DAYS",

I was so looking forward to this recipe and although it is a decent representation of a lemon tart, CAP Juicy Lemon is not the right lemon for me. It adds an overpowering lemon flavor and is quite astringen. It's like all I get. I understand you're going for that lemon zest flavor but lemon zest is sprinkled lightly over the top. The lemon zest in this recipe is the main note. Not good.. Also, a tart shell is more like a shortbread cookie instead of a graham and NIlla wafer combo. Don't get me wrong, it is a good recipe but for my tastes it has some rather large problems."
