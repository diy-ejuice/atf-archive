That combination of FLV Citrus Soda and VT Fizzy Sherbet is an awesome base for a legitimately fizzy citrus soda. I don\u2019t think this recipe would be possible without FLV Rose Essence being so subtle, and the way he used a little Cherry Extract to make it a little redder and sweeter was genius. I think I\u2019d like it with a little cooling to make it extra refreshing next time, but not too much that it ruins the balance of flavors here.  "
