  "description": "A spicy decadent Carrot Cake with Vanilla Buttercream Frosting....\r\n\r\nSoon it will be that time of year. A chill in the air. Along with the chill comes the spiced pumpkin lattes and cakes. I'll be honest. I can't stand carrot cake. Carrots in a cake??? Hmmmm no. VTA Carrot Cake as a vape?? Amazing!!! The sweet spot is at 5%. It is a wonderfully deep-rounded cake. I wanted to give the cake a spicy aspect. I didn't have to look far. FLV Pumpkin Spice compliments VTA Carrot Cake wonderfully. This stuff is strong so I only needed .7%. VTA Vanilla Buttercream Frosting is a deep and delicious cream. It's so buttery and thick. With VTA Carrot Cake there's no need to add that many flavors. I kept it simple and I'm really enjoying it.\r\n\r\nEnjoy and share your feedback.",
