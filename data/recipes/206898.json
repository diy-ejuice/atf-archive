  "description": "INW Yes, We Cheesecake is a wonderful, creamy, authentic cheesecake with graham crust that makes an excellent base for this recipe. We're using it here as the main note at 4%.\r\n\r\nI wanted to really crank up the graham cracker note so I added 2% TFA Cheesecake (Graham Crust) it's a really great buttery graham crust that pairs nicely with the INW. \r\n\r\nI didn't the lime to be sharp or the main note but I wanted to be able to taste it. VT Persian Lime is a solid zesty lime juice. I've used it at 1% here, that's just enough to make itself known but not dilute or overpower the mix. \r\n\r\nIt was important for me for this recipe to have a vanilla note, as I'm (loosely) attempting to recreate the juice I used to quit smoking. OOO Marshmallow Vanilla is a good sticky, little sweet vanilla note here at 0.5%. \r\n\r\nSweeten to Taste.\r\n\r\nWatch the Video Here:\r\n\r\nhttps://youtu.be/iFmltXIR4iM",
