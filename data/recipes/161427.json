  "description": "!!!Beeing Hasty i immediately improved this with 1% FW Blood Orange. Sorry.\r\nAnd. OH! 0.5% LA Tart and Sour. DUH!!!\r\nTo eager to share a nice discovery.\r\n\r\nI sent for some rda's. As i opened the padded envelope i found a complimentary e-liquid.\r\nStrawberry Orange with a creamy note.\r\nAs my wife deemed it yummy i thought i try my hand at improving it.\r\nInspired by Wanes https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/161224 to use CAP Strawberries and cream.\r\nI pulled this out of the closet, my atempt to make an improvement, call it a remix if you wish. \r\nIt's delicious right of the shake. Maby it stays that way.\r\nCheers.",

I did have to make a couple of subs to it for I didn't have a few of the flavors.  I subbed the LA Tart and Sour with TPA's Sweet and Tart and I subbed the Wild Strawberry from INW and used Strawberry from INW. Overall it's smooth and tasty. Thanks for sharing!"
