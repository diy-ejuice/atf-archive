  "description": "Something a little different from a normal Peaches&Cream. At first I was simply trying to do a peaches and cream with a little basil, but it wasn't working out how I wanted. Adding a little CAP Cucumber really brought the basil to where I wanted it. Then the peaches weren't coming out right, so a little lemon and strawberry kicked the recipe into gear. To lay a nice foundation I went with a simple Greek Yogurt and Vanilla, which I like because it doesn't distract too much from the main players in the recipe.",
