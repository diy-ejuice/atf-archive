This icy mix doesn\u2019t do it. It delivers the refreshment, berry, and grape that was promised and is a heck of a lot better than Berry Mix by itself, but doesn\u2019t quite mitigate that off note in Berry Mix that reminds me of cold sore medicine. This tastes like it would be great, or at least better, with literally any other mixed berry in place of that TFA stuff - WF Bumbleberry, FA\/JF\/VT \u201cForest\u201d berries, FLV Berry Blend. Even CAP Harvest Berry would probably be an big improvement. "
