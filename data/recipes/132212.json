      "text": "A refreshing berry and grape mix? I was interested in trying this to see if someone had figured out away to make that otherwise kinda gross TFA Berry Mix work really well. This icy mix doesn’t do it. It delivers the refreshment, berry, and grape that was promised and is a heck of a lot better than Berry Mix by itself, but doesn’t quite mitigate that off note in Berry Mix that reminds me of cold sore medicine. This tastes like it would be great, or at least better, with literally any other mixed berry in place of that TFA stuff - WF Bumbleberry, FA/JF/VT “Forest” berries, FLV Berry Blend. Even CAP Harvest Berry would probably be an big improvement. "
