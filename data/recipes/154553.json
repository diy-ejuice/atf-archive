  "description": "Inspired by a The Mixin Vixens challenge.\r\n\r\nThis didn't quite make it into a pomegranate/strawberry smoothie, but I enjoyed it as is.\r\n\r\nThe Strawberry Taffy adds sweetness, flavor and mouth-feel to the yogurt.  It was the first time I had used this flavor, and I was pleased with how it paired with the yogurt.  The Pomegranate and Spearmint give the punch needed for a summertime vape.\r\n\r\nTested on a Wasp Nano, SS316 0.31 ohm.  I liked it at around 50 watts.  I mixed this at 50/50 VG/PG, but I don't recommend vaping this at low wattage due to significant flavor loss.\r\n\r\n",
