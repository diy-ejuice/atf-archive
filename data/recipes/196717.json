  "description": "Ok this recipe was definitely a challenge since I haven't worked with any types of chocolate vapes and quite frankly I don't enjoy them. I did like the white chocolate in (LB) white chocolate peppermint  and I'm also Strawberry blind and prefer raspberries so here it is White chocolate raspberry pie....(notes) This recipe will definitely receive some further development Needs a few days for the floral notes in the raspberry jam to steep out and (WF) strawberry cheesecake  needs a bit to mature as well as the white chocolate. ( I used  WF strawberry cheesecake to help the raspberry. I built this recipe to the simplest form and could easily be turned up a notch if you wanted to 15% total flavor in the calculator...thanks to the guys at Developed ðŸ˜ŽðŸ¤™ (Testing on a Shenray Hadley Ni80 Alien coil 0.40 ohms 30watts )",
