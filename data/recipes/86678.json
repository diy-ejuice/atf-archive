    "name": "Orange Butter Drops",
    "description": "This can be a shake and vape, but gets much better around day 3. Great for a cold, reminds me of a cough drop that is buttered and orange. Please note *VT Orange* was used in this recipe.  All instructions were courtesy of Vape Train. I mix this at 70 vg 30 pg. You could add some menthol to this too around 0.5%.\r\nPlease note nicotine was used in the recipe I made and was still great to vape!",
