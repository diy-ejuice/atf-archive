    "description": "This isn\u2019t taking away nothing from the original recipe that one deserves its place in the mixing community however I always thought I could improve on the recipe in creating something fuller,simpler and easier to mix and upon development I think I\u2019ve achieved that.\r\nThis time I\u2019ve ripped it apart so it shouldn\u2019t really be compared with the original remix and it should be respected in its own rights and not really be compared.\r\n\r\nHere\u2019s some quick notes but without writing a biography just mix it up and compare the 2 and I\u2019ll let you decide but in my opinion V2 wins hands down purely over its simplicity and maintaining a fuller pastry and lemon flavour.\r\n\r\nFa Apple pie\r\n\r\nA wonderful pastry base that should work when you want some crust. It doesn\u2019t lend a Apple flavour when used low but more a buttery crumbled pastry.\r\n\r\nFa cookie \r\n\r\nThis compliments the Apple pie perfectly adding another level to the Apple pie adding texture and a deeper baked pastry.\r\n\r\nCap lemon meringue pie\r\n\r\nOriginally I loved fw lemon meringue pie but unfortunately I feel this is a more balanced profile it doesn\u2019t shout lemon but it\u2019s other properties fit perfectly in what I\u2019m achieving so it\u2019s a given and a perfect base to the recipe to build around.\r\n\r\nFe lemon \r\n\r\nIf only this was available first time round it\u2019s a perfect lemon which doesn\u2019t fade much when bumped up in percentages. It sits wonderfully in the recipe and I wouldn\u2019t use any other lemon in making this profile. It works great in dessert recipes but may not work in other profiles.\r\n\r\nCap butter\r\n\r\nWouldn\u2019t be a pastry recipe without a little butter it adds additional properties to the pastry as well as curding the lemon.\r\n\r\nFa meringue \r\n\r\nIt was in the original and it returns this time round. It\u2019s a remix of the original dinner lady and it\u2019s profile states meringue so it has to stay. However this time less is more 1% sits perfectly and melds together the whole recipe.\r\n\r\nCap super sweet \r\n\r\nA Remix needs some commercial sweetness.",

The combination of apple pie's crust flavor and cookie gives the recipe a perfect mellow crust quality. I had to pick up FE Lemon to make it, and I'm glad I did. The lemon in it is sweet and not overpowering, and fits in this profile amazingly. I definitely recommend this to anyone that enjoys a lemon dessert, it will not let you down. "
