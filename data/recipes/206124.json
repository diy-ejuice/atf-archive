  "name": "Berried Cream MTL",
  "description": "I wanted a mixed berry and sweet cream (my typical adv) for my kayfun using some new additions (mb the most sweet cream) to my flavoring collection. This is definitely a work in progress that will most likely be tweaked and played with in the coming weeks to see if there is any room for improvement  I am however quite satisfied after adding cap ss and allowing a 5 day steep. Thanks to @wolfwheeler and @duncanyoyo1 for their assistance.",
