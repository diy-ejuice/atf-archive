  "description": "**Carnival**\r\napple stuffed soft pretzel\r\n\r\nThis was a fun recipe to develop.  I started working on this on the Mixing with me Mates episode #25 on Bakery.  I wanted to use my Pretzel Dough, and I thought LB Bakers Touch may give it that special touch along with Salted Caramel VT  It was yummy, but not quite a soft pretzel.  The next episode of Mixing with me Mates, #26, we talked about additives.  My mate, The @VapinTrucker talked about how Cereal 27 was great to add texture to pretzel.  Ahhh, so let me go back to my recipe and try this.  So, here is what I have, and shows why mixing together, we **discover**.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Have you tried this recipe?!**\r\n**Please rate this recipe and comment below! I would LOVE to hear your experience.**",
