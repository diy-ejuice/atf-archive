So here is a better lemon cake version.\r\n\r\nSlightly Buttery(Cap Golden Butter) With a little hint of fresh lemon(FA Lemon Sicily) and a sweetness (FA Cookie) added to the original lemon cake, and Bakers Flavors/Vaping Zone Super Concentrates Gourmet(rebranded) makes the perfect sweet cream cheese flavor.\r\n\r\n\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nYou are free to\r\nShare — copy and redistribute the material in any medium or format\r\nAdapt — remix, transform, and build upon the material\r\n\r\n(The licensor cannot revoke these freedoms as long as you follow the license terms.)\r\n\r\nUnder the following terms:\r\n\r\nAttribution — You must give appropriate credit, provide a link to the license, and indicate if changes were made.
