    "description": "***NOT A SNV(there's a reason why I changed the recipe name from \"S'mich\" to \"20-Day Steepwich\"!! Trust me on this...***\r\n \r\n  \r\n***NOTES & B.S.:*** \r\nThe OBVIOUS choice for the **peanut butter** was **TFAs**. It's just such a great flavor that can be easily overtaken at low percentages. So I cranked that shit WAY up! TFA PB lacks(to me) the roasted peanut flavor I taste in *real* peanut butter. Enter **FLV Peanut Butter** and you've got yourself one excellent peanut butter base to build upon. \r\n  \r\nThe result of adding the next 2 flavorings is a thick\/creamy, salty peanut butter. Anyone who loves peanut butter vapes knows there is **always** something lacking. And my mix *was* no different. My peanut butter definitely needed an additional shove in the right direction. And I found a GREAT use for **VT Avocado Cream** in the process. The way this concentrate thickened that peanut butter up is nothing short of miraculous! This flavoring is vital to this recipe. It can't be subbed & it can't be omitted. Add to that **FW Salted Caramel**, and you've got one nicely rounded-out peanut butter. JIF, anyone?\r\n   \r\n\r\nFor the strawberry portion of my sandwich, I wanted something a little different. I didn't really want a \"jam\". I wanted more of a strawberry pie-filling vibe. This nuance is what makes **VT Glazed Strawberries** a very necessary part of this recipe. It can't be subbed. It can't be omitted. I added to that **CAP's Sweet Strawberry** for both sweetness *and* a syrupy quality.\r\n  \r\n**FA Joy**=my bread. I'm not a huge user of Joy because I'm one of those people who tastes beer. But if you aren't like me, feel free to crank your Joy up to 0.5-1%.\r\n  \r\nI didn't add sweetener to my final version, as I found-for me-sweetener killed my peanut butter texture(no matter how low or which sweeteners I used) & killed the \"tingly\" feeling on my tongue left by the VT Glazed Strawberries. Textures, to me, are what make this recipe unique and memorable. I encourage you to try this 1st without sweeteners(at 20 day's steep of course). If you find you need it? Add it. But don't blame *me* if your PB texture disappears :)\r\n  \r\nI've found that around 48 watts, this flavor has a nice balance of where I want it to be in terms of no one flavor taking the lead(0.4 ohm flatwire coil). I kept my airflow 1\/4-1\/3 open. At around 60 watts, it's more on the salty side. And the peanut butter is more of a salty \"peanut\" flavor, as opposed to a peanut *butter*. At 75 watts, the sweetness kicks back in and the strawberry is more dominant. The recipe morphs alot dependent upon what temperature you kick it at. Have fun playing around & finding the setting you want. I found that to be a fun part of vaping it!\r\n  \r\n**FYI:**  Unsteeped the recommended amount of days, this will taste very weird(VT Glazed Strawberries needs to steep. I can't even describe the wretchedness of this flavor when fresh.). I nearly trashed this whole recipe after I'd tasted it fresh. I felt there was NO way a horrible flavor could steep into how I wanted it to steep. Imagine my shock and surprise when this actually turned out the way I'd intended!!\r\n  \r\n**VG** recommended is **75%**. This eliquid is meant to be thick and the percentages will stand out even at a high VG like 75%.\r\n  \r\n\r\n  \r\nAs always, I hope you enjoy this. It was quite a tricky recipe to work out. But when I finally settled on the flavors I wanted, the percentages just fell into place.\r\n  \r\nI ask that you don't use my recipe for commercial profit. I also ask that you don't share it to any other websites. I thank you for respecting me in my wishes. \r\n  \r\nI continue to worship the ground that the **E-Juice Makers** crew walk on. Their knowledge, work, and generosity is far superior to my own. And yet, they welcome me like one of their own. I love them more than they know!! \r\n\r\n  \r\n***#EJUICEMAKERS for life!!***",

TPA PB and FLV PB is my favorite PB combo so points for doin' it right. Great idea adding FW Salted Caramel for a roasted element. VT Glazed Strawberries pair so nicely with CAP Sweet Strawberry for a perfect jammy jam. I couldn't find one thing to complain about. 5 Star juice. I really hope this gets more hype; You deserve it. -vix"
