  "description": "After trying a few strawberry kiwi recipes and while i was trying to nail down a recipe with CAP lemon lime in it, I finally came up with a great mix that I enjoyed. It's a full on candy fruit profile. The CAP lemon lime is the real star in the mix, it creates a fantastic candy profile that pairs well with strawberry and kiwi.",
