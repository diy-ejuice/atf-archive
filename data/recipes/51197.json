    "description": "This is a little different spin on the Sweet Leaf recipe by Vurve, with the addition of DFS flavors Holy Holy Grail RY4 and Holy Vanilla as well. Gives it a little more richer flavor to me and a little different profile as well but definitely reminiscent of the original :P Just paying homage to one of the great simple and amazing recipes out there!\r\n\r\n***If you mix this, please leave a review and let me know what you think or if you think there is something that could be changed to make it better!***",

The holy vanilla and shisha come together to give a nice vanilla tail, and the Ry4 gives a slight sweetness to bring together the tobaccos and vanilla. This might become an ADV for me. I think next time I'm going to sub HS RY1 for the RY4 and see how it goes."
