  "description": "Sweet and creamy carrot pudding with caramel and ginger topped with Pistachio.\r\n\r\nFLV - Vanilla Pudding/FLV - Cream/TPA - Butter: This is the base that gives this mix a nice, creamy feel. The vanilla pudding is there for a hint of texture, the cream brings everything together and adds a cream note; butter gives that richness you would expect from something that has reduced down into a thick, creamy pudding consistency.\r\n\r\nTPA - Pistachio: This is the topping, adds a nutty quality that mixes well with the creams and the brown sugar/caramel.\r\n\r\nTPA -Brown Sugar/TPA - Caramel (Orig): The sugary sauce. Adds a deep, complex sweetness. The caramel adds a hint of smokiness, gives the carrot pudding a feel of being cooked and reduced to a heavenly dessert.\r\n\r\nCAP - Gingerbread: This is used more for the ginger note than anything. This gives a great baked ginger feel to anything that has a \"cooked\" quality, and fits right in here.\r\n\r\nFLV - Carrot: This here is the star of the show. This is a shockingly accurate peel/grated carrot. Very bright and you can taste the shavings. The challenge here was making this fresh carrot feel baked. I feel that I achieved that with this mix. It tastes like it has been cooked down, but still retains a slight bite to the carrot. \r\n\r\nAll in all, this was fun to make, and it tastes amazing. If you are looking to get out of your comfort zone, hit this up and let me know how you liked it! I suggest at least a 3-5 day steep for the butter/caramel/sugar to settle down. This really shines after a week. Personally i let it sit 2 weeks and fell more in love. It tastes like it gets richer over time.",
