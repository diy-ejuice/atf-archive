  "description": "There's one word that captivates this vape: balanced. It's sweet, but not too much. It's tangy, but not too much. It has punchy, vibrant fruits and berries - not too many to overwhelm, not too few to not leave you guessing - and it's not harsh. It's really creamy, but not in the heavy cloying custard kind of way. It's also not an innovative flavor profile per se, but it's still unlike anything I've had.\r\n\r\nThis tastes more like a smoothie that's meant to be drunk than a straight up yogurt meant to be eaten. It's suuppeerrr smooth throughout the vape and really leaves me craving for another drag every time.\r\n\r\nThe yogurts and butter cream create a suprisingly thick, slightly sweet and perfectly tangy cream base which works well with the strong, dark and tart Harvest Berry, the sort of candylike Kiwi and the Blueberry Extra that bends the berry notes away from the blackcurrant in Harvest Berry and towards realistic forest fruits. EM takes away the chalkiness in the yogurt. I got the idea of using FA Kiwi in this recipe from Killberry Yogurt by MikeC / VHM, that Kiwi has got some SERIOUS secret ingredient potential going on.\r\n\r\nMix this. You won't regret it.\r\nOvernight steep - optimal at 3 days. After that, I don't notice any significant changes.",
