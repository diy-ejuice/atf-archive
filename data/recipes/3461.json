Imo its really accurate to the profile this recipe is going for. Will probably mix this one up again if im ever craving a poptart flavor. Great replacement for the real deal. "

      "text": "This is a pretty decent attempt at a pop-tart.  I was more curious as to how this would accurately represent a pop-tart because I've never had a good one that mimics the real thing. I'd say this tastes more like a pop-tart before its been toasted.  Kind of has that raw pastry taste. It's a good way to have a strawberry vape but mix it up from the millions of strawberries and cream we've all had."
