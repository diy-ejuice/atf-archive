  "name": "Orgazm",
  "description": "This project started out as an attempt to clone the popular commercial liquid with a similar name. Orgasm by One Up is a staple in my wife's rotation, and if she could find it by the quart, I'm quite certain she'd buy it. After mixing several iterations of my take on what's in it, I've settled on this one. While I believe I fell short on the clone aspect, it came out PDG! You may find this plenty sweet without the sweetener,but, the original is loaded with it.  I'd like to know what you think about this little diamond in the rough. \r\nStay Safe...And keep mixing!\r\n",
