    "description": "Apple Pie; Macdonald style. \r\nThe gooey filling really shines. \r\nFA Fuji is like a very hard apple flavour to me, and I wanted a soft pie filling so it is used as a booster rather than a main note here. Which it does beautifully.\r\nFA Pear is used to add a bit more softness and sweetness to the filling.\r\nFA Apple Pie gives both a touch of Apple as well as the base for the crust. \r\nFA Zeppola is the essential component that gives the crust that 'fried' note. \r\nFA CustApple is again giving more soft, baked Apple notes and helps to bring all the components together. \r\nFA Caramel is used for the sweetness it lends to both filling and crust. \r\nCAP Cinnamon Danish is also on double duty. The pastry notes aid the crust, and that soft cinnamon permeates the filling without overpowering it.\r\n\r\nSo there you have it! A nearly FA exclusive recipe, CAP CDS is such a great flavour though, there was no way I could leave it out of this one!\r\nI found it enjoyable after a day steep, but as usual it benefits from a few days to really settle in. \r\nCan add a little sweetener if that's your thing; I like it with and without it, pretty sweet on its own. Enjoy!\r\n\r\n",
