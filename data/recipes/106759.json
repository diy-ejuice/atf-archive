    "description": "UPDATE: If you're thinking of mixing this, you might be more interested in my newer recipe \"resolver\". I'm only leaving this one up because it was the starting point for what became a much better, more fleshed out recipe. Resolver is the culmination of my efforts to improve on this profile. However, if you're the curious type, go on ahead and mix both for comparison's sake. Personally I find this version gets a bit green or \"vegetal\"- presumably from all of that strawberry ripe mixing with those notes in fa kiwi.\r\n\r\nBefore I got into DiY, BlueDot Vapors was my go-to juice vendor. They had solid prices and some really good mixes, and most importantly, they never used added sweetener so I could actually get some lifespan out of my coils. The juice I couldn't stop coming back to was Strawkiji Freeze- a simple strawberry kiwi flavor with a bit of menthol. Now that I'm mixing for myself, I want to recapture the magic of my obsession with this juice, and possibly even improve upon it in the process. ",
