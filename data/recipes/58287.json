    "description": "Back when I was a young lad, my parents and i took many trips up to the pocono mountains. There we would have a cabin with a small grill out front. The hotdogs and burgers were good but i looked forward mostly to dessert. This tradition continued when i started hosting bbqs. These are a hit along with my grilled pineapples with brown sugar.  \r\nSo u take a banana put a nice split in it, fill the inside with chocolate and marshmallow. Wrap in tin foil and set it on the grill and wait for the magic to happen.\r\nChocolate is a PITA to get even close to as satisfying as IRL. Bf chocolate truffle plus fa fresh cream to get some more milkyness is there.\r\nI used these 2 bananas and even tho they are similar in build i find mixing the 2 of them together is alot better then some of the off notes when taking either one too high on its own.\r\nKentucky bourbon just a bit to give that banana some more warmth and taste \"cooked\".\r\nThis marshmallow  combo is pretty legit. Toasted marsh is not a new flavor but when mixed with PuR marsh it just takes it to a new level. Get that pur marsh it has become my fav one it is very accurate to a real marshmallow with that powdery puffed taste.\r\nShoutout Id10-T he tried v1 via mixersclub and gave some nice recommendations to add to this mix. THANKS AGAIN DAVE!\r\nEnjoy!",

I've had had this strange lovechild of a s'more and a banana split, but now I feel like I'm in the Poconos doing just that. DJ Mills knocked another one out of the park! "
