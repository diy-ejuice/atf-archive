  "description": "An eclectic blend of RED heroes creating a mezmerising taste sensation.\r\n\r\nINW Rhubarb is what it says on the label... This is an eerily authentic rhubarb in a bottle and encapsulates the distinctive sour & fruity rhubarb taste perfectly. It's sharpness and slight sweet notes lends itself perfectly as a pairing with strawberry.\r\n\r\nRF strawberry brings an authentic, fresh strawberry, burst to blend beautifully with TFA Strawberry. Combined, they create a magical union of RED.\r\nI tried various combinations of strawberry but settled on a real strawberry taste rather than than the popular and unrealistic strawberry notes. \r\n\r\nAs raspberry can overpower a recipe in an instant, I opted for Sweet raspberry to bring the sweet, slightly tangy raspberry feel, boosted by the authenticity of  FA Berryl.  The wateriness inherently present in Sweet strawberry lends itself perfectly here as it tames some of the stonger flavours, especially the Rhubarb.  I tried both FA Raspberry in INW Raspberry and felt that Berryl was less aggressive and sat much better here to create the final RED layer.\r\n\r\nFA Cream fresh adds a slight creaminess and binds our RED trio, whilst providing a subtle mouthfeel to make the mix more harmonious.\r\n\r\nGive this baby 5 days or so for the Rhubarb to settle and allow the REDness to shine!!\r\n \r\n",
