  "description": "Very aromatic and tasty. Minimum 3 days steep, gets even better after a week or two if you can make it last that long.  If you don't care much for Koolada, back it down or leave it out completely!\r\n\r\nmore here: http://e-liquid-recipes.com/recipe/755559/Grape+Ice+Cream+Cone+%2528AKA+Dank%2529\r\n\r\nNote 6/16/18:  I should put in that TFA Bavarian Cream works as a fine sub while still maintaining the profile.  I actually ran out of FW some time ago and have been using TFA with not a lot of difference!",

I waited a week just to give the VBIC some time and man is this good. I've seen FA Joy used as a cone-type flavoring before and it does a great job in this recipe as well. I would definitely recommend this if you want to try a traditional profile with an excellent twist. It is indeed......DANK"
