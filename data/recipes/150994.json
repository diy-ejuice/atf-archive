  "description": "Imagine the feeling you have on a hot summer day. Maybe chilling with some friends at home in your garden, maybe on the beach. You're thirsty so you grab one of these bottles as shown in the thumbnail, and you feel as if you're in heaven. This is the feeling this recipe tries to capture.\r\n\r\nMy goal was to recreate the taste of one of these as accurately as possible. After tweaking V1 some more, I think I even got a bit closer to it.\r\nTPA - Sweet Tea: I went with this, because when I originally smelled it, it smelled just like this particular tea I was trying to recreate. I used it at 6% because it builds our Tea Base and is a fairly weak flavor.\r\nFA - Black Tea: This tea provides the bitterness you can taste in this drink. Since it's a very intense flavor, I used it at 0.5% to get that bitter sidenote, but kept it low so it won't be too overpowering.\r\nCAP - Juicy Lemon: Imagine making a tea and not adding some citrus to it. Who on earth would do such thing? That's why we have 2% of this juicy lemon in there, to get a nice citrus touch, but as well, keep it on the ground.\r\nCAP - Super Sweet: Some people like it sweet, some don't. I do, and since the drink itself is very sweet, I decided to go with an astounding 0.25 Super Sweet.\r\nLast but not least, to top everything off, TPA - Juicy Peach: To be honest, this is where I was really unsure. I think though, Juicy Peach provides a really nice top note. On it's own, it smells like a very rich, natural Peach. That's why I decided to throw some\r\nFA - White Peach in there as well. It smells much less intense, but really candy-like. It reminds me of the taste of those Haribo Peaches, if anyone knows those.\r\nAlso, I used some WS-23 to really give it an \"iced\" feeling. I used it at 0.5 since I haven't used it often, but you can definitely use more of it :)\r\n\r\nFULL CREDIT TO THE THUMBNAIL/ARTWORK GOES TO @Zany",
