    "description": "This is the closest thing to the OG derailed from Suicide Bunny.  If you are sensitive to the Peppery notes from TFA custard you can mix it with Cap Custard but I would lower the % to somewhere between 3% and 4%. This recipe benefits from added PG I'm not exactly sure why because I'm not a chemist but there is a difference when I made it max VG. Steep time is minimum 2 weeks. but best after 4 weeks. ",

Second time I had to sub banana cream for LA banana cream and also sub tpa custard for CAP custard, still delicious. &#xD;\nUsed to be a big fan of Suicide bunny\u2019s line but haven\u2019t had it in years. Don\u2019t remember derailed being this good. Bravo. "
