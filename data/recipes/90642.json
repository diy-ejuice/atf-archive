            "text": "The vanilla here from the Shisha manages to give the whipped marshmallow a floral light spicy vanilla top note  with undertones of vanillin extract After a week long steep the whipped Marshmallow lends a pillowy fluffy texture to the body while on the exhale the creamy white sweet vanillin note pops like a vanillin pod in spring. I think 5% Holy Vanilla would push the vanilla more forward in the recipe along with 12%  CAP French Vanilla. Apart from that, this is a smooth buttery and fluffy vanilla vape for any vanilla lover out there. "
