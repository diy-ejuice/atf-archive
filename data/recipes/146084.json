    "description": "My take on an elderflower gin  gimlet - this  is not for everyone but if you like a different  profile  and enjoy florals this may be for  you \r\non the inhale you get the apple lime that transitions to the rose and elderflower sweetness with  a  light dry gin finish \r\n\r\nRose  essence   is very light  but noticeable along  with  elderflower  which is very much to  me like the st germain   aperitif flavors- they create the mid  notes f and pick up on the botanical notes from the gin \r\nApple creates some juiciness and  top note sweetness, it also  pulls  in some of the notes from the rose.  it used her to help balance this mix for the dryness of the gin \r\ngolden syrup creates some base syrup sweetness  that is similar to simple syrup  in a cocktail \r\nMelon rind is like  the  white and green part of a watermelon - it i is very similar to the inner white part of a cucumber.  used here for some  slight  wetness  \r\nLime   adds some tartness and is  essential for a  gimlet ",
