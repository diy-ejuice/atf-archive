      "text": "This vape is amazing. It's actually what pushed me over the edge to do DIY. This flavour you just can't get commercially. It's sweet, but not too sweet. It has this nice earthy banknote with the Kinako soy and Lovage Root. It's balanced, it gives that frappucino sense to it, more the creamy side of it. It's not quite matcha, but it has most of it's essence. It's something different. It's a beautiful recipe. Steep it for 6-7 days though.   "
