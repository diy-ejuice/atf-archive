  "description": "Hey Mixers, Been awhile since I put  a bakery out , but after a long hiatus, I decided to work on my Ms Applebumm Pie.\r\nI did some research on Crust and pairings and tried to close in on  an even more authentic apple pie tasting vape.\r\nMy original recipe was heavy on the FLV apple filling , giving it a McDonalds style apple pie flavor , which IMHO is heavy on the cinnamon notes, in this recipe I wanted to get closer to a nicely balanced mix with everything working in harmony and nothing really over powering the mix.. What I get on the Inhale: Cinnamon very hinty, then as the vape settles on my tongue I taste the apples and hint of cinn and sweetness, on the exhale I get the whole enchilada and the golden flaky crust with a hint of a butter note. In this mix I was really working on the Crust aspect with what ingredientsi have on hand , and chose : INW Biscuit - for its flakiness and butter notes, TPA Cinnimon Sugar cookie- to help with the Cinn note and some grittiness to add with the texture, and TPA AP for a darker bakery note I used the AP very sparingly to avoid the \" Frito affect\". For my Filling as always my favorite FLV apple filling ….no explanation needed as I have raved about this flavor in previous recipes… as well as MB Eden Apple another awesome flavor if you aren't using Molinberry flavs  by now your late…. Lol… and one of Waynes Favs FA Fuji Apple another Must have in any flavor aresenal- this flavor just adds some sparkle to the other apples in this mix .. All three are a power combo… please enjoy this recipe as much as I do …… Love yah guys and gals KEEP MIXING…..\r\n",
