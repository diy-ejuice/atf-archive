  "name": "Apple Dapple You",
  "description": "Another of my first originals. Wanted to go for the \"apple cereal\" flavor without using the name brand as the title. So I used one of the knock off names with a Prince song twist :) \r\nUsing Fuji Apple and Apple Pie together allowed the apple to easily meld with a more sugary cereal flavor without it tasting like two separate mixes. Sugar Cookie for added sweetness and some of the bakery. Finally, AP gives it a bit of graininess that was much needed when I was testing it without. Will be opening the books again on this flavor soon, working with other possible meringues and/or bakery flavors, tweaking %'s, etc. Welcome feedback and criticisms of all kinds on this recipe.",
