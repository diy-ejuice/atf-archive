    "description": "For a fun addition to this you can add 0.25% of FLV Cool Mint to make it a mint chocolate pudding.  \r\n\r\nI would also like to note, that initially it won't be extremely sweet.  As it steeps for 1 to 2 weeks the FLV sweetness starts to come out a lot more and it seems to get sweeter as time goes on.  If you need blast you in the face sweet, as much as I hate to say it, 0.5% Cap SS will achieve that effect, but it will also kill your coils. FLV sweetness takes a bit longer to come out, but is a very clean sweet that will leave a sweet note in your mouth but won't leave the sugar taste on your lips...it also doesn't kill coils, or cause throat irritation if you are a chemical sensitive like I am. \r\n\r\nAlso need to note that if you are sensitive to diketones like acetoin, chocolate deutsch contains a pretty high level of Acetoin according to the MSDS sheet. At this level it is pretty low ppm in the recipe, but it is enough to cause me some throat irritation after vaping it for a little while. \r\n\r\nI do have a couple other versions of this recipe using different ingredients that I will be releasing as I test them after steeping, so if you're diketone sensitive alternative recipes will be coming. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n( Picture credit) photo credit: ginnerobot <a href=\"http:\/\/www.flickr.com\/photos\/78011127@N00\/4253843499\">chocolate pudding<\/a> via <a href=\"http:\/\/photopin.com\">photopin<\/a> <a href=\"https:\/\/creativecommons.org\/licenses\/by-sa\/2.0\/\">(license)<\/a>",

Thick &amp; sweet with real pudding mouthfeel, full flavored even at just 5.36%, and hits the spot for a chocolate vape without too much tootsie roll taste.  Tasting this at 10 days I can imagine it will only get even better with time, as chocolates do. Excellent recipe! "
