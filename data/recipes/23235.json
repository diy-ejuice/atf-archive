    "description": "I've been looking for a really good gingerbread or a yorkshire parkin for a long time and anything i created or mixed came up short so i was at a car boot sale (yard sale for americans ? ) and a tramp (hobo) offered me a time machine for a hit on my xcube 2 ( i know too many brackets right ? apparently an xcube 2 looks like a crack pipe to an addict with a time machine ) Anyway ive been f'd over many times when it comes to time machines but i had a day's holiday the next day so i thought whatever .\r\n\r\nI set the time machine to 1000 years in the future but it looked pretty grim (lots of brackets ) so 2000 years i wen......t to the land of the crab people , now i know what your gonna say \" I fucking knew it !! crab people were gonna take over one day !! and yes they do rule the world 2000 years in the future and humans are extinct but you've got to admit we are massive knobheads (dickheads) so its no great surprise .. anyway lucky for me the crab people are big vape fiends and lovers of gingerbread(and brackets )\r\nand with my four fingers and thumb i soon proved myself to be a valuable member of their society with their war against the lobster people and all ...\r\n\r\nso they were good enough to give me theses notes\r\n\r\nCapella Gingerbread - The best of all ginger flavours surely ? not perfect but undeniably gingerbread\r\n\r\nFA - Metaphor - I really think this is stupidly underrated ! at low percentages it makes an amazing lemon icing and higher percentages airy cakes .\r\n\r\nDFS - Holy Vanilla - Really is worth the hype , so creamy and tasty at any percentage .\r\n\r\nCap - Yellow Cake - Wasn't expecting  much from this at all but it really is a cake changer for me , delicious doughy cake without black coils ....\r\n\r\nCap - Horchata - I ordered this randomly not knowing what it actually was but i knew i was gonna like it and even at this low percent and been totally out of place i really think it adds something to this recipe .\r\n\r\nCrab people rule !!!!\r\n ",
