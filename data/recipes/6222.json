  "name": "Cannoli Contest Entry",
  "description": "This is my entry for the cannoli contest for DIYorDIE. Before this contest I've never tried a real cannoli, but after having about 10 in the past two weeks, this is my best attempt at nailing the profile. Straight up cannoli. No lemon or chocolate just pastry and filling. Thanks for making me gain a few pounds, Wayne!\r\n\r\nThis was only able to steep for a week, but even with just a week steep it's good. I feel that letting it steep longer than a week will definitely benefit this recipe.",

Tested in a Kayfun V5, MTL, with simple spaced Coil. 1.5 Ohm and 20 Watts!&#xD;\nWhat can i say what is not written in the other reviews.&#xD;\nIts a great juice! Top balance of the flavours, a smooth and a full, tastefully vape. But not to pushy. &#xD;\nAll is there. A nice pastry, with a smooth, creamy filling. No dryness!  No need for a sweetener.&#xD;\nIf you like bakeries like me, it is a candidate for a Alldayvape.&#xD;\nI have to look to mix some diffrent fillings. Its a great base too!&#xD;\nThanks for that great recipe @Goldfish18."

Thanks Goldbones"

      "text": "Been vaping this one since the contest and I still go back to it time and time again. The simplicity is what makes this one beautiful. The base is perfectly creamy. The small amount of cheesecake added to the custard certainly mimics the mascarpone that you would find in an authentic Cannoli. I rarely ever go more than .5% with Biscuit, but it adds that snap to the sugar cookie that makes an excellent shell note to this juice. I thought this was the clear winner out of all the contest entries. Great job. "

      "text": "This is a very straightforward cannoli. Great balance in ingredients, ans a smooth vape. Definitely needs at least 6, or 7 days steep, but gets creamier, and more homogeneous each additional day. The limitation of only 6 ingredients makes this even more impressive. I definitely swiped this base, and added some more fatty/creamy notes. The only thing it might lack for some is that overwhelming tangy creaminess of a cannoli. Otherwise a very impressive recipe overall. Thanks for sharing."
