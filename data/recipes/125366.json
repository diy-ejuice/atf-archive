  "description": "The Year of Mixing Week 43  - Spooky Halloween Eye Ball Cupcakes.  \r\n\r\nI decided the cake was going to be a fruity chocolate cake with a blending of CAP Cupcake, FLV Red Velvet, and TFA Ruby Chocolate.  The ruby chocolate has that hint of fruitiness to it so that it ties in the red velvet into the strawberry flavored frosting and the light coconut red colored drizzle on top.  A touch of marzipan let's you know you're eating those little marzipan candy props ( the eyeball and knife in the cupcake) and the FW bavarian cream just acts as a rich blender to bring all the flavors to a smooth creamy exhale. \r\n\r\nA touch of sweetness is listed, but you can feel free to use whatever sweetener you prefer or non at all.  IF you forgo any sweetener, I suggest putting in 0.5% FA Juicy Strawberry to sweeten it up a bit more beyond what the Marzipan is doing in this recipe.  You want it to be sweet, it's a cupcake after all. \r\n\r\nIt's okay off the shake, at least it's vapeable, but it is a tad dry to start out with.  As it steeps the dryness of the chocolate lessens as the creams and cakes start to develop more.  I suggest a 2 week minimum steep, but 3 to 4 weeks works better. \r\n\r\nIf you'd like to participate in The Year of Mixing, search for the Flavor-Pro group on Facebook. ",
