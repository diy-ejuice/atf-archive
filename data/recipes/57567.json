Found it yesterday a little over 30 days later and it's perfect.  Not an ADV for me as it's a bit rich but with morning coffee or evenings after supper it's perfect. Will be making more!!! Thanks for sharing!!!!!!!"

Cut the maple in half or so to calm that down and let more of the bakery come out, and this almost certainly be a five-star recipe. "

I wanted to let you know, I watched the maple notes video and they talked about your maple vanilla long john you mixed for the mixathon that you did for someone who wanted a very maple recipe.&#xD;\n&#xD;\nGuess what! It was me who asked! You mixed it for me! So I wanted to say I use it a lot and it\u2019s nice. I think when I know how to mix better I might tweak it a bit so the maple is a little less dry and the vanilla doesn\u2019t come through as much but I still totally love it. It ages really well and I always have a 60ml of it aging somewhere."

            "text": "Perfect,  I was dubious of this because maple can be a bit try or sickening. But the creamy notes really mellow it.  There's not really much note wise to add to this review.  It tastes exactly like the description.  Thick cream with mellow smooth maple flavour,  with a plain doughnut throughout. Going to try mixing this with banana. &#xD;\n"
