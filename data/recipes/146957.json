    "description": "So once I tasted the Bubble Bruit wine I had to do something with it and a Bellini immediately came to mind. On the inhale I get light peach dry white wine that transitions to a sweet syrup ginger note . This is a well balanced mix I am really enjoying , there is a bit of throat hit for the first 3 days or so.. \r\nTested n the  relaod RDA S at 55 - 60 watts  \r\n\r\n**Blood orange champagne and Bubble wine**create the wine base for this mix. Bubble wine has a light booze note if used above 1.5% that is support by the blood orange that has a booze note. The bruit wine is dry but does have a light sweetness from an apple grape note that I am picking up \r\n\r\n**ginger peach** has a creamy body to it that helps fill in the middle of this mix and adds body. it also helps support that ginger on the back end along with the gingerbread, The ginger bread is more of a ginger syrup in this mix then a bread note at this percent ( note I wanted a prominent ginger note - this may not be for every one , if so drop the cap gingerbread to .75% - 1.00%) \r\n\r\n**Golden syrup** is to add that syrup note and adds some body as well \r\n\r\n**Lemon and lemon sour** help to have the peach pop front and adds some tartness to contrast to sweeter flavors, also helps to add that drying effect of a dry wine ",

            "text": "I thought this was going to be a disaster going in, but it really works! Why would I think that? Lots of reasons! &#xD;\n&#xD;\nGinger Peach, I didn\u2019t think would have enough peach at 1% for a bellini profile. Certainly not enough to overcome all the citrus, which was another concern. Between the blood orange and the lemons I thought this is going to come across way too citrusy. But that citrus really just uplifts the peach and makes the champagne more of a dry champagne, though there is a little kick of sweet lemon at the tail end. Second, Golden Syrup and CAP Gingerbread. Golden syrup seemed a little too rich, almost buttery, and I was thinking that combined with the creamy cream-soda type base of the Ginger Peach it would just be a disaster. But it isn\u2019t. It isn\u2019t too rich and creamy at all, it has a bubbly champagne feel to it that I think is enhanced by the spice. And CAP Gingerbread is a bakery flavor, why that of all the gingers to choose from? It made no sense. But by some magic, the bakery is washed out and it really comes across like ginger syrup in a drink with a nice spicy kick. This is awesome stuff. It\u2019s a bit out there in terms of profile but if it\u2019s a profile that interests you, you should definitely give it a try. We\u2019re coming up on Christmas now and it\u2019s perfect for that sort of festive spirit. I might try it with a little less of the VT Sour Lemon lemon next time because I think that\u2019s probably where the lingering lemon finish is coming from, but overall this is a very nice and very interesting and fun recipe. &#xD;\n"
