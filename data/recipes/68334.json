  "description": "0wee0 Cookie Cheesecake. I've been working on this profile(Oreo cookie crust cheesecake)for quite some time having made about 10 different versions. After testing all of my batches, I decided this one was the most authentic. As many know, an Oreo cookie flavor is a very hard profile to get right. And as this recipe is not perfect, it comes as close to a real Oreo that I can develop using the flavors out there. The dark, dry cookie is created using FA Cookie, TPA Double Chocolate(clear). The sweet creamy frosting like center of the cookie is represented by the TPA Bavarian Cream and CAP Sweet Cream. Now imagine taking the Oreo cookie and crushing it and making the cheesecake crust. That's what I've tried to recreate.\r\n\r\nI have also been trying to create an authentic cheesecake. Now there are many cheesecake flavors to choose from, CAP NY cheesecake, FW cheesecake, TPA cheesecake graham cracker, etc....However, these flavors while good seemed to fall short on an authentic fresh baked cheesecake and that's where HS cheesecake hits the mark.  Most cheesecakes I have tried either are too lite in that cream cheese flavor or too heavy on the graham cracker crust. And while they are good for a \"bright\" cheesecake, I feel they fall short on an authentic cheesecake.  HS Cheesecake works very well as a blank canvas, especially when using it with \"darker\", heavier accents like an Oreo cookie crust. I've only used this flavoring at .5% and one might think there's not enough cheesecake in there to be a cheesecake. However, with the TPA Bavarian cream, CAP Sweet Cream, and TPA Vanilla Bean Ice Cream combined with the HS Cheesecake, it makes for a nice fresh baked cheesecake. You have to be careful when using HS Cheesecake because if you use it at higher %'s, it has a burnt flavor that can take over the recipe.\r\nI added .5% CAP Super Sweet to brighten up the HS Cheesecake as well.\r\nThis is not a shake and Vape. This needs to steep for at least 5 days.\r\nVisit Freedom To Mix on Discord https://discord.gg/SmSc8Ef\r\nVisit Freedom To Mix on FaceBook https://www.facebook.com/groups/415341418920740/ \r\n\r\nPlease comment, mix, and or rate,....it makes us all better mixers.
