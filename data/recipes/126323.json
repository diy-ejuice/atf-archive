  "description": "After the word hit the street that FLV Created a shake and vape tobacco, I was quick to add it to my cart and start playing around. I'm enjoying my MTL setup during the day, I get through the day with less vape breaks - and extremely satisfying vape sessions. \r\n\r\nWe did a review show on Vurve, and RudeRudi spoke about Sweet Leaf. Following that I got in my concentrates, and mixed it up - I found the recipe to be really authentic, with a touch of dryness - like any cigar would. But because I have been vaping sweet fruits and desserts, my palate wasn't ready for it.  So I smashed in some of my favorite dark cream, and caramel - to help add more body to this delicious cigar flavor.  TFA Bavarian cream has a way for filling in all the dead spots in the mix, giving you a all round fuller body experience. \r\n\r\nThis is a Creamy Caramel Cuban, made for the squad that is tobacco curious, the perfect gateway to tobacco's. I would recommend this in a MTL setup - as this is how I tested this specific recipe. \r\n\r\nOnly add the super sweet if you want serious dessert style sweetness - because the TFA Bavarian Cream & FA Caramel is inherently sweet. This is not everyone's cup of tea, because it actually goes really well with a strong cup of coffee in the morning. Absolute bliss.\r\n\r\nIf you like sweet stuff, and also hit some tobacco recipes from time to time. Give this one a Smasheroo!",
