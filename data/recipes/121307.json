    "description": "For October's Mixers' Club prompt, I was tasked with revisiting my biggest failure of a recipe and making it work. When I first started mixing, I wanted to create a cola recipe without using any cola flavorings. From what I had gathered they were all pretty lackluster, and I wanted to solve a problem many people were facing. It was a tremendous error in judgement, and I wanted to abandon it completely. If Concrete River didn't make this eloquent challenge, and ID10-T didn't make his decision to conquer his fear, I wouldn't have accomplished a major goal and brought this to life. \r\n<\/lb> \r\nNormally I would put a lot of development notes here, and explain why I made the decisions that ended up in the recipe, but I'm not going to do that with this one. I want you to mix it up if you're interested in an awesome cola recipe, and know that I put a lot of effort into it. Another part of the prompt was to explain what I'm doing differently now, which I think could benefit many people. The first major difference in my mixing was brought about by Jennifer Jarvis. I knew early on that she utilized smell quite a bit, but I didn't understand how important it was. I stopped making recipes with percentages and suggestions, and just started following my nose like Toucan Sam. I would try to elaborate, but I wouldn't do it justice. Just go find Jennifer Jarvis and she'll give you some amazing pointers.\r\n<\/lb>\r\nAnother major difference in my style is the application of vast amounts of information I have gathered. There are so many incredible resources on YouTube, Reddit, and Discord that have made my experience truly awesome. People that are willing to answer any question you can conjure, give suggestions on ways to make an idea work, and provide inspiration for creative new recipes. I'm very thankful for all of them, and I look forward to coming up with countless things for everyone to try. ",

A delicious, satisfying cola recipe that mimics the experience of drinking cola much better than any of the individual cola flavorings I've tried.

It's a masterpiece from the bubbles to the syrupy sweet base, with a just-right acidic bite and balanced cooling. It tastes like someone is showing off either an abundance of talent, a ridiculous amount of work, incredible luck, or some combination of those. I might have to dump my FA Cola and LB Cola Freeze and use a one-shot of 007 as my go-to cola flavor. If such a one-shot were for sale, I'd pay good money for it, but here it is being given away for free. We are not worthy. "

The spice of the cinnamon is there but you wouldn't know that it was cinnamon if you were unaware of the ingredients. The fizzy sherbet reinforces that citric acid perfectly when paired with the blood orange. It also gives it that candy bottle cap kind of feel straight off the shake. This fades and balances out after a steep. The choice of vanilla bourbon is genius too. Another brighter vanilla probably would have accentuated the cinnamon and citrus more instead of working to balance it. Absolutely fantastic recipe Alfred. Thanks for sharing. "

Fizzy Sherbet provides a bright backdrop of citrusy sweetness, and Rich Cinnamon makes for such a delightfully strange pairing. I never would have thought those two flavors would get along, but Alfred managed to expertly balance them. Blood Orange slides right in with them, adding some dimension to the citrus base. The subtle spicy vanilla helps sell that darker caramel color. The bit of bite from Rich Cinnamon, the \u201cfizzy\u201d nature of the sherbet, and the ws-23 really give me a cool, foamy mouthfeel. It all comes together for a distinct cola flavor that has enough pizazz to keep you vaping it over and over again. It\u2019s cool enough to be refreshing, but not so much that it blows you off your feet. All in all, this is a really well-balanced recipe. Making a cola from scratch is a daunting task, but you did it with style Alfred! Thanks for sharing."
