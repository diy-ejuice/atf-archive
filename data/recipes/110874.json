I mixed this up today at about 25mg/ml to match the store bought stuff and this is way more flavorful. I need to try the non-pod recipe because I've had 0 luck with FLV Sour Apple in anything I've tried it was just a harsh mess but it tastes amazing in this recipe with the pod."

That said, what I could taste was awesome and nicely balanced. I will be trying out the regular version of this one asap"
