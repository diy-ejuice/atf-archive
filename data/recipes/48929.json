    "description": "Before I got really heavy into DIY Ripe Vape's Coconut Thai was my crack. Shit is expensive so it was a once a month kinda bottle purchase. I had tried to clone it previously but was not successful. Then came FLV Lemon Grass. It was the missing link. Can be a little harsh at first but things start to meld and the bite dies down. Coconut Thai was always harsh to me the first couple puffs then became super smooth, this has the same thing going on.\r\n\r\nHere's how I mixed it - CAP Coconut at 2%\r\n                                           1 drop\/30ml FA Zen Garden and FLV Lemon Grass\r\n                                           3 drops\/30ml FA Lemon Sicily\r\nEnjoy!!",
