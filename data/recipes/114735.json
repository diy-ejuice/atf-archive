  "name": "Pastry Puff By: eJuice Fairy (Jenn Winstead)",
  "description": "This recipe needs at least 2 week steep because during the first few days there is separation between the Zeppola and the Cupcake but it blends into one solid bakery after around day 5 and then develops the fluffy note around day 10. I donâ€™t find it needs any sweetener but your welcome to sweeten to taste. The tiny bit of almond separates the frosting center from the pastry puff and the small amount of joy plays with the zeppola in airing and fluffing up the cupcake. The milk adds to the lightness of the overall bakery. Enjoy.",
