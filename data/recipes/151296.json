  "description": "Inspired by Flavor-Pro Week 20 Berry Ice Cream Float challenge\r\n\r\nI wanted a berry flavor for MTL vaping, so my goal was to simplify the recipe as much as possible, and keep it light for a summer vape.  \r\nI was able to get the red flavor and soda brightness using FW Shirley Temple.  \r\nHS Blueberry holds up well against the soda flavor, and adds some sweetness.  In other variations I added 1% FA Raspberry and/or 1.5% JF Sweet Strawberry to the blueberry, and they were all good, so add them if you want more berry flavor.\r\nI did not want a heavy ice cream for a summer vape, so I used WF Vanilla Cream Extra to add the dairy.\r\n\r\nTested in an Innokin ZBiip with the 1.6 coil.  Mixed 50VG/50PG and steeped for a week.  Edited:  After a month the flavor was much better.  Recommend a longer steep.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
