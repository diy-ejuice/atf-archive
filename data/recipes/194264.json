    "description": "When Bond is served more of what Col. Smithers describes as \"rather disappointing brandy.\" M asks what's wrong with it, and Bond replies,\r\n\"I'd say it's a 30-year-old fine, indifferently blended ... with an overdose of bon bois.\"\r\nWhile not really caring what all that means, this is quite a nice, full, sweet tobacco with heart-warming brandy notes.\r\nINW Tobacco Coctail is the fine brandy note but with very little tobacco (it might even go in a pumped-up creme brulee, or dessert)\r\nFLV Sweet Cigarette compliments nicely as it gives a lighter touch adding some bright tobacco notes (and needed funkyness). \r\nFLV Kentucky Blend and INW DNB give the adecuate ash such a meeting should have.\r\n ",
