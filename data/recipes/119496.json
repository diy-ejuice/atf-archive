The chocolate wasn't quite there and I wasn't getting much caramel notes. The nuts &amp; nougat were pretty on point though. Then after a few weeks of steeping... I was still kinda disappointed. I think they really tried there best with this profile but it doesn't quite measure up in my opinion. Nice attempt though seriously. This is a really challenging profile."
