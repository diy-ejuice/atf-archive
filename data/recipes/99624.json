  "description": "This is a refreshing Pomegranate and Passion fruit sherbet. I took the cue from Wayne and used Cap Lemon Lime for the sherbet base and paired it with fw vanilla bean ice cream because it is a nice and light yet sweet ice cream. Its not too buttery so it translates to sherbets very easily. I used a touch of pink guava for a bit more tart citrus since it tastes more like grapefruit to me. Then I sweetened and thickened up the mix by adding a bit of cap vanilla cupcake. I have mixed this up with .75% polar blast and it is nice but if you don't want to steep this (you don't have to at all) then I would suggest using .5% fa polar blast or use your preferred cooling agent.",
