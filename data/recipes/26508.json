  "description": "Imagine taking white creamy American Nougat and mixing with a fantastic pastry/cannoli cream. \r\nTorrone for the nougat.\r\nMarshmallow and fresh together for that velvety and extra texture.\r\nCustard for the base. \r\nAlmond to help the almonds in the nougat.\r\nA personal favorite. I keep a few hundred mils at all times.\r\n",

      "text": "This is a great recipe for being all FA. Not exactly my cup of tea but that wont stop me from giving this a good review. The lemon notes in the custard and torrone work well for this one. I would like to try this with the new premium custard from FA either replacing or in addition to the regular custard. Also to note, this was a touch harsh for me. I tend to get off notes and a strange aftertaste from some FA flavors so I had to add a bit of sweetener to help with that. Other than that, this recipe is balanced nicely and all of the flavors work well together. Solid recipe"
