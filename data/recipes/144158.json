  "description": "Sticky, fragrant rose flavoured jelly cubes dredged with icing sugar.\r\n\r\nTurkish Delight is a classic Middle Eastern sweet and dates back more than 230 years, making it one of the oldest sweet dishes in the world.\r\nThey are small, fragrant cubes of jelly, usually flavoured with rosewater, orange flower water or citrus fruits juice and heavily dusted with icing sugar. Some versions include roughy chopped pistachios to add texture and equalise the (sometimes overpowering) sweetness.\r\n\r\nFLV Rose Essence is the star of the show here and is a phenomenal rose flavour. Unlike its competitors, this does not overpower everything it comes in contact with. This is a delicate infusion of natural rose frangrances with a delightful realistic & well rounded profile. The expected/inherent floral notes does not interfere and, when used correctly, brings a gentle rose bouquet to the table. It needed a slight boost and sweetness in the form of TPA Rose Candy to create the characteristic (sweet) Turkish Delight.\r\n\r\nFLV Marshmallow Vanilla plays a number of rolls here. Firstly, it assist by creating body and given the jelly candy a more manageable texture. It furthermore adds a delicious vanilla note which blends perfectly with the rose. Lastly, it adds the first layer of icing sugar sugar dusting, followed by a generous dusting from OOO Powdered Sugar. \r\n\r\nCap Jelly Candy does here what it is supposed to...it creates a jelly, duh! I pushed it to 3% here as traditional Turkish delight is quite gelatinous. \r\n\r\nFA pistachio breaks the menotiny of the Rose by introducing an alluring nuttiness and that familiar pistachio earthiness. DO NOT sub this with TPA Pistachio, you have been warned...\r\n\r\nGive this baby 3 to 5 days to mingle.",

      "text": "&#xD;\nNailed it. If you want to vape Turkish delight, here it is. Authentically stupid rosey and stupid sweet, even without added sweetener, but with both of those broken and saved from just being that by the addition of the FA Pistachio, which fits right in middle just like in the picture. Full gelatinous mouthfeel, and you can even feel the powdered sugar dusting. Just a hint of citrus from the TFA Rose Candy and maybe the combination of Rose Candy and Jelly Candy that’s maybe slightly out of place, but these things can also have lemon juice in them so maybe not. A noticeable amount of vanilla from the Vanilla Marshmallow that might also be out of place, but is probably what makes it extra yummy and is likely eating some of the plasticky sort of off note you might otherwise get from that much jelly candy. All in all it’s pretty awesome and tastes like a ton of work went into this.  &#xD;\n"
