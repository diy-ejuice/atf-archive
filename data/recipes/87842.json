  "description": "This started out using Holy Grail RY4 and WF Butter Pecan Pie with FLV Native . . . then I got FLV Yam in the mail, and it smelled like the perfect accompaniment.  After that, I thought a bit of FA Custard Premium creaminess would pair well with the earthiness of the yam and tobacco, as well as, thickening up the butter pecan pie flavor.  Added a little Holy Vanilla to give it next level holiness . . . finished off with a sprinkling of Rich Cinnamon.  \r\n\r\nThis has become a rich, baked, sweet potato custard with a little bit of cinnamon sugar to spice up the earthy tobacco undertones.  Mixed at 60vg/40pg . . . aside from Shyndo's Black Forest Bacco in the morning with coffee (seriously . . .go mix this stuff up: https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/87014#black_forest_bacco_by_shyndo ), this is all I've been vaping since I mixed it.",
