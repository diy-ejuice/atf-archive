            "text": "I love the complements here, the added fruity complexity of Sangria, the way Oak Barrel can make Moscato actually taste much more like wine. A touch of cooling. But that is just way way way too much Moscato. It\u2019s like drinking cheap wine through a dryer sheet filter. I think this might be a great recipe if the amount of Moscato was cut in half or less.
