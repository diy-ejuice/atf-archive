  "description": "A glorious,bright and fruitful vape experience that will be the envy of all those who haven't tried it. \r\n\r\nThe medley of fruits used here work with each other in a beautiful balancing act that layer very nicely with a silky smooth ice cream. A slight squeeze of lemon in the back that is barely noticeable helps the sun shine through this delicious vape. \r\nThe WF Buttercream Frosting paired with the LB Vanilla Ice Cream takes a so so melty like ice cream vape to a delicious sweet and balanced ice cream. \r\n\r\nThis would be one of the most unique yet wonderful eliquid recipes I have created to date.\r\n\r\nI recommend giving this a week to steep for maximum results. \r\n\r\nI believe everyone should have a chance to experience this.\r\nAdvocacy:\r\nYou aren't going to steal my right to vape with nicotine Mr Hunt!\r\nNot on my watch Mr. Hunt!\r\nAustralia is currently in a massive battle to save our industry from planned legislation that would effectively make nicotine almost inaccessible.\r\nWe only have til January 1, 2021 leaving us only a few months to try and turn this around. Please stay informed and keep up to date with all the calls to action via the DIY Downunder FB page.\r\nhere: facebook.com/groups/diydownunder/\r\n\r\nI mixed this at 70% VG\r\n\r\nI enjoy this at 60W on a Single 0.2ohm SST coil on a Recurve RDA.\r\n\r\nSeriously if you like a solid recipe that works give it a go!\r\n\r\nCheers for reading this far, now go and get mixing!\r\nEnjoy!\r\n\r\n\"Together, Let's Discover!!!\"\r\n\r\nFacebook - https://www.facebook.com/groups/diydownunder/\r\n\r\nYoutube - https://www.youtube.com/c/diydownunder\r\n",
