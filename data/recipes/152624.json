    "description": "Lickity Split is the name of one of my local ice cream shops, I used to love getting banana splits there when I was a kid. I've all but given up on chocolate but wanted to work on the rest of the profile. I've had all these flavors for awhile, but haven't really tried using any of them outside of the coconuts and custard before. I thought the custard would help thicken up the mouth feel without changing the profile flavoring too much. I kind of like this better right off the shake tbh, the banana seems to settle in a little too much after a week or so for my taste. Others may like it that way though idk :)",

            "text": "I think this might have suffered from the ridiculously long steep it's gotten because of my negligence in getting around to trying it after it was mixed. I get a very very sweet and thick creamy banana and creamy coconut. I had to double check to see what kind of sweetener was in here because it's so sweet and was surprised to find none. Although the banana and coconut are very thick, buttery rich, and creamy, I don't get any separation between the banana\/coconut and ice cream flavors. Just banana first and then the coconut finish. I'm sure there probably was some ice cream with banana and coconut toppings that I would have gotten from this if I'd tried it six weeks ago, but it's all blended in now. Both the banana and the coconut taste candied, but not like Runts candy. It tastes like if I took two Valentine's chocolates, one banana cream filled and one coconut cream filled, surgically removed every bit of the chocolate coating, and then popped both of those cream fillings right into my facehole. It's not what it's supposed to be, or at least no longer what it's supposed to be, but I love it. "
