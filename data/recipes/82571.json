    "description": "Creme de Menthe (TPA\/TFA) \u2013 obviously the main role player in this recipe. Even though the flavor itself is not bad as a \u201csingle flavor mix\u201d too, it\u2019s missing something. It actually asks for another flavor to boost its background notes unless you are OK with how it plays as a stand alone. I\u2019m a flavor junkie and I long for that missing link.\r\n\r\nCherry Blossom (TPA\/TFA) \u2013 very lightweight cherry flavor, floral, airy, excellent addition to Creme de Menthe. It doesn\u2019t bring any additional weight to the mint and the juice itself in general. It\u2019s 100% spot on. I\u2019ve also tried to replace Cherry Blossom with Elderflower (FLV) but it didn\u2019t turn that well. If you want to give it a shot, replace Cherry Blossom with Elderflower at 0.5%.\r\n\r\nCreamy Coconut (FW) \u2013 I was actually missing a touch of tropical sensation to this juice and coconut was the most logical choice. Didn\u2019t try any other fruit\/nut because it pairs so damn good with Creme de Menthe. Both outside and inside color of coconut fit to my juice color scheme too so that\u2019s another plus. Don\u2019t try to replace with Coconut Extra (TPA\/TFA) coz you might end up vaping the rubber tasting mint!\r\n\r\nVienna Cream (FA) \u2013 in order to accent the creamy note of Creme de Menthe I needed floral note cream which also pairs well with Cherry Blossom. The cream itself has to be lightweight, no custard or heavy vanilla because all other ingredients are likewise. So two creams came into consideration: Vienna Cream (FA) and Sweet Cream (FW) but the formal one won elegantly.\r\n\r\nSugar is optional.\r\n\r\nOriginal recipe updates at: http:\/\/vapingmule.com\/articles\/ejuice-recipes\/moose-42c\/",
