  "description": "Creme de Menthe (TPA/TFA) – obviously the main role player in this recipe. Even though the flavor itself is not bad as a “single flavor mix” too, it’s missing something. It actually asks for another flavor to boost its background notes unless you are OK with how it plays as a stand alone. I’m a flavor junkie and I long for that missing link.\r\n\r\nCherry Blossom (TPA/TFA) – very lightweight cherry flavor, floral, airy, excellent addition to Creme de Menthe. It doesn’t bring any additional weight to the mint and the juice itself in general. It’s 100% spot on. I’ve also tried to replace Cherry Blossom with Elderflower (FLV) but it didn’t turn that well. If you want to give it a shot, replace Cherry Blossom with Elderflower at 0.5%.\r\n\r\nCreamy Coconut (FW) – I was actually missing a touch of tropical sensation to this juice and coconut was the most logical choice. Didn’t try any other fruit/nut because it pairs so damn good with Creme de Menthe. Both outside and inside color of coconut fit to my juice color scheme too so that’s another plus. Don’t try to replace with Coconut Extra (TPA/TFA) coz you might end up vaping the rubber tasting mint!\r\n\r\nVienna Cream (FA) – in order to accent the creamy note of Creme de Menthe I needed floral note cream which also pairs well with Cherry Blossom. The cream itself has to be lightweight, no custard or heavy vanilla because all other ingredients are likewise. So two creams came into consideration: Vienna Cream (FA) and Sweet Cream (FW) but the formal one won elegantly.\r\n\r\nSugar is optional.\r\n\r\nOriginal recipe updates at: http://vapingmule.com/articles/ejuice-recipes/moose-42c/",
