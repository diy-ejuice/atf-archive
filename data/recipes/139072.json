  "description": "This Mix was done for Our 1st live episode using FLV Berry Blend. We talked about FLV Berry Blend in a live show - https://youtu.be/BYKq4D3Fh6o\r\nI wanted to see if I could mix Berry Blend as the main profile into something familiar that Ive done before.\r\n\r\nI was going for a Berry forward beverage, I am not sure that its full on Berry as I think its needs a Steep **Will update this later\r\n\r\nThe Combination of Ice and Citrus soda serves as my effervescent beverage or liquid base. Then I added the Moscato to freshen this up with a vibrant tart white grape in the middle.\r\n\r\nDragon fruit and Fuji added in combo to sweeten and emulsify these flavors together.\r\n\r\nThis is a Pretty weird mix, but I keep reaching for it for another puff. I dont think this is for everyone, but if you like weird stuff you might like this.\r\nAlmost reminds me of this weird \"Sour Alien Spray candy\" I had as a kid.\r\nI think the weirdness will mellow out a bit after 3 days, will update.\r\n\r\nSweetner:\r\nAdd if you like sweet stuff, Dont if you dont :-)\r\n\r\nTHIS RECIPE IS NOT DONE! THERE WILL BE SOME CHANGES.",
