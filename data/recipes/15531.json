  "description": "A sour and sweet Apple beer, with accents of cinnamon and strawberry.\r\n\r\nI came up with this after trying 5 other variations. I wanted to make something that was very unique to the judges. It's not easy to do when every one is going to use half of the same flavors. So I found my weirdest flavor. The one that doesn't taste like any other flavor. DONUTS by Flavorah. It's a spot on beer flavor to me. It's strong and a steep is needed for this one. Fuji is a great Apple flavor for this recipe. It's strong enough to stand up with the  Flavorah donuts (beer actually) flavor. The strawberry is used as a sweet fruity accent. The cinnamon is very light but it makes the Apple much more enjoyable. Cinnamon danish swirl can be very strong to so it worked well in this recipe as another accent to the beer. The strawberry ripe adds a sweetness and fruity note.  The sweet fruit in this recipe really help making the beer complex and enjoyable. The frosted donut adds  a powdered sugar taste to help bring out the sweetness of strawberry ripe. The sugar cookie is another sweet bakery flavor I chose to add sweetness to the beer. It also adds some bakery notes to the beer to help soften the yeast beer flavor. \r\n\r\nThis juice must steep for at least a week. The longer the better.",
