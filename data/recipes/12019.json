The chocolate and cream are balanced really well; its creamy but still has crunch. The CFB gives it a cookie texture that I didn't expect from that flavor. However, I don't get an Oreo or Hydrox cookie. To me, it's more like one of those chocolate wafer cookies minus the wafer flavor."

How you found your way to the oreo flavour is incredible and this really is like no other juice i've vaped before, and I mean that in a very good way.  Stunning juice."
