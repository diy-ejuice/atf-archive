    "description": "**Coffee Caramel Frappe**\r\n&nbsp;\r\n**Brief Description:**\r\nThis is a coffee forward caramel frappe with whipped cream on top. I haven't worked with ws-23 before so was excited to try it out this week to see how it would go. Not gonna lie, I used way too much the first go around for a high watt device like the TFV8. I haven't gotten to try this yet fully steeped but my first take on it is that its got a nice balance of sweetness from the caramel, to help cut the coffee notes. The creams haven't come out fully yet due to the steep time being only a few days but its starting to show up more. I used cream fresh to lighten the dairy up so it wasn't too heavy from the ice cream and custard. The VT cafe latte is a strong flavor, so not much was needed to bring out that latte flavor. Its actually a great coffee flavor though and isnt easily overpowered by other flavors. I backed it up with HS Caramel Mocha and FW Butterscotch Ripple to turn it from a coffee frappe to a coffee caramel frappe then added the whipped cream on top because you need whipped cream on your frap. This is not like a starbucks frap thats over loaded with sugar. Its closer to something you might get at a small stand where they use real espresso in their fraps or if you made one at home. Either way, with the WS-23, its great on a hot morning with breakfast!\r\n\r\nTry to let this one steep for 2 weeks. Longer if possible! I will post a more thorough update once I have gotten to have it steeped.",
