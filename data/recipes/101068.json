I expected a little harshness only steeped it 3 days and with all fruits and citrusâ€™ &amp; no creams to smooth them over I figured it would be a little sharp but i was pleasantly surprised excellent job very tasty recipe you created. I Need to remember to make another batch this summer and add some coolant"

Gotta give some credit to the folks who made the retail juice for designing an excellent profile, but for a DIY remix you hit this one out of the ballpark and then some @Mathematical. Stellar mix here, can't wait to see how it steeps, if it lasts that long :) Would love to see you do a mix with mostly the same components but with the nectarine. Bet it would be awesome if you could find the right nectarine concentrate to fit, but I trust your judgment after this one."
