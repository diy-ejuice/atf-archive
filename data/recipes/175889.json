  "description": "My favorite lemonade has always been lemon twist pink punch lemonade by quite a margin. I started by recreating that in your face lemonhead candy. Took a while but I had a breakthrough when I mixed a lemon meringue pie. FA-Meringue was the last key to the lemonhead puzzle. Unfortunately, this lemonade needs to steep for 3 days as FE-lemon takes some time to really pop. I honestly feel like they had to use fe lemon in their recipe because its the only lemon that I am aware of that doesn't fade really at all. This is close to indistinguishable from the lemon twist and I would love to hear your opinions on how I did! Thanks and I hope you enjoy. I left the super sweet at the lowest acceptable amount. I personally like it at .75 on this one, but start low and increase to your liking.",

The dull but overpowering LB Pink Lemonade was all I could taste, leaving me worried that steeping wouldn't be enough to fix how flat it tasted. &#xD;\n&#xD;\n&#xD;\nSurprise surprise though, after just 36 hours of steeping the difference is huge. The LB Pink Lemonade mellowed out allowing everything else to shine through big and bold. I'm shocked at how much it came to life.&#xD;\n&#xD;\n&#xD;\nI'm guilty of loving extra sweet commercial juices, so I bumped the Super Sweet up to 1%. It works pretty well here in my opinion. &#xD;\n   &#xD;\n&#xD;\nAll in all this could be the holy grail for lovers of the original. It really does taste just like the commercial version. I wouldn't be surprised if it turned out to be identical to Twist's own recipe."
