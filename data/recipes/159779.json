    "description": "They're elegant, with a pair of dainty ginger cookies sandwiched around a refreshing lemon creme. With the first bite, it's hard to register anything but crunch but then, as the crumbs dissolve across your tongue, there's a lovely hint of ginger, followed by golden syrup, maple and a burst of fresh lemon creaminess.\r\n\r\nThis is the \"Ginger Lemon Cream\" experience.\r\n\r\nInspired by another recipe I saw and drawn in by this delectable profile, I knew I had to try to create my version of this.\r\n\r\nBeing a little fussy, I enjoy a gingerbread cookie that has a firm outer edge and a soft body of the cookie. This is why I chose to combine Capella Gingerbread (has a softer Gingerbread mouthfeel) &\r\nFlavorah Gingersnap (has a firmer mouthfeel).\r\nI added INW Lemon Cake to assist not only with the body of the cookie as well but also for the lovely lemon note. \r\nThe icing had to include Loranne's Cream Cheese Icing not only for it's lovely texture but also for that slight fresh lemon note it brings. It is well assisted with Vape Trains Vanilla Cream Frosting for more volume of the filling which has worked really well here. \r\nTo sweeten and add a little depth to the flavour I added Vape Train's Golden Syrup which really compliments the cookie here beautifully. \r\n\r\nGreat off the shake & even better in 3-4 days. \r\nThis is easily all day vapable to me and not only a wonderful balance of flavour but 100% delicious.  \r\n\r\nEnjoy! \r\n\r\nIMO this is a very pleasant and enjoyable vape on a single coil RDA at 60W with a SST single coil at 0.2 ohm \r\n\r\nSteep Time 5 Days for best results. \r\n\r\nI hope you enjoy this just as much as I enjoyed creating this little recipe, but let me know what you thought in the comments below. \r\n\r\nSeriously if you like a solid recipe that works give it a go!\r\n\r\nCheers for reading this far, now go and get mixing!\r\n\r\n\"Together, Let's Discover!!!\"\r\n\r\nFacebook - https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/groups\/diydownunder\/\r\nDiscord - https:\/\/discord.gg\/kH4Fqbc\r\nYoutube - https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/c\/diydownunder\r\nWebsite - https:\/\/www.diydownunder.com\/\r\nInstagram IGTV : @diydownunder",

            "text": "Hey Pippa! I hope you're doing well. This recipe looks divine. I'm looking for recipes to mix for monday's gingerbread episode of Noted and I wanted to adapt this but I wanted to get your thoughts first. I don't have INW Lemon Cake but I was thinking of using CNV Lemon Cream Wafer at around 1.5-2%? I really don't care for LA Cream Cheese Icing but I think it'll work really well in here so I don't want to change that. WHat about the VT Golden Syrup? I see in your notes you used it as a sweetener and for depth, there's something to be said for FW Sweetener doing both of those things? Anyways, thank you for everything you do for the community I truly appreciate it! I'll let you know how this turns out. "
