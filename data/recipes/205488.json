  "name": "Chocolate Banana Butterscotch Drizzled Cheesecake V1",
  "description": "I love Cheesecake, and made this with Bananas, but it needed something else and Chocolate was just calling out to me.. Was talking to my friend ID10-T and his ingenious Idea to drizzle it in butterscotch was well, Da Bomb!!! But in the first version as Wayne said it was a tad muddled and just didn't have the Cheesy in the Cheesecake.Well here it is the best in my humble opinion, Chocolate Banana Cheesecake Drizzled in Butterscotch! Tastes good right off but after a 3 day steep delish however its Divine after 7 days!",
