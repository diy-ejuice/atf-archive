  "description": "Profile: A nutty biscuit\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nFor the biscuit part, my obvious go-to biscuit is here JF Biscuit. I decided that over INW Biscuit, as I find INW Biscuit to be just a tad too dry for what I wanted to achieve here.\r\nTo add a little pow-wow to the biscuit, I paired it up against a slight touch of AP, which helps the biscuit to feel a little bit more crunchy.\r\n\r\nFor the nuts, I went for my go-to FA Hazel Grove as I really enjoy the nuttiness it brings to the table and the slight taste of praline really works well in a nutty bakery type. I added in some WF Butter Pecan Pie to do a little dance with the hazelnut and it brings a warming creamy element to the mix along with some buttery and creamy notes, that goes really well with the biscuit.\r\n\r\nLastly, a finishing dash of FLV Cream and FA Carmel to add a further round touch, some rich mouthfeel and to help the warming touch.\r\n\r\nLet it steep for a minimum of 2 weeks to get this recipe to reach its full potential.\r\n\r\nEnjoy!",
