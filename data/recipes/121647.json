  "description": "Cold creamy ice cream with sweet syrupy blueberries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe star of this recipe is Cap Blueberry Jam, it's a fantastic syrupy blueberry that works well with with other blueberries. My original version of this recipe used the Holy Trinity for blueberries, but I found that it was being heavily overpowered by the rest of the recipe. After sending a sample of to Foment_Life he recommended subbing out the Blueberry Extra for the Blueberry Jam and halving the VBIC and putting Vanilla Swirl into the mix.    \r\n\r\nSpot on recommendation that really made this recipe come alive. The Blueberry Jam really helps boost the blueberry flavor over the Vanilla and Ice Cream without overpowering them for a great sweet but not overly sweet vape.\r\n",
