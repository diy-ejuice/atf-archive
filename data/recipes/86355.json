  "description": "A dry, heavily aromatic sandalwood tobacco with grapefruit and vanilla accents.  It's sharp, distinct, and fairly well balanced for dealing with an aggressive and distinct sandalwood.  This works okay subohm but that sandalwood can be a whole lot to deal with.  I prefer it mixed 50/50 in a MTL tank, preferably with a heavy dose of nicotine salts.  It helps me from strangling people while I try to find my inner peace.  This settles down a bit on a 2 week steep and is probably essential for a subohm type of application, but honestly I've done this after 3 days in a MTL tank without any real ill effect.\r\n\r\nThis recipe ties together a lot of preoccupations for me.  \r\n\r\nIt was originally conceived as a way to use FLV Wood Spice.  It's a really accurate take on sandalwood, but a bit outside of the normal spectrum of flavors in vaping.  Trying to figure out a way to use it, I ended up staring at aromatherapy pairings.  Turns out lt's used with citrus a lot, including grapefruit.  \r\n\r\nFLV Pink Guava is another obsession of mine.  It's a bit unhealthy.  It has some sweeter, fruitier body but the top notes taste a whole lot like Cascade hops with a distinct kind of grapefruit thing going on.   And vanilla, why not? I like vanilla with grapefruit and it actually works really well against woody flavors.  I was struggling with other vanillas, Vanillin was too bland, and most of the other vanillas bring a lot of cream baggage.  But then Flavorah dropped their vanillas.  FLV Vanilla Bean is like a darker version of vanillin.  Still dry, but darker and more robust than straight vanillin.\r\n \r\nI basically had an aromatherapy pairing going on.  But it didn't vape all that well.  It needed some more dry body.  So... why not use tobacco as a base? FLV Cured had some light sandalwood notes going already but was a pretty strait-laced not particularly aromatic tobacco.  It was also an opportunity to make an aromatic tobacco that wasn't a big damp mess.\r\n\r\nShoutout to mixers club and cokecan for suffering through earlier versions of this.  The input I got was invaluable.  I kept on tweaking.  The original percentages on cured and pink guava were a bit too delicate and the vanilla wasn't coming through as strong as I had I hoped.  Enter FLV Smooth Vanilla.  It's a pretty staggering price point, but it's a nice, smooth vanilla with a good body thats also ridiculously concentrated.  And I had it.  So I threw caution to the wind, added it, and ended up here.\r\n\r\nAnd I picked \"The Prayer\" for a name because I'm insufferable. This also tastes a lot like incense (in a good way I hope, but the comparison is definitely there.)  I've just been praying  I could get these flavors to work together. ",
