  "description": "this is my go to juice, and it's delicious. it's my 3rd and final version. \r\n\r\nthe butter pecan is definitely the base note. it's buttery. it's nutty. what more can you want. fw has this flavor on lock for sure. i put it in a lot of stuff, but it's best when it's the star. contrary to popular belief it does NOT need 5 million years steep time. 3 days, it's great. after 7 days that's about the best it'll ever get. i've worked with 3 different batches of this recipe over the course of 6 weeks, and vaped it almost daily, i'm confident. \r\n\r\ni used both tpa and cap vbic because sometimes tpa's gives me weird off notes over 2%, but i like it's vanilla more than caps. i've tried it with all of either one and it was fine, really quite good- even with all tfa the butter pecan tends to cover over the off notes for me- but this version is the best in my opinion. bavarian cream is meant to give a little more body, and i've used both jf and fw's, and i prefer jf's. the holy vanilla boosts the ice cream, as does the butterscotch ripple. i'll thank kocanada for that trick. butt rip goes in almost all my ice cream recipes now thanks to him. \r\n\r\nthe soho inclusion is hard for me to explain or even describe- soho is sweet and feels like heavy caramel to me. it's like a better, rounder ry4 to me, and maybe that's weird or wrong, but i love it. it has a light tobacco touch, that to me is reminiscent of fresh pack of camels- not current camels- camels about 12 years ago. is it just me or did they use to smell and taste a lot better? anyway like i said, this recipe reaches it's peak after 7 days but it's vapable and damn enjoyable at 3. \r\n\r\n*edit* one thing i forgot to include, because i never included it in my percentages, is 2-3 drops Acetyl Pyrazine per 30 ml. it's crucial to the nutty aspect. an option add in is 2 drops CAP Super Sweet- that's up to you.\r\n\r\nsweet home, alabama- we sure do love some blue bell ice cream down here and butter pecan is my favorite. we are also 4% higher in smokers than the national median here. what can i say, it's a struggle living in the bible belt. enjoy, yall!",
