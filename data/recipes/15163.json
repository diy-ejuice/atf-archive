  "description": "Heres something I wanted to try out, and actually came out really well. Its a chocolate covered huckleberry, the same kind you buy over priced from \"local farmers\". Its a pretty straight forward recipe, but the sparkling wine helps cut the huckleberry intensity, and the ice cream helps make the tfa milk chocolate a little smooth. I chose tfa milk chocolate because I didn't want a chocolate that would try to compete with the huckleberry. \r\n\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nYou are free to\r\nShare — copy and redistribute the material in any medium or format\r\nAdapt — remix, transform, and build upon the material\r\n\r\n(The licensor cannot revoke these freedoms as long as you follow the license terms.)\r\n\r\nUnder the following terms:\r\n\r\nAttribution — You must give appropriate credit, provide a link to the license, and indicate if changes were made.
