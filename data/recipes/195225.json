    "description": "Very simple cereal mix, made for myself never intending to release but I follow a rule (I always make a 60ml to test, if I vape the whole lot and make more then I release it) \r\n\r\nThe lemon is strong, but you get some orange and a touch of lime, after it\u2019s steeped it becomes a bit more balanced, still predominant old-school premium cereal juice vibe which I know some of you like. Fruit circles at 10% might seem a lot but it works (especially if you\u2019re a fan of the concentrate to begin with) FA milk because it\u2019s the best, French vanilla to give the milk a little panache and finally a bit of crispy wafer to boost the cereal note.\r\n\r\nSweetener totally subjective but does help the overall profile.\r\n\r\nIf you like this recipe and what I do then please rate and review accordingly.",

Had a playdough offnote for the begining but it steeped out completely after 2 days. Really good recipe, true to what it promises, if you want a plain, good and strong Fruit Circles recipe this is the one."
