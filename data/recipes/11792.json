    "description": "Strawberry Banana Cream Pie with Graham Crust. This is my first recipe as a newbie DIYer. It's quite simple (as i'm just starting out) however I'm welcome to criticisms and suggestions for improvement. In V2 i've doubled to Cheesecake (Graham) Crust to 3% and instead of 8% TFA Strawberry, its now 4% TFA Strawberry and 4% Strawberry (Ripe). Tastes pretty good to me after an overnight steep, but looking forward to trying this after a week or 2.",
