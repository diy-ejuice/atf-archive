  "description": "The best lemon meringue pie to date, sharp, zesty, zingy, buttery, sweet... fairly simple recipe, added FA cookie to help the crust out in the VTA lemon meringue tart because it’s barely there, added FA Sicily to give another dimension to that lemon, the pudding base adds a thicker butteryness to that lemon curd and also helps the base out with that crumble mouthfeel... and last but not least, that flapper pie, wow. It’s all that’s been missing from LMT/LMP profiles... it brings that marshmallowey white meringue on top and the slight toasted sweet brown sugar-esque crust on top of the meringue. If you like Lemon meringue pie you can’t miss out on this :)",

      "text": "When  I first tried VT Lemon Meringue Tart solo it didn't quite do it for me as it was a bit dry and overcooked sort of. The addition of WF Flapper Pie really fixes  that aspect up along with the touch of pudding base. This was still missing that sweet lemon tang I was hoping for so I added 5-6 drops of VT Sour Lemon to my 18ml sample and I enjoyed it even more. This might benefit from using WF lemon squares in the base too but I do not even have that flavor yet so I think that a bestest yet recipe is still in the making. This is still a great recipe and I would probably rate it 4.5 stars at the moment but I am rounding it up to a 5 as it is still 100% worth mixing if you like this profile. "

I get a very defined meringue taste, the lemon custard or curd or whatever you call it and a tasty crust. It's everything I could've hoped for in a lemon meringue pie vape. Well done."

Love what the Flapper Pie is doing here for the creamy toasty notes.  Just a well rounded beautiful, delicious recipe.  I will update review in a few days if any changes.  "
