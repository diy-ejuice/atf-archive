    "description": "This is a blackberry & blackcurrant marshmallow cream on top of a ginger graham crust.\r\n\r\nThe FLV Boysenberry isn't really used for its flavor but to jam up the berries and make them extra syrupy. I really wanted to use VTA Shisha Blackcurrant. It is easily my favorite standalone currant flavor, but it is pretty potent and tends to want to take over a mix which is why I used it really low. The CAP Gingerbread & CAP Graham is an idea I stole from @ID10-T he used it in his recipe  https:\/\/alltheflavors.com\/recipes\/48608#titanic_by_id10_t. The CAP Whipped Marshmallow I used by mistake. I wanted to use CAP Vanilla Whipped Cream, but grabbed the Whipped Marsh by mistake and didn't notice it until after I mixed it, but it worked out pretty well.\r\n\r\nPLEASE RATE AND REVIEW IF YOU MIX",
