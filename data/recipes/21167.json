  "description": "Not a lot to say about this recipe. \r\nThe profile watermelon licorice. \r\nBoth of these flavors sound disgusting together, but come together quite nicely. \r\nThe cap sweet watermelon in this recipe as low as it is to add a salt water taffy vibe to the juice. \r\nLA watermelon is the star of the show, combined with honeysuckle it becomes a wonderful watermelon syrup flavor. \r\n\r\nFA Anise is EXTREMELY potent. 0.15 is all you'll need for a well rounded flavor. \r\n\r\nSweetener is not preferred in this mix, though pyure at 1% would be best.\r\n",
