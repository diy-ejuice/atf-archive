    "name": "Bees Knees  (Lemonade  Bourbon Cocktail,  orange bitters) ",
    "description": "This is  my take on the classic cocktail  Bees Knees   - which like many prohibition-era cocktails was invented as a way to hide the scent and flavor of poor quality homemade spirits.   The addition of honey was considered bizarre by some at the time, since sugar is more usual.     The original  cocktail is made with gin, but I felt that Bourbon is a better pairing in this style of cocktail\r\n\r\nOn the  inhale  and exhale you get a sweetened honeyed lemonade   with a tart blood orange  and  darker spice notes on the finish \r\ntested in a  reload RDA at 60 watts .  it is good at 3 days \r\n\r\nThis  mix is based  off of the  the **FOGVLOG  layerz episode back bar bitters**  https:\/\/youtu.be\/ggxsvyBEPLM  \r\nhttps:\/\/alltheflavors.com\/recipes\/141520#sidecar_by_ruderudi\r\n\r\nI built off  profile that was presented on layerz\r\nThe  **lemon**  needed some more tartness and VT sour lemon is  pretty good at adding that really tart note  .. but it is  not sour \r\n**Honey Bee** is light and floral so the golden syrup helps with adding some dark notes \r\n**blood  orange**  holds the middle here  and  connects to the back bar bitters   pulling out the  orange note  \r\n**bourbon**  adds a nice dark warm note to the finish \r\n**back bar bitters** adds a nice dark spice note that gets your  lemon to really pop  with a  bitter orange note   and creates a unique finish \r\n\r\n",
