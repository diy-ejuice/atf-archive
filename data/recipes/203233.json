  "description": "In Australia I associate summer with fresh mangoes. \r\nI looked at my wall, grabbed some flavours and threw them together. I didn't change flavourings or percentages from that so likely there is a better way to make this but I like it enough as is to share.\r\nFor me this is the perfect amount of saturation, richness and mouthfeel.\r\nIf you have and EXTREMELY sensitive throat you might think its bordering on harsh off the shake but there is no harshness for me especially after 24 hours.\r\nAs I said, I didn't play with this at all so feel free to make it better or change it up and let me know what you did.\r\nI vaped this exclusively on a Citadel (after market driptip) with a dual core fused clapton 0.25ohms @45w (3.4v) ",
