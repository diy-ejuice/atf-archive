  "name": "3 Donuts: Simple Vanilla Powdered Donut",
  "description": "An easy three ingredient spot on vanilla powdered donut recipe. I used to mix this up with Cap Glazed Donut, but since FA Zeppola came out it has definitely been my go to for a donut base. This recipe could be tinkered and made more complex, but it's delicious as is and showcases just how good of a flavor Zeppola is.",

      "text": "I get an \"off\" flavor from TPA Vanilla Swirl starting at around 1.25%. This sucks, because I love what it does at low concentrations; there is just something in there I am overly sensitive to, so I cannot use it higher than 1%. To modify this recipe, I reduced it to 1%, and added 1% TPA Whipped Cream to compensate. I considered using 1% of CAP Vanilla Custard or FA Vanilla Bourbon to stick with the vanilla flavor, but TPA Whipped Cream is one of my favorite flavors and finds its way into most of my recipes anyways. It adds a bit of \"fluffy sweetness\" to things, and it worked well here.&#xD;\n&#xD;\nLike others, I get only powdered sugar from FA Zeppola (especially at 4.5%) at first. It takes at least a week for the bready donut flavor to start to come into play, and about 2 weeks before it really starts to shine. I was disappointed when I first picked up this flavor, but I'm very glad that I gave it a chance. It really is an amazing flavor.&#xD;\n&#xD;\nI'm also a huge fan of simple recipes. For quite a long time, I got sucked into the \"more flavors equals more complexity and better recipes\" mindset. It took some time to realize that oftentimes this is not the case, and that simple recipes can be absolutely amazing when the right ingredients are used.&#xD;\n&#xD;\nWhile some of my recipes do require a high ingredient count, I was able to simplify many of them, and they are now better than they were before. So I love it when I see simple recipes like this one, which showcase one particularly good flavor, and use just a couple of other good flavors to round things out. Great job!"

I mentioned before that I only get powdered sugar from FA Zeppola at 4% and above, as opposed to any donut. But this is only true for the first few weeks. After 2-3 weeks, everything just comes together like magic. Tastes exactly like a sweet powdered donut. This deserves serious praise. "
