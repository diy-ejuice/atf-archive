  "name": "Lemon Frosted Vanilla Cupcake",
  "description": "Fun fact. The origin of the lemon is unknown, though lemons are thought to have first grown in Assam (a region in northeast India), northern Burma or China.\r\n\r\nThis is a lemon frosted vanilla cupcake that focuses on the cake aspect. You get delicious vanilla cake followed by nice sweet lemon frosting. The lemon frosting is apparent, but not in your face. FE lemon is perfect for the frosting. I really wanted to focus on separating both the cake and frosting.  \r\n\r\nThis is a recipe I worked on since mid November and mixed many variations. Mix it up and leave some feedback.\r\n\r\n####In return, I will mix up one of your recipes and give you an honest review.\r\n\r\nI vape this primarily in an rda (Wasp). \r\n60 VG / 40 PG or 70 VG / 30 PG\r\n\r\n####Steep time: 5 days\r\nGood as a shake and vape but like anything with cake notes, a few days really helps bring this recipe together.\r\n\r\n####Vanilla Cupcake TFA: \r\nCake base.\r\n\r\n####Yellow Cake FW: \r\nCake base.\r\n\r\n####Lemon FE: \r\nSweet and tart candied lemon for the frosting.\r\n\r\n####Vanilla Cupcake CAP: \r\nThe frosting.\r\n\r\n####Meringue FA: \r\nThe frosting.\r\n\r\n####Vanilla Bean Ice Cream TFA: \r\nBoost the frosting, vanilla, and adds some weight to the cake without making it too dense. This brings the recipe together.\r\n\r\n####Super Sweet CAP:\r\nUsing this at 0.5% adds enough sweetness while not overpowering the tartness of the lemon. This is optional.\r\n\r\n####Acetyl Pyrazine TFA: \r\nThis really helps bring out the grainy note. This is not an ingredient that must be used, but really does make a difference.\r\n\r\n",
