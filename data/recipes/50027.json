  "description": "Lemon Ice Cream with Frosted Flakes sprinkled on top sound tasty?\r\n\r\n**FW Lemon Meringue Pie**\r\nI wanted that \"Dinner lady\" vibe in the mix. To my palate, Albeit on the weak side, this ingredient is close to that note for me. There's no doubt in my mind this is in Lemon Tart.\r\n\r\n**FA Vienna Cream**\r\nSweetness, Cream and a sugar \"texture\".\r\n\r\n**TFA Toasted Marshmallow**\r\nAdded mouthfeel, But a light toasted note as well.\r\n\r\n**TFA Vanilla Bean Ice Cream**\r\nVanilla, Cream and sweetness.\r\n\r\n**CAP Cereal 27**\r\nHave I mentioned how much I love this ingredient? Contributes the cereal note.\r\n\r\n**FA Custard**\r\nPlays beautifully with the Lemon ingredients to bring a smoother lemon experience, Further enhances the Ice Cream notes as well.\r\n\r\n**FA Lemon Sicily**\r\nBecause FW is quite weak, I've added Lemon Sicily as backbone support to prevent the lemon note from fading over time.",
