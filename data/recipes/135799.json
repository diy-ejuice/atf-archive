    "description": "\ud83c\udff7\ufe0f Soft Baked Golden Cookies topped with Matcha Green Tea Cream and Fresh Berries. \r\n\r\nThis recipe is inspired by the painting \u201cStarry Night over the Rhone\u201d by Vincent van Gogh. I was moved by Van Gogh\u2019s bold use of contrasting color (vibrant blues, buttery yellows, golds, and greens), rich texture, and expressive style. I wanted to pay homage to Van Gogh by creating a recipe that expressed the same qualities. \r\n\r\n&nbsp; \r\n\r\nTop: Matcha Cream, Esai Tea, and Jade Tea combine to create a velvety soft, smooth, and milky matcha green tea cream; with notes of a mild culinary grade matcha, savory black tea, and lightly green and crisp green tea.\r\n\r\nSandwiched inside this fragrant cream are mild notes of freshly picked juicy bilberries. The amalgamation of Bilberry, Blueberry Extra (SL) (CAP) and Blueberry Extra (TPA) makes for a sweet, tart, and natural Bilberry flavor. \r\n\r\nBase: Married into the cream, sits a nutty golden cookie. Almond Cookie, Beer Nuts, and Biscuit were combined to make this cookie base. The subtle notes of almond, walnut, and dry roasted peanuts also help to crisp up the edges of the soft baked cookie. Not only does the cookie add texture to the overall recipe, it\u2019s a nice nutty and buttery contrast to the brighter teas and juicy bilberries. \r\n",
