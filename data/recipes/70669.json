It's a thick heavy creamy coconut cigar.\r\n\r\nMix the originals first, otherwise you're missing out.\r\n\r\nI suggest vaping Abuela and this alternately.  You will go \"Oh the mango\" → \"Ooh the coconut\" → \"Oooh the mango\" ∞\r\n\r\n¹ https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/47894#abuela_by_fear\r\n² https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/42350#leche_de_coco_coconut_milk_by_hashslingingslashur",

You took 2 recipes I have tried and enjoyed and blended them together &amp; it works well. Them tobacco combo you used from Abuela works really well in here and doesn’t overpower the coconut. "

Other than that I mixed this as is, this is a great mash up of two great recipes. I was thinking of what I could sub the mango in Abuela for to make a different vape and the first thing that came to mind was coconut so finding this helped me. It's a great vape, I get the same cigar goodness from Abuela with a light creamy coconut at the back end. I'll definitely be mixing up more of this. "
