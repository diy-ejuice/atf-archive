  "description": "Touching base with an old friend recently, he expressed his long love affair with Castle Long. It was an old profile that I hadn't visited in a very long time. Being who I am I couldn't resist a take on the old versions we've all tried and try to do something a bit bigger and a bit bolder with it. \r\n\r\nThe Coconut: While I'm fairly positive the original used TPA Coconut Extra, I feel like it goes too quickly to hand lotion without a ridiculously long steep, and it's just less forgiving. TPA Coconut Candy is creamier, sweeter, and frankly just better all around IMO. At 5% it's bold, bright, and doesn't fade behind the wall of other stuff we got going on here.\r\n\r\nThe Almond: It's two parts here, with TPA Toasted Almond leading the way, with some CAP Cereal 27 to back up the nutty background while also giving a faint bit of grain. The grain texture also serves to boost up the Red Oak in our Bourbon Layer\r\n\r\nThe Bourbon: TPA Kentucky Bourbon is still the most buildable bourbon on the market to me. At 2.5% it's plenty bold enough to come all the way through, with a little FA Whisky to give a fair bit of peaty bite to the top end. TPA Red Oak helps it hit those woody notes\r\n\r\nThe finisher: TPA Vanilla Swirl gives us a mild body at 1.5% and a fairly bright vanilla. Along with a healthy splash of TPA Brown Sugar we get a rounded sweetness without too much extra heavy background.\r\n\r\nI hope you all enjoy this as much as I enjoyed creating it! Cheers!",

I really love this flavor profile, especially with this colder weather coming in, it just feels relaxing, inviting and warm. All the percentages seemed a bit high and I was worried about that, but I mixed it just as it was written and it came out absolutely perfect. The brown sugar just melts into the bourbon, the oak and the toasted almond, with the vanilla swirl with just a hint of that whisky, it is phenomenal. Already mixed up a bigger batch cause when this tester is gone, I'm a want some more. Thank you so much for sharing this with us. It is outstanding !"

      "text": "I didn’t have the red oak so I just put in 3 % cereal 27. I’m not one to wait for a steep so I just had to taste off the shake. So I only mixed a 10 ml which I will vape. I will mix up a bigger bottle and let that one steep. My first impression I love it. Much better than the original. Thanks Kopel "
