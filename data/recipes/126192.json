  "description": "This is the first batch I have mixed up. I will see how it goes and add notes after steep.\r\n\r\nAfter steeping for 2 weeks I have tried it out. I really enjoyed this. Vanilla ice cream forward then it finishes with a buttery cone. I am very pleased. I will be trying out a V2 of which I have already posted a recipe. My reasons for changing to a new recipe is I think it could have a bit more dairy flavor. Please don’t let this stop you from mixing it. It really is enjoyable. I like simple flavors and this hits the spot.",

Sweet, creamy, exploding with vanilla notes accentuated by a wonderful graham to create the presence of a cone. Good job, fellow mixer. Very good job. "
