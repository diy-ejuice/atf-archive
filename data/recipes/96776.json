  "description": "Faerie Maize is my attempt to recreate the sensation I got from my favorite eliquid, Faerie Wings, by RNR Vapors. They went out of business last year and the juice is no longer available.\r\n\r\nThe original Faerie Wings was a \"Rich Taro & Coconut Medley Blended With Creamy Milk Tea\". It's hard to put your finger on the exact reason why this juice was so good. It was rich and starchy, like a solid bakery custard, with a floating whisper of coconut in the background, like a delicate faerie wing.\r\n\r\nI tried a plethora of different juices, searching for that combination of rich and delicate, but nothing even came close. The taros were all too tangy, the custards were all too sweet, and the bakeries were all focused on other elements in the recipe. \r\n\r\nThe first time I tried the retail version of Terkish Maize, I hated it. It was so sweet that everything else about the profile was drowned out. Still, I knew there had to be a good juice in there, so I started experimenting.\r\n\r\nI mixed it 50/50 with an unflavored base, and the flavor profile started to emerge. It had that rich custard feel to it, and I thought it would be a good base for the other elements. I used Inawera Biscuit to strengthen the bakery effect imparted by the corn, then I added TPA Taro and Coconut Candy to weave in the rest.\r\n\r\nI vaped this creation until the 120ml bottle was gone. It was simply fantastic. I was about to make another batch when I saw these recipes by TooTall and ActionRalph, so I decided to try my hand at an all DIY version first.\r\n\r\nThis is my first attempt at a first attempt. I'm actually really happy with it. I would love to get some feedback on this if anyone has any suggestions to make it better.\r\n\r\nhttps://alltheflavors.com/users/Tootall\r\n\r\nhttps://alltheflavors.com/users/ActionRalf\r\n\r\n*Note: This is the first time I've shared an adapted recipe on All The Flavors. I tried to do all the licenses, links, and credits correctly, but if I did anything wrong or left anything out, please let me know so I can fix it. Thanks!\r\n",
