  "name": "My Secret Sbux: Cinnamon Dolce White Mocha",
  "description": "This is the only coffee drink that I will actually have as I really don't like coffee at all. White Mocha is lovely and put a dash of cinnamon in it and something magical happens. It's my Starbucks secret for you. I like even better in coconut milk.\r\n\r\nThis is really milky but very little coffee, so if you want more just increase WF Brazilian Coffee up to 0.75% or more to your taste.\r\n\r\nNotes and details of this mix will be added shortly.\r\n\r\nEnjoy, be queer & vape on.",

On the inhale you get a sweet milky light vanilla/ coconut  note that transitions to white chocolate with cinnamon and light coffee.    If you want more of a coffee note you can easily up the coffee.  This is easily an all day vape for me and am in love ,   well done !!!! "
