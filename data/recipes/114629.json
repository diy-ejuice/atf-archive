  "description": "Every October the family goes to the local apple orchard to pick a basket of apples, and then takes the hay ride back to the pumpkin patch. When we have all our stuff ready, we go in to the little shop area to pay. This recipe is what that little shop smells like. \r\n\r\nThere’s spices unknown all blending together in the country air. There’s apples, obviously. So many apples. Is it the fresh squeezed apple cider? Apples from the orchard? Pies? Maybe some coconut candles or jam that was probably made by someone’s sweet old grandma. There’s so many different things hitting your nose, but nothing is offensive. There’s no off notes, but you’re not quite able to pick out every subtlety. \r\n\r\nThat’s the inspiration for this recipe. I usually don’t post my non-tobacco recipes because I usually find that I’m just bumbling around with fruits in my hands, but I’m actually pretty proud of this one- not just as a fruity recipe, but just in general.
