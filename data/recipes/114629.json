    "description": "Every October the family goes to the local apple orchard to pick a basket of apples, and then takes the hay ride back to the pumpkin patch. When we have all our stuff ready, we go in to the little shop area to pay. This recipe is what that little shop smells like. \r\n\r\nThere\u2019s spices unknown all blending together in the country air. There\u2019s apples, obviously. So many apples. Is it the fresh squeezed apple cider? Apples from the orchard? Pies? Maybe some coconut candles or jam that was probably made by someone\u2019s sweet old grandma. There\u2019s so many different things hitting your nose, but nothing is offensive. There\u2019s no off notes, but you\u2019re not quite able to pick out every subtlety. \r\n\r\nThat\u2019s the inspiration for this recipe. I usually don\u2019t post my non-tobacco recipes because I usually find that I\u2019m just bumbling around with fruits in my hands, but I\u2019m actually pretty proud of this one- not just as a fruity recipe, but just in general.
