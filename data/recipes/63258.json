    "description": "It's a different take on RY4. Smooth creamy vanilla, adds warmth and body. Red Burley is the best for being accepting of most accompanying aromas, oakwood adds a nice woody note, and well graham cracker and zeppola...can't really go wrong with that combo as a bakery note.\r\n\r\nAfter doing a few tests with playing around with the percentages, I find myself coming back to the original recipe and preferring it to other versions. If you want a bit more of a graham forward taste, add in 0.75% FLV Graham Cracker, but other than that I pretty much like it as is.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\nphoto credit: BaboMike <a href=\"http:\/\/www.flickr.com\/photos\/36976184@N02\/5581447146\">Feminine Penis<\/a> via <a href=\"http:\/\/photopin.com\">photopin<\/a> <a href=\"https:\/\/creativecommons.org\/licenses\/by-nc\/2.0\/\">(license)<\/a>\r\n",

I don't know why it's listed as a \"work in progress\" - it tastes finished to me, with no sign of room for improvement. Not too sweet, not too dry, just terrific. I can definitely enjoy this Morning Wood all day. "
