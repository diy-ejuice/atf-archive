  "description": "Every single one of us has a little bit of Devil Inside. \r\nWith this in mind it was past time to start playing with fire & heat and a few other little things that were naughty whoooo ha wha ha whaaa wa ahhhhh........\r\n\r\nThere are few lovely cinnamon based cocktails out there that seem very trendy at the moment so I thought I would take my chances and create one in a vape, so said the devil inside. \r\nThe devil on my shoulder made me lick test Flavorah Fire Cinnamon & Flavorah Heat, kids DO NOT TRY THIS AT HOME otherwise you may discover the same melting point of brimstone! \r\n\r\nFUN FACTOID: The exact temperature of Hell cannot be computed but it must be less than 444.6°C, the temperature at which brimstone or sulfur changes from a liquid to a gas. \r\n\r\nMay I use some orange I ask Lucifer,only if it's with my blood he replies. Adam was around the corner screaming use this Sour Apple as Eve handed me some raspberries bubbling in citrus (so they didn't make it to heaven apparently lol) \r\n\r\nWith these ingredients I went to work for the Devil. \r\n\r\nAre you pleased with what I have created I ask the Devil.\r\nHe replies \"we all have a bit of me inside us all ha hah,\r\nso let all those DIY'ers decide ! Whooo wooo ha wha wa ha aha ahhhh\" \r\n\r\nI dare you to mix this !!!! \r\n",

      "text": "&#xD;\nWhat a fun little sort of abstract recipe. I could probably do without the extra throat hit from the FLV Heat, but maybe it drives home the cocktail profile, making it burn like strong liquor in a way that it wouldn’t with just the cinnamon &amp; sour apple? Regardless, the apple, raspberry, and citrus soda all come through and play well together, and the little bit of cinnamon on top makes it more interesting. If you mix this up, you’ll probably think as I do now that there should be more apple + citrus soda and raspberry + citrus soda recipes.  &#xD;\n"
