  "description": "Okay, so everyone has their strawberry and cream vape. This one is mine. I derived this from ye ol' Mustard Milk, after messing around, adding and subtracting things over about a six month period of time. Less strawberry and more cream. \r\n\r\n\r\nCAP Sweet Strawberry and TFA Strawberry 1:1, I think, makes a great artificial strawberry flavor, and it's what I ended up settling on for this version. \r\n\r\n\r\nTFA VBIC at 6% makes a great creamy base for us. I apologize if you get pepper from it. It truly is a shame some people do. We add TFA Vanilla Swirl at 2% and CAP Sweet Cream at 2.5% to give us an excellent cream that is not too sweet, and loaded with plenty of vanilla.\r\n",
