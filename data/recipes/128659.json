    "description": "What I think to be a delicious vape. This is creamy peanut butter cream filling sandwiched between two oatmeal cookies. On the inhale you get oatmeal cookies and on the exhale you get a delicious peanut butter cream filling. I personally love it on a shake but it best after a few days of steeping.",

            "text": "This is stellar. The only way I could imagine anyone being let down by it is if you're expecting a lot of oatmeal cookie. It's there, but it definitely takes a backseat to smooth, thick, and rich peanut butter creme. I tried it as a shake and vape and it was promising, but even at 1% that raw greasy vanilla of unsteeped CAP Vanilla Custard was sticking out like a sore thumb. Give it a few days and it dies down. Give it two weeks and it's even better; the oatmeal cookie comes out more and picks up a bit of bakery texture that was missing before, and pairs so well with peanut butter and cream flavors eventually melt together into something like a giant gooey spoonful of peanut butter cream filling. A lot of peanut butter recipes have problems with fading but this one is still strong three weeks out and hard to put down. "
