  "description": "This is an experimental flavor combo for pod style mods and nic salt flavor dev. I have recently embarked on the nic salt journey and this is my first NicSalt for pod systems release, I chose a really simple and not complex flavor profile with known flavors for easy mixing by anyone... I shouldnt have to leave any flavor notes as these flavors are known  well enough and used broadly. After adding my Nicriver salts @6mg i was really pleased with the outcome of this mix it tasted like strawberry watermelon slighty sour and sweet with a nice brightness the pear brought to the party. I hope anyone who tries this has the same experience.... Happy mixing\r\n",
