  "description": "on the inhale you get a nice bright sweet marshmallow vanilla that transitions to  a nice creamy gooey custard using Fresh03 quick custard and finishes with a brownsugar cookie / nilla waffer bakery note.  This is a  simple, **VERY TASTY**  and really well balanced mixed - it is for those that like a creamy full mix but do not want that over the top egginess of a custard.    This is  very vapeable off the shake but really comes together at 5 - 7 days  \r\nTested on a reload RDA at 65W on a .15 alien coil \r\n\r\n**flapper pie** is the base of this it is has a nice light caramel with a vanilla pudding/ custard/ meringue cream filling a light bakery note. \r\n\r\nQuick custard  by  @freshepies  **(LB vanilla ice cream and FLV vanilla pudding - if you do not have these flavors I highly recommend u get them as it is probably one of the most useful cream custard bases out there)** really fills out the cream part of this mix and is nice off the shake but hits its stride at 4 - 5 days. it creates a custard type of profile with out some of the heavy egg notes\r\n\r\n**marshmallow gooey** is pretty much \"fluff\" and I love it!! it adds some of those marshmallow vanilla top notes,  and helps transition to the custard \r\n\r\nThe **brown sugar cookie and cap sugar cookie** are noticed on the finish as the crust and support the bakery in flapper pie ",
