  "description": "Weekend Assignment - *Blue*\r\nShake & Vape certified, best after 24hrs to round out\r\n\r\nWhen I think of the color blue, I think of a light, bright blue. So what would blue taste like to me? To put it simple... refreshing! Like a crisp winter sky. Now to emulate that into a flavor...\r\nI used FW Blueberry, but at 3.25% it's not what you are tasting here. It's a thick syrup style blueberry that is giving the HS something to sit on top of and give it some body. HS is a bright, very candied Blueberry and these two combined is very good if candy is what you're after. The jelly candy/marshmallow/Swedish gummy is to give this a chewy candy base, like a soft cloud and the whipped cream helps round the sharpness out. Sweeten it up, drop in some extreme ice, and you have my idea of blue. A cool, sky blue gummy candy that's as refreshing as it is good. \r\n**If you don't want a slight menthol note, sub the extreme ice with 1 drop koolada per 10ml or any other cooling agent...but the Menthol/mint in extreme ice adds an interesting touch.",
