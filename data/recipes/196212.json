  "description": "If you like Sugar Cookies..... you have got to try these. Inspired by a mixer over on ELR known as JGrim. He mde a simple 4 flavor mix back in '16. I have vaped this for 3 years. Over that time I have tinkered with one aspect or another and now  this recipe is just humming. Simply delicious. Most of the flavors are self explanatory but I will explain,  or at least try to....\r\nAlmond;  Because almond flavor in Sugar Cookies is amazing\r\nAlmond Cookie;  Because it ups the almond aspect and keeps the Cookie balance \r\nMarzipan; Because it enhances the almond flavor giving it depth without affecting the overall profile\r\nClassic Sponge Cake;   Originally I usedFW Yellow Cake, MB Sponge cake is sooo good and enhances the bakery notes here\r\nHard Crack Toffee;  Very strong flvor, added here @ .15 to give this that \"Oven Baked\" edge..\r\nSugar Cookie;  @ 7.5 to get all I can from this Flavor\r\nVienna Cream;   @ 3.5 it turns out amazing\r\n\r\nThis can be vaped right away, but after 5 days the Vienna  Cream and Almond settle in and it  only gets so much better.... \r\nIf you like Sugar Cookies, ..... have at it, you will taste the goodness right off (SNV) .   Make enough though, you will want to taste this after a week........enjoy.\r\n\r\nP.S.  I almost forgot, ... Sweetener!  I add .5 Super Sweet, sometimes .25... It is at your discretion.\r\n\r\nP.S.S.  Substitutions;  MB Classic Spnge Cake can be subbed with 3% FW  or JF  Yellow Cake.\r\nINW Marzipan can be subbed with .35 FA Marzipan , \r\nHard Crack Toffee;  can be taken out but those slight toasty edge notes wont be there...\r\n\r\n",
