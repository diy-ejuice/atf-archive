  "description": "Dark tobacco with licorice \r\n\r\nLittle more needs to be said. I came up with this a few years ago, but have since modified it to fit more recent tastes. \r\n\r\nThis is amazing after a 30 day steep. It's good straight away, but really improves with time. \r\n\r\nI used to smoke Gauloises tobacco rolled in licorice papers, and since I started vaping, I've been wanting to replicate this for the days I'm really craving my old habit. This is the closest I've come. \r\n\r\nImage by Brian McSwain from [The Florida Heartland](http://www.brianmcswain.com/thefloridaheartland/)",
