    "description": "This is a very mild and gentle touch on an awesome juice by Element E-Liquids, also called Key Lime Cookie. It sparked me to make my own KLC and this was born. I took my general approach of a more simple version and I think it turned out okay.\r\n\r\nI have used varying percentages of the cookie base and the lime to find a nice match and this was the best. Turning the cookie down made the lime too strong, and vice versa, but using less of either just didn't taste as good. \r\n\r\nOur cookie base is a simple one, and I tend to use it for \"plug and play\" with apples, strawberries, and the like. 6% Cap Sugar Cookie is the main note here, turned up a little higher than normal to stand up to the very potent key lime elements to this mix. 1% FW Hazelnut adds a more grainy texture to the sugar cookie and a little more 'chew'. I reckon this could be accomplished with AP at around 0.25% but who doesn't like Hazelnut? \r\n\r\nOur lime note is simple and strong. I have toyed with CAP Lemon Lime, FA Lime Tahity, and some others but I felt none of them quite fit the cookie base as well as FA Florida Key Lime. As a side note this flavor is bomb diggity and a must have if you're a citrus lover like myself. It stands out in a mix, especially at the 3% we utilize here. Nice, bright, and green in a good way.\r\n\r\nOur final addition is FA Meringue at 1.5%. This is one of my all time favorites, and as I release more recipes you will see it pop up in almost any bakery, dessert type flavor that I mix. It adds a sweet baked note to the whole recipe and serves as our frosting\/glaze element as well as an impromptu sweetener. To me it adds a faint note of crispiness to the frosting area of the cookie too, much like a day old corner brownie, again in a great way. \r\n \r\nSkip the sweetener unless you have to have it, this is sugar laden and rich all on its own. I generally mix this at 80\/20 but 70\/30 seems to bring the bite of citrus out a bit more, so adjust to your liking here. I would suggest not dropping below 65% VG or the citrus of the lime combined with high PG will really bump up the throat hit.",
