    "description": "I been grooving on Liquid Barn's White Chocolate Peppermint as a single flavor since it came out for the holiday. It is really, really good. Got bored and threw this one together and have been alternating it into my rotation of bored mixes.\r\n\r\nThis recipe is a bit thick, LB White Chocolate Peppermint is not the strongest of flavorings. Going the lazy route with the VBIC \/ Meringue combo :)\r\n\r\nEnjoy. Just a tasty thick easy recipe. I shake and vape, it of course gets better over time.",

I think to only thing I would change is add to the ice cream base to add some depth and thickness.  Maybe hangsen ice cream or something along those lines.  The nice thing about this one is it\u2019s simplicity though and having 4oz of WCP from the awesome box this is a great way to use a bunch of it!  "
