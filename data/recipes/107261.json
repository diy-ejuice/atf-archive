  "description": "One of the First recipes I ever made...The white chocolate peppermint from LB is the star of the show here. It was my very first order of flavors I got in my beginner kit from LB. Obviously it can be subbed and played with but It's a delicious christmas time vape...Nice and Cool just the way I like it!\r\n\r\nedit: 11/08/19. Lowered percentages and tweaked some due to age of recipe and lots of people still mixing it..",
