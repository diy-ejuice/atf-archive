  "description": "My simple take on a boysenberry cream pie. This is made for the Developed Pie Challenge\r\n\r\nI start by using possibly one of the best boysenberries out there,\r\nFLV Boysenberry, next I use JF Boysenberry to add a slight bit of stickyness to the pie filling.\r\n\r\nFA Apple Pie is used on the lower end here as it provides a good pie crust base while CAP SC softens up the crust to give it a delicate mouthfeel.\r\n\r\nNow onto the creams! CAP Sweet Cream is just fantastic all around and helps provide the sweet almost whipped like cream base to a pie. I added a little FA Fresh Cream here to help boost the cream profile and also thicken the cream base.\r\n\r\nCAP SS is optional but I think it really helps provide a more authentic pie. I use it at 0.25% here as I don't want to mute out the flavors and oversweeten it, just enough to provide the every so sticky sweet taste a gooey pie has\r\n\r\nSUBS: If you want a slightly more baked crust, replace CAP Sugar Cookie with FW Pie Crust at 0.75%",
