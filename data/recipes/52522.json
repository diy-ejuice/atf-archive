  "name": "Gin Basil Smash",
  "description": "The Basil Smash is a relatively new drink (well, new in the context of cocktails) with an alluring Hulk-green tint and a real fresh kick. ... Place basil and lemon into a cocktail shaker. ... The Basil Smash was conceived by Jörg Meyer of the Lion in Hamburg in 2008. \r\nTime to make juice that comes very close to the real drink!\r\n\r\nBuilding blocks:\r\n\r\n(FM) Gin In Paris, serves as the foundation for this recipe. \r\nThe complex flavors of this gin, a gin combined with pure orange, and a  smooth banana taste.  It is spicy and fresh without dominating.\r\n(CAP) Lemon and Lime, a very refreshing and balanced lemon&lime that perfectly sit in this mix. I choose this aroma for its light candy and soda taste.\r\n(FA) Oba Oba , light vanilla tasting, sweet candy aroma that blend nicely gin, basil and the lemon and lime.\r\n(FLV) Basil, a refreshing alternative for a natural mint flavor, fresh basil and fresh fennel with hints from anis. Fairly sweet and the finishing touch for this recipe.\r\n\r\nThis savory vape is perfect any time of year, but it packs a powerful (and tasty!) boozy punch!\r\nThe ultimate “Lounge-Vape”.\r\n\r\nOptional:\r\nLike it sweeter? add (CAP) super sweet to you likes.\r\nA few drops of cucumber/cactus will work as well.\r\n\r\nSteep: 9 days to settle the gin and citrus and let the basil blend perfectly.",
