  "description": "Have you ever had one of those days where you just wanted to take a box of cereal to the couch and dig in?! Here is your chance! This is a simple Trix cereal vape that tastes amazing! What’s also nice, is this acts as a base, or stone. Take the sweetener out, unless you don’t want to of course. If you want cereal and milk, add this to your favorite milk base. If you are looking for a breakfast yogurt, just add this to your favorite yogurt base and you are good to go. The choices are endless, including cheesecakes, cannolis, ice creams/milkshakes, cakes, anything you want. \r\n\r\nThis is certified shake and vape as well. The FLV Sweetness will get sweeter over time, capping out around a week, so if you would like to wait that long, go ahead. I doubt it lasts that long. \r\n\r\nPlease, if you make anything using this, link it! I would love to see what others use this with. ",
