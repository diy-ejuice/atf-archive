    "description": "This flavor will tie you to a radiator and GRAPE YOU in the mouth.\r\n\r\nThe name is a reference to the Whitest Kids You Know sketch with the same name.\r\n\r\nI wasn't going for anything in particular here, but I wanted a grape flavor that wasn't overpoweringly grape (despite the name) - so it's got some blueberry in there as well to mellow out the grape candy flavor. It also has some sour gummy candy to bring out some more sourness along with the lemon and cherry to add more fruit in there. Cactus, I'm not sure why I put that in there, but it's good. Marshmallows are for body - I especially like the toasted marshmallow, but that might be a bit too much. Cream cheese icing adds some sweetness and creaminess.",
