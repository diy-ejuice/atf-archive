    "description": "Creamy Sopapilla casserole. My first public shared recipe. In its current state, it has taken me over 13 revisions. Nothing should be subsituted. \r\n\r\nI have always steeped the recipe for 2 weeks. I prefer all my recipes 30\/70 pg\/vg because it gives a certain sweetness and thick mouth feel. Some times I have added no more than 1% tfa sweetener, but it is still very sweet for me without. \r\n\r\nIf you give this a try, I appreciate all feedback.",

After 2 weeks it blends into a nice creamy cinnamon with the cream being dominant. On the exhale I get dough or bakery notes. Being unfamiliar with the reference I have no suggestions, as is it's a really good vape. Good work.    "

            "text": "This tastes terrific! It's like a fresh sopapilla tossed in cinnamon &amp; brown sugar and then topped with vanilla ice cream. Very complex and hits all the right notes after steeping for 15 days. I wouldn't suggest changing a thing. I've been meaning to try to make a sopapilla cheesecake vape that would be a simpler profile (based on a culinary recipe that's just canned crescent rolls, cream cheese, vanilla, cinnamon, and sugar) and will probably steal liberally from this when I do. But in the meantime, I need to get some more of this in the steeping drawer because it is delicious. Thanks Myztik! "
