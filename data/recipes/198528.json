    "description": "Profile: Caramel infused taffy with a kick of peppermint\r\n\r\nBeen screwing and chewing around with FLV Peppermint thanks to @Zany, despite the fact that yours truly hates everything cool.\r\nBut I was drawn to the peppermint flavor much more rather than just having a cool element in my mix.\r\nI do love a good caramel and peppermint candy however, so I set sails to make it into a vape that I could enjoy all year around.\r\n\r\nLets break it down!\r\n\r\nThe Taffy Chew:\r\n\r\nTo create the texture I decided to go with FW Salt Water Taffy as the main note. This adds both a little sweetness and a little texture to the mix.\r\nI wanted to enhance the texture, making it more thick (as if it would be sticking to your teeth), so for a more waxy and sticky texture note I my choice fell on CAP Butter Cream to complete the waxy and stickiness.\r\nFor a little bit of mouthfeel, just so it didn't feel like that I would be chewing a flavored candle light, I threw in some TFA Vanilla Swirl. It makes it chewy, but round and nice in texture and adds a hint of sweetness and creaminess without actual cream.\r\n\r\nThe Caramel Mint:\r\n\r\nI have always found the mixture of FW Caramel (salted) and FA Butterscotch to be a perfect caramel taste for me. It brings the best of both worlds, so it was an easy choice for me combine those two.\r\nConcerning percentages of the two, they are just about enough to not be disgusting, but gives a nice round warm mouthfeel on the inhale, that really coveres your tongue in caramel goodiness.\r\nOn the exhale, you'll get a good serious kick of the FLV Peppermint in both terms of cooling and the nice sharp peppermint taste, while the caramel still lingers and dances around. I experimented with FLV Peppermint around 0.5% which i found to be way too much and it just took over. I find 0.25% to be just perfect, to still keep some sharpness without it feels like you're vaping razorblades.\r\nFA Meringue is being used in this case to create a shade of candy and doesn't really do much other than exactly that.\r\n\r\nTo complete the candy, but not stated in the recipe above due to the preference of people, I added in about 0.25% CAP Super Sweet. I find that it adds the sugarlips that I myself like from candy, but the recipe works fine without it really. It all comes down to whether or not you as mixer tend to use it.\r\n\r\nConcerning a steep, this really needs the advised 3 days of steep. Off the shake the FLV Peppermint is a tad too harsh and the caramels haven't developed yet at all, so please follow my advise and let it sit for 3 days.",
