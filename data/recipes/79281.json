    "description": "I enjoyed the idea of a 1-2-3 recipe ID10T did with his cranberry sprite recipe.  Simple and easy so I made one of my own.  \r\nCreamy and thick vanilla pudding type of recipe wit darker and forward vanilla notes.  Has a few spicy and nutty notes as well.  Simple recipe, but it meets my vanilla needs.  ",
