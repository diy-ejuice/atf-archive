  "description": "I wanted to contribute to REMIX MONTH but I wanted something outside my normal bakery type flavors to use.\r\nI LOVED Ruby Roo's Nola Flavor as a great summer vape, but it's been over 6 months since I last had it so this was going by memory and flavor description as best I could.\r\n\r\nFlavors Description \r\n\"Nola is a traditional Australian pavlova meringue topped with whipped cream, strawberries, kiwi, and passionfruit.\"\r\n\r\nPassion fruit\r\nI knew right away the passion fruit was FA passion fruit so that was easy. The taste really stands out to me, though it's fairly sutble in the vape itself, I would recoginize it anywhere. I knew it would have to be low to just barely peak through with that slight tropical/floral note it carries. .5% brings the perfect hint of flavor without the throat it that it brings used higher.\r\n\r\nStrawberry\r\nI'm a strawberry non-taster so I always struggle with strawberry juices, but I could taste a small amount of a ripe, slightly sweet strawberry in Nola. I can't taste TFA Straw ripe at all so I doubted it was in there, but I can taste FA Red touch (Strawberry) so it was my first though, it carries a real strawberry flavor with a slight dryness to it. I've heard it described as freeze dried strawberry and I think that's pretty accurate. Looking for something to bring a little life back into FA Strawberry I went with FLV strawberry over the others. I'm not a huge fan of TFA Strawberry, and originally I tried INW Shisha strawberry, but it made it a little to candy feeling for me. going with a 2:1 ratio of FA and FLV strawberry with 4%/2% helped bring to life the strawberry and sweeten it just a touch.\r\n\r\nKiwi\r\nUp front I don't have a ton of experience with Kiwi so I wasn't sure on this one. I only have FW and TFA DBL.\r\nComparing the two, I found TFA Kiwi double to be a little more candied kiwi, whereas FW seemed a little juicy, almost like would you'd get in a yoplay Strawberry Kiwi yogurt. It's a bit of a weak flavor it self but I knew it needed to stand up to provide some juicyness to the overall vape so I took the % up slowly to stand contrast to the strawberry.\r\n\r\nThe Meringue\r\nFA Meringue was an easy choice here, it's a very sweet, real meringue flavor when used higher to be more of a main note vs. and accent so 2% worked really well. When vaping Nola though I swore up and down I tasted a slight sweet bakery note, like you'd get from a baked meringue. Wanting to really keep that sweet bakery flavor sutble I went right to CAP sugar cookie, 1.5% doesn't taste like cookie, but it provides some baked sugar sweetness to the merignue to fill out that base perfectly.\r\n\r\nWhipped cream\r\nSo this one is doubtfully what they use in Nola, but I only have FA whipped cream and CAP van whipped cream. More than likely I would guess they use TFA whipped cream as FA is disconnected in the states, but I didn't want the weight it brings to the table so I went with CAP van whipped cream. It's fluffy and light and I only get a slight vanilla taste to it. 1.5% was enough to provide a light fluffy mouth feel at the end of the vape with a hint of vanilla accenting the fruits.\r\n\r\nLet it steep for a few days so that passion fruit settles in to the recipe and have at it!\r\n\r\nAll in all from memory this isn't a 1:1 clone, but it's incredibly similar and really hits the spot for the craving of NOLA as well as being a great sweet and bring summer vape.",
