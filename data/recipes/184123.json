  "description": "Tropical Pineapple and Paw Paw with creamy yoghurt and a touch of lime. \r\nMade for Mixin’ Vixens- I know the photo shows banana- but I’m really not a fan of banana. Paw paw is said to share similarities so I chose to use that instead. \r\nMB Pineapple Lassi is an amazing yoghurt with a fairly good pineapple but it needed some help, so I used the VT and INW. \r\nThe VT Paw Paw is quite high at 3.75%. But I needed to push it that high to get it to come through over everything else. \r\nVT Yoghurt Drink adds to the yoghurt as well as having a citrus note which brightens the fruit. It also sweetens the mix. \r\nCAP Creamy Yogurt gives the yoghurt more creaminess and yoghurty tang. \r\nCan definitely SNV- maybe give it a few hours minimum though. Improves with a few days steep.",
