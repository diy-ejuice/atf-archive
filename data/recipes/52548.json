  "description": "This flavor is inspired by one of the most glorious things in the existence of aromas, in my opinion . . . old books.  What I’m not trying to do: create a vape that tastes like an old book.  What I’m trying to do: create a flavor based on the findings of what aromas make up the smell of old books.  Scientists have studied the volatile organic compounds (VOC) that combine to create the aromas that people associate with old books.  This is intended to be a mélange of those aromas that has tobacco as its foundation with supporting notes from the other aromas.\r\n\r\nThe following are articles I read dedicated to the fabled old book smell.\r\n\r\nFrom the New York Times Op-Ed page: Some scents add monetary value as well as historical interest. A dictionary owned by Mark Twain still had a distinct aroma of tobacco in its pages. Twain, of course, was an incessant smoker of cigars and pipes. Source: https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/27/opinion/the-smell-of-old-books.html\r\n\r\nFrom Mental Floss: A combination of grassy notes with a tang of acids and a hint of vanilla over an underlying mustiness” is how an international team of chemists describes the unique odor of old books in a study. Source: http://mentalfloss.com/article/31235/what-causes-old-book-smell#sthash.oyAVEY1V.dpuf\r\n\r\nFrom IFLScience: Compound Chemistry reports that hints of almond are created by benzaldehyde, while vanillin emits notes of vanilla. Sweet smells come from toluene and ethyl benzene, and 2-ethyl hexanol produces a light floral fragrance. Additionally, the book can also retain some odors it has been exposed to during its history, such as smoke, water damage, or pressed flowers between the pages.  Source: http://www.iflscience.com/chemistry/where-does-smell-old-books-come/\r\n\r\nFrom Popular Science: The fact that the participants named chocolate wasn’t surprising to the researchers, though the frequency that they identified chocolate and coffee with eau de book was.\r\n“You tend to use familiar associations to describe smells when they are unlabeled,” Bembibre says. “And also, the VOC's of chocolate and coffee seem to be very similar to that of books. But it was still surprising to see that reference come up again and again.”\r\nBembibre also tested what people thought of the smell of the library at St. Paul’s Cathedral, London, where the researchers gathered many VOC  samples. The smells recorded there were as a whole described by participants as woody and smoky more than chocolatey, probably because they were able to see the magnificent wooden surroundings. The library was chosen for a reason; the smell in that library is so famed that it often gets mentioned in guest books, and the curator insists that any conservation methods must preserve the distinct smell.

It is delightful as a shake and vape, but I'm eager to see how this changes given a little time to unfold.  As this progresses and/or changes, I will add more extensive flavor notes . . . at the time of this writing, I am early in the process (day 2).\r\n\r\nUpdate (July 2nd, 2017):  \r\n\r\nAddition - added FLV Connecticut Shade at 0.5% . . . it brings in some coffee/cocoa notes and just a hint of leather.  It feels like the perfect bookend (don't excuse the pun) to close out this recipe.  I think this is now near completion.\r\n\r\nMixed up a 30mL of A Good Book at a ratio of 60vg to 40pg and loaded it in a tank that is somewhere between a very restricted lung hit and MTL.  \r\n\r\n",

Got called into work from corona isolation so I rebuilt my go to travel tank, fatality m25 and out the door for my 45min travel time in. By the time I got in I had made my mind up to leave this review.  I fell in love with another tobacco juiced called dark strong on elr over a year ago as I loved how the flavors played well together. That one used coconut to tie things together. This one here is my new favorite. From inhale to finish is awesome. Did a great job with the percentages. Spicey, lingering depth of flavor and smooth finish. I wanna say that chocolate is binding or bridging the flavors. But not blah, cause even the fig has a part but the vanilla and almond are awesome compliments to the tobacco's. All around all day vape material here. Im going back home to mix 120 to sit on a shelve as I think after 2 week's this is just going to get better. Now I see you have v2 of this! Get the front door. Im all in, thanks a ton for contributing and sharing this masterpiece! "

I've never experienced a vape like this. &#xD;\n&#xD;\nI feel it would be useless to try to describe the flavor more than what has already been said and you'll be better off tasting blind anyway. You can taste every bit of this recipe on its own but it is certainly greater than the sum of its parts. When you stop analyzing and trying to pick up this and that and just enjoy the vape you start to get a true sense of what this vape really is. Its a wholly unique experience and altogether a very pleasant one. &#xD;\n&#xD;\nReally just a beautiful vape that, at least for me, hits the sense memory hard and think that elevates the recipe to a whole new level. Most Michelin Starred chefs strive to accomplish this and cannot. I never expected a juice to accomplish this and I think that's really something special. &#xD;\n&#xD;\nIt develops like a good book, interesting from the beginning but more and more so the further you get into it. Don't put it up on a shelf to steep. That would be a waste. Instead enjoy it slowly from start to finish as the flavor twists and turns into something altogether different and yet unchanged at the same time. &#xD;\n&#xD;\nAbsolute poetry; a love letter to vapers and book lovers alike. Thank you for sharing it. "
