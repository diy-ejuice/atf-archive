  "description": "Problem solved. Complex tobacco flavor with just 3 ingredients. \r\n\r\nNice rich tobacco comes from the burley. Add some dark notes and caramel with ry4 double, and finish it off with some dark honey notes. Add more burley if you wanna taste that ash, but I wouldnâ€™t recommend over 4%. Let it steep. \r\n\r\nEnjoy. Born. ",

The Burley dominates this mix and only at the very end does the Black Honey show up. I'm glad I found a use for it!    Nice job."
