  "description": "I really wanted to try to make something with Avocado cream (VT) it is a pretty solid buttery creamy profile - it does have a slight banana note that was present in all the percentages I tested at ( 1, 2 and 3) . That banana back note works in this recipe but may not work in a more savory type vape.. Adding citrus to it seems to even bring that note out more and acts as the top note . The honeysuckle and meringue add the sweetness that is needed in a gelato . and bring the vanilla galeto and avocado together in this mix .   The Key lime is the top note and well who does not like lime and avocado!   This is a a creamy light bright gelato that could easily be an ADV . The percentages are made for a RDA and profile may not be strong enough in a subohm",
