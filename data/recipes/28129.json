    "description": "First recipe posting here, hopefully others enjoy it. I was looking for a good Bavarian Creme Doughnut and I looked for a bit and couldn't find much. There were a couple of things that were simple that I mixed up and didn't care for. I decided to make this my first mix. I am aiming for biting into the center of the doughnut here. The ooey, gooey center bite that results in a super creamy feel.\r\n\r\nZeppola\/YC\/Joy: This is the doughnut base. Zeppola is one of my favorites here. I tried TPA - Frosted before this and it just didnt fit right. There was something off, or artificial with it. I've tested this as a doughnut base, and it gives me a \"Fresh fried doughnut\" feel; slightly yeasty as well. This is my base I use for many doughnuts now.\r\n\r\nBavarian Cream\/French Vanilla Creme\/SC\/Meringue\/VC: This is my Bavarian Cream. The custard\/meringue combo gives me a slightly thicker cream. I tried without those, and it felt too \"watered\" down. \r\n\r\nThe chocolate glaze: DCC. This is use lightly, as I just wanted it as a thin glaze. \r\n\r\nI was asked how the vape experience was, and this was my reply: Its got a strong fried doughnut taste on the inhale and beginning of the exhale. Then its followed by the Bavarian cream\/semi creamy flavor, with a very slight chocolate at the end of the exhale. It's a pretty thick and dense vape. Very flavorful. A couple of people have commented on the fact that the French Vanilla is so high, but it is not as strong after the steep; gets toned down by the other flavors in the mix. The doughnut taste lingers on the tongue, with a little bit of the cream as well.\r\n\r\nIf you want a little more balance, more even texture\/doughnut to cream feel, you can drop the Bav Cream down to about 1% or so and drop the french vanilla cream down to about 1.5%. This adds more of a texture and balance to the mix.",
