  "description": "\"Throw shit at a wall and see what sticks\" is what a great man once said.\r\nThat's exactly what I did with this recipe. I craved for fruit salad, so I picked up any flavors that looked like they could belong in a fruit salad, used the recommended percentages ELR back then gave me and voil√† - my current ADV was born\r\n\r\nHonestly, I feel like there is lots of room for improvements. I'm currently playing a lot with this but I feel like this is good enough to put it out there. Good enough that I vape this stuff since months everyday.\r\n\r\n(Sweetener is optional. I simply used it because I like it sweet)\r\n\r\nFULL CREDIT TO THE THUMBNAIL/ARTWORK GOES TO @Zany",
