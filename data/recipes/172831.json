  "description": "Lemon meringue pie- a tart lemon curd, sweet fluffy meringue and a buttery pastry. I tried really hard to get the balance between the flavours right so it was authentic to eating an actual lemon meringue pie.\r\nCAP Lemon Meringue Pie is the main player. I just accentuated what it already has and filled in where I felt it was lacking. I tried using VT Lemon Meringue Tart but CAP worked better for the type of LMP I had envisioned.\r\nFE Lemon (aka ‘Xpress Flavour’ Lemon on Chefs) and LA Cream Cheese Icing make up the lemon curd layer. FE is just a really lovely lemon and works perfectly here to create that lemon meringue pie kinda lemon. If you want it more lemon-y you can bump it up to 1.5%. LA CCI is what makes this mix so good. It gives it richness, mouthfeel and makes \r\nit a lemon curd rather than just a lemon. I think it needs a bit of a steep to really start working though. I wanted to avoid using a custard or anything too creamy so as not to mute the acidity of the lemon.\r\nINW Biscuit and CAP Sugar Cookie create the buttery bakery layer. You can definitely sub INW Biscuit for JF. Most of the versions before this one I made with JF. The INW just seemed a touch more present after the steep. \r\nFA Meringue is obviously the meringue layer, but it also sweetens the whole mix as well as softening any of the harsh edges of the lemon.\r\nI like to use CAP SS at 0.5% but you can obviously sweeten to your own tastes. I think it does need at least a bit of sweetener to brighten everything up. \r\nYou can leave overnight and it’s ok but it gets so much better after at least a weeks steep.\r\nI tested it on a single coil in the Hadaly and i got a really great balance in the layers- the lemon, the pastry/ bakery and the meringue were all present and easily identifiable. I went onto test it on a couple of dual coil RDAs and although still good the layers were a bit less distinct. I personally have found this recipe works far better with a more restricted airflow. I tried on the Drop Dead with the airflow wide open and I mainly just got lemon. Once the airflow was closed a little more than halfway a lot more of the profile came through. \r\nI’d really love to hear feedback-\r\nany criticisms and suggestions as to how I could improve the recipe would be much appreciated. \r\nThanks ",
