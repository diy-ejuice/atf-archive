    "description": "FW strawberry- this is my favorite strawberry. Was an obvious choice after tasting this be liquid. No doubt in my mind flavor West. I'm certain you could substitute the CAP sweet strawberry, JF sweet strawberry ,or 2-1 combination TFA strawberry, strawberry ripe.\r\n\r\nCAP golden pineapple- this is a great flavor and was my first choice. Nailed it \ud83d\ude03\ud83d\ude03\ud83d\ude03.\r\n\r\nFLV sweet coconut &  FA coconut- this is where I think my remix is better than the original. I'm certain they are not using FLV, probably TFA. Adding FA coconut makes the coconut more complex, and realistic. Besides I could not resist, this is hands-down my favorite coconut!! (tends to fade a little overtime.)\r\n\r\nCAP super sweet- if I was going for a one-to-one clone this would probably be a much higher percentage. Just a Touch does make everything a little sweeter.\r\n\r\n",

I typically do not like coconut or pineapple in any ejuice, however upon first taste I changed my mind. Great combination of flavors and I'm with you on loving FW Strawberry, I overlooked it for a couple of years since no one really used it but then I was trying to recreate a strawberry custard and realized that was the strawberry that I was looking for. Well done!"
