    "description": "A unique take on an old profile, 60 Hz is a syrupy strawberry custard with the kiss of sweet honey.\r\n\r\nStrawberry mutes rejoice (I'm not one of them, but I wanted this recipe to be accessible). The three strawberries here should, in theory, present themselves to even those who have a hard time detecting strawberry in mixes. FLV Alpine Strawberry, WF Strawberry (Baked), and JF Sweet Strawberry bring a deep, dark strawberry to the fold. Strawberry (Baked), with its honey backend also serves as the secret ingredient in the mix. \r\n\r\nTPA Vanilla Custard II is a fantastic new-ish vanilla custard. It rivals the boring ass original TPA Vanilla Custard with more body....well more everything. CAP NYC is in here to bolster that creaminess. It serves a place in almost all creamy\/custard mixes. FLV Rich Cinnamon morphs the custard with a slight spicy warmness.\r\n\r\nLet this one steep a couple weeks. The honey takes the forefront and kills the custard notes until then.",
