    "description": "I love ENYAWREKLAW\u2019s BOOSTed V3 recipe. All I did here was change the strawberry combo and add INW Biscuit for the ice cream cone (another idea I pinched from ENYAWREKLAW- from his strawberry ice cream cone recipe). It worked out better than I could have imagined. \r\n\r\nI got CAP Ripe Strawberries and wanted to play around with it. I decided to put it in a recipe I knew quite well- BOOSTed v3.\r\nThe combo of strawberries are made for each other-maybe literally with them both being CAP. There\u2019s the perfect amount of tartness and sweetness which I think balances well with the cream and the cone comes in on the end.\r\n \r\nIf you would like more strawberry increase both to 4.5%. If you would like it to be more ice cream forward do them at 3.5%.\r\n\r\nI wouldn\u2019t have made it public as it feels like I cheated but it tastes so bloody good! This is definitely my favourite strawberry cream recipe that I\u2019ve tried. All credit goes to ENYAWRECKLAW though as it\u2019s 90% his recipe anyway.  \r\n\r\nIt\u2019ll need 3 days minimum. But it gets so much better after a steep. 5 days recommended.  \r\n\r\nPs. If anyone can tell me how I put a link to ENYAWREKLAWs recipe at the bottom of the description that would be much appreciated. I can\u2019t work out how to do it. Thanks ",
