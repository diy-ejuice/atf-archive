  "description": "Pancakes with fried apples topped with whipped cream, delicious at the first vape.\r\n\r\nBuilding blocks:\r\nCrepe SC WF mixed with a little Strawberry Jam on Toast for the perfect fresh baked sensation of a sweet pancake. Crepes SC WF needed a more burned taste, i got that from the toast bit from the RF SC Strawberry on Jam whilst adding a little  sweetness to the pancakes .\r\n\r\nApple Filling FLV, nothing else comes close to that gorgeous smelling baked apples, \r\n(I strongly do recommend this flavor in bakery mixes that needs cooked apples.)\r\n\r\nTopped with Whipped Cream from CAP.\r\n\r\nSome of these flavors are not in the ATF flavor database!!!\r\n***Blackberry Jam w̶i̶t̶h̶ on Toast - SC*** = ***Strawberry Jam On Toast - SC***\r\n***CAP Vanilla Whipped Cream*** = ***CAP Whipped Cream***\r\n\r\nYou will enjoy this vape.",
