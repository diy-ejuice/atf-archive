  "description": "**DESCRIPTION:**\r\n  \r\nThis is a very good remix I did of Frankenvape by The Standard. \r\n\r\nRECIPE:\r\n  \r\nTFA Kiwi Double is used here because I believe it is in the original.  \r\n\r\n  \r\nTFA Orange Cream as well at TFA Marshmallow are also used for the same reasons. \r\n  \r\nTFA coconut was used as an afterthought and adds a really unique layer.\r\n  \r\nTFA Cinnamon Sugar Cookie was used to fill out the recipe and bring it all together. You can not sub this out for CAP CDS!\r\n\r\n*If you enjoy The Standard's Frankenvape, I think you may enjoy this. It's good fresh, but after 4 days the orange, kiwi & faint cinnamon really begin to mesh well together.*\r\n  \r\n*60-65% VG recommended.*\r\n  \r\n*Please ask permission to post this on other sites, as it is only intended to be shared on ATF. You may not sell commercially*\r\n\r\n\r\n#EJUICEMAKERS",
