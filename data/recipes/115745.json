  "description": "this has been my kryptonite for the last year or so. I guarantee you will not want to vape any other butterscotch custard/pudding's again. put it in your rotation, you won't be mad you did. (this is made for sub ohm devices such as rda's and tanks.)\r\n\r\nfw butterscotch & fa caramel pair with tpa brown sugar to deliver the incredible dark note.\r\n\r\nflv vanilla custard & inw custard are soul mates. the two combine to deliver a nice thick and creamy, eggy, thick mouthfeel custard.\r\n\r\nfa almond is the finishing enhancing touch. it adds yet more creaminess and emulsifies all the notes.",

There's something about it that I notice in every recipe that lends to a dry chemical like custard.  I dunno but today I figured out the common denominator.   So I thank you for the revelation and suprised myself that I was able to tell it had INW Custard.  A cool learning lesson for me.  All in all its not bad, Sorry for the ramble of a review but your recipe did help me out alot.  I'm gonna add some Sweetener to see if it lends a little wetness."
