  "description": "Years ago there was these little jelly beans made by starburst called \"Joosters\" the pink ones were by far the best so here's my tribute to the little bastard.\r\n\r\npink guava by flv - flavorah were kind enough to send me a big haul of their concentrates for me to try and as soon as i smelt this it hit me instantly that it was the smell of a pink jooster, after tasting the concentrate my feeling was confirmed.\r\nsuper simple recipe and super good tasting too! i have also experimented and added ws-23 to this,  that too was a success.\r\nif you enjoy candy recipes then you're probably going to enjoy this :)",
