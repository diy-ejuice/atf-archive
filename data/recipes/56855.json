  "name": "Tweaked Obsidian (Cookie Dough RY4)",
  "description": "This recipe is a tweaked version of the original Obsidian. Flavor is a warm and buttery cookie dough recipe rolled up into an RY4. There's more a focus on the cookie dough in this recipe compared to the original. It's great for those who don't enjoy Pie Crust.\r\nFULL DEV NOTES HERE -> http://diyordievaping.com/2017/08/10/tweaked-obsidian-cookie-dough-ry4-diy-e-liquid-recipes/",

There is some sort of off-note to me that I am not a fan of here, and I don't know why. It was still a good vape, but there was that thing in there that stopped it from being great. Compared to the original, personally I got no offnotes in it, where I know some did with the Pie Crust. Still a good job with the tweaking"
