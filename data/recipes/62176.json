    "description": "The Real Cookies and Cream! Yes, I know, a little arrogant; but, I have mixed several cookies and cream by various mixers, and while they have been great, most lack that Oreo taste and texture that I associate with a cookies and cream. So with that said, this is my take on a real cookies and cream. It's not perfect, but it's pretty damn close.\r\nAs any mixer can attest to, chocolate is hard to get right. Especially when you're going for an Oreo tastes and texture. Oreo's have a distinct chocolate taste unlike a chocolate bar. It's more of a dry, dark, gritty taste with a luscious cream smashed between. I went through 7 versions to try to get the Oreo right. My first choice of cookie was FA Cookie, and that was exactly the right cookie to start with. The chocolate was a different matter. I started with TPA Double Chocolate(clear) at 2%. And while the chocolate was there, it was too \"in-your-face\" and slightly bitter so I brought it down to 1%. That seemed pretty close. I also tried combining INW Milk Chocolate, and while it's a good chocolate to work with, it tended to make the recipe into more of a chocolate shake, and that was not what I was going for. I ended up settling on TPA Double Chocolate (clear) at .75% and it seems spot on, especially when combined with FA Cookie at 2%. Now the cream. This was probably the easiest of the layers. TPA Bavarian Cream is one of the best flavors in any mixers arsenal. It's creamy, rich, and has a depth that some creams fall short on. When paired with CAP Sweet Cream at .5%, it lends itself well to that sweet and creamy center of an Oreo. Last, but not least, the TPA Vanilla Bean Ice Cream. My original version didn't have this flavor and while it was a good cookies and cream, it was more like a double cream Oreo cookie. It seemed to need a little extra push into a Real Cookies and Cream and TPA Vanilla Bean Ice Cream at 1% did the trick. I added CAP Super Sweet at .25% to sweeten things up a bit, and voil\u00e0, The Real Cookies and Cream! \r\nCan be a shake and vape but is best after a 3 day steep.\r\nVisit Freedom To Mix on Discord https:\/\/discord.gg\/SmSc8Ef\r\nVisit Freedom To Mix on FaceBook https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/groups\/415341418920740\/ \r\n\r\nPlease comment, mix, and or rate,....it makes us all better mixers.

It reminds me of some of the artifical cookies and cream protein shakes, or drink mixes I have tried. Its good, but it's lacking something. The chocolate in this plays very nice, especially with bavarian cream. I love DCC and BC together, tastes amazing. "

However I\u2019m not getting the sweet icing part of the cookie in the middle. For me it\u2019s a great flavor just really wanting that sweetness of the cookie. If I can get it to give me that creamy sweetness. It would be a 5 star recipe. But for my palate I have to give this 4 stars. "

The cream is the star of the show with the chocolate cookie being the back note of the recipe. I get a nice, lightly sweet cream on the inhale followed by the hint of the dry and gritty Oreo cookie on the exhale. Not to sweet and perfectly balanced. This can be a little harsh off the SnV, but after the recommended 3-day steep time this is a very enjoyable recipe that isn't too heavy or taxing on the pallet. Kudos to you for making this recipe, will definitely mix this one again. "

The Bavarian cream works perfectly as the lead cream imo it just goes so well with this dark chocolately goodness and the supporting vbic and sweet cream are just *muah*"
