    "description": "Mountain Dew Black Label\r\n\r\n1 drop of FA MTS Wizard for per 15ml\r\nMTS is just here to smooth out the acidic properties of the LB Dew Mountain. MTS is optional but I found it to hit my palette just little bit better when included. \r\n\r\nCAP Harvest Berry and TPA Black Currant\r\nTogether this flavors create the dark berry flavor as mentioned on the can. I've probably drank 5-10 cans of Black Label trying to get this combination right haha. I've went through alterations using bilberry and just harvest berry but each different alterations seemed to highlight the berries too much to be a 1:1 recipe. Although they were good, they just weren't right. \r\n\r\nLB Dew Mountain, TPA Ethyl Maltol, TPA Koolada\r\nThese three flavors make up the base of the Mountain Dew flavor. LB Dew Mountain by itself falls short. I used Ethyl Maltol to sweeten the recipe because you and I both know Mountain Dew is just full of sugars. I tried different Sweeteners (sucralose) but they all seem to mute the flavor too much. TPA Koolada was a must have for me. I cannot drink a soda without it be chilled. The Koolada is here to try and mimic the ice or fresh out of the fridge feeling. \r\n\r\n",
