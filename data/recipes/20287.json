  "description": "SOUR SKITTLES\r\n Really love my sour skittles but you can feel your teeth rotting away as fast as you eat them so wanted to nail a vape that gave me a healthier option\r\nI wanted to have it so you got a hint of all the top notes left in your mouth after you vaped it !\r\nAfter 7 revisions an a big juggling act im really pleased how it vapes ! You get a different taste as you vape an a nice sweet mixed fruit exhale thats sweet an kinda refreshing !\r\nHad alot of problems with that sour after twang I tried all the usual suspects TPA sour 20% , FA Sour wizard , Malic acid an citric acid as well as trying various citrus concentrates an few lemonades in lower %s\r\n\r\nFew notes\r\n\r\nCAP ITALIAN LEMON SICILY / FA LIME TAHITY - These 2 i wanted for there citrus sour taste that are a main note in the sweets ! Kept them high to be an over riding taste in the vape ! The lemon is a bangin candy lemon perfect for this an FA lime is a great fit to the real taste of sour skittles 4 % an 1.75 worked out about right ! so there my green an yellow skittles !\r\n\r\nTPA GRAPE CANDY / INW BLACKCURRANT - Purple i wanted to combine these 2 as i wanted that back end to taste of the INW concentrate as i get that from the originals ! Grape candy is a sweet easier flavour that fits on most berry fruits an just adds another dimension to it ! The INW is a strong one so didnt need to overdo the % on that compared to the Grape\r\n\r\nFW BLOOD ORANGE - Tried adding other oranges in but FW is such a good bitter orange thats pretty sweet an zingy so felt that it could hold its own on team orange ! It gives that bitter grapefruit just in the middle of the vape an as its not hugely strong lays nice with the other citrus notes\r\n\r\nCAP &JF SWEET STRAWBERRY - Love these 2 together the candy / sweety JF is bangin an cap just plays well with them adding  a nice sweetness needed for the actual sweets but also pulls the other fruits in together an a slightly higher %\r\n\r\nFA SOUR / MALIC ACID - Tried alot of combos but to get tongue curling sour you have to add so much of them it just mutes the shit out of all these delicate fruits ! Settled on 1 % FA which i find much better than TPA an .5 of malic acid (do not overdo this one as it mutes the shit out of it an ruins the recipe i found )\r\n\r\nTPA MARSHMALLOW / ETHYL MALTOL  - just adds that overall sweetness an the center part of the skittle which is kinda sweet but tasteless an the EM rounds it all together plus pulling a bit of extra sweetness From the fruits\r\n\r\nJob done an hopefully some of you\r\nTASTE THE RAINBOW ;-)",
