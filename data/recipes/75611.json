Raspberry balance is pretty close and doesn\u2019t taste like Icecream laced with cough syrup. I would toss in a little more VBIC or ramp the percentages up a bit all around and add something to give that ice cream a little more body and dairy sweetness. &#xD;\nIn a RDA you again get the general direction where this is going.&#xD;\nMaybe hit a touch of Bavarian Cream, a small hit of a darker raspberry to add volume\/range\/extra levels to the raspberry, and steep longer than 7 days. Say... 2 weeks minimum.&#xD;\nI\u2019m strangely attracted to the potential of this recipe."
