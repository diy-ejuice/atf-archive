  "description": "**THIS DOES NOT USE OOO 50/50 CHERRY IT USES VSO CHERRY**\r\n\r\nA refreshingly unique blend. You get a darker cherry with some light floral notes, dunked right into a delicious southern sweet tea. Floral's are not overbearing and this is not medicinal as you would think. It is slightly floral so some may confuse the two, but this is a delicious vape!! I add 1 drop cap ss per 10ml, sweeten to your liking!!\r\n\r\nThis is good as a shake and vape but as always i recommend a short 3 day steep.",
