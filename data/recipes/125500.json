  "description": "This is the result of pitting my least favorite fruit flavor (Grape) against my favorite fruit flavor (Mango). There are two versions of this recipe, one with White Peach at 1%, and the other with FA Apricot (Armenia) at 1%. After gathering some information from test subjects, both need to be included because they're awesome for different reasons. I'm usually not a fan of anything grape flavored, but this makes it work. It is also probably worth a shot if you're not a fan of Mango. ",

      "text": "The most unusual pairing of flavors, that make an awesome juice. Both the Apricot and Peach version are excellent. Though INW Grape isn't a grape flavor, but a \"purple\" flavor, I fell in love with it. Between the two I'd say the Peach version is better, but that's a bit biased because peach is my favorite flavor. Don't let that discredit the Apricot version though, it's seriously good but in a different way.  All in all, a very good grape/purple flavor with a hint of peach/apricot and mango on the end! Three simple flavors. 6% and a fantastic juice. "

Other than that I really enjoy the pairing even though i’m not a big fan of either grape or mango  by itself. Thanks Alfred!"

      "text": "This is one of those pairings I never would have thought to try on my own so I'm glad Alfred came up with it for me. For such a simple formula, everything feels balanced and paired together nicely. I'm not the biggest fan of mango but I do enjoy grape vapes. This recipe seems to bring the best elements from each flavor and seals the deal with a splash of peach. I haven't tried the FA Apricot sub yet but I imagine it will likely be just as good.&#xD;\n&#xD;\nIn the end I get a crisp, clean fruit flavor. Light enough on the palate and with enough nuances and subtleties to keep it refreshing as an ADV. Seems to work well as a palate cleanse too for those days when you've been vaping enough bakery juices to put Little Debbie out of business. As a bonus feature, the juice fluoresces when exposed to UV light. Fill a tank and check out that purple shimmer when you're out in the sunlight or hit it with a black-light indoors and watch your tank glow.&#xD;\n&#xD;\nThis is definitely worth a try if you're into simple and clean fruits or if you are a fan of either grape or mango."
