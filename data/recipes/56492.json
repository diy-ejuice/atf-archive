  "description": "This is the flavor of choice for the divine and glorious Vurve, creamy and oh so sweet! It is that amazing FLV Milk & Honey with a dash of TFA VBIC to give a pretty amazing combo! You just cant get enough in your mouth... It's good as a S&V but better with steeping!\r\n\r\nInspiration from The Vurve himself \r\n\r\n***If you mix this, please leave a review and let me know what you think or if you think there is something that could be changed to make it better!***",

But it allowed me to have a nicely aged dark and powerful milk and honey. Not the milk and honey they talk about in the bible.  No sir.   The kind of milk n honey that stays out late doing things you just can't bring your self to question because you are truly afraid of the answer youll hear.  Let it age a few months and you'll have to rename it the Anti Milk n Honey.  Good stuff.."
