    "description": "I've only had it steeping for about a day or so. It's pretty tasty and definitely gets me in the Christmas mood. The White Chocolate gets kind of drowned out by the Peppermint, so I'm considering dropping it down to .75%, but it seems to die down on it's own after a few days. I'm going to let it steep for about a week before I make my final version, but I feel like it's in a good spot to share right now.  I may not change anything, but I don't know right now. It's definitely super pepperminty with some creaminess mixed in. It goes great with coffee!",
