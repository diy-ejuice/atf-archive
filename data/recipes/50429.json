  "description": "Croissant aux Amandes\r\n(Almond Croissant)\r\n\r\nAfter 25 iterations, this was the closest i've been able to get. It's been my \"White Whale\" since I started mixing about a year ago. This recipe is  delicious and has been since #5, but was always missing something.\r\n\r\nNOTES:\r\n\r\nFA Almond / INW Marzipan / TPA Pistachio\r\nThis combination is there to form the Almond, The Marzipan plays two parts, it boosts the almond as well as plays as the backbone as the marzipan filling. The Pistachio is there to hopefully add a bit more nuttiness to the Almond as well as help replicate the slithered almonds found on top.\r\n\r\nFA Meringue\r\nThe Meringue is here to add a bit of powdered sugar on top, \r\n\r\nTPA Pie Crust / INW Biscuit / CAP Cereal 27 / FA Zepolla / TPA Butter\r\nThe is the nucleus of the recipe, they bring it all together to form a nice, buttery croissant. The Zepolla creates a nice cake bass, adding the Cereal 27 adds a bit of a cooked quality along with some nice texture.  Pie Crust, Biscuit, and Butter brings the fluffiness down and adds the pastry texture and taste of a croissant. \r\n\r\nINW Marzipan / FLV Butterscotch / CAP Vanilla Custard\r\nMixing these creates a decadent Marzipan filling, \r\n\r\nBy no means is this a shake and vape, needs at least a 5 day steep...but the longer the better.\r\n\r\nLet me know what you think! I always welcome constructive criticism.",

This juice is the best juice I've ever tried as far as clear, clean, balanced, &amp; layered... This is a grandslam banger when it comes to hitting the profile! Very very very very nice job! üëçüëçüëçüëç I've tried ALOT of recipes on here and I'm going to say that this is THE BEST on this profile.

      "text": "this is an excellent juice- probably the clearest, most well layered pastry vape i've ever tried. has a defined buttery croissant flavor that is accented by soft sweet nutty cream. most pastry vapes seem too heavy on the cream aspect and the mouthfeel of actual pasty comes across as shadowy and vague- not this one, which i applaud. i will say that it's at it's best around the 2 week mark. this is a superb recipe, thanks for sharing."
