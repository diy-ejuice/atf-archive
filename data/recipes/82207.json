      "text": "This is a really nice mix. The ice cream is refreshingly different from most of the typical combos. HS Ice Cream is super unctuous and lends itself to a butter pecan profile very well. The OOO Butter Pecan Ice Cream adds some body, but not a whole lot of pecan. Thatâ€™s not a complaint. INW Creme Brulee adds some roasted notes into the mix to help out the pecans some. The caramel blends right into HS Ice Cream, making it darkly sweet. Great ice cream base, and I like the more mellow nature of the pecans. Good work."
