    "description": "It's nearly springtime! Been working on this one for a while now, and I feel like it's ready to share. Enjoy the rich, sweet, and tart combinations of cherry and lime in all it's Sonic loveliness.\r\n\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n**Recommended for**: High Wattage Drippers \/ RTA's\r\n\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n**What I vaped it on during development:**\r\n\r\nDually RDA\r\n80 Watts\r\nRambo's Wire Art Coil:\r\n3mm .16\r\n28g Stainless Steel Frames, .3 Ribbon 3ply 316L Nichrome80 Fralien Single Coil\r\n\r\nElfy RTA\r\n35 Watts\r\nMini Staple Single Coil\r\n3mm 6 wrap\r\n.3 N80 \/ 40g N80 .25 Single Coil\r\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n**\uff26\uff2c\uff21\uff36\uff2f\uff32 \uff2e\uff2f\uff34\uff25\uff33**\r\n\r\nSee video: https:\/\/goo.gl\/Ld6EBC\r\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n**Steeping recommendations**:\r\nI would recommend letting this formulation sit for at least 3 days to allow the notes to properly meld together and the inherent alcohol and throat hit to dissipate. Don't expect a super smooth draw from this one as authentic citrus recipes should inherently carry a slight throat hit.\r\n\r\n----------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nFollow for more creations:\r\nhttp:\/\/www.youtube.com\/c\/SteamCraft",
