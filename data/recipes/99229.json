  "description": "This recipe is made to see if FA Chocolate is similar to the chocolates that are in e-liquids such as \"Golden Ticket\"\r\n\r\nAs a recipe, it's a simple milk chocolate. Top note is a bit of cocoa with a milk chocolatey finish thats light and focuses on the dairy. Still trying to work this one out and find a useful chocolate to use in desserts. ",
