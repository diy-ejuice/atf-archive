  "description": "Berry Cinnamon Roll with a hint of lemon. \r\n\r\nI paired FW Blueberry & CAP Harvest Berry for the berry note in the mix. I really FW Blueberry but it needs a little help to shine through so I threw in some Harvest berry.\r\n\r\nI paired FW Cinnamon Roll & FA Pandoro to make the pastry. Cinnamon Roll taste like the inside of a cinnamon roll to me & needs a little help in texture. So i put some Pandoro with it. Which taste similar to a Lemon Cake & has some decent body.\r\n\r\nItalian Cream Is used for the icing on top & FLV Rich cinnamon is used to boost the cinnamon in the FW Cin Roll.\r\n\r\nI am not the biggest fan of really sweet juices. So feel free to add your favorite sweetener if you don't find it sweet enough.\r\n\r\nNeeds around 7 days to steep.\r\n\r\nPLEASE RATE & REVIEW IF YOU MIX.\r\n",
