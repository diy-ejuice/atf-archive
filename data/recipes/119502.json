  "description": "Edit: 8-16-19\r\n\r\nDragonfruit tea with a slight hint of strawberry. The WS-23 is optional I just prefer my tea over ice\r\n\r\nOriginally i used only TPA dragonfruit @ 4%, but after I acquired INW i tried it in this recipe and liked it even more so i lowered the tpa to 2.50% and but the INW in @ 1.5%\r\n\r\nINW Shisha Strawberry: I choose it because its one of the few strawberries I can taste after a few weeks steep. I used it at 1.25% so it would over run the dragonfruit, but still come through enough that you would know its there.\r\n\r\nMy Tea combo: I went with Black & Red Tea, Red is super earthy but not very leafy to me, and Black is more leaf than earthy teaness. So put them both in at 0.75% to get a balance of both earthy and leafy tea notes.\r\n\r\nLike I said above the WS-23 is completely optional I've just been into cooler vapes here as of late and really liked this better with it added.\r\n\r\nDoesn't really need a steep around day 3-5 the fruit will be more present but it is super tasty off the shake.\r\n\r\nPlease rate and review it you mix it.",
