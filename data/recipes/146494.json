For me, childhood summers always meant creamsicle ice cream, and this recipe replicates the flavor perfectly.  Nice cold sensation and creamy orange, with a light tangerine to really bring it out.  It's perfect for summer, and I'm sure I'll always have a bottle ready to go in the warmer weather.  Really a great job. "

After a day of steeping this is incredible, it does a very nice job on blending those sharp citrus notes into a very pleasant ice cream vape. Immediately had to mix a bigger batch, this is going into my rotation!"
