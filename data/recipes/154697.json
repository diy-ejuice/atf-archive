    "description": "[Update 7\/15\/2019] Added 0.5% FW Sweetener (or the sweetener of your choice at the comparable percentages). I found that as the original recipe aged it got harsher, and the sweetener seems to stabilize that a bit - I'm still testing)\r\n\r\nHere is my take on one of my favorites the Black Forest Cake. If you are a lover of cherries and chocolate cake and have had a Black Forest Cake I'm sure you know what I mean. Unfortunately chocolate and cherry flavorings are difficult to mix with. Regardless this is my attempt at replicating this delicious cake. \r\n\r\nThe chocolate cake is a combination of JF Yellow Cake, HS Australian Chocolate, LB Lava Cake, and FLV Chocolate Deutsch. I tried to strike a balance between the different chocolate flavorings to minimize the off notes and accentuate the good notes - regardless chocolate flavors are very polarizing in the vape community and I'm sure to some it will not be agreeable to their senses. \r\n\r\nTo me INW Cherries, at low percentages, is fairly authentic with minimal cough syrup notes, but at those low percentages it was not enough to overcome the cake flavor. I decided to add INW Marzipan which increased the Cherry flavoring adding a sugary depth to the Cherry note. One thing I want to try is to get my hands on TFA Cherry Extract to see how that plays, but I had a difficult time finding it so I went with what I had.\r\n\r\nLastly is the heavy whipped cream which I used CAP Vanilla Custard and TFA Whipped Cream to emulate. The Vanilla Custard adds a richness to the cream note as well counteracts the  dryness of the chocolate flavors. It was kept low to not elevate the Vanilla note as well as to minimize the steep time of the recipe. I added TFA Whipped Cream to further increase the creamy quality and volume to the vape. I tried adding it at higher percentages, but I found it wanted to mute some of the other flavors as it steeped.\r\n\r\nFor me the vape is a creamy chocolate initial exhale with the chocolate and cherry notes lingering on the palate with a slight tartness. Is it perfect? - no - but it is still quite good. For the most part I vape this in a single coil RTA like a KayFun V5 or the Coppervape Skyline clone with a 0.3 ohm Clapton coil running around 36-38 watts. I have vaped this in RDAs with mixed results so you have been warned. It seems that the flavorings are best delivered at a medium vape temperature. Since I mainly vape on single coil restricted airflow RTAs this recipe scratches my itch for this flavor profile.",
