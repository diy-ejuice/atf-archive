      "text": " That is as refreshing as an unseasonably cool spring breeze and even kinda tastes like one. It's juicy and packed with flavor while still being light enough for a warm weather ADV. The lime seems to have faded slightly after a terribly long steep to the point where I'm not distinctly tasting lime, but there's definitely more than just lemon zest behind that forward hops. The lemony citrus plays very well with it. The hops tastes altered - more floral less piney - by the other flavors and the entire thing tastes like it came from, and belongs out in, nature. I see someone talking about talking it golfing and while I don't golf, that sounds like the perfect pairing of a vape with an outdoor activity. The only thing I could say by way of critique is that if you want it to still be clearly limey even if someone lets it steep for freakin ever, maybe look for something to reinforce Lime Cold Pressed that will hold up over time. Doesn't really need it, though, it's hops &amp; citrus heaven just the way its."

      "text": "Sometimes, it doesn't take very long to analyze and judge a vape. This right here is a what if for me. What if someone made Zima the right way? This is a simple yet vibrant lemon lime with hops, made deliciously chilly.  An adult version of 7-Up. Yanno, Zima. This is ridiculously tasty, and could easily be an all day vape. Definitely a welcome palette  cleanser after tons of sweet fruits, tobaccos, bakeries, and so on. Just light, crisp, brisk, and refreshing, yet with enough nuance to go \"Howdy. You won't be forgetting me.\"&#xD;\n&#xD;\nDigging the hell outta this stuff!"

      "text": "This is a really interesting mix.  Being under 4% you wouldn't think that its super flavorful, but its bursting with it.  The zestiness of the lemon and lime really work well with the bitterness of the hops.  The cactus helps to smooth out the rough edges of the cold pressed nicely.  This is pretty much what the description says...simple but refreshing.  I could see this becoming a go to on the golf course for me this summer."
