  "description": "The idea behind this recipe started in the DIY_eJuice discord, where we were just bullshitting in the lobby one day, coming up with words that rhymed with \"soda\". Yoda came up, so I figured, being the \"soda man\" and all, why not give a \"yoda soda\" a shot.\r\n\r\nSo I started thinking, what are the characteristics of Yoda? First off, he's green. What \"green\" flavors do I have? Lime, Cactus, Apple, Pear, Honeysuckle, Hibiscus were on the shortlist (yes I know their flowers aren't green, but I considered all florals \"green\" for this purpose).\r\nHe's also an elder. That's where Elderflower came in to the picture.\r\n\r\nSo now I had all these flavors in mind, time to make this actually taste good.\r\n\r\nThe soda part is something I've worked with a lot, so of course I had to use my go-to fizz base: FLV Citrus Soda, CAP Lemon Lime & WS-23. As true effervescence is not (yet) possible to achieve in vape form, I feel that the sprite esque citrus notes from those flavors is as close as you can get to vaping a soda.\r\n\r\nFLV Elderflower became the main part I wanted to build around, and I know that pear and elderflower is a great pairing. FA Pear is perfect for that as it's very sweet, something that is needed to make the recipe balanced against the funky florals and sharp citruses.\r\nTFA Honeysuckle was on the short list, and it is sort of a \"funky pear\" so I think it's a perfect match here to help the pear with the sweet part, and also bring a more funky vibe to the whole recipe.\r\n\r\nAs I did a first test mix with those flavors, I knew I was on the right path. The flavors all pair beautifully with eachother and the overall feeling you get from it is very refreshing. After that it was all about finding the right balance between the sharp citruses, funky florals and sweet pear. It took quite a few attempts to get the balance between the elderflower, honeysuckle and lemon lime right, but I think it ended up great. I wouldn't nesscesarily say that it tastes like \"yoda\".. whatever that would be, but I think the common thread in the recipe is make makes this a yoda soda.\r\n\r\nTLDR flavor notes;\r\n**FLV Citrus Soda** & **CAP Lemon Lime** acts as the sprite esque soda base, **WS-23** adds the cooling which further enhances the soda feeling.\r\n**FA  Pear** adds a very sweet and authentic pear flavor. It's very juicy which helps the mix with the freshness.\r\n**TFA Honeysuckle** pairs great with the pear to give that funky sweetness, it helps sweeten the citruses and adds some complexity to the mix.\r\n**FLV Elderflower** adds a floral touch, although it's a bit sweeter than other flowers, and a little musky. I think the sweet-tart flavor that blueberries usually have, this is in the same realm as that.",

      "text": "As a fan of soda and floral vapes, this one was right up my alley. I would have never thought to combine the two! This turns out to be a nice, refreshing summer time vape. The honeysuckle creates a nice mellow floral base, and is lifted up by the elderflower for a prominent but not overbearing floral. I like the mix of citrus soda + lemon lime; citrus soda is great but needs a little bit of support to really push it in the direction of soda and the lemon lime does that. At first I thought the pear might be a bit high, but it does wonders in accenting the citrus flavors and adding some juicy sweetness that a soda needs. Top it off with some ice and it's delicious! I might bump the ws-23 to 0.75% but that's just a personal preference (I like 'em cold!). &#xD;\n&#xD;\nI think this is a great floral recipe for those to try who are interested in florals but don't necessarily want to vape \"flowers\". Excellent job!"

      "text": "Solid soda vibes from this super refreshing beauty. The citrus does a terrific job of uplifting the elderflower and creating a citrus soda for elderflower lovers. A shot of elderflower liqueur in 7-up would be the grossest of oversimplifications, it tastes like it a soda built ground up specifically to be elderflower-infused. Pear isn't super defined but gives it a nice pomaceous sweetness that teams up with the more floral honeysuckle sweetness so nicely.  "

      "text": "Please let me kick this off with 5 stars. This is such a lovely experience. I am partial to drinks, enjoy a decent soda vape on occasion and have been known to enjoy florals if they're done with a little body. This mix has that all. It is light on the body enough to never get too heavy, a very goos nondescript natural sweet from the pear and just the perfect combo of citrus flavor and elderberry/honeysuckle. It is light enough to make you want to take another drag, yet delicate enough that the florals never outshine the soda base but complement each other perfectly. This is by far my favorite drink I have tried yet and I had to force myself to put it down. Mixed a 30 and instantly regretted not mixing more. Another note: perfect level of coolant here. It adds so much to the experience more so than making it seem cold or refreshing. I would have paid cash money for this as an adv if i were still buying commercial and this were on the market. Thank you for putting this together!"
