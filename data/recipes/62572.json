  "description": "Made this for a friend a while back and thought I would share. I am not a fan of Chai tea but I actually enjoyed this. Capellas version of Chai tea is very good. Then with the raspberry thrown in it makes a quite pleasant vape. I would imagine you could sub the raspberry for other fruits and it would be good as well. No aging needed with this one. So feel free to mix it up, I would like to hear some feedback. Hope you enjoy it as much as the person I made it for does!",
