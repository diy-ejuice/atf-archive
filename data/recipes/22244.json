    "description": "This one is a very strange flavour composition - but I like to vape it to have a break from sweet or fruity flavours. It reminds me of that kind of a situation when you're enjoying some blueberries in a hot sauna and someone nearby is eating a good sweet orange, so you decide to take a bite from that too. Why the sauna ? Mix it up and see for yourself.\r\n\r\nProfile:\r\n\r\nGin - In this recipe, the gin is mixed with blueberry and orange and magically turns into a juniper wood flavour with no actual taste but a lingering and somewhat savoury specific smell that feels very refreshing and surprising to your palate. Resulting smell, when mixed with blueberry and orange listed below, feels like a distinctive smell when you enter a hot wooden sauna and take a deep breath. To make things more sweet - I shall use a bit of a Strawberry ripe here, so gin won't kick.\r\n\r\nBlueberry & Orange - INW Blueberry carries strong ripe jammy blueberry flavour which, at below median percentage, I shall pair with FW Blood Orange - a sketchy flavouring, but definitely good and one of its kind. As a result - I got nice and sweet full blueberry flavour with peel and a pulp, not too jammy, but still sweet and an orange peel flavour that resulted from high percentage of FW Blood Orange used. Orange peel feels quite refreshing, especially when paired with juniper and blueberry. And INW Grapefruit when used that low will provide a substantial kick for the blueberry, so it won't feel so heavy as usual.\r\n\r\nTry to mix it, seriously. Let your palate be surprised for a moment.",
