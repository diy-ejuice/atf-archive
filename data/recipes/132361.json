  "name": "Country Clouds Corn Bread Puddin' Remix ",
  "description": "After a week of developing and roughly 30 different versions,  I am confident this is a solid remix of Country Clouds Corn Bread Puddin‚Äô.  There was a profile that was missing in every possible combination in previous versions. At first I went the popular TPA Kettle corn route to recreate the corn bread and wasn‚Äôt quite there. It was adding to much of a sweet dry popcorn note to the mix and not really giving that corn bread texture in the commercial version. I tried Flv popcorn, LA buttered popcorn, Tfa movie theater, Fw buttered popcorn the list goes on... even FA corn lol which pretty much  canned corn.  So I figured I needed to pretty much build the corn bread profile from the ground up and try to keep it simple and not complex from a commercial e-liquid stand point, thinking  what would they use. Now this is where the tricky part comes into play ‚Äúthat underlying missing profile. Of course Acetyl Pyrazine is there but how much? Starting at .50% and combined with FA Break Fast Cereals seemed to work well in the first few mix‚Äôs but still was falling short. So doing some research on a specific compound Cyclotene I felt this was key. Cyclotene is found in a lot of concentrates we use but in low amounts but loaded with other compounds causing me to push a flavor to extremes and cause muddled off notes or muting. This is where Tpa Maple syrup comes in. It‚Äôs loaded with Cyclotene. This is what ties in the corn bread base. Now that‚Äôs out of the way,  back to the cornbread. These are the failed attempts of the bread imo. FA breakfast cereal,  Cap Cereal 27,  Tpa Crunchy cereal. These were paired with some type of corn flavor and various creams  or even pushing AP to its limits. So back to research still missing that profile. I needed a more buttery slight cream AP texture. This is where Tpa Cheesecake Graham comes in. I know right?!? But It has everything I need in texture, slight butter, sweetness,  AP, a little cream and guess what else??  Cyclotene. So the Ap, CCGC  and maple syrup/Ooo cornbread make up the cornbread. The Ooo corn bread gives it even more texture corn sweetness. Now the keeping it simple. I don‚Äôt get much pudding in the original just more of a heavy vanilla cream. Tpa Vanilla custard. This flavor is also key that pulls  everything together to give the vape more body and nice vanilla accent to replicate the so called ‚Äúpudding‚Äù.  Don‚Äôt forget  the sweetener!!  Yes 1 percent to keep it authentic to the commercial version.  Also keep in mind the AP is pushed to .75% I wouldn‚Äôt go over this!!  it just takes over and mutes. You get plenty more from the  CCGC. Off the scale you will taste the custard pushing through a little on the ass end of the vape. Giving it 24 hours it will homogenize and won‚Äôt be as noticeable. There is a lot more notes on other profiles in this but I tried to keep as condensed as possible. Enjoy this one. \r\nhttps://m.facebook.com/groups/456512471380574/\r\n",

I held off on reviewing it until I tried it with TPA Vanilla Custard and the original commercial eliquid. Now, what I have to say is... with TPA, it taste so close to the original, it‚Äôs baffling. But, with CAP VC, I love it so much more than the other iteration or the commercial eliquid. With CAP VC, this is easily my favorite DIY eliquid to date. And I thank you for sharing this with me. I love this recipe so much more than any other recipe that involves CAP VC. It has the boldness that I desire from a good dessert/bakery, which is hard to come by in diy or commercial eliquids. "

It smells delish ...&#xD;\nAfter steeping its a nice, smoth, mix. But its not so tasty than i imagine befor. But thats a personal thing, i think its the taste of the FA Maple.&#xD;\nI know the recipe calls for te Maple from TPA but i dont think that is more tasty, its the general profil of Maple, what i dont like. But its absolut a Corn Bread what i taste."

Wayne was right, BigReds Remix is closer to the OG(which I was kinda unimpressed with)&#xD;\nhowever, this recipe is better than them both IMO&#xD;\nIt has a touch more corn than the OG and is very well balanced. My current ADV and has been for quite some time.&#xD;\nVery good job on this one!"

I've never had the original but have mixed up several other remixes and they all seemed to feature Cereal 27 which is good but can wear out its welcome.  This tastes like Cornbread Pudding.   and I just realized this is a shakenvape007 recipe.. damn..If your on the fence on whether or not to mix this up, go for it.  Everyone of his recipes have been tasty if not ADV-able."

I was working on a clone of CP myself, 5 different versions in when I saw this recipe. The TFA Vanilla Custard is what makes all the difference. Don't sub any other custard in, I can attest. The only thing that I did differently was used just .5 of the super sweet. &#xD;\n&#xD;\nDoesn't matter at all. I have been nursing a few mls of the store-bought version. Today I followed a tank of it with a tank of this recipe. Couldn't tell a difference. Thank you for all your hard work, and also for sharing!!"
