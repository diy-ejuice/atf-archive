  "description": "A tobacco recipe with creamy butterscotch custard topped with caramel popcorn and peanuts. \r\n\r\nI love FLV tobaccos so, as its an all FLV recipe, I really wanted to do some sort of a tobacco mix. I used Vanilla Pudding as the custard base with a little added creaminess and mouthfeel from the Cream. FLV Butterscotch is one of my favourites, it's such a great butterscotch top note. Popcorn and Beer Nuts is a really nice combo plus the caramel note in Popcorn fills out the Butterscotch. I used a bolder, darker tobacco which adds some more depth and dimension to the mix. \r\n\r\nMinimum steep - 7 days. But it takes 10-14 days for the tobacco and popcorn to fully come through. \r\n\r\nTested on Citadel RDA, 0.6ohms, around 35w. \r\n",

      "text": "Steeped for about 20 days, this stuff is awesome! I never thought of using flv popcorn with a tobacco but its a combo i can see in alot of recipes. Although, I'm not complaining, but for some reason I get a very distinctive chocolate note in here. I have no idea what it could be coming from, nothing in here has ever come off as chocolatey, but yeah thats what I get at a longer steep. Its delicious, to me its like tobacco with kettle corn along with the same chocolate note you'd get from red burley. I may be broken to flv butterscotch haha. Thanks for this one!"
