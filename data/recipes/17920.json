    "description": "A variation on a stand alone flavouring.\r\nAmetrine is a fresh orange juice type flavour with a couple of ice cubes.\r\n\r\nNotes \r\n(Ecto cooler) I used to have this as a stand alone, it's a great tasting flavour but uses a hell of a lot, it's supposed to be reminiscent of an old school juice box from the mid - late 80's although I can barely remember that.\r\nIt's a clean tasting orange juice.\r\n(Champagne) \r\nI was hoping this would give it a fizzy type mouth feel, it doesn't at this % but it does help change the orange flavour a touch to make it more genuine almost like Fanta or tango.\r\n(Cactus)\r\nI love this flavouring I can say it does change the recipe from dry and flavoursome to juicy and tastier you can't pick it out it helps blend the fruit and makes the mix mouth watering.\r\n(Koolada)\r\nI would say use this to taste \r\nI added a touch even as 1-2 drops per 10ml it makes it noticeable and changes the mix to a slightly chilled taste.\r\n(Sour)\r\nI wanted to make the mix more realistic to step away from the soda taste and I feel that this does it well, the addition of sour heightens the orange and brings it back to the front almost a candy effect without making it sickly.\r\n(Super sweet)\r\nUse sparingly, just enough to bring it to life although without it it's still good.\r\n\r\nThanks, happy mixing",
