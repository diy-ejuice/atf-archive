  "description": "I've been playing around with FLV cookie dough for a little bit, and after Wayne released Obsidian it definitely inspired me. FLV cookie dough is a little weird to work with, at first I really didn't like it. It almost has an RY4 taste to it right away as weird as that sounds, to me atleast. But I can see why Wayne went that route. With some supporting flavors and of course a little time it does come out pretty tasty! I don't add any sweetener here, and it probably would benefit from some, so add .5% super sweet if you want. FLV Cookie Dough, and FLV Frosting are a little harsh right away, so I do like to add a little more VG. This is my spin off from Obsidian, here I present MrColdOnes Creamy Cookie Dough!",
