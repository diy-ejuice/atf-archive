  "name": "Cactus Coitus",
  "description": "Time for an origin story! Everyone has defining moments in their lives: learning to ride a bike without training wheels, a first love, a first heartbreak, graduating from college, a first child, experimenting with hallucinogenic drugs, etc. I would like to take this opportunity to share one of my defining moments as a mixer with ATF. One night, early December 2015, I was laying in bed and thinking about my concentrates (as is good and proper) and an idea to introduce INW Cactus to INW Grapefruit emerged out of wherever-the-fuck-ideas-come-from. I desired to push Cactus, so I chose 2% and a host of complimentary citrus flavors stepped forward and offered themselves to the cause. I was impelled to get immediately out of bed and rush to the kitchen so that I could put it together. After careful mixing, I anxiously shook what could be a dream or a nightmare come true. I stood, I dripped, I inhaled, I exhaled, and I just about died in ecstasy. After coming to the realization that I had truly connected with the most magical concentrate on the planet, I labeled the bottle 'Cactus Coitus.'  \r\n\r\nBroken down: \r\n\r\n[INW Cactus/Grapefruit] - Main events. You won't get aloe or soap because of how Grapefruit asserts itself.\r\n[Pineapple/Lemon Sicily/ Lime Tahity CP/ Mad Mix/ Tangerine] - Citrus mix to compliment the main pairing. I'm sure there is wiggle room for some substitutions here, but I have never desired to try. Mess with these and let me know how it works! Balance is key.\r\n[CAP Sweet Mango/Sweet Strawberry] - These are flavors acting as sweeteners and serve to round the out some of the sharper elements that can show up in a citrus mix.  \r\nShake and vape? Hell yeah.",

Boosting the cactus properties while subduing some of the downsides of using cactus at high percentages. Tasty as hell as a shake and vape and improves upon further steeping. The juice eventually melds together into what is truly a juicy wet cactus extravaganza."
