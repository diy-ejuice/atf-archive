  "description": "A delicious blend of Straw berry and rich milky creams.\r\nTpa ripe strawberry and strawberry come together to make a nice strawberry slightly sweet and artificial but slightly ripe and fresh.\r\nTpa Bavarian cream,sweet cream,and cheesecake graham make that rich milky cream.\r\nTpa vanilla custard gives it a little more richness and thickness to the vape.\r\nAll together this is essentially a simple recipe and inexpensive using all tpa but is very delicious and easily an adv.\r\n",

      "text": "After 1 month, this is another pretty solid flavor. Initially I find the custard to be too strong but with repeated vaping the custard mellows on my tongue. The result is flavor pretty close to legit powdered strawberry quik milk. For my tastes, it‚Äôs not exactly what I‚Äôm looking for. I just taste custard too strongly I think. Might be worth halving the custard and adding in vanilla swirl or replacing it all together with vanilla swirl. Really solid flavor though as is and might be what someone is looking for."
