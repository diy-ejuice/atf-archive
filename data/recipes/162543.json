    "description": "A nice almost candy-ish lemonade flavor.\r\n\r\nSome Flavor Explanations \r\n\r\nCucumber & Cactus Concentrate - I usually only use one or the other in a mix, and was trying out a combo of both to see if it would make the juicy\/wetness taste even more wet feeling. These two combo-ed together has been my go to ever sense if I feel a juice needs a wetness\/juicyness factor added in.\r\n\r\nSuper Sweet CAP - The usual sweetener to give a juice that commercial e liquid kick.\r\n\r\nShisha INW & Ripe Strawberry TFA\/TPA - Shisha has that nice sweet strawberry-ness while Ripe Strawberry has that almost natrual yet candyness that I enjoy. BUT Ripe strawberry tends to fade rather quickly so I used some shisha to help the strawberry flavor stick around a bit longer.\r\n\r\nPink Lemonade LB - This is my go to for a lemonade base. Usage I've found is between 1% and 2% for a base. anything higher than that and the juice will become far to harsh.\r\n\r\nBlood Orange FW - What can I say, I like this orange flavoring. Probably one of the most common that new mixers buy when they build their first carts. Really has that nice orangey kick people want.",
