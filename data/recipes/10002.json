The EM from the Strawberry Ripe helps to round the blackberry bitterness out a bit and what's left of the bitter blackberry  works in tandem with the creamy vanilla ice cream to create this uniquely flavorful vape. I'm very surprised that this recipe has not gotten more love! It may be a little outside the comfort zone for some but I recommend everyone try it. I enjoyed it after 2 days steep but it really all comes together around day 5, with the blackberry (while still being slightly bitter and on top of the mix) chills a little and meshes with the steeped fullness of the VBIC. Definitely a great one!"
