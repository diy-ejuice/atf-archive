  "description": "\"A cheeky bird pecks at delicious strawberries . . .\" that's the description for this fabric design called Strawberry Thief.  This recipe has 2 of Noted's [top flavors of the year](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cyA_-M791c&feature=emb_logo) . . . WF Strawberry Cheesecake and OoO Strawberry Jam.  It also has the #1 worst flavor of the year, TFA Strawberry Yogurt.  The reason for the TFA Strawberry Yogurt is simple . . . I was reaching for INW Yes We Cheesecake and, instead, grabbed the Strawberry Yogurt.  Happy accidents, and what not!  This has turned into a spectacular strawberries and milk/cream.  I guess the various layers (Lord knows there's a lot going on) cover up whatever note the Noted crew disliked.\r\n\r\n",
