    "description": "Everybody claims they have the \u201cBest\u201d custard recipe most of which I have personally tried! Some are good,some are shit but I\u2019ve NEVER had a true custard that absolutely blows my mind....UNTIL NOW! I know,I know it\u2019s super Cliche of me to blow my own trumpet and sit here claiming I\u2019ve got the king of them all but you need to understand,I create my recipes for my tastebuds and I don\u2019t release recipes unless I\u2019m 100% in love with them! I have a few custard \u201ctype\u201d recipes uploaded and they have all done well on ATF and ELR! Some mixers claiming mine is there all time favourite which is very humbling for me. I can whole heartedly say that this recipe right here is by FAR the best custard I\u2019ve created and is worthy of a Throne! Don\u2019t believe me?? Just ask Jon Snow!!! \ud83d\ude00He confirms it\u2019s literally like vaping custard crack!!! If you don\u2019t have MB legendary custard you COULD sub FA custard prem @ 4% you can also sub CC Devon Cream for INW Shisha vanilla @ 1.5% and finally CC Creme Caramel for VT Salted Caramel @ 3%. The rest of the recipe is vital though I\u2019m afraid. Please mix up,leave a rating and review so other mixers can decide whether they would like to mix it up. Happy mixing guys and gals \ud83d\udc99 ***P.S*** This is NOT a straight forward \u201cVanilla custard\u201d! This is a full on Rich vanilla custard with hints of buttery caramel and topped with crushed digestive biscuits. \ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\ude0b\ud83e\udd24\ud83e\udd24",
