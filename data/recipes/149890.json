    "description": "Well here it goes my second recipe.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance for all of you that takes the time to try them.\r\n\r\nAs a new mixer, sometimes is hard for me to get the flavors needed for a lot of recipes here on ATF and also because I live in Colombia it is almost impossible to buy INW, FLV, VT, WF and the list goes on.... and on...\r\n\r\nSo i am trying to develop some simple yet delicious recipes with flavors that i believe most of you reading this will have, in a way to encourage new mixers or peaple who are just trying to get in to DIY but dont have that budget at the beggining. \r\nAlso it have been a great learning opportunity because with this simple easy recipes i have started to understand different flavor pairings and know what each of those do in the mix.\r\n\r\nNow lets talk about the recipe itself (sorry for the long boring intro)\r\n\r\nCAP Cinnamon Danish Swirl: OMG i love this!! it gives so much body, and its the star of the recipe. I think the pastry\/cinnamon combination that this have is amazing for a simple recipe like this one.\r\n\r\nNow in order to smoothe and add more mouthfell and a creamy layer I went with TPA Banana cream and TPA Vanilla swirl. Those two make the cinnamon more soft and delicate. And the TPA Banana cream adds like a hole new twist, more like a surprise element... And that's it!! just 3 flavors but a very great juice in my oppinion.\r\n\r\nAs a SNV i have to say its really good but simple, with not much mouthfeel so I encourage you to wait from 3 to 7 days... That way it feels more balanced and I hope it will give you nice a surprise.\r\n\r\nHope you guys like it and please leave behind a review.",
