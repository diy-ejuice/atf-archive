  "description": "For those days when you just want to throw something together that works and can be vaped right away. There's no complex layering or deep profiles to be found here. This is just an easy, smooth candy strawberry/watermelon that you can throw together in a rush and not have to worry about steep times. \r\n\r\nThis has been my go-to recipe for the past month or so when I just want to mix high VG and drip for a day or two while waiting on my other mixes to steep out.

I love a good candy ish profile more often than not and this one delivers. The strawberry and watermelon combine wonderfully and you have the pineapple jumping in to provide a nice tartness that is just awesome. Great job on this one and it's probably my new number one snv recipe now."

      "text": "This is great fruit candy vape. Watermelon is definitely the main profile in this. Reminds me of a watermelon Jolly Rancher. The pineapple shows up on the exhale but but doesn't separate itself from the watermelon. Fuji, I suspect, is the one acting as a a bridge, fusing the fruits together and keeps the recipe wet. As usual, I can't real taste the strawberry very well. I only get the sweetness from it. &#xD;\nOverall, one of the best simple fruit mixes I have ever tasted and will be mixing this again. I still want to try this with a different strawberry (maybe Shisha Strawberry) to see how a strawberry I can taste works with it. Bottom line, if you don't have LA watermelon, get it! "
