  "description": "Have you ever tried Cookie Dough Cheesecake? I have not, but it sure sounds like an awesome profile to tackle. \r\nThe very first version I created was really good. I just knew I could make it better. After playing with percentages, as well as adding in Cap butter cream and TPA Brown sugar, I felt it was complete.\r\n\r\nCap NY Cheesecake with FW Vanilla bean ice cream are a match made in heaven in this mix. Along with TPA Graham cracker clear for a delicious creamy cheesecake base. \r\nThe Obvious Flv Cookie dough with some help from TPA Double chocolate clear, FA Vanilla bourbon, CAP Butter cream and TPA brown sugar for the tasty cookie dough flavor and texture\r\nCAP Super sweet is of course optional if your not into sweet vapes, although I feel it fits the profile well. I also used super sweet at .25 on previous versions which worked quite well.\r\nThis recipe to me was very good immediately, but as always, the creams and the awesome NY Cheesecake comes out after a few days to a week.\r\n\r\nI hope this recipe gets mixed up in the community. Please leave any feedback you may have if you choose to mix my recipe. Thank you in advance!\r\nMixed recipe at 70VG/30PG\r\n\r\nV1 Used Inw chocolate.Very tasty off the shake, Taste and texture is there, V2 will play with %s for more flavor\r\nV2 Used Cap double chocolate clear and upped the cookie dough .5% upped the graham cracker clear .50\r\nV3 reduced vbic to 1.5% and included cap butter cream at .50 and TPA Brown sugar at .50",
