  "description": "My 1st ground up mix.  Started with craving it and had fig so flavor research led me to VT red dates.  Love that deep rich baked fruit vibe I get from it. Combine with FLV fig it shines through the oatmeal cookie.   Didnt really think about coconut until I found some photos and recipes online. Wanted to focus on 3 flavors to combine for this juice. The coconut started with sweet coconut because thats my goto in bakeries, the FA coco helps it blend with the golden syrup.  Love the flavor the golden syrup has with the red dates and bridges it with the cookie. I used caramel original instead of brown sugar because I believe its smoother with the golden syrup instead of 2 flavors it combines into one.  Praying that someone mixes this up and gives me some feedback.  I was astonished how well this turned out.  Really well balanced, I probably did 3 versions and still playing but its freaking good and will share it at this point. Believe I got lucky having and mixing these flavors as they play really well together.  Ive been mixing other people creations for around 2 years and a ton of online research and talking with other mixers.  Just never thought my 1st official juice would turn out this well.  I like a week long steep to meld esp with those dates and fig. ",
