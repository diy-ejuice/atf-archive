    "description": "\"Tropical Melon with a Coconut Exhale\"\r\n\r\nSounds strange but it has a cult following. And for good reason. Creamy, buttery coconut with a clean melon flavor. It breaks up the monotony of your ADV of Strawberries and Dragonfruit on top of being refreshing and unique.\r\n\r\nGood as a Shake & Vape but gets better after a short steep.\r\n\r\n\r\nUpdates and Revisions:\r\n\r\n10\/29\/19:\r\nCoconut (TPA) 1.5% to Coconut (FA) 1%\r\nI can't believe I didn't think of this before. Duh.\r\nCoconut Candy (TPA) lowered to 1%\r\nTo better compliment FA Coconut.\r\nIntroducing Honeydew II (TPA) at 2%\r\n\r\n5\/23\/19:\r\nLowered Butter Cream (CAP) from 1.5% to 1%. \r\nThis should be a supporting flavor and I feel this change reflects that.\r\n\r\n4\/30\/19:\r\nOmitted Almond (FA). \r\nAs much as I wanted to continue to keep FA Almond in this mix, there was not much of a difference. Feel free to continue adding it to your own mixes, but at .5%, it seemed unnecessary.\r\n\r\n3\/21\/18 BIG UPDATE:\r\nRevised:\r\nAlmond (FA) 1.5% to .5%\r\nCoconut (FA) to Coconut Candy (TPA) \r\nVBIC 3% to 4%\r\nAdded:\r\nToasted Marshmallow (TPA)\r\nCoconut (TPA)\r\n\r\n2\/19\/18:\r\nWent back to A\/AP VBIC. After testing, I have concluded that Diketones are delicious and in small quantities, I have had no problems. Ordering Sweet Coconut (FLV) and will continue to test.\r\n\r\n9\/17\/17:\r\nChanged Golden Butter (CAP) to Butter Cream (CAP). The Butter Cream lends a bit of sweetness and still brings that buttery note I wanted.\r\nLowered the Honeydew (TPA) by 1%. I feel that 3% still brings that overall melon tone, but perhaps without nose raping you.\r\n\r\n3\/9\/17:\r\nChanged Toasted Almond (TFA) to Almond (FA). I feel like the sweetness of Flavour Art's Almond will really shine in this recipe. \r\nChanged Butter to Golden Butter to reflect Capella's decision to change the name.\r\n\r\n5\/19\/2016: \r\nI have reworked the recipe to replace VBIC with A\/AP free VBIC. I don't expect a noticeable taste difference.\r\n\r\n10\/15\/15: \r\nI've taken out the Cantaloupe and reworked the other percentages.\r\n\r\nSide note: I've seen my recipe re-posted on other sites and re-posted here. I'm glad you guys like it!\r\n\r\n9\/18\/15: \r\nI steeped for 3 weeks and it was quite close. I reduced the Cantaloupe and upped the Honeydew. I really feel like I'd miss the Cantaloupe if it wasn't there, so I'm trying a reduced batch before I consider omitting it all together.\r\n-vix",

            "text": "To start off this tastes amazing. I enjoy Honeydew quite a bit and this mix hit the spot. The balance is great. The cream subdued the sharp points of the honeydew very well. I assume the toasted marshmallow is there for mouth feel and some sweetness, so it plays well here though I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s necessary, but plays a part. The almond I feel isn\u2019t necessary, I am unable to get taste or texture due to the honeydew and vbic in here. It doesn\u2019t hurt but I don\u2019t think it helps. Butter cream blends with the vbic nicely to create a great cream. The coconut is a hard one for me. I have to search for it quite a bit but it\u2019s there. I think it\u2019s because of the honeydew at 3%. I don\u2019t know if dropping it to 2% would lend the same flavor while allowing a little more coconut or not. It\u2019s there but I really have to search. I think it had a more texture and sweetness with some cream, more than anything. All in all, this is very tasty. Ive never had the original so I can\u2019t compare to it, but I will be mixing this again. "
