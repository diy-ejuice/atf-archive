      "text": "Super fizzy, really sparkles. Mostly hits the profile of champagne with currants and cranberry. Very tart cranberry. Plenty of sweetness. A little funky down low, as the currant should be, but overall but has a really crisp, clean taste . There’s quite a bit of lemony citrus here that isn’t accounted for in the profile... kinda tastes like what would happen if FlavourArt put out a “champagne, cranberry, and currant” flavor. Like WTF is all this lemon doing here? But it’s hard to stay mad at it because it’s pretty freakin tasty if you don’t mind lemon. "
