            "text": "Super fizzy, really sparkles. Mostly hits the profile of champagne with currants and cranberry. Very tart cranberry. Plenty of sweetness. A little funky down low, as the currant should be, but overall but has a really crisp, clean taste . There\u2019s quite a bit of lemony citrus here that isn\u2019t accounted for in the profile... kinda tastes like what would happen if FlavourArt put out a \u201cchampagne, cranberry, and currant\u201d flavor. Like WTF is all this lemon doing here? But it\u2019s hard to stay mad at it because it\u2019s pretty freakin tasty if you don\u2019t mind lemon. "
