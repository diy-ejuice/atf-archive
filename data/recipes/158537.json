    "description": "Profile: Danish puff pastry with vanilla pudding, powdered sugar and a little almond\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nBeen through several version of this.\r\nFirst few version I used CAP Cinnamon Danish Swirl, but it wasn't really I was looking for as the cinnamon note was way too heavy for what I was going for.\r\nA traditional danish \"spandauer\" doesn't have any cinnamon in it at all, so my idea for making the pastry with it got scrapped.\r\nI kept in VT Croissant that has been there from the start, but I felt it didn't really hold up on it's own. So I introduced WF Croissant SC to back it up. At 1% I feel it does the job backing up the 3% VT Croissant.\r\n\r\nFor the pudding I have tried a few custards such as FA Custard and Custard Prem. CAP Vanilla Custard was at the table at some point too, all in some variations with FLV Vanilla Pudding.\r\nSadly, no matter the combination I did, I just felt it was too overpowering, so for my final version, I decided to just stick it with FLV Vanilla Pudding.\r\nThe almond just serves as an accent for topping and so does the OOO Powdered Sugar.\r\n\r\nIt's a simple recipe, but I quite like it despite the simplicity it has.\r\n\r\nI feel this is best after about 12 days, but very enjoyable after just 7.\r\n\r\nEnjoy!",
