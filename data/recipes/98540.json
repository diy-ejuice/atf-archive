  "description": "Lemon Lime & Bitters is a staple of almost every non-drinker at the local club and also that refreshing beverage to enjoy with a meal.  Till recently I would never of thought that this profile would be possible to achieve this easily.  Thank you to Vape Train for bringing the \"bitters\". It is perfect IMO. Their lemonade is on point as well. To top it off the fizzy sherbet works very well here for a little almost fizzy mouth feel as well as giving a little lemon like assistance to the overall recipe. I don't have any of the VT Limes but I have my favorite squeeze of lime juice concentrate in FW Key Lime which sit's beautifully in the middle here.  This is a delightful & refreshing shake and vape recipe that I am sure you will enjoy all day however let me know what you liked about this or not.  Enjoy! ",
