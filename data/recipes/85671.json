  "description": "Quick note on a small change that made a big difference (huge thanks to mlnikon for the help with this one): ADDED 0.5% FA FUJI APPLE this really brightens the pear notes and makes it much more vibrant and delicious! \r\n\r\nSo I have dicked around with this Graham Mother Clone for a while now and decided this is my final version, imo it tastes quite nice. I was never able to get it spot on to the actual juice which is probably because Im still somewhat new to mixing and recipe creation. That being said, i have really enjoyed vaping this recipe and wanted to share it with everyone here! I will add a bunch of flavor notes in the future when i get the time, i really like to add as much info as possible and dont have time to do that right now. I really hope you all enjoy this as much as i have. If you have any ideas or suggestions on how to improve this recipe please let me know, because like i said i am still rather new and am always open to advice and constructive criticism. \r\n\r\n\r\nNote: You can sub super sweet with a different sweetener or exclude or increase the percentage depending on your tastes. I think the actual premium juice might be using a higher percentage of sweetener than my recipe but i like to keep it low/not overly sweet. ",
