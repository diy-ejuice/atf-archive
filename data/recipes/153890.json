  "name": " Driven By Fear (Sweet Apple Tobacco)",
  "description": "Based on a suggestion by @Fear on Noted, on how great a (INW) Am4A mix with some apples could be, and he was absolutely right. I gave it a bit of a punch, so it is not overly sweet. \r\nINW Am4a - the base of the sweet tobacco for the recipe, wich calls for apples naturally\r\nFA Apple Fuji - a great apple, but can be too noticeable or evident\r\nFLV Sour Apple - another good apple, drier and green\r\nFA Pear - gives the apples some juice\r\nINW Absolute Virginia - Was afraid it might be really strong, but as it is an extract I find it really subtle (needs steeping!)\r\nFA Black Fire - gives the spice, some great smoke (non ashy) without dominating all\r\nNeeds to steep 4 days (a week better) so it all comes together!\r\n",
