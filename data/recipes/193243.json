  "name": "Bourbon Custard | #TPACHALLENGE | DEVELOPED",
  "description": "This recipe was created on our Interactive Mixing podcast but only using TPA flavorings.  With shipments of flavorings being disrupted due to the corona virus, we thought it would be a good idea to mix with flavorings that most people might have in their stash and we think we succeeded in delivering a full bodied toasted custard with hints of bourbon.  Full recipe notes on DEVELOPED LIVE at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6lohUcFLq8 .  \r\n\r\nWe also want to see what you can do with an all TPA recipe.  Create an all TPA recipe, tag it with #TPACHALLENGE in the name of the recipe and we will talk about the recipes next Thursday, 5-7-20 on our DEVELOPED ASSIGNMENT podcast. \r\n\r\nThis is a collaborative creation by DEVELOPED: NaChef, Max Savage, and Folkart.\r\nOur weekly episodes are released at 6:00pm EST every Tuesday, and catch our live shows every Thursday at 6pm EST.\r\n\r\nCheck out our website at https://www.DevelopedDIY.com - We now have Merch!\r\nFind us on YouTube https://www.youtube.com/c/DevelopedDIY\r\nFollow us on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/developeddiy/\r\nCheck out our FaceBook Page at https://www.facebook.com/developeddiy/\r\n\r\n![Legacy](https://i.imgur.com/97yskRE.png)\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you would like to support DEVELOPED, the best way is to check out our LEGACY one shot line at https://www.DIYFlavorChaser.com/developed",
