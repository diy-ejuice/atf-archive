  "description": "The sun is out! Yes, when the sun comes out around here all I want to do is sit outside and have a nice refreshing vape.\r\nA fresh summer drink, candied, sweet and intriguing.\r\n\r\nBuilding blocks:\r\n\r\nFA Blood orange, less strong and overpowering than FW but very aromatic and very authentic, pairs nicely with the watermelon. A nice mixer btw.\r\n\r\nLA Watermelon Clear, the base for this drink , this aroma have a lite candy note which i like very much and for that reason i added a little FA Oba Oba to reinforce that taste.\r\n\r\nRF SC Lychee, it sits in the background, almost trivial  but in reality it's like a mysterious frivolous aroma that changes your vape each and everytime.\r\n\r\nINW Cactus, 1/2 drops per 15ml to much destroys the effect. One could considering the use of Cucumber if you prefer.\r\n\r\nbe creative, add koolada or mint, and if it's not sweet enough add a drop of CAP super Sweet.\r\n\r\n2 days to settle but give it 4 days or more for the fruits to fully grow and balance the flavors even more.\r\n\r\nEnjoy.\r\nshare and rate if you like it.",
