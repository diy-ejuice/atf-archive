  "description": "To me this taste just like the grape Bazooka Joe bubble gum I remember from when I was a kid. Its flat out delicious. Flavorah Grape is perfect for this recipe and I don't think you can substitute it without changing the entire dynamic of the recipe. I use 2 percent Flavorah Bubble Gum and 1 percent Inw Bubble Gum YC and it makes a less dry bubble gum than if I were to use Flavorah alone. I added half a percent of FA Marshmallow to give this some extra mouthfeel and body and .35 percent Cap Super Sweet to push teh grape and bubble gum flavors up another knotch. I didnt try it as a SnV, I let it steep 4 days before trying but it may be good off the shake as well. If you give this a try I hope you enjoy it as much as I am right now.",

No throat hit is an added bonus,   Once it steeps, I will make sure to add the final notes.  Thank you for sharing this,"
