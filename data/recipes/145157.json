    "description": "We spoke about it in this video: https:\/\/youtu.be\/jF_6rVlT9wo\r\n\r\nThis is a realistic full cream milk layer, you can vape this on its own - but it really screams for a top note, I would say good options are: \r\n\r\nStrawberry Milk \r\nJF Sweet Strawberry  2%\r\nOR\r\nINW Strawberry Shisha 2%\r\n\r\nBanana Milk\r\nTFA Banana Cream 2.5%\r\n\r\nChocolate\r\nHS Chocolate Cream 1.5 + CAP Double Chocolate V2 0.75%\r\n\r\nDon't be afraid to add a little sweetener, as most flavoured milk has some sweetener in it. \r\n\r\nFLV Milk & Honey - nice full milk flavour, has a darker sweetness to it\r\nCAP Sweet Cream - There is a cheesyness to it that I am currently addicted to, it helps fill out the middle notes of the layer\r\nTFA Dairy Milk - This adds depth to the whole layer, it also ads a prominent dairy note to the mix. \r\n\r\n",
