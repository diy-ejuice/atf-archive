  "name": "Straw melon lemonade",
  "description": "This is a nice simple shake and vape melon lemonade with a slight breeze of strawberry. I made this because mlnikon made a strawberry watermelon lemonade a few days back but i didnt have a few of the ingredients so i decided to make something similarly profiled. Now the strawberry in strawberry lemonade is more of a lemonade than it is a strawberry and rather than build on the strawberry i decided to leave it as is. I really like the lemonade base of flv lemonade at 3% and strawberry lemonade at 2% it works  most everywhere and with almost any fruit added.  I enjoy this directly after mixing with or without sweetener your choice?\r\n\r\nThis is am extremely delicious recipe. So if this sounds even remotely good to you give it a whirl. You won't be disappointed!!",

I did try adding some WS-23 @ 0.25% after I went thru my 1st batch and it works great in this recipe. Great work on this lemonade!"
