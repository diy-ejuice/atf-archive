      "text": "This is a terrific tropical mix loaded with complimentary flavors. The best way I can describe it is... this tastes like what Mountain Dew would taste like if it had originated in a Caribbean paradise rather than in Tennessee. It's thick and sweet but still has a beverage feel. I can pick out some specific fruit flavors at different times - orange, mango, passionfruit, peach, lemon/lime soda syrup, but taken together it just screams TROPICAL. The African Horned Cucumber is pretty funky on its own but all the citrus and other things here seem to clean that up and what I mostly get from it is like a passionfruit tartness. It’s very juicy and refreshing, as several of the ingredients are on their own, and there’s a nice juxtaposition of sharp tangy top notes and deep syrupy sweet base. Perfect for summer or wishing it were summer.  "

      "text": "What a glorious burst of tropical sunshine. This is flavorful with a nice thick and wet mouthfeel yet vapable for extended time. There is a great variety of distinguishable flavors in this mix and I somehow even get a nice touch of passion fruit tartness in here which is more than welcome. Hop on an inflatable pool lounge with this one in the summer and just drift away. "
