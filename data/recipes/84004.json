  "description": "This is a revision of a recipe I made on a Youtube video. I increased percentages for better flavor on the steep. This recipe is good on the shake but really comes into it's own on a week or longer steep. It is also big batch approved, I am vaping some that is months old.\r\n\r\nA tried and tested tobacco pairing.\r\n\r\nFA Maple Syrup for the Maple backed up by CAP Caramel for added richness.\r\n\r\nEnjoy!",
