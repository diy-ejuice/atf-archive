  "description": "A delicious, chilled, fresh orange: no more, no less...\r\n\r\nThis is a further adaptation based on my Icee Lycheee base employing a ripe orange to provide a refreshing and 'clean' citrus vape.\r\n\r\nINW Shisha Orange is a phenomenal orange... It is a full, juicy, fresh orange with ZERO artificial notes. This is straight up orange juice without the acidic notes or annoyingly sweetness present in most orange concentrates. There is a fabulous zesty back note which emphasizes the authenticity perfectly.\r\nBest of all, this baby does not fade - ever! \r\n\r\nThe cream provides a bit of body and mouthfeel to avoid the 'linearness' often present in simple fruit vapes.\r\n\r\nA dash of WS23 provides just the right amount ice to make this one a winner!!\r\n\r\n3 days rest and she's ready to go!!!\r\n\r\n",
