    "description": "I tried going for an authentic profile of a triple apple hookah and ended up tweaking it to make it more enjoyable as an ADV.\r\nA real hookah doesn't have this much sweetness and zest, and has much much more anise in it which gets old really fast in vaping imho.\r\nI ended up decreasing the Bahraini Gold (which brings the anise) and upping the INW Shisha Apple which is a wonderful sweet apple flavor. This also made the vape much more smooth as Bahraini Gold has a bit of a throat hit.\r\nLowering the INW Bahraini Gold left a bit of space in the tobacco department and FA Maxx Blend was perfect for the job (imho) as it brought a sweet tobacco to the table that blends in perfectly.\r\n\r\n\r\nOptional: Increase Maxx Blend to 0.5% or even more if you want more tobacco in the vape, remove it all together, or replace it with your own favorite sweet tobacco flavor.\r\nOptional2: For a more authentic hookah experience I'd add 0.25-0.5% Anise depending on brand.",
