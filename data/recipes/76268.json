    "description": "I\u2019ve made probably twenty recipes with hazelnut trying to find something better than bust a nut.  I vapes that stuff for a month straight.  Finally I came up with this.  At first you get butterscotch but just for a second then it\u2019s a beautiful creamy hazelnut, So good.  The FA hazel grove backs up fw hazelnut because I personally have problems tasting it after vaping it for a week lol.   I used TFA vbic because it\u2019s decadence.  I\u2019m lucky and don\u2019t get the pepper.  If you do get pepper sub liquid barn for it.  The Butterscotch I believe has been the missing ingredient.  It kind of sauces things up here.  Sweetener I think needs to be there because I\u2019m trying to mimic the hazelnut cream that goes in your coffee and well that stuff is loaded with sugar.  I\u2019m trying to get better about only releasing the absolute best I have got ADHD so when I taste something good I release it and that\u2019s not always good because after a steep it changes.  This has been sitting for a week mixed it up on ELR and brought it over here because it\u2019s that good",
