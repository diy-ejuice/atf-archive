  "description": "Got some Inspiration from Theo's Grapey Vapey and Pippa's Pop my Grape, and made something for MTL\r\n\r\nAnother purple Grape BubbleGum, But for MTL!\r\nThe Purpz: Mainly FE Grape, this has a potent Purple grape flavor that works well in Candies and artificial grape juice. I then used the TFA Grape Juice and Dragon fruit to give a juicy boost to the grape note.\r\n\r\nTested on Berserker 1.5 MTL with a 0.55 Ohm Nano Fused Clapton\r\nAmerican Bubblegum was an easy choice. I kept it low here as I didnt want to deal with weird notes that I get from ALL bubblegum\r\n\r\nSS, I'd say yes. But hey, take it out if you dont like the sweet stuff in life.\r\n",
