  "description": "Being someone who have a really hard time tasting strawberry juices, what was left for me was to play around and a find a way to use strawberry in a way that pleases me. After thinkering a lot, what came was this strawberry juice, based in a drink made with coconut rum + strawberry syrup. It's cold, sweet, refreshing and delicious.",
