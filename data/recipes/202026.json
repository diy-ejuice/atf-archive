  "description": "A decadent, full bodied fluffy white cake with a sweet vanilla top note and plenty of icing \r\n\r\nTo ensure the cake part is front and centre with a lot of body I layered WF fluffy white cake, FW white cake, FA custard prem for more body and a touch of sugar cookie for that fresh baked note\r\n\r\nTo make the recipe a full experience and not all on the finish I boosted the icing  with FLV vanilla Bean which ensured a prominent and sweet vanilla note that hits you straight away followed by the body of the cake which stays with you for a good while afterwards \r\n\r\nAnd to sweeten FLV sweetness worked really well here, not as imposing as CAP SS and not as subtle as FW sweetener \r\n\r\nI’ve been after a vape like this for ages and before I started mixing I tried loads of commercial cake recipes but the actual cake part was always hiding in the background. The closest thing I found was nilla killa which isn’t a cake but the rich vanilla top note is lovely so I aimed for something similar but with a white cake instead \r\n\r\nIt takes a good 4/5 days steep for that cake to come through properly \r\n\r\nI tested this on a single coil flavour RDA, 0.25ohm alien coil on a mech squonker \r\n\r\nAlso on a Taifun GT4S with a 0.25 ohm alien at 45w",
