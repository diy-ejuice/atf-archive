  "description": "Much more simplistic take on Monster than Wayne did on live mixing, but it's the drink none the less! \r\n\r\nFW Green Goblin- The main flavor of the whole recipe. Just straight up monster, just a little lacking solo to me\r\nTPA Citrus Punch- Adds just a little extra limey(???) soda taste\r\nTPA Champagne- Just added \"fizzy\"(not actually any fizz) aspect you get from the drink. Maybe its a power of suggestion, I don't know, it just works\r\nCAP Super Sweet- Bc Monster is so sweet its almost syrup-like, 1% does just the trick",
