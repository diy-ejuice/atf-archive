  "description": "This recipe is a coffee sweetened with condensed milk. It is quite good, as the vanilla, milk, and cream make this coffee very creamy and thick. I currently have a batch steeping with a lower percentage of condensed milk (.25%) and sweetener added (CAP Super Sweet .5%) to see if that works out better. This recipe was best after a looooong steep of 14 days.",
