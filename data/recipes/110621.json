    "description": "Based on a remix of Boardwalk Bombshell\r\nhttps:\/\/www.lediypourlesnuls.com\/boardwalk-bombshell\/\r\n\r\nDecided it should be blueberry, so from the youtubes they say that FW Blueberry is the best.. But the youtubes are a fickle crew and they also say that HS Blueberry is the best. So... What to do.. What to do.. Hey!\r\n\r\nThe youtubes also say that Bilberry can make candy blueberries take their job of being blueberries a little more seriously. So I sent Bill in there to give the other two a stern talking to.\r\n\r\nBilberry is a strange way to spell Blueberry.  (NN is VSO Vaping Swag Original Blueberry)\r\n\r\nFrom there.. Some Ice Cream to make it a little less battery and a little more creamy.\r\n\r\nAnd.. Blam!\r\n\r\nThis is the first recipe I've made that passed the 120 ml test.. And as of this writing I'm pretty sure this will be a constant resident in the Drop rda..\r\n\r\nGive it a couple weeks for full awesomeness, but after a week or so It's good stuff..",
