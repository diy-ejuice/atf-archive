    "description": "Super concentrates cappuccino- simply put best coffee flavoring ever!!! I've been sitting on this recipe, subbing in and out coffee flavorings, trying to get something I could put my name on. I finally found a coffee flavoring  that I like.. recently did a full right up on this flavor check it out here.\r\n\r\nhttps:\/\/docs.google.com\/document\/d\/1ms2uzZieIrJIH2G2t69QfKS5nYyaoShIBnA7mo4DDf0\/edit?usp=drivesdk\r\n\r\nFlavor West ice cream, cap sweet cream, and cap vanilla custard- these three come together to create a fantastic milkshake base. I prefer flavor West vanilla bean ice cream, it's a little sweeter than the others but, if you don't have it I'm sure you could substitute in TFA, or CAP. Cap vanilla custard, comes together with the vanilla bean ice cream, to give you a much thicker more authentic ice cream. CAP sweet cream, this flavoring is a grate milk flavoring,  and the counterpart  to the ice cream giving you a milkshake, instead of an ice cream flavor. If you don't have it I'm 99.9% sure Bavarian cream will work just as well.\r\n\r\nCap sugar cookie- this flavoring does a great job of sweetening the profile, at 2% doesn't have a lot of cookie flavor. But who the doesn't want a little cookie in the milkshake \ud83e\udd14 I have always loved the way this flavoring works with creams, just makes them more complex and tasty.",

            "text": "First of all, massive thanks for Chris on hitting up the SC cappuccino! If you're looking for a creamy coffee flavor, look no futher, this one is amazing and it doesn't have any skunky notes to it. I can say for sure it's the flavor I've looked for since I started DIY.&#xD;\n&#xD;\nSo I mixed this up using TFA VBIC because I don't have FW's verison, but regardless of that this was still a great vape. The coffee isn't super heavy, it makes for a very creamy flavor when mixed with all of these creamy. It's a bit heavy for the summer so not an ADV at least during this time of the year, but extremly enjoyable. It somewhat reminds me of a jamocha shake from Arby's, granted it's been years since I had one. but you could probably get something almost dead on with this base adding some kind of chocolate flavor."
