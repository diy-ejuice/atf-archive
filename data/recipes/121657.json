  "description": "Blueberry, Blackberry, and Huckleberry blended together into a wonderful creamy yogurt.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis was my first venture into creamy/yogurt vapes. EdibleMalfunction was kind enough to share his yogurt base with me and that was my starting point. \r\n\r\nI wanted to do a blend of a bunch of different berries rather than just one or two. So I started with the always wonderful FW Blueberry and FA Bilberry combo. For me this makes a great blueberry that's sweet but not over sweet and candied but not over candied. \r\n\r\nI chose TPA Blackberry and TPA Huckleberry to add a depth of sorts to the mix. The blackberry has a nice tart berry flavor that works well with the sweetness of the blueberries. Huckleberry worked wonderfully to work in a nice sweet jammy flavor into the berry blend. These two took a bit of work to get to a good place as they are very strong flavors. My first attempt with the two was at 1% and .75% respectively and they overpowered everything in the mix. Cutting them down to .5% each helped significantly in allowing them to complete the roles I wanted them to without taking away from everything else in the mix. ",
