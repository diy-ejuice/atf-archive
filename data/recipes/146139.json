    "description": "This is my ctrl-z recipe. I enjoy developing complex and rough tobacco profiles but every now and then I need a reset as vaping \"put-hair-on-your-palms\" tobaccos can be quite taxing. This is an old favourite of mine that I keep coming back to... Especially when I am on a losing streak with my tobacco recipe development. So thats actually pretty damn often XD. \r\n\r\nCtrl-z is a simple ruyan 4 styled dessert profile with light tobaccos tones, a rich, smooth caramel top note and a custard base so moreish-ly dense and creamy, you almost have to chew before you inhale.\r\n\r\nThe Ruyan tobacco layer is made up of DIYFS Holy Grail RY4 and MB Melty Caramel. This combination makes for a rich and smooth caramel layer with light tobacco highlights. It creates almost a Caramel treat like quality which I absolutely adore. \r\n\r\nThe silky, smooth bourbon vanilla tones of DIYFS Holy Vanilla helps to smooth out the texture even further and helps to round out the caramel layer, which otherwise comes accross slightly linear. \r\n\r\nFor the dessert base I used FA custard premium. Not just because its a wonderfully smooth custard with loads of mouth feel and weight but also because its vanilla tone is the least intrusive which is very important in this specific profile because I really want the Holy vanilla to take the spot light. \r\n\r\nThis recipe is fantastic off the shake but it takes a week or so to really develop texture.",

I am a bit of a Holy Holy grail fanboy and just love the use of it here. I made another version where I subbed the FA Custard Premium with INW Custard as I do not particularly like FA Premium. A winner right here!!! "
