  "description": "Dropping my own strawberry recipe as I’ve been long overdue on. \r\n\r\nI wanted something that did not have a fading strawberry over time and by Jove I think I’ve accomplished just that. \r\n\r\nA sweet and creamy strawberry cheesecake with a  crisp crust. \r\n\r\nLiquid barn strawberry cheesecake is an amazing concentrate all on its own. Honestly just 10% of it on it’s own gets you pretty much all the way there in a great strawberry cheesecake. I wanted to build off of it and give it more depth. \r\n\r\nMy strawberry combo is jf sweet strawberry and real flavors sc strawberry which give the right balance between a syrup/candy strawberry and a ripe whole strawberry topping. \r\n\r\nI used a touch of jf cookie with the goal of keeping the graham crust aspect of the cheesecake from going “soggy”. \r\n\r\nJf cheesecake graham crust, jf Bavarian cream, hs French vanilla and jf marshmallow pull all the thick creamy consistency needed for a cheesecake. Cheesecake graham crust boosts the cheesecake aspect/note of the lb strawberry cheesecake. Jf marshmallow adds sweetness and that fluffy full mouthfeel. Jf Bavarian cream along with the hs French vanilla impart a nice vanilla note that doesn’t drown out the strawberry but helps add an ala mode taste to it. \r\n\r\nSweetener is optional. ",
