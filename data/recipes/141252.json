    "description": "Tatanka Rubio, part two in a Tatanka tobacco trilogy.\r\n\r\nThis is their story... \"I believe today that this place is bigger than the dream I had for it. What it means to anyone that comes here will be up to them. Tatanka was not designed as the white man\u2019s version of the Native American. Rather it stands as a centerpiece for two cultures, one whose very lives depended on the buffalo and one who saw it as a means to an end. It recognizes and accepts that this is our mutual history. It can also represent the chance to move forward.\" Kevin Costner, Attraction Founder\/Owner\r\n_________________________________________________________\r\n\r\nA balanced tobacco recipe where FLV Tatanka create a smooth, rich and full-bodied flavor with the FW Butterscotch Ripple and nutty flavor of the FW Creamy Hazelnut.\r\nJust enough FLV Bourbon and VTA Salted Caramel to spice up this recipe.\r\nA simple recipe, beautiful and bold.\r\n\r\nAs always, add whatever sweetener at liking, i did not used any.\r\n\r\nThis is one of those recipes that benefit of a longer than usual steep. \r\nMinimal 14 days, a longer steep will benefit the overall taste.
