It's slightly earthy, nutty, a tad smokey, and just a great mellow tobacco flavour. Can be a bit dry on the exhale but we can balance that out.\r\n\r\nButterscotch (FLV):\r\nVery spot on butterscotch taste, although it's not very creamy nor is it very sweet. The use of the additional caramel's add to the body and depth of the butterscotch profile. At 3% it's presence is unmistakable.\r\n\r\nBrown Sugar (TPA):\r\nUsed mainly for it's sweetness but also for it's similar compounds that help boost the existing caramel and butterscotch notes.\r\n\r\nVanilla Custard (CAP):\r\nI have tried using other custards, (FA, TPA, FLV) and although each were good, they just... well aren't CAP's vanilla custard. I have a hard time not resorting to using CAP's v1 but at least I gave it a shot. It's buttery, very rich, creamy, tasty and just works so well here. It's really the body, the backbone of this recipe, but can easily be swapped out for a different custard profile. Although, I don't suggest it.\r\n\r\nAcetyl Pirazine (TPA):\r\nIs used to round out the tobacco and increase it's roasted and nutty profile.",
