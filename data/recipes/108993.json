  "description": "I'm italian and this is the vape translation of a traditional italian dessert: Pesche con cioccolato e amaretto.\r\nAfter many and many trials this is the most close flavour to the real dessert.\r\n\r\nChocolate: in this dessert the chocolate is very strong and sweet at the same time, so i went with CAP double choco for the dark chocolate aroma and FA chocolate to give it a bit of kindness.\r\n\r\nThe peach: FA white peach is a must everytime we need a peach flavour, but in real eatable life this dessert is made in order to avoid trashing peaches too much old, in fact all our grandma use a combination of peaches. Here it comes the TPA Juicy peach to mitigate the FA white peach and give the sensation of a peach mix.\r\n\r\nAlmond amaretto: this is the accent of this receipt. This flavour is very strong and you will need just a .5.\r\n\r\nAgain in real life Almond amaretto is a special type of cookie. So i tried to combine this with FA cookie or INW cookie, but at the end I erased those cookies from my recipe because the TPA almond amaretto is a very complete flavour and it has already inside it all the cookie you need.",
