  "name": "Not Your Nonna's Strawberry Custard",
  "description": "Wanted a nice strawberry custard with a different profile than I usually mix for myself.  At first I used the nonna's at 2.5% which was a little to overpowering on the exhale where the anise/pizzelle cookie flavor was a little to much for me. Mind you I do not get the lemon flavor as some do with this flavor. I dropped it down to 2% where it balances itself better in the mix to give it the more subtle cake flavor with a hint of pizzelle cookie cake accents in the middle of the vape. The strawberry at first I went with inw @ 2% and tpa ripe strawberry at 1%. It gave it a strawberry jam effect which was pretty tasty. The strawberry faded after a few days so I gave it a lift with the rf strawberry sc to give it little more staying power.  I am sure this recipe has been done a 1000 times. But I always enjoy a strawberry dessert.  Enjoy",
