  "description": "Simple and easy to mix. Flavors that most ever mixer has or should have. Did i forget Delicious $$$ well this is definitely that.  This recipe is very similar to my dragon lady recipe i basically just put pink guava where the strawberries were and lowered the Dragon fruit a little.  I love it off a shake but it might be a little throaty at first for some but i dont really have a throat hit problem i can vape tfa juicy peach with zero throat hit so....... I feel that this recipe is a shake and vape but it is at its best after a 2 day steep so the fruits blend into one cohesive pink kiwi lol. So If your looking for a bright fun fruit mix than give this one a try. I think you will be pleasantly surprised. Lmao i just realized it was a 3,2,1 recipe.\r\n\r\nAs always sweeten to taste with your preferred sweetener. I do use sweetener when i mix this. .35% flavorah sweetness is my favorite.",

      "text": "To be fair, he warned that it might be a little throaty for some. The little bit of throat hit I get from Pink Guava is somehow amplified by one or both of these other ingredients that aren’t particularly rough on their own and this is too throaty for me. The flavors do blend together very well, though, and it makes something that does kind of taste like a natural fruit that doesn’t exist, a hot pink kiwi. I might try it again with both sweetener and cooling and see if that smooths it out, or a fairly neutral cream like TFA Vanilla Swirl. Or some FLV Guanabana? "

Mixing up a couple more tests batches with Sugar Daddy and his wife, Icy Cool.  All test batches with various sweeteners have been seriously good...  just fine tuning to my sweet spot.  Great job @TooTall  "
