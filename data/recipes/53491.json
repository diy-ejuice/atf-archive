  "description": "Bright Grapefruit supported by strawberry and Blueberry.  Perfect Summer Vape.\r\n\r\nINW grapefruit has a very authentic grapefruit flavor for me. During my testing after I got the flavor, it was quite strong at 5%. I wanted to whip something up that tamed out the bitterness, and added some fruity complexity and sweetness at the same time. I mix this at 75/25 VG/PG and its great as a shake and vape, but the grapefruit mellows a bit after a day or so. Berry base really supports the grapefruit zing and bitterness well.\r\nAn awesome fresh summertime ADV for me\r\nHope you enjoy.",
