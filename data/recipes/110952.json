    "description": "Notes\r\nSo i have been working on this for a wile now i didn't think the chocolate was up to scratch to begin with but after trying a few different ones like molinberry glamor chocolate i settled on this as it was the most authentic to the actual cherry ripe you get from the shops. Needs a week steep and you can probably sub out the raspberry with another raspberry as it is just there to support the cherry. The dedicated coconut and cherry mix really give you that authentic cherry ripe filling tast and mouth feel.",
