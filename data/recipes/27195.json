  "description": "The Grapefruit is a great idea. Only one problem; the taste. The Oro Blanco is a grapefruit hybrid. A cross between a traditional white grapefruit and a pomelo. It has none of the qualities of traditional red-fleshed grapefruit that make you cringe when someone mentions it. It has almost none of the bitterness you would expect, and it's mildly sweet with nice citrus notes. I often had these for breakfast as a kid before hopping on the bus, but it's a fruit I just kind of forgot about as I got older. I chose this because for the most part grapefruit is generally hated and I sought to change that idea. \r\nInw White Grapefruit was the obvious choice here as it's the only grapefruit flavoring that isn't overly bitter and has a very mild sweetness. \r\nFW Blood Orange was the backing citrus note that this mix needed as it imparts the orange note without tasting like bitter zest. \r\nFA Lime Tahity(cold pressed) takes the brightness to another level and really makes the two fruits come alive.
