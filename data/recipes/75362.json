    "description": "This is my attempt to create a cream cheese filled French toast with maple syrup. \r\nI've had this delicious breakfast dish a few times at IHOP and other pancake houses and I wanted to see if I could recreate this profile in a vape.\r\n \r\nThe Cream Cheese.\r\nIf anyone has ever tried a profile including a cream cheese note, you know how difficult it can be. There are not a lot of just straight up cream cheese flavors to chose from. I SFTed  RF Cream Cheese and I'm not sure if the vendor\/rebottler sent me the right flavoring. It did not, at all, taste like cream cheese, so I went with a flavoring that while it's not a straight-up cream cheese, it still has that cream cheese icing note to it. No, I did not use LA Cream Cheese Icing. I instead went with LA Cheese Cake. To me it's similar to LA CCI but lighter on the icing note. Also, adding CAP Vanilla Custard helps to bend the LA Cheese Cake into a more believable cream cheese.\r\n\r\nThe French toast.\r\nThe French toast should have been easy enough, 4-5% RF French toast and done! But I was getting a medicine note from it and so I decided to build my own French toast. CAP Cinnamon Danish Swirl at 1% and WF Deep Fried Pastry Dough SC at 2% seems to be well balanced to mimic the fried bread and cinnamon while the CAP Vanilla Custard at 1.5% adds the eggy part of the French toast. \r\n\r\nThe Syrup.\r\nWhat can I say, FA Maple Syrup at 1% just works here. I also added .5% CAP Super Sweet to bolster the FA Maple Syrup.\r\n\r\nI do not suggest vaping this right away. It needs at least a 5 day steep to let the LA Cheese Cake and CAP Vanilla Custard settle in. The CAP Cinnamon Danish Swirl also needs that time to calm down a bit. \r\n\r\nVisit Freedom To Mix on Discord https:\/\/discord.gg\/SmSc8Ef\r\nVisit Freedom To Mix on FaceBook https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/groups\/415341418920740\/ \r\n\r\nPlease comment, mix, and or rate,....it makes us all better mixers.
