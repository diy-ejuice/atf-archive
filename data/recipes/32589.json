    "description": "Alright let's start off with the Belgian waffle, at 8% standalone comes out a little harsh, but at 4% very well-balanced and delicious. The perfect base for this recipe.\r\n\r\nButterscotch Ripple- can I say enough good things about this flavoring. No it's fantastic almost to for for words.  This recipe in pairs perfectly with the waffle making everything better sugary and delicious along with boosting the creams.\r\n\r\nButter & Vienna cream- true staple flavorings in this recipe thay help smooth everything combining to give you a fantastic cake pop base.\r\n\r\nHazelnut-  wall complementing The Nutty flavors in the waffle also helps boost the creams and smooth things out.\r\n\r\nWanted to limit myself to five flavorings for this competition. After the dod competition it seems obvious, we can create banging flavors without using so many different concentrates.",

I never liked FW Butterscotch Ripple that much but at 1.25% it just works and it's giving me more of a syrupy sensation.&#xD;\n&#xD;\nTo me it's something I can vape all day without being bored and that's not an easy achievement."
