    "description": "I was hoping to get this done with just one concentrate but taking the hard cracked toffee too high resulted in too much coffee, I tried FW salted caramel and it was too rough by the time I got it high enough for the same caramel taste so I chose chefs choice\/CCW and it worked out perfectly, there was a slight fresh cream\/milk note in the original so I added 1% fresh cream. The 1st revision I made had 2% super sweet in it but the sweetness was at the front and in the original it came after the coffee\/caramel so I reduced the super sweet to 0.75 and added the marshmallow which seems to layer the sweetener in the same way as the original does. This is 95% there if I fucked with the %\u2019s a bit more I could get it 100% but it would be fiddly and so much of this clone\/remix game comes down to perception and you can\u2019t please everyone but I\u2019m happy enough to put it out there and say \u201ccan you do better?\u201d :)\r\n\r\nI know there is probably some difference in concentrates between the original and the remix but it\u2019s that close why be picky \ud83d\ude06",
