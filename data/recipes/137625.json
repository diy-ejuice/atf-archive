  "description": "I was hoping to get this done with just one concentrate but taking the hard cracked toffee too high resulted in too much coffee, I tried FW salted caramel and it was too rough by the time I got it high enough for the same caramel taste so I chose chefs choice/CCW and it worked out perfectly, there was a slight fresh cream/milk note in the original so I added 1% fresh cream. The 1st revision I made had 2% super sweet in it but the sweetness was at the front and in the original it came after the coffee/caramel so I reduced the super sweet to 0.75 and added the marshmallow which seems to layer the sweetener in the same way as the original does. This is 95% there if I fucked with the %‚Äôs a bit more I could get it 100% but it would be fiddly and so much of this clone/remix game comes down to perception and you can‚Äôt please everyone but I‚Äôm happy enough to put it out there and say ‚Äúcan you do better?‚Äù :)\r\n\r\nI know there is probably some difference in concentrates between the original and the remix but it‚Äôs that close why be picky üòÜ",
