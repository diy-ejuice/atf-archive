  "description": "This is a complex cavendish with peanut butter and caramel. Dark, mysterious, sweet, and nutty. Like David Attenborough. \r\n\r\nThis is probably the 10th version of this recipe that started simple, but became a pain in the ass. All I wanted was a strong cavendish, with a little caramel and moderate peanut butter. I kept trying to force it to work with only INW Cavendish as the main note, and it just wouldn't happen. It smells great, but it doesn't translate. Picked up FLV Cavendish, even worse. Smells amazing, but has this horrible cloying cherry in the background that is almost nauseating. So I ended up making my own cavendish, which is what I want to taste when I smell INW Cavendish and FLV Cavendish. \r\n\r\nINW Tobacco Cavendish Type - This stayed in, because it is still a solid 'cavendish'. It's a little spiced, sweet, and smooth. \r\n\r\nINW Tobacco Kent - This was the breakthrough. All attempts up until I realized this was what I was looking for were trash compared to the attempts with it. I love this stuff. Dark molasses, a little anise, spices, and almost burned brown sugar. It's perfect. Unfortunately though it has been discontinued. I apparently bought the last two 30mls from vaperstek, so if anyone really wants to mix this hit me up on reddit and I'll send you some. I should be able to mix a few gallons with what I've got. \r\n\r\nINW Gold Ducat- Topping for the cavendish. This is mild and syrupy, a little bit of plum or raisin back in there, with some light leaf. I wanted those dark fruits and they come through after a steep. \r\n\r\nFLV Cured Tobacco - Dry, nutty, and woody. I needed everything this has for the cavendish. \r\n\r\nINW Classic for Pipe Black - Pretty much a standard for down and dirty tobacco mixes. I didn't get too crazy with it because I wanted to keep it cavendish rather than a cigar dunked in a jar of peanut butter. \r\n\r\nINW DNB - I push it up to 1.5, but for the masses I think 1 is good. Ashtray. \r\n\r\nTPA DX Peanut Butter - One of if not the only DX that is way more kickass than the OGs. Regular PB will work but obviously not as awesome. \r\n\r\nDFS Holy Holy Grail RY4 - So this was the bastard that made this happen. All I get from this is caramel. No vanilla, no tobacco. Just an amazing, melted, gooey caramel. I did another RY4 that needed TPA RY4D, and I had to do something with this. It was a serious bitch to work with. Any higher and it's cloying and sticky and buries everything. Much lower and it disappears into the peanut butter and Kent. 2% is perfect and it took many attempts to get it right. \r\n\r\nI hope you all enjoy this as much as I enjoy everything about Mr. Attenborough. It needs minimum 3 weeks, more won't hurt. ",
