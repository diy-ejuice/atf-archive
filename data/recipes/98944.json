  "description": "Thank you to Matt who recently joined our FB group at DIY Downunder for hopping in and challenging us to create this profile, I'm now dam glad you did! \r\nHis challenge was \"for a recipe based on Pancakes/Crepes with lemon juice and sugar\". This is exactly what I get and enjoy with my version here. I will go a step further and say this is \"Yummy AF\". The sugary note and sweetness from the OOO Powdered sugar and VT golden Syrup to the squeezed Lemon coming together from Caps Juicy Lemon & FE Lemon with the pancake effect by bringing WF Crepe & FA Zepolla together provides all together a simply gorgeous vape. The mouthfeel is authentic as those sprinkles of sugar work over your tongue with a little lemon juiciness while you get the pancake underneath. It's just a lovely vape that would go well while sipping on your favorite cuppa I think. Enjoy! \r\n",
