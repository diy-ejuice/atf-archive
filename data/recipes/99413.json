I've always liked this flavor,j ust never really found a use for it until now. That said I'm sure a lot of different lemons would work in this recipe,  if you have a favorite lemon go ahead and plug it in. I chose juicy lemon for its Sweetness, in fact, most of the flavorings in this recipe I chose because they were sweeter than other offerings. \r\n\r\nFA lemon Sicily -  hands down my favorite of the bunch I seem to use this anytime I want to take another lemon flavor to a more realistic.\r\n\r\n FA custard - has a great thick eggy quality to it that I believe emulates the curd very well. I will say I tried a batch with fa custard premium, and I love them both, close to write this recipe with custard, instead of custard premium, for several reasons first and most importantly it's easier to source. second we don't need our buddy ID10-T getting all worked up again and writing a fuck you with a giant strap on recipe  To be honest, I think there are a lot of custards that would work so use what you've got, and let me know how it turned out.\r\n\r\nFW Bavarian cream - I chose this flavoring, in part because I have an affinity for it, and in part because it is sweeter than other offerings.  Bavarian cream adds some extra vanilla, and richest to the mouthful.\r\n\r\n TPA butter - this is where the magic happens.!!! You may or may not know, I have an affinity for this flavor. (it's like the Frank's Red Hot Sauce of mixing I'll put that shit in anything). Butter adds a whole nother level of richness, perfectly contrasting, the lemon and sugar combination.\r\n\r\nTPA sweetener - curd is essentially eggs sugar and lemon juice. I pushed the boundaries on these flavors, knowing that I was going to add, what I considered an obscene amount of sweetener to the mix. Why?? I'm glad you asked, it gives it that sugary sweet lips that you would expect from this profile. \r\n",
