  "description": "I am a big fan of Cereal mixes and I really like TPA Sweet Cereal Flakes. I hadn't made a mix with it in a while but I wanted to do something a little different with it and it still be Cereal. Now they have made all the old timer cereals like Frosted Flakes, Fruity Pebbles. Froot Loops with Lucky Charm type Marshmallows. So I thought I would give that cereal profile a go.\r\n\r\nI don't mix with high % anymore and haven't for some time now so even flavors like TPA, FW that general need higher %'s I use much lower than most. But for me it works out great, I can still taste each flavor as good if not better than when I mixed much much higher. If you are someone who has trouble tasting at lower % then feel free to up them to your liking just stay at the same ratios. But I urge you to try this mix as is first before changing it and going higher in %'s.\r\n\r\nI wanted the SCF to be the star of the show so it is at the highest % here. I used WF Cashew in place of AP. It really does compliment the SCF so well and does something lovely to it IMO.\r\nTPA LLC is behind SCF not only for a bit more of the cereal grain taste but also for the Hard Cereal Marshmallow taste. It is a weaker flavoring but at 2% here it works great. I used DIYFS Pillow Talk pretty low because I didn't want it to take over with a gooey type Marshmallow. At this % it helps bring that Crunchy Marshmallow in the LLC out from the cereals a little more. And of course the OOO Cream, FA Cream Fresh and FA Meringue make the sugary sweet milk our cereal floats in.\r\n\r\nI gave this a quick hot bath uncapped and then steeped for 3 days and on day 3 it was DELICIOUS, it is exactly what I was shooting for. It is very much vapeable after 3 days but if allowed to steep a full 7-10 days the Cream/Milk comes through a bit more and the cereal actually becomes kinda like when you let your cereal sit in the milk just long enough for it to start to get a bit soft but still has a crunch to it.. I don't know how to explain it in Vape terms but that is what it becomes after a longer steep. 3 or 10 days it is a great cereal mix IMHO.\r\n\r\nGive it a mix and let me know what you think.. Happy Mixing...\r\n\r\n",
