    "description": "Smooth earthy whiskey followed by warm vanilla cream.\r\n\r\nTFA kentucky bourbon\/FA whisky\/FA oak wood - The two liquiors mix together well though both tend to fade, the oak wood is here to get them to hold their flavor longer while adding a subtle smokey note.\r\nFLV cream\/HS French vanilla ice cream\/TFA toasted marshmallow\/FW butterscotch ripple - the cream and French vanilla ice cream combine for a nice heavy cream for the whiskey to sit on. The toasted marshmallow and butterscotch ripple add to the body and mouthfeel, keeping it thick through the exhale.\r\nFA maple syrup\/FA torrone\/INW shisha vanilla - the maple syrup flavor is barely detectable, which surprised me at 1% but it adds not only sweetness but richness as well. The torrone lends a hand to the texture and shisha vanilla is strong enough to fall in line behind the whiskey but not be overtaken by the creams.\r\n\r\nThis doesn't need long to sit, tastes fine right after mixing though the whiskey will mellow after a few days as the creams develop.",

            "text": "When I first checked out this recipe, it seemed nuanced to the point that FA Maple Syrup would ruin the subtle intricacies and make the whole mix taste like pancakes.  In my experiences, as you somewhat eluded to above, FA Maple Syrup tends to be rather a bully of an ingredient.  I decided to mix a 30 of the recipe verbatim and another without the syrup.  My results concluded that FA Maple is definitely a make\/break ingredient here, as I did not care much for it without.  The user's description hits that nail right on the head.&#xD;\n&#xD;\nThis is an excellent and well balanced fruitless recipe.  Don't let the number of ingredients scare you away, if you have everything and like to change it up, this one is very unique.  My only disclaimer is that I found it much more enjoyable after the 10-12 day mark, as the whiskey does have a slight bite early on but it calms down after a bit more time in the bottle."
