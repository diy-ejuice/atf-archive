  "description": "#####**Description & Setup**\r\nBlueberries are probably my all time favourite fruit, and there used to be a soda I had when I was a kid that had such a nice blueberry taste to it but with a subtle sweetness of what I could only describe as \"Blue\". \r\n\r\n#####**Notes**\r\n**VT Fizzy Sherbert** - The Fizz. I didn't want to push it too far and have the citrus come in too much, as I wasn't wanting to go for a Sprite Blueberry. \r\n\r\n**TPA Blueberry + FW Blueberry** The Two Blueberries are from Ed's Blueberry Trinity, with TPA Blueberry slightly lowered, this is for the blueberry part of the soda. \r\n\r\n**LB Blue Raspberry** - For now as the \"Sweet Blue\" note I found in that soda. Right now I'm pretty happy with it, but might lower it in the future a tad bit. \r\n\r\n**Cap SS / WS-23** - Obvious Soda Feel, these can be adjusted to however you feel like - but I highly suggest keeping it a tad sweet for this one. \r\n\r\nI am pretty happy with this current recipe and find it pretty damn good. It can be vaped right off the bat, but i noticed that things really start to blend together after 3 or so days.\r\n\r\n",

      "text": "This was excellent off the shake. Vibrant, crisp, refreshing; all the things you want in a **lemon-lime** soda w/ a hint of blueberry. For me the real magic happened on day 4 when the blueberry finally seemed to become the star of the show and dammit, I wish I'd actually paid attention the the recommended steep. I would have had more than 3ml left when it became, possibly, one of my favorite recipes to feature blueberry. And, to top it off, the recipe manages to be simple, yet clever, and entirely accurate to the name--about as rare as me mixing the same recipe again... which I'm going to do now."
