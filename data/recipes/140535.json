    "description": "My first recipe here folks so be gentle:) O-rangz is one of my favorites, but a 30ml bottle would barely last me a day so I got to work. After several attempts I feel I've created something at least as good as the original, if not better - certainly worth sharing with the mixing world. There are several Fruit Loops style recipes out there but this one is fairly simple and really tasty!\r\n\r\nThe TPA Fruit Circles does most of the work of course, but it needs something extra for just the right amount of sweetness and volume, hence the CAP Vanilla Custard and TPA Sweet Cream plus a touch of CAP Super Sweet because sweetness! In another version, I tried FA Lemon Sicily for the lemon, but found it just a bit too tangy. I'm a big fan of Capella and TPA obviously, but I feel this recipe is forgiving enough that you could sub some other brands in, except for TPA Fruit Circles - it's the best there is at the time of writing this IMO.\r\n\r\n75% VG - Pretty good off the shake, 2 weeks is better if you have the patience:)",
