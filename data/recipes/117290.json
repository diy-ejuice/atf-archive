    "description": "As fall sweeps in, apple is my go to comfort vape. Exploring an apple base, my favorite is clearly Fuji and LA at 2:1 ratio. When other flavors are layered, I find that tweaking needs to happen to boost the apple and how the flavors play so I decided to play with some different bases to keep it simple. One experiment came to be a nice subtle balance for me with the addition of Bourbon. I never did try it with any others and you may find that they work better, differently and more to your liking. Here's a nice, simple, light vape that allows room for growth and play. Enjoy! (Fuji needs 3 days min to meld with the LA and settle IMO. I had this from then to after a two month steep and enjoyed it as it mellowed. YMMV)",
