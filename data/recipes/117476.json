    "description": "An intensely creamy creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e cheesecake - decadently rich & luscious.\r\n\r\nBased on my custard stone and Tootall\u2019s 3-2-1 Creme Brulee and follow up Yummy Classic, I present my interpretation of the doubly-delicious Yummy Classic on steroids, and then some!!\r\n\r\nThe moment I picked up INW Yes, We Cheesecake I knew that they created a winner. This is an immensely creamy, fresh out the oven, European style baked cheesecake which, I am certain, will be the new gold standard for Cheesecake flavours. Period. \r\nThis is a Philadelphia style cream cheese set atop a delishious, delicate graham style base, perfectly balanced.\r\n\r\nThe 3-2-1 Creme Brulee needs no introduction and combined with the Cheesecake, results in next level oral pleasure...\r\n\r\nYou can absolutely not substitute anything in this recipe with the exception of the Shisha Vanilla with your favorite vanilla.\r\n\r\nThis baby shines after 5 or 6 days, thanks to the wizardry at Inawera... \r\n",

Do Not Substitute w\/ VT Creme Brulee! \ud83d\ude20 It just seems to fall short and possibly makes a 5 \ud83c\udf1f recipe about a 3 \ud83c\udf1f... That being said I'm gonna give it 4 and don't do what I did... IT JUST DON'T WORK HERE. "

I've said it before and its been rather consistent that inw custard isnt very good to me.  Several recipes have fell short in my book because of that note I get.  But ruderudi I held onto it cuz I knew you would come to the rescue.  Nice smooth rich cheesecake that won't go to waste!"
