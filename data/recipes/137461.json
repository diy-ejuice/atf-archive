Maybe lowering the Cap SB and cream and adding a more syrupy SB such as INW Shisha Strawberry could help as well. &#xD;\n&#xD;\nEdit: I originally gave this 4 stars after trying it after a week steep, but now after 3 weeks steep it is definitely better all the notes I didnâ€™t like from SB have faded out.
