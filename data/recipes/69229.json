      "text": "Probably the richest, thickest, most savory vape I've ever had.  3% pistachio makes it almost seem genuinely salty.  The bottom end of this vape is thick and sweet, yet it has a slightly salty top note.   Excellent recipe, the pistachio really shines, and the pudding base is impeccable. "

      "text": "Sweet, satisfying, and addicting. Mixed without Kentucky Bourbon, as I do not have it. Inhale is a pistachio custard, not very eggy but has a full mouth feel. Exhale is where the sweet pastry comes in with a hint of caramel from the RY4-Double that lingers almost as an aftertaste. Very close to Nobleman by Charlie Nobles or PRy4-U by Enyawreklaw, but this one is my personal favorite recipe for this profile."
