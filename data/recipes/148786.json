  "description": "i did another hops mix, it took a few nights of tinkering and shit, but it turned out nicely and i'm honestly over trying to nitpick some nuances. mix it up if you like green fruit shit or something a bit weird. there wasn't any real thought behind this, i am not trying to replicate anything real, just wanted to add a bunch of shit i like together. here's the amalgamation of that. notes below.\r\n\r\nflv yakima hops - it's at a high percentage here, but don't let that deter you. you'll hardly taste it. it gets buried in all the fruit. what it does at this percentage is create some weird, funky, earthy, dirty depth to the fruits involved. that's about it. if you like pears or apples, this will appeal to you, and the hops will just bring some extra shit to the party.\r\n\r\ninw lime / cap lemon lime - using inw lime here to just bump up the citrus notes from cap lemon lime, while also adding some extra tartness to the mix overall. the use of pear in this mix really sweetens this shit up quick, so the extra boost of bitter/sour from inw lime was necessary. cap lemon lime is just something i ain't used in ages, and i forgot how good it was as a base to recipes such as this. nothing crazy going on with thought process on this.\r\n\r\ntpa pear / fa pear - obviously i've been doing this combination, in different percentages, for a long ass fuckin time. i decided to go opposite to my norm here though, as i wanted that crisp realism from tpa pear to stand up front. i'm just using fa pear in this to add some juiciness to the hops, and help give some dimension to the sweetener. easy.\r\n\r\nfa fuji - at first, i was using inw anton apple in place of fa fuji, however i wasn't getting the apple bite that i wanted from that. granted, i know inw anton is a powerhouse of a flavor, but fa fuji can't be muted as easily by the other flavors. that's pretty much it. i wanted apple notes, this is how i got them to stay in the mix.\r\n\r\ncap super sweet - this is kinda optional. i don't think it's entirely necessary, but i think that it does help negate some of the offensive notes you usually can pick up from yakima hops. without the super sweet, i was noticing just a touch of unpleasant vegetal flavor on the back end of this mix. it seems that adding the super sweet prevented that. and hey, i'm a cuck now that likes using sweeteners.\r\n\r\nsteep time - this is really good day one, i honestly think it's best off a shake. everything stays fairly separated and it feels brighter off the shake. it's still solid after a few days, i haven't had a bottle last longer than three days, so i can't say much about its longevity. but whatever. mix it in smaller batches, vape it quick.\r\n\r\nalright that's it. mix it if you want or don't. i haven't dropped anything new in a minute and i like this one so fuck it. enjoy.",
