  "description": "I know this is far from a groundbreaking recipe, but it is totally delicious and I have not been able to put it down.\r\nAll the credit for the strawberry flavoring goes to ID10T for creating his \"Holy Trinity Strawberry combination\"\r\nAlthough it is a simple recipe, it has the perfect balance of flavorings IMO\r\n\r\nFA Zeppola gives the fried donut flavor and contributes to the doughiness of the donut \r\nTPA Frosted Donut also contributes to the donut, as well as adding a powdered sugar feel to the mix\r\nFA Meringue and Cap Vanilla whipped cream create a nice light fluffy cream \r\nFA Red Touch Strawberry, INW Shisha Strawberry and JF Strawberry sweet combination created by Dave (ID10T) is just a dam tasty strawberry combination that really nails the strawberry profile\r\nCAP Super sweet at .25% just helps keep these amazing flavors on your pallet.\r\nThis has easily become an ADV for me\r\nRecommend a minimum of 7 days to start to taste the donut. As a shake and vape, you will be able to enjoy the strawberry combination, the donut and creams just take a little longer to really come thru to complete the donut.",

Your usage of Id1ot's strawberry trinity is fantastic here, and oddly enough in my experience heavy profiles like donuts and custards amplify strawberry more than any other, so you get a really upfront strawberry profile here that I personally haven't even been able to recreate in other mixes. None of them have tasted as sweet, gooey, and tart as this. The donut base is great, sometimes a bit doughy depending on the atty, but that's not unwelcome. Delicious  stuff, I love it. My girlfriend loves it. So thank you :)"
