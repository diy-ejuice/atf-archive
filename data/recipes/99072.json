            "text": "It's a nice juicy vape and just like ID10-T says you shouldn't think of a real life counter part. But it's juicy and reminds of a tropical drink with the mango sitting on top. It's easy to vape and the taste seems to linger a little bit. Love it. I subbed Sweetness for supersweet at 0.25 as to me it's sweet enough at that level. Steep at 3 days seems to be enough, but it evolves a little bit more if you let it sit for 5 days. "

            "text": "I'm in the same party as ID10-T in that I too dislike CAP Sweet Mango by itself and in most recipes, however, I believe Wayne pulled this recipe off quite well. The tangerine and guava are very pleasant and seem to distract somewhat from that overripe funk that sweet mango has going on. Its very nicely balanced although a bit heavy handed with the mango if you are using a high wattage dropper, as I noticed the mango flavor disappearing after the first 10 or 15 mins of vaping this. I tried this with 1.5% of WS-23 and it was very nice and juicy still. Definitely mix this if you are into tropical\/mango recipes."

            "text": "I think you have to let go of the idea that this is supposed to taste like anything to really appreciate it. Is it a realistic mango or mango juice? No, everything here is a bit artificial and candyish. Is it a mango candy? Not quite, it's a little bit too much like an *almost* overripe fruit, got just a bit too much funk on it, to taste like any kind of candy I've ever known, and the tangerine stands out quite a bit. But if you think of it as supposed to taste like a rapidly pinkening orange tropical sunset shared by sweethearts, we have a winner. I get tangerine right up front and on top, separate from the rest, and it wakes up the senses. It's a bit intense after every redrip but calms down more with each drag. The rest of the vape is this a candy sweet yet tropically funky thing that shifts. It briefly starts out more tart and pink, less like citrus and more like underripe berry or slightly sour grape, and then rapidly gains a thicker orange tropical and very sweet sweetness that's almost like chewing on a juicy tropical mostly mango bubblegum. I dig this, and this is coming from someone who actually hates CAP Sweet Mango standalone and in other mixes at such a high %, because I think it tastes like overripe, bordering on rotten, fruit. It seems that while tangerine stays separate, the tarter part of Sweet Guava does a great job of cleaning that mess up. If so, it's another concentrate to add to the list of things that can do that (CAP Jelly Candy also seems to help with this, absorbing that overripeness like a sin eater). Cantaloupe might be helping as well, I don't know. I don't taste a distinct cantaloupe here, just a juicer body that I don't think can be accounted for by the other ingredients. It manages to be both thick and juicy and avoid that funny sort of dryness that vaping too much CAP Sweet Mango for too long will give you, that cotton candy type of dryness. I want to mix it again with some coolant added to see if it can help with the way something this sweet gets to be a bit much in the summer heat (it's in the upper 90s here and it's not even June yet! that makes things cloying that wouldn't be in cooler weather). Can't be sure that it won't water down the vape and ruin that thick juicy juicy, but there's only one way to find out. "
