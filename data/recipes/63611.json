  "name": "Sweet Potato Pie",
  "description": "This was a challenge that Shakenvape007, aka, David and myself agreed to test each other. One a pumpkin Pie ( https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/63776#i_hate_pumpkin_pie_by_shakenvape007 ), the other a Sweet Potato Pie. We will let you be the judge.\r\n\r\nSweet Potato Pie! With Fall in the air and the holidays approaching, it's time to release some seasonal blends. Many mixers will probably be releasing their seasonal vapes and I'm sure there will be plenty of pumpkin ejuices to choose from. I wanted to do something a bit different with pumpkin and see if I could bend HS Pumpkin Pie into a sweet potato pie. Not sure if this is a southern thing but, around the holidays instead of pumpkin pies, many of us make sweet potato pies. It's hard to tell the difference if you don't know which is which, but they do have their subtle differences.\r\n\r\nThe sweet potato:   A sweet potato pie, to me, has more of a richer, almost nutty, buttery note. Perhaps the \"nutty\" note comes from the skin of the sweet potato. If you've ever noticed the skin of a baked sweet potato, the essence of the skin gets drawn into the fleshy inner part and can color the orange a darker color. This is what gives it a richer, \"nutty\", almost caramel taste. To bend the HS Pumpkin Pie into that flavor, I introduced TPA RY4 Double. It has that slightly burnt caramel, leafy aroma that bends the HS Pumpkin Pie nicely into that rich, creamy, sweet potato pie that everyone enjoys. I also added CAP Cinnamon Danish Swirl to add that spice associated with Fall seasonal vapes. You may wonder why I didn't use a pumpkin spice, well, for one, I don't care for that nutmeg flavor in most pumpkin spices and adding a pumpkin spice may have counter-acted the bend into a sweet potato pie.\r\n\r\nThe crust:  Over the last few months I have been testing Wonder Flavours entire line. And while most are pretty good, they seem to not be accurate to what they are labeled as. However, they are still very useful. As I was testing WF Caramel Rice Crispy Treats, I found that it did not taste like the profile suggests. I instead got a moist, but somewhat, flaky, pumpkin pie crust. Now everyone's palate is different, but that's what I wrote down in my flavor notes and it was very helpful with this recipe. I also used CAP Cinnamon Danish Swirl to bolster the crust just a bit adding a slight more pastry that the WF Caramel Rice Crispy Treats lacked. \r\n\r\nThe topping:  With every sweet potato pie there is always a topping. Some will treat it as a pumpkin pie and top it with Cool Whip or whipping cream. The way I like to top my sweet potato pie is with toasted marshmallows. TPA Toasted Marshmallow was the obvious choice for that note. I added .13% of CAP Super Sweet to sweeten things up a bit. You may want to increase the Super Sweet to .25% if you're looking for more sweetness. \r\n\r\nCan be a shake and vape but is best after a 3 day steep.\r\nVisit Freedom To Mix on Discord https://discord.gg/SmSc8Ef\r\nVisit Freedom To Mix on FaceBook https://www.facebook.com/groups/415341418920740/ \r\n\r\nPlease comment, mix, and or rate,....it makes us all better mixers.

That Hs pumpkin does a great job selling that smooth silky texture, and the bakery pie underneath is layered in perfectly. Sweetness and everythin is on point. Ill be mixing another bottle of this to vape on Thanksgiving night!"

      "text": "Ok let's review this. One of the things that Folkart states in the description of the recipe is that he wants to be able to make a Sweet Potato Pie recipe that is distinguishable from pumpkin pie. This is a tall order, as trying to separate subtle accents from similar profiles is extremely difficult. Before we answer that question, I want to state that I absolutely love this recipe. It's just delicious and its flavor has thrown me into a pile of red hued leaves. The level of autumn-ness this recipe contains is so fun and nostalgic. It's layered very well. You can taste the bakery layer on the bottom with the squishy sweet potato sprinkled with cinnamon layer in the middle holding everything together. Topping it off with a buttery sweetness that's almost like a glaze. Unfortunately, I don't get much of a baked marshmallow layer on top. In fact, that's the only point of contention I have. It seems as if the toasted marshmallow is a bit hidden and isn't doing much for the recipe other than getting in the way of the great sweet potato filling he's built. The choice of ingredients here is really key to this recipes success, though. Using HS Pumpkin Pie is the best move for these profiles (I haven't found a pumpkin flavor as good yet), and then using WF Caramel Rice Crispy as the base and bender to the pumpkin. The RY4 double acts as almost a richness inducer, giving a touch of a smokey caramelization to the pie. The CAP CDS does what it does best and that's add a soft cinnamon flavor to the mix while not detracting any of the other profiles. Now to answer the question. Did Folkart create enough distinction to call this recipe Sweet Potato rather than Pumpkin? For the most part, I think he did. Adding those deeper caramels and brown sugars does a good job of playing that role and the use of RY4 Double was smart. I'm sure if I vaped this recipe without seeing the ingredients, I'd be able to agree it was sweet potato rather than pumpkin. However, the profiles are so close together I would've loved a bit more distincition to completely win me over on sweet potato. Overall the recipe is fun, delicious, nostalgic, and impressive. I just wish there was a bit more authenticity to the flavor profile to really drive home that \"sweet potato\", with a bit more vibrancy to the flavor. DEFINITELY a recipe you want to mix up if you're planning on trying to tackle this difficult profile. SCORE: 4.5 / 5 "
