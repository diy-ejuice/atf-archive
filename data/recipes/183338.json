  "description": "Here we have a fairly simple and straight forward Nutty Custard Profile.\r\nI absolutely love Custard and wanted to combine my all time favorite nut into the mix, the all mighty Pistachio!\r\n(TPA) Bavarian Cream 1% + (INW) Biscuit 1% + (FA) Custard Premium 2%, pulls together to create an extremely luscious, rich, and decadent Custard.\r\n(TPA) Pistachio 4% produces a nice creamy nutty note, and when paired together with (FLV) Pistachio at 1% adds the textural top note to the nut that clearly makes it a distinct Pistachio.\r\nNow by adding (TPA) Ry4 Double 4% is something I felt was crucial to give the recipe a nice deep aroma, but also add some slight Vanilla & dark Caramel notes to give the impression as if the desert was finished off with a light brush of smoke. \r\nThis is great off the shake, and fantastic after 3 days! However, if you can hold out for a couple weeks?... Wowza!! :)\r\n\r\nI hope you enjoy this one as much as I do!\r\nHAPPY MIXING, & HAPPY VAPING!!!",
