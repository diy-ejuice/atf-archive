  "description": "Simple 3, 2, 1 mix of an RY4.  You might ask, \"Why would you make this if you've already got Holy Holy Grail RY4?\"  My answer is simple.  Because Cardinal . . . that's why.  Also, I've been neglecting JF RY4 Double and FLV Milk and Honey and wanted to try my hand at simplicity.  At only 6% this is a surprisingly bold RY4 . . . extremely thick and rich. Mixed it up last night (60vg/40pg) . . . filled up the Savour with it this morning.  It goes great with coffee.",

      "text": "This seems like great example of what can be done with JF RY4 Double that makes it superior-tasting, if not more versatile, than its TFA counterpart . Full-flavored and dark vanilla-forward, some rich caramel, and a thick, satisfying cream, with a solid hit of sharper toasty tobacco notes tightening up the finish. There’s a lot going on in this deceptively simple recipe, because all to JF RY4 Dub and FLV Milk &amp; Honey complexities come though. I kind of expected that much Holy Vanilla to smother them but it doesn’t, it just makes it a caramel-vanilla-tobacco. Love this.  "
