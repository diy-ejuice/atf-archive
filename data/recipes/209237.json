  "name": "CORN BREAD PUDDING 2.0 CLONE/REMIXED",
  "description": "my first corn bread pudding recipe is definitely good and taste very similar to the real one after a good steep but the new 2.0 is A bit more spot on i feel they definitely aren’t using OOO corn bread even tho it is a very good ingredient to use . and I also felt that they were using a lot of cheesecake graham crust . So 3.5% seemed right and with a little vanilla pudding to thicken it up . I stayed away from the custard this time as Wayne said the custard are used to last time seemed a little oily . i put 1% AP this time instead of 0.75% since I’m not using OOO corn bread this time to give it a bit more “corn” flavor and using kettle corn at 3% with that makes a perfect corn taste . i’m also using TPA Maple syrup instead of FA this time just to switch it up i’m not sure which one they’re actually using to be honest . you can use FA as a sub witch is in my original clone . And last but not least i’m using Flavor west yellow cake to give it some bready-ness .  And at 1.5% it seemed just right . You can use super sweet all the way up to 1% , I like mine any where from 0.5% to 0.75% . I am planning on posting my blueberry version also in this form too . i will also be making a strawberry one for both clones 1.0 and 2.0. ",
