  "description": "This is a nice Sweet  Melon  based vape Recipe. The Purilium watermelon is very candy like and a great flavor on its own. FA watermelon to me gives more of that authentic watermelon taste. FLV wild melons adds a bit more of all melon flavor without being to overpowering at .75%. Added the Vanilla swirl to give it some creaminess as well as juiciness so the recipe is not dry. The FA Custard adds just a bit of citrus to the mix and really blend well with these flavors. No added sweetness is necessary as ITS ALREADY PRETTY SWEET. Good off the Shake steep 3 days for best results. \r\n",
