  "description": "Slow mulled Elderflower Cider with hints of citrus and spice.\r\n\r\nApple Cider/Liquid Amber: This is the apple cider base. Apple cider provides some of the sweetness and cider taste where liquid amber just adds that \"fermented\" notes to finish it off\r\n\r\nApple Filling/Rich Cinnamon: This is some of the mulling taste. The apple filling gives a deep, cooked apple and spice, the rich cinnamon adds to the mulled notes\r\n\r\nElderflower: This is the hidden gem. It plays very well with the orange and mandarin to give a slightly floral hint. Its a hidden star for sure\r\n\r\nOrange/Mandarin: This is another depth of flavor in the mulling. It adds a nice citrusy note to the mix",

      "text": "I found this one to be a little harsh to the extent that it was almost hard to vape. It’s the oranges, especially FA Orange. Also, while orange belongs in a mulling with spice scenario, this seems really orange-forward to the extent that the balance is off. It’s almost like a 50/50 orange juice/cider combination, which is a bit weird. It seems like a easy fix for an otherwise nice elderflower-laced apple cider: Swap out the FA Orange and FA Mandarin for either INW Shisha Punch or FLV Back Bar Bitters for that orange-peel and spice flavor or, if those extra spice notes are unwanted (not sure why they would be in this scenario), some VT Orange Marmalade might do the trick. &#xD;\n"
