  "description": "A decadent smooth rum custard, with a light orange cake accent. \r\n\r\n*** flavourart  custard premium ***\r\n\r\nDefinitely a must have custard!! \r\nSuitable substitution would be the original flavourart Custard with .5% TFA butter. It's going to get you close until you can pick this one up. I had to order mine from across the pond. \r\n\r\nhttps://flavourart.com/en/store/flavors/emotions/custard-premium-flavor/\r\n\r\nTraditionally I do an extensive right up, but this has really been getting in the way of me releasing content.\r\n\r\n I think this is a very straightforward recipe custard rum yummy. The one thing you might be asking yourself why pumpkin pie. Here I use it to boost the texture and creaminess of the already delicious custard base. \r\n\r\n Happy holidays everybody I hope you enjoy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
