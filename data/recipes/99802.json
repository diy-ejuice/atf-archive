    "description": "**Highgarden Ice Cream**\r\n&nbsp;\r\n**Description:**\r\nI recently had this bourbon based rose cocktail that was fantastic. When I saw this flavor profile I got excited. I wanted to try to convert that cocktail into an ice cream vape, while keeping it a simple recipe just with that adult element added to it. Some of you know I make alcoholic ice cream in real life for fun. I totally intend to make this in real ice cream form at some point soon now.\r\n&nbsp;\r\nThe vape is sweet, not overly floral, and a nice hint of booze. ",
