  "description": "Alright so let me preface with this.....it's a weird flavor that I'm probably crazy for trying to create. Again its weird and odd, but came out good enough that I thought I should share it with the world.\r\n\r\nIt's a sweet potato and brown sugar chip covered in dark chocolate.\r\n\r\nThe chip - after getting FLV Yam in my first thought after tasting was those new sweet potato and brown sugar Sun Chips, so I figured why the hell not. At 1% it seemed to be enough to get sweet potato but not overtake everything into sweet starch. It needed help so CAP Cereal 27 at 2.5% adds some grain to it, and INW Biscuit at 0.5% for a bit of crunch. Add a little TFA Brown Sugar Extra and a touch of FA Caramel and BOOM! Sweet potato and brown sugar chips.\r\n\r\nThe chocolate - I wanted a dark chocolate for my coating and HS Australian Chocolate and I have a lot of history so it was my go to, but a little FLV Milk Chocolate keeps it from going dry and chalky. I feel the tiny bit of FA Caramel helps to bridge the chip and the chocolate a bit as well.\r\n\r\nAs far as steep? Shit I can't really answer that. I mixed this up and stayed far away from it until I got ballsy enough to try it. It's had about 3 weeks and I'd say that's plenty. I'm sure you can get by with a week steep. Good luck and god speed.\r\n\r\nName inspired by the band The Dali Thundering Concept.",
