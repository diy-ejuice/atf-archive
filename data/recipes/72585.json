  "description": "I was working on a different profile for the upcoming \"remix month\" and happened to have FLV Mango and Peach on the desk next to the bottles of flavorings I was working with. Thought it would be an interesting combo. I am not going to break the flavors down here, read this as not even pretending to have a goal in mind with this, I thought it would be interesting and good, and it is ;) \r\n I have only done two versions of this one just as is and one with .3% Super Sweet. I really like both versions. This version is a bit more interesting in that as you change your wattage, airflow different aspects of it will shine through. The version with super sweet seems to be a bit more in your face but more linear losing a bit of it's complexity.\r\n\r\nHave a mix, have a vape, enjoy ",

The way they come together here is very interesting; I get individual aspects of mango/peach and strawberry/mixed berry that are intertwined without being combined and nothing remotely unpleasant or out of place.
