    "description": "My attempt at a strawberry, peach, lemonade! The goal was to make a delicious summertime vape during the warm weather.  I like to mix 120ml of this at a time, and vape through the steep.  It starts very strong on the strawberry and lemon when fresh.  As I vape through the bottle, it becomes very peach forward. Overall, it feels very fresh the whole way through.  I have been vaping this and tweaking this recipe since about April, and I think I am comfortable enough to share it for the first time!\r\n\r\nSuper Sweet is a necessary addition in this one. It really brightens this mix up.  Without it, all of the notes are weak.  The amount is up to you; I'd mix anywhere between 0.25% and 1%\r\n\r\nEDIT 11\/13\/20: Removed Marshmallow from this mix entirely, it really doesn't add much to the overall profile.",
