  "description": "Youâ€™re 13, youâ€™ve walked to the gas station with your hoodlum friends, and you have a major life decision to make: the gross ass Sno-Caps your friends are all getting or the Peachie Oâ€™s you so desire? I trust you made the right choice.\r\n\r\nFLV Peach Gummy is the obvious yet perfect place to start out. FA White Peach is wonderfully bright and helps the sugar coated texture. A bit of TPA Vanilla Swirl pumps up the chewiness and provides body. TPA Dragonfruit helps blend everything together into one smooth, chewy candy. CAP Super Sweet candies up the White Peach top notes.\r\n\r\nShake and vape certified.\r\n\r\nHappy mixing. ðŸ‘½",

Smooth, and juicy peach candy - The small amount of Super Sweet really helps sell this as a candy.&#xD;\n&#xD;\nGood job!"

      "text": "No reviews on this classic? Unbelievable. Chewy peach rings, well balanced flavors. That 0.5% TPA Dragonfruit is absolutely necessary as well, it's such a perfect emulsifier to combine the Vanilla Swirl to the peaches. Without it the flavors stack as opposed to blend, still good though. Easy to mix, easier to love. Mr.B is an absolute wizard, you're only hurting yourself by not trying this. All hail the swirl."
