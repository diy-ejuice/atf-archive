  "description": "This was supposed to be a collaboration with Concrete River. Unfortunately the only adjustment my first version needed was moving VT Fig from .25% to .75%. If you're a strange person that wants to vape a Fig Newton replica, this is your recipe. As much as Concrete would like to say he had nothing to do with this creation, he was the person that introduced and recommended using VT Red Dates. It's used to fill out the inner dimension of our factory-pressed cookies with fruit paste perfectly. If you're a Newton connoisseur you know they're thicker than a snicker, so I used JF Biscuit, CAP Sugar Cookie, and FA Cookie to get you there. Then I added the AP version of cinnamon with FLV Cinnamon Crunch for the tiniest hint of spice in the background. I know that VT Fig is pretty much black licorice in a bottle, but after steeping at .75% I assure you there's no black licorice in these bars. It's essential for accuracy. ",

I have no idea how a Fig Newtons is supposed to taste like, but this tastes like something from my childhood that was probably much like a fig newtons. Pretty good flavor!"
