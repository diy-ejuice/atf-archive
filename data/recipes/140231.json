  "description": "This is a hot YUMMY  mess  - and named after a phrase coined by the most fabulous   @leilani    \r\nOn the inhale you get a  creamy sweet caramel ice cream that transitions to   caramel popcorn  in the  middle and finishes with a  toffee and graham cracker note. \r\nBest on an RDA at 60 - 65 wattts \r\nMade for Mixin in the kitchen popcorn episode \r\n\r\n**Butterschotch ripple** and **Creme Brulee**  create  a thick creamy caramel ripple ice cream.   VT creme brulee is a really nice flavor it has less  burnt dark brown sugar than other brulees and leans more toward a caramel the creme is also less eggy.  FW butterscotch ripple is more of an ice cream  and works well  here \r\n\r\n**kettle corn***  **AP** and **caramel popcorn**  create that cracker jack type of popcorn I wanted here .  caramel popcorn is really bringing the nut notes with some darker sweetness and is light on the popcorn.  The kettle corn brings more of a buttery caramel note.  AP is used for more of that popcorn texture and supports the kettle corn \r\n\r\n**toffee**  is needed to add some depth and supports the finish in this mix along with graham cracker \r\n",
