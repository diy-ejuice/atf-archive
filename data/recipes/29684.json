    "description": "Mallowmars are a treat that I have always loved, but just never got around to mixing before. I love them for the same reason I love marshmallow eggs at Easter. I am a marshmallow junkie. So, where do we start? I started with the cookie, because it is the foundation. The mallowmars cookie is pretty cakey, but not overly sweet. So that called for FA's Cookie, and Capella's Yellow cake. Just the right combination for a really cakey cookie. The next component to tackle is the marshmallow. This is the queen of the ball! No marshmallow would be quite enough, because the marshmallow in this cookie is Big. And fluffy. And Creamy. So I decided on a combo of FA Marshmallow and FA Catalan Cream. Catalan is the natural choice because it is rich and creamy, and has the feel of a marshmallow cream. Last but not least is the chocolate. FA Chocolate fit the bill, and at .5%, it comes in just strong enough to do what it is supposed to. Barely dress that marshmallow, because we can't send the queen out without a dress! This mix requires a 3 week steep, but at the end of the wait, you may just find yourself wishing you made a bigger batch!\r\nEnjoy!",
