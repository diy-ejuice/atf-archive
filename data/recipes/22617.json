  "description": "This is just a straight forward cherry cheesecake. Just an easy recipe that works with most any fruit flavor just swap the cherry and or adjust the amount of fruit but a great cheese cake. This juice is an amazing  shake  and vape but gets even better after a few days of steeping.  On the flavor list they didn't have plain cherry from the flavor apprentice that is what I used not cherry blossoms or cherry extract  it's just a straight  Cherry flavor  from TFA.  I just felt this recipe needed a little sweetener  I don't normally use sweetener but I think this one needed sweetener  to bring this flavor in the  game.",
