YES it does get better, but that's a SNV CUSTARD.&#xD;\nI love it, Sublime, don't let one reviewer get you down.&#xD;\n-Almi'zi&#xD;\nAfter thought: I am thoroughly enjoying this recipe because it removes the weirdness I get from CAP VC in other custard recipes, it's good as a custard, I get it some people like to criticize things and not give credit where credit is due. Saying something is good and giving a 0/5 is a little confusing, but Sublime, keep it up."
