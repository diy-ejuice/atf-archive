  "description": "So this is  a Dr Pepper styled beverage using the spectacular  @alfredpudding  .007 cola mix https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/121307#007_cola_by_alfredpudding cola base .  if you have never made this mix,  you should  - to date It is one of my favorite mixes.  From the minute I tried his mix,  I wanted to try and make a Dr Pepper styled mix -   \r\nwhile Dr Pepper  may have 23 flavors  there are several flavors that I think make it signature :  birch/ sarsaparilla,  almond/ amaretto/Cherry, cardamon and molasses   are the key flavors I wanted to try and pull out \r\n\r\nFLv root beer   to me is one of the best  root beers around and will provide that birch note  I am after \r\nFA almond  provides that sweet almond extract  / amaretto   sweetness  \r\nWF molasiess is a dark syrup sweetness  that works really well with the WF blackcherry jelly bean   together I get  almost a licorice type cherry note \r\nFA cardamon is  not something that you can  notice unless you are really looking for it  but I do find it adds \"something\"   and you notice it when is it not there  on the finish  for sure  \r\nWhile this may not be spot on Dr peper   for some - I think   it is close  and am really enjoying it  \r\n\r\n\r\n",
