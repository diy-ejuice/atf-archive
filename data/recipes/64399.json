  "description": "*A tribute to Fear*\r\n\r\nNot only was this recipe \"not originally created by this mixer,\" it wasn't really created by this mixer at all. It was created by @Fear. Only, it was created by Fear without his knowledge or consent, and after reading this he'll probably file some kind of restraining order or at the very least block me on every form of social media. I'm afraid this might cross the line between flattering and creepily stalkerish.  \r\n\r\nFear has 22 public recipes on ATF to date. Of those, there are only 10 ingredients he's used three or more times. There are only two that he has used five times, **FLV Red Burley** and **INW Shisha Vanilla.** So those two were non-negotiable. He has used Red Burley at an average of ~ 1.75%. His average use % of Shisha Vanilla is around 1.25%, but that went beyond just a playful vanilla accent and created a slight waxiness that went away when I dropped it down to 1%.  \r\n\r\nThere are four flavors he's used four times: **FLV Kentucky Blend**, **FLV Cured Tobacco**, INW Cactus, and CAP Cantaloupe.  Burley and Cured are Tobacco Batman and Tobacco Robin, basically, and obviously Kentucky would work here, too.  I used Fear's average %'s with just a little rounding of those two. \r\n\r\nI've thought about making a Cactus + Tobacco recipe and calling it \"Grasshopper Spit\" but this was not the time or place for that. Cantaloupe + Tobacco was right out, at least for my tastes. That left the things he's used three times so far: TFA Sweetener, INW Shisha Strawberry, **JF Honey Peach,** and OoO Cream Milky. Honey Peach jumped way out in front of that pack in my mind. Yum. But in my experience it needs some help to be well-rounded flavor and not an upside-down, inside-out peach. \r\n\r\nSo we go to the ingredients he's used twice. There are a bunch of those, but **INW Peach** was the clear winner. I started with his average use of 1%, but the brightness of that peach seemed to be getting just a little too weird for me, clashing, I think, with the ashy part of Kentucky Blend. Subsequent versions with it toned down to 0.75% seemed to clean that up. \r\n\r\n*But why?*\r\n\r\nBecause I thought about how @Shyndo is driving himself nuts trying to create a \"tribute to @ConcreteRiver recipe\" as the punishment for losing a head-to-head mix-off against him, and wondered how I'd approach such a task. I also mixed up version 1s of \"tributes\" like this to my friends NotCharlesManson, Philosaphucker, and Kopel. The Lemon-Lime Strawberry Ice Cream Cone needs major work. LA Banana Cream/TFA Kentucky Bourbon/TFA Toasted Marshmallow is a killer combo, until you add a bunch of Cactus to it and it becomes something that just ain't right. Finally, I have an unbalanced bouquet of flowers plus Pink Guava and FLV Cream that needs a lot of love before it will be ready to share. Of the four mixers I wanted to make tributes to, Fear's public body of work was simply the easiest to use this way. You're looking at version 4 with the only tweaks being slight reductions in the two INW ingredients. ",
