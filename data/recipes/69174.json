  "description": "Sweet tea with peach simple syrup. \r\n\r\nyellow peach is a nice soft peach flavor. Great when combined with white peach for its sharper notes at lower percentages. \r\nApricot just to round off the stonefruit.\r\n\r\nSince it is a simple syrup, the peaches are cooked down with sugar which is where the liquid amber along with super sweet to make it sweet and syrupy. \r\n\r\nFa black tea is in the background giving this a nice finish",

      "text": "This is a nice peach tea mix, for mypersonal taste the yellow peach is a tad bit overpowering of the white peach. The apricot does help to blend the two peaches to some degree. This would be a five star for me if it didn't say black tea background. The tea for me is the main note I'm getting. I will mix again but will most likely drop the black tea to 2% and up the white peach some. Thanks for this nice recipe."
