  "description": "This was based on a recipe i found on line that caught my attention and I thought lets give it a go. On the inhale you get a sweet vanilla soft cookie that transitions to a nutty, caramel popcorn, graham cracker finish. it is good at 3 days but the popcorn builds over time and comes out at 7 days . best at around 60 - 65 watts .    \r\n\r\nFeel free to add additional sweetner if you want that commercial feel  - as this is a in your face commercial style mix and  not meant to have alot of subtly -  but the cake batter dip provides alot of sweetness that comes out over 3 - 5 days.   \r\n\r\nThis was made for daytime frank Mixin in the kitchen episode n popcorn \r\n\r\n**caramel popcorn, AP** and **kettle Corn** create the popcorn base. it tends to grow a bit. The Caramel popcorn and peanut is very light on the popcorn but has a really nice peanut finish . Kettle corn has a nice buttery sweet note that I am using here along with AP to provide more of a popcorn note. \"**NOTE** AP is not necessary but does support the popcorn and cookie in this mix. \r\n\r\n**cake batter** adds some top note sweetness and body to the mix to contrast some of the darker notes\r\n\r\n**Graham cracker and Sugar cookie** creates a really nicely balanced cookie with a soft center and slightly darker baked crisp notes from the Graham cracker. \r\n\r\n**caramel toffee** is a nice dark caramel note that holds up in this mix and comes though at the finish \r\n\r\n**vanilla cheesecake custard** sits a bit on top and adds some vanilla top notes and needed creaminess to this mix",
