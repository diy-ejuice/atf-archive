  "description": "This recipe was inspired by a desert I had a while back. The dish had marshmallows, cream cheese, and pineapple. I thought it would make a great profile to replicate. Not a complex recipe but very delicious. Not much to mention on flavor notes, pretty self explanatory....just a nice creamy, marshmallow, pineapple vape. Can be a Shake n Vape but only gets better with time. Suggested steep time, 3 days. This is a first version. I normally post my first versions of recipes and keep 2nd or 3rd versions private for commercial purposes. MaxVG ....Enjoy :)",
