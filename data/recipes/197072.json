  "description": "There's this incredible juice I love called Kookie Krunch, and when I stopped vaping pre-made juice it was the first recipe I wanted to recreate.  This one is so close to the mark, that I actually like it better than the original.  It's that cookie cereal I loved put into a bottle.  Take it for a test run and maybe you'll find you love it just as much as I do.  This is one of my ADV, maybe it will be yours. ",
