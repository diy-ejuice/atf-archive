    "description": "*\"Jill's Kiss(Violet Green Tea Ice Cream)\"*\r\n  \r\n\r\n**DESCRIPTION**\r\n  \r\n*She's beautiful, she's exciting, and she's totally clueless to how you truly feel about her. Her name is Jill. And this is what it would taste like to finally kiss her...*\r\n\r\n  \r\n**NOTES:**\r\n  \r\n  \r\n*TFA VBIC was used instead of Capella because I wanted vanilla creaminess. FA Vienna Cream was added more for its' texture than its' vanilla.*\r\n  \r\n*FW White Chocolate & TFA Vanilla Swirl add an extra creamy & thick layer to the ice cream. Vanilla Swirl can't be beat when added to VBIC. This isn't Breyer's after all.*\r\n  \r\n*FA Violet is fantastic and a very underused flavor. It's absolutely delicious with a floral backnote.  (This represents the soft petal-like quality of her lips).*\r\n\r\n*FE Green Tea is THE best representation of Matcha Green Tea ever created!. No other brand's concentrate would have pulled off this sensual and intriguing combination like Flavor Express!*\r\n\r\n*... and after that first kiss, her sweetness lingers. Enter Erythritol.*\r\n  \r\n\r\n **I love this as a shake 'n vape, though it really gets creamy after 2-3 days. And even creamier after 7 days. Also, I purposely omitted adding Koolada or Polar Ice, but feel free to add either if you prefer. I found the coolness to be too much of a distraction to the delicate flavor balance of this mix.**\r\n\r\n#EJUICEMAKERS",
