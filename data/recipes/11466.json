  "description": "I was making juice one night and was running low on flavors and decided to make something to use them up. I thought why not make something that would just use them all up at once. It was like 3am and I needed to get to bed.  So Shadow's Milk was created.  Oh well I love it.  Since this one is heavy on the creams I mix this one until frothy then I let it sit, until it's clear, then I mix until it is frothy again.  Then I heat in the baby bottle warmer for 30 minutes.  Then I let this one sit for 2 weeks.",
