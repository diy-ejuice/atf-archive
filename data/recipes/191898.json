    "description": "I love a rich, creamy, marshmallow vape and this to me works perfectly for that.  Normally I wouldn't push milky undertone this high but it needed it in this recipe.  All these ingredients work in harmony together to make a very fluffy vanilla forward marshmallow mix.  Give it a try.",

            "text": "immediately after mixing I'm get that fluffy mouthfeel I want in a marshmallow vape.  The marshmallow note is present, and I don't taste coconut, which I don't want in my marshmallow.  Just the right amount of sweet and the flavors are already well blended.  I think the milky undertones work beautifully here. I can't wait to see how this develops in the next week... if I can leave it alone for that long.  I like it NOW.  4 stars until I revisit it when a 7-day steep is over.  Good job! "
