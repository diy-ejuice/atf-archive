    "description": "For this recipe, I used **FLV Mango**, definitely one of my favorite, for a realistic mouth feel mango.   \r\nThis creates a delicious creamy Mango forward smoothie.  Mixed Berry taste on the back end of vape.  \r\nFeel free to add sweetener to your liking.\r\nEnjoy.   \r\nThis is delicious off the shake; however, better after 3 days.  ",

            "text": "Weird thing is I seriously had all of these flavors sitting on my desk. This one is pretty simple which that's how I mix now a days\"quick and easy\".. Well layered. The mango is the body of the vape that sits right in the center of the vape. The berry and the boysenberry combo work together at the top and the strawberry cream does play a duel role here. I do get the strawberry at the bottom and the cream fills out the smoothie base. However I do get the citrus notes from the smoothie base  right at the mid range and follow through to the end. That is expected and I know that after the 3 day suggested steep they will fade. As far as sweetness goes I see no reason to add any. The sweetness is already there as it sits spot on to the point where it borderlines candy but the tartness from citrus helps tame it making it just sweet enough but not overwhelming.  The experience for me on this one is a nice light fruit,  sweet yet tart refreshing vape that is enjoyable in the warm weather. Well done. "
