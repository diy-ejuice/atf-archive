    "description": "This is one of my first recipes that I was genuinely happy with. Then INW Yes, We Cheesecake came along, and I became ecstatic, and this recipe became one of my ADVs. This is a lemon meringue cheesecake where the lemon curd and meringue are reminiscent of the pies my grandmother used to make. At the same time, it  presents the mouthfeel and the rich creaminess you get from a traditional cheesecake recipe. I am fairly new to mixing and would love any feedback that the community might have to offer. Please mix, share, and enjoy.",

It's amazing off the shake as a cheesecake with a lemon meringue on top and turns into a smooth, rich, creamy cheesecake filling with lemon meringue mixed into it a week in. To be fair though, only about 2 mL out of 30 made it to the week mark "

            "text": "Gotta say, this is definitely better after a steep. Off a shake, it's a cheesecake that was drowned in lemon juice, but after a steep, holy damn! Thick AF cheesecake with a very subtle lemon note. Not overpowering, just dense.. Personally, I don't get that much meringue and it's missing a crust, so I can't quite consider it a lemon meringue pie. This is more a of just the cheesecake filling. I think I've been spoiled by the Lemon Tart Remix. I'd suggest finding a way to incorporate a crust and a chalkyish meringue note. Although, I wish I had more bottles to make a bigger size. Great job. "
