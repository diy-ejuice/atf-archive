  "name": "Mixin Vixens - Jarvis - Caramel Bourbon Ice Cream",
  "description": "My initial mix up of this week's recipe turned out poorly so I had to remix it without getting the benefit of a few weeks of steeping like the first version got. This has been steeping now for 8 days, and has turned out lovely and was actually pretty good off the shake, though the creamy flavors have started to shine through now that it has had a bit of steep time.  I would say this needs about 2 weeks steeping, maybe 3 to be fully stabilized, but if you're a mix and shake vaper this will work, but maybe mix up a big bottle or a second batch to allow one to steep as well.  \r\n\r\nThe ice cream layer in this recipe is made up of Delosi's Vanilla Cream and FA Vienna Cream.  These creams are actually DAAP free, so I did have to use a few other ingredients to DAAP it up a bit for you DAAP lovers.  The FLV Cream adds a bit of Diacetyl, and the WF Caramel Butter definitely has some level of DAAP in it that adds to the overall thickness of the ice cream flavor.  The Caramel is meant to be mixed into the ice cream, as it is a caramel ice cream so there shouldn't be much in the way of separation in these layers, but should be blended all into one. \r\n\r\nAged Bourbon Cream is the drizzle that tops this ice cream, as I thought it would be something a bit different and contrasting to the caramel notes. And instead of adding yet another cream to add to the whipped cream layer, I just kind of ignored the whipped cream as I felt it would get lost in the ice cream notes.  I used FA Nut Mix over the other types of nuts because I know this flavor gives a good slight nut note when used at a low percentage and it wouldn't overpower the other flavors making it a nut ice cream rather than just a topping. Since I had poor results trying to get a toffee pecan type of note in the first attempt, I just settled for a hint of nut to go in there. \r\n\r\n",
