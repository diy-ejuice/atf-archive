    "description": "inspired by VapeTasia\u2019s Killer Kustard strawberry i would say it taste pretty damn similar . But that\u2019s kinda what i was going for but i\u2019m not going to name this as a clone . But if you do you like their strawberry kustard I would highly recommend mixing this up I would give it about a month steep for its best potential but surprisingly it is a good shaking VAPE. If you do not have flavor west cotton candy you can use any other cotton candy by any other vendor because most of them are just EM which sweetens custard so you do not need sweetener .  Now I prefer flavor West Cotton Candy\/EM because I do believe it has a slight edge of flavor in it compared to other EM\u2019s But if you don\u2019t have it just sub it And I\u2019m sure you can sub the strawberry for any strawberry you would like depending on what strawberry use I would use anywhere from 4% to 6% but with this particular strawberry I am using I would stick with 4% and I\u2019m sure you can sub the strawberry for any strawberry you would like depending on what strawberry use I would use anywhere from 4% to 6% but with this particular strawberry I am using I would stick with 4%. I was trying to go to the a cappella route which I did successfully other than the EM\/cotton candy by flavor west. for all you who love my recipes sorry I haven\u2019t been posting lately I\u2019ve been really busy but I\u2019m back on the mixing spot and if we need to know anything or would like any advice just hit my inbox on here or if you know my Facebook You can reach me there",
