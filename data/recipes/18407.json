    "description": "A nice thick creamy apple cinnamon cake.\r\n\r\nCAP Cinnamon Danish Swirl. Used it at a lower percent to give it a nice smooth cinnamon flavor like apple jacks cereal\r\n\r\nJF Fuji. Fuji goes very well with cinnamon danish swirl to give it that apple jacks feel to it. I like it at 1.25% but could be bumped up to 1.50% if you want more apple.\r\n\r\nTPA Strawberry Ripe.  Works really well in this very smooth and adds a little sweetness to the mix.\r\n\r\nTPA Vanilla Cupcake. Cupcake thickens up the cake a little more and adds to the yellow cake.\r\n\r\nFA Vienna Cream. Used it to add some creaminess to the cake.\r\n\r\nJF Yellow Cake. Has a very nice cake feel and taste to it.\r\n\r\nSteep Time - 3 To 5 Days",
