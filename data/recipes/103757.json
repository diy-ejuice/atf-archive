Oh and i think i nailed the profile. Let me know whether you think i did??  I took my Rubble Rock and some of id10ts lucky charms marshmallows and here it is a fruity pebbles with marshmallows in milk. It doesnt get much better than that.. I am sharing this recipe  after a 1 week steep but i haven't been able to put it down since day 3 i really like it. You may want to boost the fruits depending on how long you want to steep this recipe. By boost i mean .25% for lemon meringue pie, blueberry, and mandarin  but i havent needed to boost them myself but i do know from mixing rubble rock that you can do it if you need to. Other than that it is what it is a cereal vape enjoy!!!\r\n\r\nThanks to id10t for making his lucky charms recipe i thoroughly enjoyed using your marshmallow lol.\r\n\r\n\r\nI used .35% Flavorah sweetness . Use whatever sweetener you prefer. Or dont use any at all your call.",

I loved Rubble Rock and this one was really great too. If you dig cereals give this a shot!"
