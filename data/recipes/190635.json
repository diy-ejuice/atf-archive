    "description": "First attempt, shake and vape. See my note below. \r\n\r\nCTC by FLV is almost a good enough single flavor. I used that for most of the cinnamon, it creates the grain, and a small amount of cream \u2014 so a random cream base was made and used to help boost the milk. Overall happy with my first recipe, a simple one, after mixing others since 2016! Nothing perfect but it\u2019s mine!",
