  "description": "Needed a Boo Berry vape - one that tastes as close as possible to what I remember from too many years back. Try #1 was up around 20% flavours, tasted good - on the right track. So this is a scale back plus added in some super sweet. \r\n\r\nCereal: FW Cake (yellow),  TPA Vanilla Cupcake, AP and Hazelnut is my attempt at the cereal component. My previous recipe was pretty good but I feel the cereal is not 100% there yet.\r\n\r\nMilk: Bavarian Cream, Cream Fresh and vanilla swirl and meringue provides the milk. \r\n\r\nMarshmallow and Blueberries should speak for themselves, though I think the marshmallow gets a bit lost in the milk.  Need to find a way to separate it out. I though the super sweet might help with that...\r\n\r\nTrying to find the balance between the cereal, milk, & blueberry with a bit of marshmallow. Any comments/critiques welcome.\r\n\r\n",
