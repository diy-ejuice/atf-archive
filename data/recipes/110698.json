  "description": "Inspired by the most recent episode of [Noted](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cIT0iHK4qaw).  I had been wanting to mix Yakima Hops with FLV Mango but wasn't sure in which way.  I had completely forgotten that I owned FE Mango.  So, I slapped those three together and began thinking what else would go with it.  A mix of TFA Vanilla Swirl and VT Yoghurt Drink to mix it into a smoothie type situation.  CAP Golden Pineapple and FLV Sweet Coconut seemed like perfect complements, as well.  Finally, a heaping dose of WS-23 to cool it all down.  This is smooth as hell and vapable right off the shake.  Hope this scratches an itch for somebody . . . enjoy!",

This is an excellent mix and makes for a great all day vape, I leave the ws23 out as the yakima hops adds all the refreshment I need. Just mixed this up a 2nd time which is rare for me but speaks to how much I enjoy this recipe, thanks bro!"

What I didn't expect was to be able to taste all the notes rather than just a beautiful mess of hopped up tropical yum. Mango, hops, pineapple, a touch of coconut, and a silky smooth smoothie base. Superb!  "
