  "description": "Intended to send this in for my 2nd August's Mixers Club entry but will be sending something else. Still, It's a lazy ass mix that simply tastes good.\r\n\r\nI went with the plainest tobaccos I could find. Sweet dessert baccos with fairly simple profiles and medium to light body on top of a malty hazelnut butterscotch pudding base.\r\n\r\n\r\nShout out to one of my favorite bands that I was blasting the entire time I was thinking this mix up. If you like groovy, doomy and fuzzy metal, check out Windhand! The sheer heaviness and droning fuzz of their music helped inspire me to create a thick and malty recipe to chain vape while listening to their stuff. The title of this mix is taken from one of their recently released songs.",
