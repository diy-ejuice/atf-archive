  "description": "I never got on board the cereal hype train, I mixed plenty of top recipes, but they just weren't to my taste. I ordered Capella Blueberry Cinnamon Crumble simply out of interest. It turns out it was very pleasing to my palate, and hopefully yours. I went into overdrive thinking of cereal and grain combinations to add to it. I prefer yogurt with my oats/muesli, so feel free to remove the yogurts and creams and use your favorite milk base instead.\r\n\r\nAs a shake and vape it's pleasant, but the longer you can wait, the more it deepens. the blueberry's are always a back note, but they linger on the palate nicely. This combination of creams and yogurts are perfect for me in this mix. Enjoy! \r\n\r\nPlease note this recipe is subject to commercial release.",
