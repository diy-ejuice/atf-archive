    "description": "The base- cinnamon Danish swirl macaron and Ginger Snap come together for a fantastic cook. The inspiration here was cookie I ate on my honeymoon this is a very Dominican thing cinnamon and Ginger macaroon. The cinnamon Danish swirl mostly a cinnamon flavoring with a light Bakery Downey combines flawlessly with the Ginger Snap to give you that slightly dry cookie flavoring I've been added macaroon for the hint of coconut and to make the cookies more complex.\r\n\r\nThe top notes- you getting a nice bright Apple with the rest of the cookie flavoring Fuji and strawberry ripe come together here as the top notes do you strawberry simply sweetens the Fuji and adds a layer of complexity.\r\n\r\nAccents- meringue does so many different things here boosts the cookie by giving it that trademark meringue cereal flavor along with sweetening everything else.\r\n\r\nSleep time- I've been on the fence about this one for some time now I knew it was one of my favorites but wasn't able to discern whether or not to submit it until the two-week steep time had passed I don't think you need the full two weeks but it's not going to hurt. So 2 weeks lol",

Been looking for a good recipe using FLV Ginger Snap bc it really doesn\u2019t taste to me like a cookie, but it works well in here the molasses like note it has comes through very well. Not really getting the strawberry i think i may have gotten lost in the steep, "
