  "name": "Peppermint Mocha Challange DMC #007",
  "description": "Another challange for the season. Well for me coffee concentrates are blah and bland. I really do not get a authentic coffee flavor from any of them. They are very dirty and fall flat imo. The good thing about this profile is it's a cappuccino mocha which we all know is more a of chocolate with coffee undertones.  Part of this challenge is the offerings we have still lack in the coffee department.  I chose FA cappuccino and paired WF cappuccino cream in this mix because they have a more authenic coffee flavor and rich cream backnotes. For me the peppermint was easy using LB white chocolate peppermint. It brings a nice peppermint to the table at lower percentages but lacks chocolate, so that is  where the MB glamour and FW mocha come in to play to support the lacking quality of the LB wcp. Now hey you can go higher on the LB but imo it starts to taste like toothpaste. Finished off with some caps SS because who doesn't like sugar in there coffee. But hey me personally I like mine black.
