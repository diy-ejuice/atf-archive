Combined they are to me the perfect pie crust as they have both a buttery note and a bit of flake going on. FA Apple Pie does take a couple of days to really come out and at 1% it does work its magic for being just a crust with no notes of apples or spices. VT Croissant is super buttery even at 2% which makes the crust feels nice, thick and chewy.\r\n\r\nThe Filling:\r\nPUR Country Apple has an amazing ability for apples pies since it taste like cooked apples. To make an apple pie, this would be the apple I go for, thanks to that  ability. I have tried other apples, but they don't bring that feeling of cooked apple like PUR Country Apple does. It's soft, mushy and sweet. \r\nFLV Apple Filling I kept somewhat low at 1% as I didn't want it to dominate the other ingredients in the filling. I find 1% to be just the perfect amount of spices. Not too much and not too little - just a nice touch of spices.\r\nI don't know how common it is anywhere else, but here where I'm from we like to have prunes, dates or raisins in our apple pies. VT Red Dates has a bit of a sweet and dark taste, that I find go super very well with apples in general. It has a touch of sun raisins going on and it does a little love dance with the apple.\r\nIt brings some punch to the filling, adding some darker and fruity notes and adds some nice texture.\r\nLastly for the filling I settled for just a hint of INW Custard. By all means, I'm not using this much for the flavor, but more to thicken up the texture of the filling itself and make it a little gooey, which INW Custard delivers perfectly fine at 0.75%.\r\n\r\nLastly at the very top of the pie goes the OOO Powdered Sugar. It's just there for the taste and to enhance the sweetness of it all a little.\r\n\r\nWhile I suggest to let it sit for 5 days, to me it's already good after a few days.\r\n\r\nEnjoy!",
