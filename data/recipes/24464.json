    "description": "So about a year ago, I tried my hand at mixing up a recipe that was inspired by that Banana\/Pineapple\/Orange juice blend that Dole makes. I had made a few adjustments since then, and found that the base from a year ago was still the best. Here is the most current iteration. It's a great shake and vape, but a little separated. Give it two days, and it's all melded together into something inoffensive, consistent, and my favourite ADV when I get burnt out on bakeries and the \"heavier\" mixes in my arsenal.\r\n\r\nCAP Sweet Tangerine \/ CAP Juicy Orange - here's the orange juice base. These two flavours are great together, but carry some strangeness straight out of the gate. Juicy Orange has a little waxiness to it if you push it too high, and 2% is right about the threshold on that. If you pick up on that waxy note, dial it back half a percent. After an overnight steep though, most of that off note gets pushed aside. What we end up with is a really wet and bright orange juice base.\r\n\r\nTPA Banana Cream \/ LA Banana Cream - you already know this is my go to ratio for bananas. The touch of LA helps push the accuracy of the banana note, while the TPA carries it home with the creamy sweetness. The mouthfeel of these two in tandem help emulate the mouthfeel of the real-world counterpart of this recipe. That Dole juice is almost like the middle ground between juice and smoothie. It's thicker and smoother than a typical glass of juice, and these two concentrates help get that aspect going in the right direction.\r\n\r\nCAP Golden Pineapple \/ TPA Pineapple - here's your pineapples, the TPA is around to really give that bite of tartness you want, it cuts through the sweets so well in this mix. The CAP Golden was a new addition to the recipe, and just really helps dial back on some of that battery acid note you get from TPA Pineapple.\r\n\r\nFA Fuji \/ TPA Marshmallow - the extras in this recipe are what really make it, in my opinion. The FA Fuji helps emulate the fact that almost every commercial made fruit juice on the market has apple juice in it as a base. While Fuji doesn't inherently taste like apple juice, at this low of a percentage, you get the idea of it, while still having one of the best fruit emulsifiers we have available. The Fuji brightens up the oranges, gives some depth to the banana, and helps make the pineapples less one-dimensional. TPA Marshmallow is our sweetener, and helps add to that mouthfeel you get from the banana creams. Using TPA Marshmallow will push this recipe right into the realm of accuracy to the real fruit juice blend. Thick, creamy, and sweet.\r\n\r\nTPA Koolada (OPTIONAL) - use to taste. If you like Koolada, it really helps this recipe come together. Without Koolada, it's still good, but adding a few drops just pushes it to a whole new level. Because, well, let's be honest, who the fuck likes drinking warm orange juice?",

            "text": "I enjoy this very much. That CAP Juicy Orange\/Sweet Tangerine combo is as close to OJ as I have seen thus far. The LA\/TFA Banana Cream combo makes a nice base and interacts with the orange beautifully. That banana combo is always going to be light against stronger flavors, especially if TFA Marshmallow is on the scene, so I would add a bit of FA Banana if I wanted to crank that up. &#xD;\nI hate TFA Pineapple compared to CAP Golden and INW Pineapple, but it works really fucking well here against the orange\/nanner combo. When I smell the ever-so-familiar scent of TFA Pineapple when I drip this, I get moderately aroused by the contrast that's coming. Fuji does some work with integrating everything and was a good choice. &#xD;\nYeah I tried this with a light amount of Koolada and so should everyone else. &#xD;\nPeople like to use the word 'balanced' a lot. I wouldn't use it here. The highs outweigh the lows by quite a margin, but that is okay because that is how the profile works. I can't say that I have ever had the source material, but this is a mighty fine vape that I am enjoying and that is all that matters."
