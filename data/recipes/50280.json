  "description": "Saw this recipe pop up  on my facebook page as one of those \" DIY video and I thought this would make a great mix -   I have to give it a go.   and I was right  - \r\nJuicy lemon/ lemon Sicily    - make up the predominate note and  combination of the two  give you that  punch with out taking over the recipe \r\nGraham cracker/ cookie - come out on the back end with a slight  sweet graham cracker \r\nVanilla pudding/ marshmallow - give the  main body to the recipe  balancing the lemon with sweetness and  dense cloudy vapor \r\nthat this mix calls for.  First time using  FLV vanilla pudding in a mix and I can see alot of benefit in using this for mixes that you want to add body in but don't  want  or like  Cap custard.  \r\nWhip cream and frosting   - used as additives here to  for that powder sugar sweetness  that ICE box cakes are known for.  \r\n",
