    "description": "I make sugar cookie recipes like crazy, it is my favorite profile and I just can't stop and I am posting my best ones only.  This is a good one Creamy and Vanilla'ey, its yummy.  Not too sweet but sweet enough to be a sugar cookie.  Hope you like.  I made it, gave it a warm bath for an hour then left the cap off for about twenty mins and it was good to vape but steeping a week will give the best flavor....Love to all...Kim",

My only critism is that some people might find it to rich and intense But that is exactly what i like about it. Rich vanilla through out the vape with that buttery cookie exhale. The hazelnut helps along the cookie. Just a little bit to rich with the butter and vanilla. I don't think i will be able to handle any more once i finish my 30ml. I know non descriptive reviews are annoying so i tried to add something meaningful to the review. Either way good job. "
