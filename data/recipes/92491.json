  "description": "almond caramel cream.\r\n\r\nwf vanilla ruyan custard- this flavor is a workhorse. i honestly prefer it solo around 6-7%, but it pairs great with ry4s and other creams. it's primarily a vanilla, secondarily a texture/mouthfeel booster- it reminds me of what inw's creme brulee would be if it didn't get weird over 0.5%- it's got such a full body to it. oddly- it's nothing like cap's VC1, largely because it's vapable immediately and doesn't seem to change much with a steep. this is the base flavor in this recipe because it's a solid body foundation but it doesn't bully the top notes.\r\n\r\ninw custard- what can i say about this flavor that hasn't already been said. it's great, again doesn't require much steeping, and provides lovely body. helps fill out the ruyan custard here and helps the vanilla not be so dominant.\r\n\r\njf's ry4- probably the best ry4 out there. less steeping, more depth of flavor. mostly a warm caramel note.\r\n\r\n(top notes) inw's marzipan & fa's almond- this combo is sweet almond bliss.  that twangy cherry note from the marzipan fades after 12-24 hours, hence the teensy steep time. they mesh effortlessly with the custards and caramel ry4- it's a delightful combo. \r\n\r\nside note/how's it vape, mahfucka?: this juice is super similar to those standard ry4/custard/nut combo recipes we all love: dillinger's dairy, pistachio ry4, gentleman's custard- if that profile is appealing to you, you'll love this one. the difference here is that this recipe is ready to vape almost immediately. i'm not yanking yer chain. honestly most of the wonder flavors i've tried have that in common, their inclusion in a recipe, or even just solo; they are damn near shake & vapable. i'm not unaware of the discourse re: their potential sugar content, or whatever- i just don't care. *shrug*",

I love that juice and even have a remix posted on here... THIS however tastes like a more refined or decadent version... I'll have to pick up JF RY4D and give it another try... Nice job! üëçüëç"
