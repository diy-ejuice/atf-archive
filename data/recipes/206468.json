  "description": "It's a green apple gummy - thick, chewy, sweet and extra juicy - but sitting on a white base like a strawberries and cream would - no one came here for cream today though right - It's time for thee apples:\r\n\r\nI like to add CAP/PUR Super Sweet 0.5-1% in candy recipes\r\nI have mostly mixed this with WS-23 @ 1% as the weather warms up (in Australia at least)\r\nPersonally, I think this needs some SS @ 0.5% to feel like a true gummy candy, but it's DIY so go for it and add both, or don't and add neither if you prefer!\r\n\r\nQuick Notes:\r\n\r\nTFA Apple (Tart Green):\r\nAdds a bright and sweet top note with only a hint of peel at 1.5% but enough to bring some authenticity to the mix\r\n\r\nFLV Granny Smith:\r\nNo off-notes are present at 1.5% and this is an awesome green apple. \"A really sweet, crisp, mostly natural green apple. It‚Äôs just a little bit candied. Fairly harsh. A bit dry, not very juicy.\"\r\n\r\nFLV Sour Apple:\r\nThis one boosts the Apple Gummy flavour and adds some bite to the mix. I couldn't take WF Apple gummy any higher without getting soapy off-notes. The sour apple is candied but pretty soft.\r\n\r\nFLV Red Apple:\r\nTones down sharp notes and adds some depth to the mix, even at 0.5%. A very authentic red apple.\r\n\r\nCAP Fuji Apple:\r\nFills in the dryness of the FLV Apples and adds some sweetness while just tying everything together perfectly with it's apple juiciness.\r\nReally good and fresh this one..\r\n\r\nWF Apple gummy\r\nIs a good gummy flavour at 1% but is used low because I would get soapy off-notes any higher. I have attempted to boost it here with FLV sour apple.\r\n\r\nFLV Cream\r\nThe apple gummies I was going for are little green, apple-shaped gummies with a white base (like a strawberries and cream) but do you think I could find a picture of them online? Nope! That is the reason for the FLV Cream. It adds a smoothness without imparting too much cream flavour. I feel it works here but I am yet to try it without it - I think you could skip it if you wanted just a straight up apple gummy with no cream but it's not that noticeable anyway!\r\n\r\n\r\nI made many versions after this mix but I kept coming back to this so it was just lucky I had scribbled the percentages down somewhere!\r\n\r\nLet me know what you think if you mix it up. Subs should be ok in here for the fuji, I like the juiciness of CAP's though, and if you don't have the cream just drop it :) Sing out if you need help with subs. No probs. Peace fam!",
