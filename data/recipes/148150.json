    "description": "**12.22.19 This is also very good with cap sweet cream instead of tpa. Same %**\r\n\r\nK (my GF) wanted a thick vanilla marshmallow malt\\milkshake vape. Very rich. Here is what she likes best. I look forward to mixing this with some updated ingredients, but this is made with all pretty common tools in a mixers arsenal.\r\n\r\nFlv cream + Tpa malted milk + tpa sweet cream + fw hazelnut: to set up a nice creamy base with the hazelnut low. Want this to be a real malted milkshake & just wasn't getting it with the malted milk alone.\r\n\r\nVbic because it's a milkshake and you've gotta have some ice cream in there. Chose this particular one, well, because I have too damn much of it & it works.\r\n\r\nVanilla swirl for extra vanilla with some density to it. Oh and it's \ud83d\ude0b\r\n\r\nThe marshmallows because it's a goddamn marshmallow vanilla milkshake.\r\n\r\nBecause of the creams I highly recommend waiting at least 5 days of steeping, but 7-10 is optimal. \r\n\r\nSubs\\adjustments: if you're a pepper taster just sub lb vic at around 4.5%  **a small amount of your favorite sucralose based sweetener really helps this mix.\r\n\r\nEnjoy & Happy Mixing! Remember, feedback good or bad helps us all become better mixers\r\n\r\n7.9.19: this one's done. Very different v2 with flv marshmallow vanilla & VT Milkshake base incoming.. ",

Rich and mellow and smooth and full, it's one of the best milkshakes I've had the privilege of vaping (though admittedly, I've only vaped a handful of milkshakes). Great stuff. Looking forward to the remix with FLV marshmallow vanilla."
