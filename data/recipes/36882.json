  "description": "This is a great Tangerine flavor with the perfect amount of creaminess. The strawberry ripe really helps to bring the tangerine flavor to life making it flavor fully brighten up.  The shisha shawberry adds a nice strawberry that gives a little more sweetness to the recipe. The vanilla whipped cream combined with the butter cream and Shisha Vanilla keep this recipe light and fluffy while not taking anything away from the powerful Tangerine flavor. Good as a SNV. ",

I mixed some up for myself, and have been happily vaping it for the past week. &#xD;\nThe blend of flavors here is sublime, it's a light creamy vape with a citrusy zing that almost (but not quite) hits a sherbet note at times. It's refreshing, easy on the throat, and deserves more notice than it's getting. "
