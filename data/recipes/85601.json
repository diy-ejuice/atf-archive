    "description": "So... here is the very first recipe I created on this site. The profile is an Iced Blueberry Lavender Tea Latte. It has taken A LOT of development to get to this final product, but I am finally satisfied with it. Mix and enjoy!\r\n\r\nFlavor Comments:\r\nBlueberry Wild (TPA): The perfect blueberry to pair with lavender. It is an earthy, floral and dry blueberry. At 3% it accentuates the lavender very effectively and adds a more subtle natural blueberry.\r\n\r\nCondensed Milk (PUR): After using Cream Fresh (FA) for all previous batches I found it worked but gave it a pretty noticable milk funk. So I finally decided to try Condensed Milk (PUR) and it was a perfect fit. Had all the notes Cream Fresh (FA) has without the funk. Perfect.\r\n\r\nLavender (FA): Probably the best lavender on the market. Very natural. Definitely the right choice for this profile.\r\n\r\nMarshmallow (FA): Been with this recipe since the beginning. Not sure why, but the authentic marshmallow root flavor works so well with the lavender. Also adds some thickness.\r\n\r\nMilk & Honey (FLV): I really don't know why I didn't think to use this cream sooner. It really gives it that latte heated milk taste. The honey adds plenty of sweetness and a nice floral note. The milk is authentic with no funk. Just perfect.\r\n\r\nPeppermint (TPA): Gives this recipe the herbal tea note and also adds a nice iced quality. This flavor can be pretty powerful so keeping it lower is key.",
