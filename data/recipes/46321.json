    "description": "Version 5. Blackberry lemon scone.\r\nStill in progress but I feel it's worth releasing to the public.\r\nA delicate powdery cookie with a blackberry background and pronounced lemon zing! Sweet Jesus we're getting fancy.\r\n\r\nFW Blackberry: Why would I use anything else? Tastes like blackberry jam. Doesn't really taste like a fresh blackberry.\r\nOOO Beignets & JF Biscuit: Buttery soft pastry and dry butter biscuit together make a very delicate crumbly cookie flavor. Originally I tried to use FA Cookie and it just wasn't right,\r\nCAP Juicy Lemon: Just a little bit gives it a lemon rind taste which is exactly what I was going for.\r\nFA Meringue: Sweet and creamy feel.\r\nFA Almond: I don't know why I decided to add this, but I'm glad I did. Almonds! They're delicious.\r\nFA Marshmallow: Adds that missing sweetness and mouth feel that I just wasn't getting from Meringue. I may replace Meringue with Powdered Sugar\r\nThe %'s may seem oddly strict but every revision just needed a little something extra and this is where I arrived.",
