  "description": "Well I must have bumped my head because here is yet another simple 4 ingredient mix. Well actually its 3 ingredients and sweetener. A huge difference from my usual layered madness lol. Any way this is a peanut butter pudding  with banana chunks cut up in it. Most of my recent recipes I haven't been listing sweetener in the ingredients list due to it not affecting the flavor and it being your choice. Well it's still your choice if you use sweetener but its my opinion that with peanut butter vapes sweetener is necessary to make the peanut butter not so dry.  I use Flavorah sweetness always because its my preferred sweetener .25%-.50% is always enough for me but feel free to use whatever your preferred sweetener is at your preferred percentage but if you haven't tried Flavorah sweetness I would suggest trying it. I personally bought a 4oz bottle of sweetness from Flavorah direct because I like it so much. \r\n",
