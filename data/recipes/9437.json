  "description": "Honeysuckle, of course, is the very top note here. Blueberry and blackberry do a magical wood sprite dance in the background, where the background is a meadow illuminated by fireflies looking for a date. Its a warm summer evening where the air is sweet with libidinous anticipation and it is time to gather around the fire.\r\nI included bilberry to add some musky aspects of that ever-so-sweet FW blueberry. The pear is present to help smooth the whole thing out (don't get me wrong, it still has a bit of a bite though and that is quite okay). The cactus is added to juice it all up a bit more (just as the right amount of booze can provide the right amount of lubrication for summer evening socialization). Plan the event a week in advance and the stars should align to gather this group. Just come prepared to have a good time and go with the flow!",

I can't say enough how awsome this recipe is. Yum! I added a bit of sweetner to mine. If you love fruit vapes this is a must try!!!!"
