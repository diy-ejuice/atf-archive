    "name": "Paradiso (Rumblepup's Cielo Remix) #REMIXMONTH",
    "description": "Rumblepup Steam Elixir's Cielo is a ridiculously good juice.  It is a Cuban-inspired Tres Leches with pear and orange.  This is really just a shadow of what the original brings to the table.  It was a flavor that I could not put down.  Rumblepup's entire line is unique, tropical deliciousness.  This was the standout, in my opinion.  \r\n\r\nI tried to balance the fruit and creams to make a suitable remix that hit similar notes to the original . . . but, by all means, go grab a bottle of this from Rumblepup.  I doubt you will regret it.  He is an extremely mindful mixer and, as far as I know, does not use sweeteners in his juice.  ",
