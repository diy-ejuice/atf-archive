    "description": "I know after all the hate Brie Cheese has gotten recently it is going to be hard to convince anyone to give this a try, but if you like apple mixes you should at least make a 10 ml of this. The pear and apple are a great combination and the musky brie cheese does wonders to bring out the sweetness of the fruits. Very simple mix, the sweetener is there to round out the harshness of the apple an provide just a touch more sweetness. ",
