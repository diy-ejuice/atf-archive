  "description": "This is a long steeper, needs at least 3 weeks to start blooming but you won't regret it. Promised.\r\n\r\nBread Pudding V2 (SC) (Real Flavors) is the American version of their series, V1 was more of a  Canadians type of taste, combined this with Vanilla Pudding from FLA (the best vanilla ever tasted) mixes goes so well with the bread pudding it becomes a finger-licking mix.\r\n\r\nAdding some Aged bourbon Cream to give this a spiced feeling and taste.\r\nA little Rum&raisin reinforced and intensified the bread pudding even more.\r\nThe baklava is there to sweeten and thickens the final mix.\r\n\r\nRemeber, smell but don't touch before the 3 weeks mark!",
