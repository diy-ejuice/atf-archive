  "description": "\"As your attorney, I advise you to buy a motorcycle. How else can we cover a thing like this righteously?\" \r\n\"We'll just have to drum it up on our own. Pure Gonzo journalism! \"\r\n\r\nFLV Milk & Honey, haven't used at all until this mix, been wanting to play with it, wanted to build a recipe around it. What a delicious flavor!! Another killer one from Flavorah. I actually get nice light graham cracker flavor in there, sort of honey graham crackers, and the creaminess of the milk is definitely there, slightly dairy. \r\nLately, I've been using a lot of FA Fresh Cream, CAP Sweet Cream lately and FA Meringue at a 2:1:0.5 ratio, that's my go to milk base now, so I didn't want to use them at all, I wanted something different to support Milk & Honey so I went with a touch of FA Vienna Cream and CAP Vanilla Custard. \r\nI've also been wanting to incorporate in some subtle touches of nut flavoring, I love what 0.5% FA Almond can do with any cream, so I decided to try it with a few different ones.\r\nI couldn't decide which I really wanted here, que Dr. Gonzo, I said to hell with it and used all the ones I was contemplating with FA Torrone being the most random of them all, another one I've never mixed with in my own recipes but used sparingly in others. So far I get different notes of each depending on the pull, sometimes the hazelnut is really present in the exhale/after taste, sometimes the sweetness of the pistachio or almond lingers or combines, sometimes the torrone comes out strong in the front for a moment, the nougat and nuttyness, it's a pretty intriguing and fun mix to vape for sure. \r\n\r\nIt tasted pretty good as a shake and vape, it was made 9/27/2017 and after a good week steep it's great, but it continues to fill out through weeks two and three.
