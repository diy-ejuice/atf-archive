  "name": "Strawberry Malted Milk",
  "description": "I have been on the hunt to find a juice that tastes like the Pink Nesquik. After a couple of misses trying to mix this I think I have finally gotten close. I still want to try and swop out the TFA Vanilla Custard with FA Custard Premium to see if it creates a more mouthful of creaminess when paired with the creams. I have dropped the Malted milk down to 2.5 where it was previously at 4, it can be a bit overwhelming at such a high percentage.\r\nI have mixed this at 70/30 and let it steep for about a week and it tasted amazing. I then left it to steep one more week and OMG, I cannot put down my Vape. This is definitely a winner, although I feel it can still be tweaked slightly to make it even more amazing. Maybe a V2 on the way",
