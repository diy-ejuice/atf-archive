  "description": "My first published recipe EVER!\r\nWhite chocolate covered caramel wafers are one of my favourite treats to snack on. I do prefer the type with the caramel flavoured wafer rather than the chewy sweet caramel that some have. This is a crack at that!\r\n\r\nWhite Chocolate: \r\nThe mix of VT White Chocolate Base, TPA White Chocolate and LA Cream Cheese Icing gave that perfect creamy sweet vanilla flavoured coating that melts on your fingers as your eat a treat of this type. To some, TPA will give a slight peppery note for the first day or two but will eventually turn the mix creamy and sweet.\r\n\r\nRice Crispy:\r\nCombining WF Caramel Rice Crispy Treat and TPA Rice Crunchies this low was originally there to aid the wafer with being 'crispy' but turned the mix into something new. We now have it as a middle note that adds to the authenticity of the profile.\r\n\r\nWafer:\r\nWF Crispy Wafer SC is not a super concentrate IMO. I had to raise it up to compete with the chocolate and sits under that and the rice. Used low it is subtle and works in the way that I hoped for Rice Crunchies to originally, adding crispiness to the rice.\r\n\r\nExtras:\r\nDFS Holy Vanilla at .5% adds a hint of vanilla that blends the choc to the wafer.\r\n\r\nAdditions:\r\nFor a slightly stronger/chewier caramel try adding .5-1% FA Carmel(Caramel) or 1.5-2% TPA Caramel Candy to boost the WF Caramel Rice Crispy Treats.",
