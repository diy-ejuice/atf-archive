    "description": "I have to say that FLV Yam is one of the best flavors I have tried in many years. It is truly authentic. My goal here was to make a recipe that doesn't exist, A sweet potato\/yam, cinnamon Danish with sweet cream cheese. If you don't like cinnamon you can reduce the WF cinnamon Pastry to around 3% but being that it's not a WF SC it works very well at 5%. The FW Cake (yellow) adds a bit of cake to help the WF cinnamon pastry seem more like a fluffy pastry to soften the WF cinnamon pastry. I have found that since there's not really a good cream cheese flavoring out yet, LA Cheesecake is the closest we have at the moment. I added a bit of CAP golden butter but you don't have to use this....I just like it better. Just a touch of CAP Super Sweet and it's ready to vape, although I would steep it for about 3 days for best results. If the Yam is too high off the shake, it will fade as well as the WF Cinnamon Pastry. I will be mixing this recipe today(1-21-18) at 4:30 PM EST on DMC LIVE! See below for link.\r\n\r\nCan be a shake and vape but is best after a 3 day steep.\r\nPlease comment, mix, and or rate,....it makes us all better mixers.
