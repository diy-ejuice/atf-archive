    "description": "Made for my BF but I really like it too - just plain old custard pie really - but it is soo yummy - even straight off the shake.  The cap custard and tpa custard are the stars with pie crust and biscuit backing them up then adding caramel and butter pecan to give it interest.  I now add supersweet to almost everything at .25% because I do believe it is kinda like salt - it brings flavors forward.  I used to avoid sugar but if you use just a little it won't gunk up your coils.",

Nice sweet caramel and butter pecan top notes I just can't get enough of, and a good pie crust undertone. Maybe it was just the batch I got but my TFA Pie Crust does give me an odd burnt\/overly toasted flavor but it's not enough to detract from the rest of the mix here. 5\/5!"
