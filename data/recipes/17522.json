  "description": "Pomegranate and Raspberry are the main ingredient in this one.\r\nA touch of Strawberry adds the red sweetness to the mix without showing the presence of Strawberry.\r\nAnd Cactus, I might even say that Cactus is the main ingredient in this. It just melds the Pomegranate and Raspberry together nicely giving this juicy effect.\r\nIf you feel like you need more sweetness then 0.5% TFA Sweetener is an option, wouldn't suggest EM as it will just mute the overall flavor.\r\nIt's great as Shake and Vape but 3 day steep will give fuller experience.\r\nTFA Dragonfruit at 0.5% is a nice addition to this, it will bring that strawberry out of shadows a bit.\r\n\r\nApologize for my shitty description and notes xD\r\nHope you enjoy,\r\nPeace V ",
