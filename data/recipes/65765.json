I mean right level of spices, graham cracker crust, dead accurate pumpkin flavor, and even that sweet caramelization unique to this sort of pie. Hell, when i hit it too much, I even get that bit of \"dude, too much, yer about to get sick\" taste. NO, that is not any sort of butric scent. It's just a thing my own body does. This is how I know it's accurate.&#xD;\n&#xD;\nSeriously, well done man. This is just the thing to set off my holiday vibe. Totally worth the $18 it took to ship HS Pumpkin Pie in from england cos everyone else was out."
