  "description": "Inawera's Burley is nowhere near FA's,although they share some common characteristics.FA's Burley is stronger,more concentrated,has some spicy notes and is more cigarette like in taste.Inawera's Burley is smoother,has a better balance between salt and sweet,it can be used as main aroma in a tobacco mix and i think it could be the only tobacco from inawera that can be used in higher percentages.\r\nTobacco symphony and the combination of pyrazine-beer nuts -creamy hazelnut add a nutty,yet not too salty note.Caramel and Miss cream make the mix just a little sweeter,smoother and somewhere in the background you might notice a slight chocolate note(depending on hardware,set up and wattage).\r\nI really enjoy this in relatively low wattage(0,7ohms around 20watts)in mtl device.\r\nIt really needs a good 14 days steeping and is completely ready 20 days\r\nBe patient and enjoy!\r\n\r\n",
