  "name": "POD Tangerine Creamsicle!  18 mg/ml  NicSalt",
  "description": "This is a very good Orange Creamsicle that utilizes Nicotine River's Smooth NicSalt.\r\nIntended for Pods, MTL devices and RTA's etc.\r\nI used 18mg/ml of the NicSalt and It's as smooth as silk. I can DL hit it in my Nord with very little throat hit.\r\nYou can actually taste the Orange and Nectarine that leads to a nice creamy finish.\r\nThe best part is that it's not harsh at all.\r\nPretty great for only 16% of the mix being the aromas. I'm very happy with it.",
