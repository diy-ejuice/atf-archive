It was not dark, harsh, bitter or \"old stock\" tasting. I always try to find my target in 0....little to no degradation on the shelf. I have a bottle of their Custard Cookie at 3% to work on and its so dark and bitter and harsh I can't vape it much less get a bead on what it was a year or two ago when it was probably originally made. Just food for thought Remixers....",

      "text": "This is an awesome recipe my first testing on the shake was bland and the lemon and lime overpowers the sugar cookie after sitting a few days everything falls into place with a nice sweetness and sugary flavor with creaminess from the lemon cream wafer .The only thing that bothers me is capella sugar cookie fades notoriously in a mix so I usually add a small percentage of Fa cookie or Inawara biscuit to a recipe featuring Capella sugar cookie it helps hold the flavor in the long term and adds  a more buttery flavor. Unfortunately I have never had the original ejuice to compare it's authenticity other than that good job! This recipe will help new mixers getting into DIY because of the simplicity  but complex flavor...üòéüëç"
