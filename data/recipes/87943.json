  "description": "*You know those cinnamon apple side dishes you get at rib joints, or in your sad microwave Hungry Man dinners?*\r\n\r\nPUR Country Apple is a plain baked apple. Adding a little FLV Apple Filling takes it from plain to subtly cinnamon-spiced. But what's still missing is all the goopy sweet stuff that's really the best part. The Apple Filling has a lot of that all by itself, and a touch of sweetener goes a long way to finishing it. But a little pat of butter is still missing. VT Golden Syrup instead of sweetner brings the sticky sweet and a just-right hint of buttery goodness in one. Overnight steep.  ",

I took it camping in late summer with cabin and a bunch of other stuff. I only vaped this. Simple mix that hits that apple cinnamon note without the bakery element to distract from it. It's got the texture and the flavor im looking for in a profile like this. Thanks, ID for putting this together and sharing!"
