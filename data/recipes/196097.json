    "description": "If you like lucozade Caribbean crush then this this recipe is for you, in fact if you like anything tropical and refreshing then this recipe is for you, if you like the recipes that I create then this recipe is for you, if you\u2019re sitting in the sun and you\u2019re hot then this recipe is for you. Pineapple hits you at the forefront, coconut steps in just after the pineapple and then mango and passionfruit sit just at the end to really convince you that this is a tropical mix, sugarloaf and queen have been a combo I\u2019ve used for some time now and there\u2019s no mistaking the fact that there is pineapple in this recipe, this was the first time I\u2019d used VTA coconut in a recipe and it\u2019s a really good coconut, it\u2019s not dry\/bitter it just oozes that coconut you might taste in Malibu rum. VTA yellow passion, it\u2019s the best passionfruit for taking higher as far as a percentage is concerned. WF is a good passionfruit but if you take it too high then you\u2019re in dirt city (too earthy above 1%), same goes for the mango, VTA shisha I find is the best and least earthy mango amongst its competitors, if you don\u2019t have this one in your arsenal there you\u2019re missing out. Fizzy sherbet gives a carbonated feel.\r\n\r\nSweetener and coolant totally subjective but adds to the overall profile.\r\n\r\nIf you mix this then please rate and review accordingly :) \r\n\r\nDon\u2019t forget to check out my one-shots as an easier alternative to trying my work.\r\n\r\nEPIC!
