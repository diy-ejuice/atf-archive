  "description": "If you like lucozade Caribbean crush then this this recipe is for you, in fact if you like anything tropical and refreshing then this recipe is for you, if you like the recipes that I create then this recipe is for you, if you’re sitting in the sun and you’re hot then this recipe is for you. Pineapple hits you at the forefront, coconut steps in just after the pineapple and then mango and passionfruit sit just at the end to really convince you that this is a tropical mix, sugarloaf and queen have been a combo I’ve used for some time now and there’s no mistaking the fact that there is pineapple in this recipe, this was the first time I’d used VTA coconut in a recipe and it’s a really good coconut, it’s not dry/bitter it just oozes that coconut you might taste in Malibu rum. VTA yellow passion, it’s the best passionfruit for taking higher as far as a percentage is concerned. WF is a good passionfruit but if you take it too high then you’re in dirt city (too earthy above 1%), same goes for the mango, VTA shisha I find is the best and least earthy mango amongst its competitors, if you don’t have this one in your arsenal there you’re missing out. Fizzy sherbet gives a carbonated feel.\r\n\r\nSweetener and coolant totally subjective but adds to the overall profile.\r\n\r\nIf you mix this then please rate and review accordingly :) \r\n\r\nDon’t forget to check out my one-shots as an easier alternative to trying my work.\r\n\r\nEPIC!
