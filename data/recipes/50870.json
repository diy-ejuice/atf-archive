  "description": "Nay-Ked! This is a departure from my normal bakery and cream recipes. Some times you just got to get away from the same-old same-old. I've been wanting a juice to take me to another place,... a secluded island in a distant land. This recipe strips away all the heavy bakeries, creams, and sweeteners to just enjoy a great \"tropical fruit\" vape on a secluded nude beach somewhere in the Pacific(I wish). It's quite hard to explain but I will try.\r\nTop note: FA Orange and FA Lemon Sicily not to over-powering though\r\nMiddle note: CAP Golden Pineapple and CAP Kiwi\r\nEnd note or bottom note: FA Lemon Sicily and INW Cactus. It has a slight floral note but not so much that it gets in the way of the other flavors. I don't like most floral notes in juices but this sits well with this juice. \r\nNice refreshing vape for a change of pace.\r\n5 days steep for best results but can be a shake and vape\r\n\r\nPlease comment, mix, and or rate,...it make us all better mixers. Enjoy :) \r\n",
