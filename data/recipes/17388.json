  "description": "Fantastic fruit loops in milk.  I know the Looper / Pebbles / Fruit Loops cereal profile has been played out to the max & revisited over and over.  But after tinkering with ingredients & percentages, I have come to a final revision that is worth putting on display.  This really captures the cereal crunch, citrus, cream, milk,  & sweet notes that are so desired in this profile.  Surprisingly good as a shake & vape, however giving the Bavarian Cream & Sweet Cream a week to blend in is recommended!  Mix at 80/20 VG/PG   Enjoy!!!  ",
