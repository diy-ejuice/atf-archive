  "description": "Not your typical apple pie. I'm going for the one that has a almost crunchy crumbly crust. Almost an apple crisp but not quite. \r\n\r\nAfter trying to create this recipe with all components at the same time and coming up with a unsuccessful semi mess, I decided to work on the pie filling first, then add the crust later.\r\n\r\nThe filling\r\nThe two apples combine to make a nice sweet and tart apple flavor. Combined with 1 drop the FLV Rich Cinnamon per 15ml, liquid amber and brown sugar you have what I have found to be a really nice pie filling with just the right amount of cinnamon.\r\n\r\nI know alot of people get a green apple flavor from Anton Apple but I get a nice sweet fleshy red apple flavor from it. That paired with the FA Fuji form a very nice apple base from which I worked from.\r\n\r\nThe crust\r\nNow I wasn't going for your typical buttery flaky crust you find in most apple pies. Growing up my mom made a Dutch Apple pie where you make a crumble crust using butter, flour, cinnamon, and sugar to make a crumble. You pat part of the crumble into the pie pan to form a crust, add the pie filling, the top with the rest of the crumble.\r\n\r\nI used FA Cookie and CAP Sugar Cookie to form the main crust profile and the CDS to give it the obvious cinnamon notes and also stole the bakery flavor I get from CDS to round out the crust.\r\n\r\nThe FA Cookie brought the drier cookie aspect that this crust needed. The CAP Sugar Cookie brought the softer buttery aspect to it. In this ratio I think it works well.\r\n\r\nThe overall cinnamon note is what gave me the most issues when creating this recipe. Both cinnamons are in my opinion very strong and originally overtook the entire flavor profile. After several renditions in which I gradually brought them down I think I have come up with a well rounded apple pie flavor.",
