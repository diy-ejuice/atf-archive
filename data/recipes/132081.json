  "description": "This was mixed up for a holiday live steam fund raiser  on Fresh03 channel for St  Jude children  hospital\r\nThe  fa buttershcotch and caramel work to create that  soft creamy topping\r\npound cake is infused with a pudding and irish cream for a warm full  dense vape  \r\n\r\nNOTES: this is pretty sweet without any sweetner, bu t feel free to add sweetner if you like it really sweet. FLV sweetness   would be what i recommend.  FLV Irish cream   is my favorite Irish cream   but   FA  Irish cream  can also be used  at the same percent it will lend a bit of a chocolate back note\r\n",
