    "description": "This is a tasty bright sweet jammy strawberry forward inhale that moves into a light tart lemon on the exhale ending with a vanilla bakery note. can be a shake and vape but is best 3 - 5 days\r\nThis was made for daytime franks MIXIN IN THE KITCHEN   TPA episode https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/channel\/UCpzG9vsIgaCUzHVrUMHiV_g\r\n \r\n**dragon fruit** just helps to get the strawberry to pop out and helps to blend the lemon and strawberry notes .  Also dragon fruit is a great enhancer for strawberry .  \r\nDespite all the strawberries out there the combination of **TPA strawberry and Strawberry ripe** are just hard to beat and if you have those 2 - you can create just about any strawberry you want\r\n\r\n**Lemonade cookie** is a great flavor but will fade so it needs some support - sadly I did not really have any other good TPA lemon flavors for this mix and this just screamed  for a bit more lemon and  **INW lemon cake** was just tooo good to leave out.  it.  INW does lemons really well and this adds those notes and support the bakery with a yellow almost pound cake base\r\n\r\n**Vanilla swirl** is added for some body ad vanilla notes \r\n\r\n**sweet cereal** supports the bakery notes and adds some additional sweetness and texture  with a sweetned corn flake note \r\n\r\nNOTES: This is pretty sweet mix but if you want it sweet add sweetner FLV sweetness .03%  or cap supper sweet .5% to pop put those fruit notes. if you want more of a sour note WF sweet and sour rhubarb at 2.5% could also be added here to support some of those sour notes, as well as VT sour lemon at around 1.50% .  A bit of cap sugar cookie to add more texture and butter notes  if you want to around 2.5%  ",
