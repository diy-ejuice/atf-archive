  "description": "Apple Crumble Custard (brandy inside)\r\nSweet and lightly brandied apple crumble pie with a wealthy cinnamon custard and cream topping.\r\n\r\nGot the idea when i was making my Boozed Apple Pie Shots you can find this here -->Got the idea when i was making my Boozed Apple Pie Shots you can find this here --> https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/46176#boozed_apple_pie_shots_by_sejouced\r\n\r\nThis time i wanted a more crumble type of apple pie but with the addition of a custard.\r\nBecause i was testing few of the newest RF SC aromas i came up the idea to use RF SC Apple Crumble with some support from RF SC Apple and include the very smooth RF SC Cinnamon Custard. I decided to swap the FA Whiskey from the previous recipe with the RF SC Brandy to infuse the apples/crumble with a sweet and brandied note. \r\nBrandy can be made from any fruit such as wine/grapes (Cognac) or plum (Slivovitz), or apple (Calvados)\r\n\r\nBuilding blocks::\r\n\r\nRF SC Brandy to infuse the apples and give them a sweet brandied taste\r\n'Solo tested at 2.5%, the recommended.maximum, steep 3 days.\r\nThis brandy got notions of grapes, it is very aromatic and sweet, i sense nuts, dried fruit, caramel, honey, vanilla, a little zest of orange and spices such as cinnamon.'\r\n\r\nRF SC Apple Crumble the foundation of this recipe.\r\n'Solo tested at 2.5%, the recommended.maximum, steep 3 days.\r\nI compared this to the RF SC Apple pie version, in this RF SC Apple Crumble i sense nuts and cinnamon and burned sugar'\r\n\r\nRF SC Apple added to support the crumble and to provide an extra layer of apples.\r\n\r\nRF SC Cinnamon Custard, very velvet and smooth custard with mild notes from cinnamon and eggs.\r\n'Solo tested at 2.5%, the recommended.maximum, steep 3 days.\r\nCreamy with very noticeable cinnamon but not disturbing, eggs, sugar, taste more like a pudding'\r\n\r\nFLV Cream to add a smooth structure to the custard and round it of.\r\n\r\nSteep 3/5 days or more\r\n",
