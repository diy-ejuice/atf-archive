I do pick up the coffee and a creamy texture, but I'm not fidning a whole lot of vanilla due to the muting. I made a second tester at the same time where I tried lowering CAP Super Sweet to just 0.25% and it is definitely a lot better.&#xD;\nA good adaption to this, would be to introduce it to a little bit of VT Coffee Milk Froth, which I think could help it out with more texture.&#xD;\nOver all, not bad a recipe and I really enjoyed vaping it, despite the overly sweet taste."
