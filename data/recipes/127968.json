  "description": "A moist lemon cake with coconut butter cream.\r\n\r\n\r\nWF ANGEL CAKE \r\n‚Ä¢ This is my cake, but it also is used as a part of the butter cream, as it is very heavy on the butter. I needed something to bring out the cake part of it and here i used \r\n\r\nFA BREAKFAST CEREAL \r\n‚Ä¢ 0.75% is just enough to give the angel cake the texture without tuning it into a cereal. Works like a charm üòä\r\n\r\nWF COCONUT CUSTARD \r\n‚Ä¢ the coconut in this reminds me of the sticky‚Äôs coconut you get from a bounty chocolate bar, but it also has some sort of ‚Äúvibe‚Äù to it. A fruity vibe, whitch go very well with the lemon. The creamy custard ish taste in it, makes the buttercream along with the buttery note from the angel cake.\r\n\r\nTPA TOASTED ALMOND\r\n‚Ä¢ gives the coconut a slight toasted flavor making it less sticky, so what you get is more of a desiccated coconut type, with a light toast too it. And THAT is what I want in my butter cream!\r\n\r\nCAP LEMON MERINGUE PIE \r\n‚Ä¢ this works as i wanted it to. I get the lemon part of it that i was looking for, and the pie and meringue part just helps the butter cream and the cake part. WONDERFUL!üòä\r\n\r\nFA LEMON SICILY \r\n‚Ä¢ 1% just to brighten up the lemon a bit. Its just not strong enough lemon without it.\r\n\r\nThats it. Hope you will enjoy it as much as i do. This was a fun Challenge. \r\n\r\n",
