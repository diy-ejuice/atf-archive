    "description": "A moist lemon cake with coconut butter cream.\r\n\r\n\r\nWF ANGEL CAKE \r\n\u2022 This is my cake, but it also is used as a part of the butter cream, as it is very heavy on the butter. I needed something to bring out the cake part of it and here i used \r\n\r\nFA BREAKFAST CEREAL \r\n\u2022 0.75% is just enough to give the angel cake the texture without tuning it into a cereal. Works like a charm \ud83d\ude0a\r\n\r\nWF COCONUT CUSTARD \r\n\u2022 the coconut in this reminds me of the sticky\u2019s coconut you get from a bounty chocolate bar, but it also has some sort of \u201cvibe\u201d to it. A fruity vibe, whitch go very well with the lemon. The creamy custard ish taste in it, makes the buttercream along with the buttery note from the angel cake.\r\n\r\nTPA TOASTED ALMOND\r\n\u2022 gives the coconut a slight toasted flavor making it less sticky, so what you get is more of a desiccated coconut type, with a light toast too it. And THAT is what I want in my butter cream!\r\n\r\nCAP LEMON MERINGUE PIE \r\n\u2022 this works as i wanted it to. I get the lemon part of it that i was looking for, and the pie and meringue part just helps the butter cream and the cake part. WONDERFUL!\ud83d\ude0a\r\n\r\nFA LEMON SICILY \r\n\u2022 1% just to brighten up the lemon a bit. Its just not strong enough lemon without it.\r\n\r\nThats it. Hope you will enjoy it as much as i do. This was a fun Challenge. \r\n\r\n",
