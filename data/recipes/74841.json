  "description": "A new twist on Lychee. Paired with sweet strawberry and guava, this is a surprisingly complex profile from a very simple recipe. \r\n\r\nYou’ll get strawberry on the inhale with lychee and guava on the exhale. There’s a bit of a bite Day one, but it smoothes out by day 4 and beyond. \r\n\r\nIt’s really good. Enjoy. \r\n\r\nUpdate* Changed FA Juicy Strawberry to FW Strawberry cos it's just better. :)  Also lowered the Lychee and Guava to help smooth it out. ",
