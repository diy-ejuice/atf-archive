  "description": "I love Cookies and I love Coconut, I want something sweet and coconutty but not a macaroon.  Buttery gewey delicious.  Hoping this is it....lol...this is my first take on it lets see what happens.  I have never worked with Coconut, Buttercream or Brown Sugar before, so this is an adventure for sure.  I would love any advice or comments anyone has...thanks so much.  Love to all...Kitten  \r\n\r\nI mixed a 30ml batch and tried it, it was good but the coconut tasted too much like tanning oil, then I let it sit for a week and tried again....HUGE difference, it tasted like a cookie with coconut.  Tried again after ten days and it had been totally transformed...it is what I was looking for, a buttery sweet coconutty cookie but not a macaroon...I will continue to mix and vape it.....SMILES  :  )",

Standing outside having a vape I decided to give it a try and I can say for sure that this recipe is gonna deliver! You definitely tell that it's gonna need time to steep, but it's not bad at all on the start! I think it'll be just what I'm looking for. Nice job! I'll give it a rating in a week or so because I don't want to underestimate it..üëçüëç"
