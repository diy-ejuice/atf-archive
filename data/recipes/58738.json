  "description": "This one has had so many different iterations that it raises philosophical questions as to whether it's even the same thing it started as. But I think it's finally where I wanted it. I really wanted a bold Tobacco with chocolate and leather undertones. Originally, the chocolate came from INW French Pipe, but it was rather weak in the mix, so I started throwing in some FE tobaccos with it. Eventually, it became clear that it was better without. \r\n\r\nFE Captain doesn't necessarily have a strong chocolate note to it, but it is very rich and has an almost chocolate feeling to it, if that makes sense. \r\n\r\nThe Western was the hardest part of this mix for me. My first test of the TFA version had a cough medicine taste to me, so I've always avoided using it. The first attempt at this profile I used INW Western, which also had a very offensive taste, but I was hoping that mixing it super low and steeping would help it. It did not. To the trash that mix went. Next up was FA Cowboy. It didn't have the cough medicine taste, but it also didn't have a good taste. On to v3 I went. I finally gave TFA Western another shot, and this time things went much better. Either something with my tastebuds changed, or I just had to find the right place for it. Either way, it provides a nice bit of leathery taste here, and also adds a bit of that chocolate nuance. \r\n\r\nFLV Red Burley is in there to add a bit more tobacco and a little bit of earthiness for the Western and Captain to mix with. All together, it ends up a nice strong, bold tobacco flavor. \r\n\r\nDNB and Black Fire in there just doin their thang. Adding a bit of smoke and ash to the mix. As far as steeping goes, the Black Fire will dominate the first couple of days, so bare minimum is about 4 days. Optimal is 2 weeks. \r\n\r\nThis sumbitch may have taken a few months to finally get it where I liked it, but I'm really happy with how it turned out. \r\n\r\n",
