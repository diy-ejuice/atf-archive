  "description": "Coming at you with another tobacco tainted wizardly mix, this is a butterfinger as if it Has been penetrated with a faint tobacco edge :)\r\n\r\nThanks to Phil hailes for sending me a big pack of butterfingers to get this done :) \r\n\r\nEverything is self explanatory when considering we’re recreating a real life chocolate/candy bar, I feel the only concentrate in there that needs the explanation is the cereal 27... this adds crunch but that’s not the only reason... if you watch “gourmet makes” hosted by the channel “Bon apetit” on YouTube then you’ll have seen that they added cornflakes, also, butterfingers have a real salty vibe due to what I think is the peanut butter, so I have used CCW salted caramel to reach that profile.\r\n\r\nIf you like what I do then please rate and review accordingly 😘 ",

Haven't tried it until this, and i have to say its probably the most satisfying desert tobacco ive tried. that salted caramel is another delicious choice, i just wish more people used it! as for this recipe, the hs peanut butter does something to the tobacco thats hard to get away from. awesome mix"
