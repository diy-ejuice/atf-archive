  "name": "Butterscotch Reserve by Glas (A remix)",
  "description": "Normally,i only buy some snv's from time to time,created by mixers i respect, only to support the  diy community.This project was a request from a friend and i just couldn't refuse.Butterscotch reserve by Glas vapor,is a typical RY4 mix,nothing really innovative,it was created for people that enjoy RY4 mixes.The only difference is that they added a honey and alcohol layer,which makes it a little difficult to identify the exact vanilla and caramel flavours.I believe that honey flavour is tobacco based so i went with tpa's Black Honey.The bourbon accent is not really heavy,it is hidden in the background,so i preffered Aged bourbon cream by RF,for the alcohol accent and also for the nice blend it does with other creams.French vanilla is softer and milder than custards and it blends well with tobaccos.RY4double was the obvious flavour for the main tobacco.My first attempt was with tpa's caramel original,but i feel that fw's butterscotch suits much better\r\nSupersweet is optional,i vape it without it,but the original uses it,so mix according to your taste",
