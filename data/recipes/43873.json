  "name": "Chocolate Mint Shake",
  "description": "@MrZigglesworth and I were hanging out the other night and decided to come up with a few recipes, so this is just as much his work as mine. We wanted something refreshing for a summer vape, something that could be an adv. His idea was a chocolate mint shake. There's quite a few versions of shamrock/chocolate mint ice cream, so we took a little bit of a different approach. I think we nailed it first try. The chocolate and mint are both light, but don't get lost. I think that's what makes this easily an adv. Cap Creamy Yogurt really ties everything together and really surprised the hell out of us.",
