    "description": "WIld melon is a key player in this, along with bourbon which is a strong profile had to back it down to .5% so it doesnt overpower the mix.  FLV virginia is a background flavor alittle mild and earthy notes to give support to FLV KY blend, as for Kentucky blend brings full body tobacco and some ash to the mix.\r\nOverall i believe this is an interesting mix ",
