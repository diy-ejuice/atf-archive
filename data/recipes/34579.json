  "description": "Sort of an apple fritter add cinnamon if you like.\r\n\r\nFA Zeppola/FA Apple Pie: Makes up our zeppole. Apple pie has nice bakery notes with a bit of apple shining through and the zeppola takes it to the next level with more powdered sugar, cakeyness and a bit of greasy feel.\r\n\r\nFuji is just boosting our apple note to the front. \r\n\r\nJF Yellow Cake and TPA Bavarian cream here to round everything out. Yellow cake gives just a bit more body without taking away from anything and bavarian cream complements the apple with its darker sweetness. These two kind of unify the zeppola and apple pie into a fritter. (sub CAP yellow cake 1%, FW at .5%). could see sugar cookie working for this purpose but I didn't want it to mute anything or take it too far into cookie land.\r\n\r\nA touch of caramel for good measure.\r\n\r\nHonestly works as S&V but let it chill out  for a couple days",
