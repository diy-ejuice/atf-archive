    "description": "https:\/\/youtu.be\/PtX9xYDJAKY\r\n\r\nNOTE  The recipe has changed from the linked video in peach percentage with the addition of sweetener. The peach was falling a little flat but the sweetener perked it right up. Hope you enjoy!!\r\n\r\n\r\nSorry About the name...LOL  But If you Know Peaches you know she is Special.\r\n\r\nJF Honey Peach - Deep dark peach with notes of honey that don't go cat pee on me\r\n\r\nFLV Cream - Lovely cream flavor here adds body to the mix as well as acts as a blender to mix everything together\r\n\r\nFA White Peach - A nice bright peach to add some juciness and a great peach flavor when combined with the other peach. This peach for me had no throat hit after the steep\r\n\r\nLB Vanilla Ice Cream - A wonderful creamy light vanilla ice cream Type of flavor if you search hard you can find a little eggyness and has a great mouthfeel\r\n\r\nINW Shisha Vanilla - This adds some more vanilla and helps to add to the mouthfeel as well.  This is IMO a great versatile  vanilla.",
