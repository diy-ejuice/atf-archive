  "description": "Maybe trying to do too much here, but the taste off the shake was pretty good.  I had to take it away from myself to make sure I had something to sample after the steep.  Basically took elements found in some of my favorite custards, and tried bringing them together.  Game Changer, Thick Vanilla Custard\r\n Mama J's Game Over.  Turned out to be pretty tasty.  The Banana cream combined with the Coconut make for a nice surprise on the exhale.  Mix it up,  and I dare someone to rate it.  \r\n  https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/166911#the_game_changer_by_furiousmixer  \r\nhttps://alltheflavors.com/recipes/69566#thick_vanilla_custard_by_aquaneo\r\nhttps://alltheflavors.com/recipes/103411#mama_js_game_over_custard_by_wllmc\r\n",
