  "description": "Strawberry & Apple Crumble Custard Batch 5/10 PG25/75VG 6mg nicotine\r\nSo i hope when you vape this Recipe. You get Strawberry's and apples with a hint of Cinnamon topped with a lovely crisp Crumble topping. With a small pour of Thick Vanilla Custard .\r\nI went with a Strawberry & Apple Crumble Custard as i have always been a BIG fan and Crumbles are so good in the fall. So i wanted a lovely sweet bakery pudding with the flavors we was given to use. I love this Strawberry & Apple Crumble with Custard i just hope you guys do too\r\n\r\nStrawberry (Ripe) (TPA) at 6%     Which was the best place for me. As it is quite a week flavor and i wanted it to be prominent and hold up with the apple and mainly the Cinnamon and Cereal 27. and at the 6% you get Strawberry and not just sweetness from the EM. And it holds up well with the rest of the flavors.\r\n\r\nFuji Apple (FA) at 3%     I used at 3% because its pretty strong but i still wanted to be a main part of the recipe. And it goes well with Strawberry Ripe and Great with the Cinnamon Danish Swirl v2 so it needed to come over in the vape. And i think it does that very well in this Recipe\r\n\r\nCinnamon Danish Swirl v2 (Cap) 1%      I used at 1% as i don't want to much Cinnamon. But don't want to use it lower as i may look like i did not use it in the correct way. But it works well surprisingly with the Strawberry at 1%. Cinnamon it can die off a bit 2 weeks on wards. But for me any higher it makes this recipe to much of a Cinnamon vape and takes away from the Strawberry ripe.\r\n\r\nCereal 27 (Cap) i used at 4% which is a good place to be i feel. To bring out that dark bakery note its the heart of the Crumble. I know its not the correct flavor to use but i feel it gives it more of a Crumble than a pie note which is what is needed in this recipe. And it worked out well i think with out making it to much of a cereal vape.\r\n\r\nCookie (fa) at 3% to go with the Crumble for that biscuit crunch and add to Cereal 27. i tried Graham Cracker v2 (CAP) and Sugar Cookie v2 (CAP) but they did not work as well.\r\n Sugar Cookie v2 (CAP) i feel was good but it needed to be used at 5% and i feel it was pushing the flavor total is a lot higher then i wanted it to be. As it's already at 21% flavor  total which is higher then i usually have in Recipes. And FA Cookie just worked better here tbh.\r\nGraham Cracker v2 was good as it helped with the Cinnamon and it has a bit of Cinnamon in it. But it took away form the Strawberry and was not as good as i hoped in Batch10  FA cookie in taste was better with the Crumble that i wanted.\r\n\r\nVanilla Custard v2 (Cap) at 4% i added Custard to add weight and a the Custard note for that pudding feel. but i did not want to much Custard as i thought it would take away from the fruit base and the Crumble. But i still wanted to taste Custard and not just a creamery note any lower than 4% Vanilla Custard v2 just gives the creamery note and  weight to me. And not so much of that Thick Custard mouth feel that i'm after.\r\n\r\nI used Cinnamon Danish Swirl v2 (Cap)  Vanilla Custard v2 as i do not vape Diketones if i can help it. I do understand that this Recipe maybe mixed in the competition with Cinnamon Danish Swirl V1 and Vanilla Custard V1 which is fine i just hope my Strawberry & Apple Crumble Custard Recipe works as well as i have not tried it with V1s so fingers crossed \r\nits an ok shake and vape but much better after 3 days steep i feel. \r\n\r\nA Big THANK YOU to the Beginner Blending team its been fun for me just to enter the competition i hope i can go on to the next round. But if not thanks away and thanks for the Podcast i love it so keep it up guys :)",
