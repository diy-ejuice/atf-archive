    "description": "This recipe started as an evolution but really it's a revolution in mixing.\r\n\r\nWhat other recipe in DIY can you sub almost everything with another and it's still good?\r\n\r\nWhat began as a remix to \"Oreo's in custard\" has evolved into something even more special.\r\n\r\nThis is a mouth full of all day vape off the shake but best in a week.\r\n\r\nI have subbed nearly every ingredient in this recipe and each time it's been a success. If you have only got VTA Vanilla buttercream frosting, that works. Inawera custard rather than TFA VII works well.\r\n\r\nNo sugar cookie? use JF Cookie. Haven't got one ingredient leave it out or throw in 3%5% of FW Butterscotch Ripple.\r\n\r\nTry subbing the cookie for a Molinberry version, it won't hurt it.\r\n\r\nAdd some fruit like bananas, berries ect and it will hold up nicely.\r\n\r\nMake it even fatter in mouthfeel by adding some FLV Vanilla Marshmallow? Maybe even sub in some cheesecake? Regardless it will hold up beautifully!\r\n\r\nIn over 4 years of mixing I haven't seen a recipe that is as constantly versatile and delicious as this is to work off.\r\n\r\nHave fun with it & enjoy the evolution!",
