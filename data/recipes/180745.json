    "description": "A fairly simple flavor profile of blueberry and pomegranate. Thanks ediblemalfunction for the blueberry trinity used in this recipe.\r\n\r\nFlavor Choices\r\n\r\nThe blueberry\r\n\r\nas described above the blueberry trinity was implemented. A very good combo of 3 different blueberry flavorings.\r\n\r\nBlueberry FW\r\nBlueberry Extra TFA\r\nBilberry FA\r\n\r\nMy original version of this didn't have Bilberry FA in it, which was also good in its own right. I just wanted to try it with the bilberry added in and percentages adjusted.\r\n\r\nPomegranate\r\n\r\nPretty simple, I just used TFA's Pom for this. Tasty stuff at 2-3% range. I like the subtle almost \"sourness\" this flavor gives, yet I wouldn't say floral, but I could see it becoming floral at higher percentages.",
