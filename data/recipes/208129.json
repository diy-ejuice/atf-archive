  "description": "I bring you another recipe created during our live stream this last Sunday. Every week @lediybr and @madmixer create a new recipe together.\r\n\r\nWe present you with a Kiwi Lemonade with a touch of Cantaloupe. This is the second version and we were very satisfied with the results. A complex vape with unique notes and a combination of textures. Without further ado, here are the notes!\r\n\r\n**LA Lemonade e VT Sour Lemon**\r\nThese two make up the lemonade base, LA having a more base note and that lemonade drink texture. VT comes into play on the top note along with the other fruits while enhancing the lemon notes.\r\n\r\n**FLV Cantaloupe**\r\nDon't be fooled by the percentage used, this is a very strong flavor and it brings the natural notes of a cantaloupe. We really had to tone down the first recipe's percentage because of its strength.\r\n\r\n**FW Kiwi e FA Kiwi**\r\nFA Kiwi was used since we wanted to take this recipe towards a natural fruit mix, it is also a base flavor that contributes to the juiciness of the mix. FW Kiwi comes into play for its acidic top notes.\r\n\r\n**WF African Horned Cucumber**\r\nLast but not least important, this is a very authentic and unique flavor. It brings all types of notes into the recipe such as citric, tropical, sweetness, as well as a creamy yet juicy texture. This is a very complex flavor and it sits really well in the mix giving it a singular taste, enhancing the tropical notes of the Cantaloupe as well as the sour notes of the lemon, also contributing to the natural essence of this recipe. Without this flavor, this wouldn't be as attractive as it is.\r\n\r\nSuper Sweet is here to help pop all the wonderful notes found in the recipe. If you mix this and like it, please rate and comment on it. Enjoy!",
