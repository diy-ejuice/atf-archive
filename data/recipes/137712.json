  "description": "flavor pro challenge - I am not sure that cam blend is actually a wine.  I tasted it on my hand and it might be a tobacco which I think would go fine here too but it is kinda sour too so I am unclear on what it is.  I guess I should single flavor test it huh?  Anyway a bunch of strawberries with a little chocolate and whatever cam blend is and coffee is to back the chocolate as I find they make a good pairing.  Also I couldn't locate my super sweet so not a very sweet combo but i often leave out sweetener.  Not tested yet.  I will give it at least a day steep before doing so.  Then update here.  okay found out it IS a tobacco which should work fine anyway - but it needs a longer steep.  Will update in a few weeks.",
