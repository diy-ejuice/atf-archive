    "description": "simple gummy type recipe   - if you are making a jelly bean or gummies you want  to keep the flavor profile simple and use a central  flavor that will really pop, much as you get with a gummy or jelly bean candy .   if you are adding a marshmallow ,  cap Jelly candy , vanilla swirl or menagerie keep them low and use as an additive for mouth feel - or it can mute the main note .   The 27 bears  is a great gummie  base  but it does add  a slight pineapple back note that really works here  helping to push the strawberry upfront- \r\n\r\nyou could add TFA  straberry or   FA juicy strawberry  to really enhance the strawberry - as it is a candid strawberry but Liquid barn strawberry cheesecake is a solid strong flavor  with some creaminess add by the cheesecake at the recommend percentage. This is good as a shake and vape but needs 3 days to come together",
