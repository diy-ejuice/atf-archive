  "description": "Blue team members: @ID10-T @Millions81 @modivin\r\n\r\n Dr. Seuss wrote silly children's books. But he also cheated on his wife while she was sick and drove her to suicide. He was a stone cold prick.\r\n\r\n‚ÄúI am too old and enmeshed in everything you do and are, that I cannot conceive of life without you,‚Äù read her suicide note. ‚ÄúMy going will leave quite a rumor, but you can say I was overworked and overwrought. Your reputation with your friends and fans will not be harmed.‚Äù\r\n\r\nWe went to that cold dark place, and you can, too. The dark berries, prickly cactus, and ice cold are self-explanatory. The bit of blood orange is there to remind you while you're reading Horton Hears a Who that Dr. Seuss's wife's blood is on his hands.\r\n\r\nCome join us on Discord! https://discord.gg/ufVTyAQ",

      "text": "The bilberry and blueberry make for a dark fruity body that is the core of this flavor. The cactus actually packs a punch here, first time i've come across this flavor being used prominently as opposed to just for the juiciness. The icy chill works well here, as does that little touch of blood orange for contrast. For me though, the dragonfruit and the bit of sweetener are what make this work brilliantly. The former adds a tiny tropical vibe to go with that blood orange, and a ton of juiciness, but it's the sweetener at this amount...in addition to making it all just pop, it adds just enough sweetness to keep me coming back to this dark, rich, slightly painful but in the right way juice.&#xD;\n&#xD;\nIt really tells the story you're gunning for here. I think i'm in love with this stuff. Will definitely be making more."
