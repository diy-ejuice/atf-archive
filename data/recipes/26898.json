  "description": "sub 4% cap ny cheesecake or 4% tpa cheesecake graham crust if you donâ€™t have fw\r\nsub 1% tpa graham cracker clear if you do not have fw\r\nI am a inw raspberry molina junkie. in my opinion there is not a better single raspberry. it is sweet and authentic of a very ripe raspberry. as with most ink flavors (especially fruits) they are authentic to the point that some may even get the greens/leafy hint as if the fruit was eaten directly from the plant. the raspberry runner up for me is definitely tpa raspberry sweet, its like the raspberry sibling of tpa strawberry ripe. I find that it helps keep the raspberry balanced from being either too authentic or too artificial with its tart and sweet properties.\r\nonce again fa custard used for its slight lemon note that helps keep fruit flavors prominent even after a steep especially helpful in heavier cream type recipes. fw lemon meringue pie also helps to add to the texture and sweetness while assisting the raspberry brightness. if you do not yet have cap vanilla whipped cream just get it. it has replaced fa whipped cream not only because I think it tastes better but also because it is very readily available. i like whipped cream on any and all desserts and cap whipped cream gives me that dollop of sweet fluffy dairy goodness.",
