  "description": "I saw BigRed's Sad Boy Blueberry Jam Cookie in the #DIYorDIE discord awhile back and I finally managed to get OOO Strawberry Jam in so....\r\n\r\nFirst, I pushed the Strawberry Jam pretty high...not many using this at 4% that I seen but it scaled well imo with 0 off notes or anything getting weird.\r\nIt did lack actual strawberry vibrancy or pop I found, as It's a cooked down jam, so I added 2% TFA Strawberry and  .50% Super Sweet. Problem solved.\r\n\r\nWith a more bold, balanced, sweet AF strawberry jelly out of the way, all I need was a buttery sweet cookie to surround it with.\r\nI chose a heavy dose of Sugar Cookie 6% because it would scale well up high with the  OOO Strawberry Jam.\r\n\r\nI backed it up with a firm cookie they call a Biscuit in the UK. The buttery cookie note, texture and \"snap\" that Biscuit(INW) brings worked well.\r\n\r\n*the Butter base keeps them from sticking to the pan*\r\n\r\nGood to go off a shake,  just give it enough time to let the bubbles settle...best after 3 days + imo\r\n\r\nThis recipe was tested and designed on the Haku single Clapton at .54ohms at 50W and the Moonshot RTA at .56ohms at 42 watts\r\n@s2k on ELR\r\n\r\n",
