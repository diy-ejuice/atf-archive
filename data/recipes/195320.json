  "name": "Bourbon Pecan Pie - Simple Recipe",
  "description": "Super simple recipe. \r\n\r\nIf you don't have OSDIY Lucky Shot get it - it's delicious! When I tasted it I immediately thought it was everything WF Butter Pecan Pie was missing. A bakery type crust and some dark gooey-ness. Lucky Shot is basically a one shot and already pretty complex, so I wanted to keep the mix simple. I've been looking to make a bourbon pecan recipe for a while and TFA Kentucky Bourbon fits so well in this mix. \r\n\r\nThis recipe is easy to alter the percentages and customise to your own tastes. \r\nGive it at least 3 days steep.\r\n\r\nIf you mix it I hope you enjoy it!",
