    "description": "I took Wayne's Yeo Layer crossed with the creams and honeysuckle from ID10-T's Longing, added a hefty dose of Holy Vanilla, and applied a sprinkling of FA Coconut . . . this is The White Hummingbird.\r\nSweet rice is the main note here layered on top of a warm, sweet honeysuckle-laced vanilla cream.  For me, it's a very satisfying vape . . . sweet, savory, warm, and slightly floral.  I mixed up 30mL, shook it like hell, and let it rest for 24 hours before trying it.  It will be interesting to see what happens as this continues to age . . . as it stands, I'm thinking I should mix up another because this bottle may not last long enough to find out. \r\nMuch respect to ENYAWREKLAW and ID10-T for the exceptional resources they provide to the DIY community!\r\n\r\nGreen Hummingbird quick notes . . . dropped honeysuckle and Holy Vanilla percentages . . . switched FA Coco' to TPA Coconut Candy.  Added Basil and Green Tea . . . will probably adjust both a bit higher.",

I guess the basil would brighten the green tea, so I will try that next month with my next order. But do try this one out. It is creamy, slightly floral, and a nice rice base and green tea accent. I love it. Thank you for sharing this recipe. "
