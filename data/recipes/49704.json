  "description": "This milk is  so rich, creamy and smooth! I basically made a baby with all of the other milk recipes out there and took some of the best parts and combined them all into one milk. \r\n\r\nI am a huge S&C fan and as a new mixer wanted to make up my own iteration of an S&C to see how it goes. You can pretty much vape it right away but i do suggest at least 3-5 days of steeping to give the flavors time to bind and settle some.\r\n\r\nUpdate: Dropped the Dragonfruit 1% just for better overall balance but you can still keep it at 6% if you liked the extra kick the dragonfruit gives the profile. \r\n\r\n\r\nInspired by God Milk, Mother of God's Milk and Dragon's Milk\r\n\r\n***If you mix this, please leave a review and let me know what you think or if you think there is something that could be changed to make it better!***",
