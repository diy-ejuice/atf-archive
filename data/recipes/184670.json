I\u2019m not a fan of sweet flavors so I cut the fw sweetener in half and am very happy with the result. I may bump it up to .75% just to see what it does, but as it stands this is the kind of flavor that\u2019ll give me a brief break from mixing! Too good. Thanks guys. &#xD;\nEDIT 2-25: had a second bottle steeping for a week and yeah, this flavor wins vaping. Where has this been"
