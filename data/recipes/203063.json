    "description": "Just a nice simple and easy soft black licorice candy recipe, and also my first attempted mix with the FW Black Licorice flavor.  It's a satisfyingly bold flavor with the cheesecake adding some smoothness and a touch of creaminess.   Great as a Shake and Vape flavor!  \r\nThe effect of steeping is as of yet unknown. I'll be updating this description later once I've had a chance to let a bottle or two steep for a while.",
