  "description": "My entry into the Beginner Blending MIXXED competition.\r\n\r\nI originally aimed for a CinnApple Danish with strawberry whipped cream, while I was mixing and batching, it hit me that i was getting a more of a cereal note from the original mix. I pushed forward and I think the mixed turned out really well. You get the Cinnamon and apple cereal upfront and then a strawberry milk on the back note. I really hope you enjoy it.\r\n\r\n",
