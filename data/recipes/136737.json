  "description": "Posh Squash\r\n\r\nTrendy cordials or squash has been a big trend around the world for many years where you see big leading companies and smaller marketers competing to bring out the next big thing especially when it comes to fruits which overtime has seen some amazing pairings that widely differ from the squashes that I remember drinking in my childhood. I can only say we are now spoiled from what was originally a saturated market of orange and black current varieties.\r\n\r\nSo here’s a take on the classy more upmarket varieties based on a off the shelf brand which sees a blend of raspberry,rhubarb and blossom orange combined with apple juice. It’s truly delicious and balanced and the only thing missing is summer!!!\r\n\r\nNotes........\r\n\r\nCap sweet tangerine/FLV Blood orange\r\n\r\nThere’s many ways to combine oranges which is definitely a debate for another day. I didn’t want to go down the FanTastic orange route especially with the amount of ingredients there to create that orange flavour so it needed slimming down. I wanted something realistic especially this being a beverage vape so cap sweet tangerine fits the recipe perfect. It’s bright and vibrant and very realistic and adds plenty of juiceness and with the addition of FLV blood orange adds a little more authenticity,tang and zest. \r\n\r\nINW Raspberry/TFA Raspberry Sweet \r\n\r\nAgain these 2 raspberries don’t need any introduction they’re proven Raspberry staples amongst the diy community. The combination of the 2 gives a somewhat authentic Raspberry with INW being very realistic while the TFA adds some sweetness and syrup.\r\n\r\nINW Rhubarb \r\n\r\nHands down the holy grail of rhubarb no more words needed. Keep this flavour low and it provides a authentic rhubarb that just works in any direction you need to go. I’ve had this up to 1% while developing this recipe and it does work higher up the range but it will mute certain flavours within the recipe but if intense rhubarb is your thing feel free to up the percentage to 1% for a more tart tab laughing experience.\r\n\r\nTFA Dragonfruit \r\n\r\nThis is not necessarily a flavour that’s required it’s not doing much but by adding it,it will pop the raspberry and makes it brighter infact I feel it makes all fruits brighter and prevents foreground flavours being lost especially when using something as aggressive as INW Rhubarb. With its addition it prevents the recipe from being dry so wherever you get dryness within recipe developing a touch of Dragonfruit can seriously prevent this.\r\n\r\nCap Double Apple \r\n\r\nThis was a flavour that I didn’t anticipate using for the said recipe only befit wasn’t on the said bottles label. So why is it included? It’s always advisable to read the ingredients I was surprised when I seen it in the ingredients however I thought I’d try it and I wasn’t disappointed including it. Apple definitely adds something of a base flavour to pair other fruits around and maybe they had a reason to use it. Everything blends very well into the Apple without taking any of the flavours in other directions. I didn’t want to take the Apple flavour into anything too advanced so I kept it simple. Cap double apple fits the bill perfectly providing juiciness and some authenticity. I could of used Fuji but that flavour does overpower somewhat and could of confused the recipe. Basically the Apple is there without noticing it if that makes sense.\r\n\r\nFLV Cherry Blossom \r\n\r\nOriginally a orange blossom would of been a better choice however it’s a flavour not widely available so I had to bend something else that I already had and one that is pretty well described to what it is,however this is only true if used right after all adding cherry would probably ruin the recipe. FLV cherry blossom is perfect and has that blossom floral elements without being overpowering. If kept really low you get what you need out the flavour without contributing any cherry notes. Perfect!!!.\r\n\r\nCap Super Sweet\r\n\r\nI like any beverage related vape with a little sweetener it’s more there for my preference but add or dismiss to your liking \r\n\r\nAdd WS23 for a cooler vape anything between 0.5-3%\r\n\r\nEnjoy xxx\r\n\r\nDon’t forget to support my work by heading over to chefsflavours.co.uk and purchasing oneshots from the Divine Oneshot range.",
