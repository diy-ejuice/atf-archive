  "description": "Delicious, creamy spoonfuls of Strawberry Yogurt. FW Yogurt, CAP Creamy Yogurt and FA Madagascar Vanilla provide the backbone for a perfect yogurt base here. Feel free to change the fruit up in the recipe. In fact, I encourage you to experiment and come up with some wonderful versions of the yogurt. Here, I used my go-to combo of TPA Strawberry Ripe and JF Sweet Strawberry to achieve my desired fresh, but just sweet enough strawberries. Give the mix two weeks to fully steep.",

CAP Creamy Yogurts does not have such a heavy tang to it, so its a good introduction into yogurts. This reminds me of a High End Strawberry Drinking Yogurt - Great stuff. Thanks for this one!"
