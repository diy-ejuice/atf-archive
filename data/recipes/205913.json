  "description": "The Muffin/Cake base here uses FLV Blueberry Muffin, FLV Pound Cake, with Boysenberry to bring the blueberry more forward. FLV Pastry Zest was used to boost the bakery notes, along with FLV Frosting for the glaze.\r\nThis turned out quite delicious.\r\nI recommend the sweetener to make it more realistic, was not the same without it\r\n\r\nTested with Recurve single coil RDA, 3 MM Fused clapton .20 OHMS around 60 watts",
