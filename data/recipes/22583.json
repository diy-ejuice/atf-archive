    "description": "An authentic Banana Twinkie, using no sweeteners!\r\n\r\nThe Cream Filling (TPA Banana Cream 3%, TPA Bavarian Cream 3%): The key here is how well these two are blending, while staying separate from the cake. TPA Banana Cream isn't too authentic, which makes it right for what we're emulating.\r\n\r\nThe Cake Base (JF Yellow Cake 2.5%, CAP Vanilla Cupcake 4%): Even though the cake we're emulating looks really yellow, any more YC than this gives us the wrong flavor. Still needing more cakey-ness, CAP Vanilla Cupcake is a perfect match in flavor.\r\n\r\nCAP Butter Cream 1.5%: This flavoring is really special in the mouth-feel department. It makes the cake seem oily, without making things too heavy. It's also very sweet, which this recipe needs.\r\n\r\nFA Soho 0.5%: Soho makes a great replacement for acetyl pyrazine (which it seems to be rich in). Helps to give a cooked effect, or a crust, to bakeries.\r\n\r\n2 week steep suggested. The flavor and texture changes considerably after the first week. Developed at 70\/30.",
