    "description": "An amazing cloned recipe by u\/project_twenty5oh1 he put in a ton of work into this spot on clone a few years back and is one of my ADV. I have found that the menthol that works for me is .5%-.7% fw extreme ice to make the Polar Bear clone. Personally I don't use the heating mixer and I just mix and shake and it's perfect for me.\r\n\r\nOriginal post on Reddit: https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/electronic_cigarette\/comments\/2lsbi1\/in_celebration_of_reaching_25000_comment_karma_on\/?st=IX3QN6MB&sh=29e41527\r\n\r\n\"u\/project_twenty5oh1\"\r\nHello all,\r\nI've been working for the past several months solely on a polar bear clone. I've talked to many juicers, many diyers, and had many people test it, and I'm happy enough with it that I feel comfortable sharing the fruits of my labor. For those who don't DIY, TFA = The Flavor Apprentice (or the Perfumer's Apprentice) one of the main companies used by juice vendors.\r\n\r\n6.0% TFA DK Base\r\n5.0% TFA Banana Cream\r\n3.0% TFA Banana Nut Bread\r\n1.0% TFA Bananas Foster\r\n3.0% TFA Peanut Butter\r\n0.3% TFA Koolada\r\n0.2% TFA Coconut Extra\r\n0.3% TFA Smooth\r\n1.0% Strong Mint\/Menthol Concentrate\r\nTake out the mint\/menthol and you get Nanner. My suggestion is to use Axiom's Icicles (the concentrate of which is used as the mint\/menthol in Polar Bear) - you could order 0mg from Axiom and use it as a flavor ingredient, reducing VG appropriate to even out the concentration; Icicles is 20% concentrate, so if you made a 100ml bottle you would need 5ml of Icicles juice to reach 1% concentration in the Polar bear.\r\nNow, some notes on process. After discussions with some juicers, we came to the conclusion that a heated magnetic stirrer is the likely culprit for the \"process\" that Grizzly uses for their juice, and that it's not really completely ready right away after mixing (as I'm sure they'd like us to believe) but that you mix using this process, and then 3-4 days later it's reached shelf stability. The juice I made last Saturday is exactly the right color of Polar Bear now (bonus reusing polar bottle!), so I'm pretty sure i've got it right. This process works for any juice you mix, and makes trying a mix you're fiddling with much, much faster.\r\nBasically, I cook the juice for 4-8 hours in a heated magnetic stirrer at a constant 75c. The stirrer has a temperature probe which will equalize the temp inside the flask with the temp of the hotplate, so there's no guesswork as to whether you've hit the right temp (such as using a water bath or heated ultrasonic). Here's some before and after shots of a 1500ml batch I made:\r\nIngredients initially mixed and the vortex stabilized, temp reached, begin cook time\r\nFour hours later\r\nThe end result is a Nanner\/Polar clone that has the following attributes:\r\n\r\n1) It doesn't gunk up cotton or coils. Myself and others have found that you can go at least two weeks without changing cotton, and when you remove it there is no discoloration. What this says about nanner\/polar may be that it has some ingredient that contains a sweetener, or sweetener is added, I don't really know.\r\n\r\n2) This relates to 1; it's not as sweet as the real thing, which I've found I quite like, while retaining all the inherent flavor attributes that make it such a good juice.\r\n\r\n3) It costs $1.20\/30ml.\r\nIf you have any questions about using the stirrer or anything about the process please feel free to ask. My entire plan for this juice was to open source it, and I've been selling it for $10\/100ml (up to 1L) plus shipping. Really just double the cost of materials, I'm just happy people have been enjoying affordable juice I made. I encourage you to try this recipe and see if you can figure out what is missing to make it a really true clone, or make your own improvements! Let me know what you come up with :)\r\nHere is a link to the heated magnetic stirrer I've been using- you will need to buy stir bars and flasks separately, but they all can be found on amazon. This is also a nifty gadget for other things that require constant mixing and fixed temperature.\r\n\r\nHere's what my fridge looks like after I cooked up 4L last weekend, 2L 6mg Polar and 2L 3mg Nanner: \r\n\r\nhttp:\/\/imgur.com\/Ta5ImD2\r\n\r\nPolar Bear was the first juice I found (after trying HUNDREDS) which I could vape and vape and vape and never get sick of. I bought easily 80+ bottles of it. I've vaped more than a liter of my own version in its current iteration, and I love it. I won't be going back to buying juice, ever.\r\nTL;DR: Recipe is at the top. #kickbacks, #crucifixions, #Bigglesjuice, #wheredeyatdoe, #hashtag.\r\nEDIT: This recipe works GREAT at 0mg!\r\nEDIT AGAIN: Pimp for \/r\/diy_ejuice!\r\n\r\n",
