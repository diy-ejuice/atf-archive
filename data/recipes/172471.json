  "description": "Happy Halloween!!\r\nSeemed like a good day to drop this recipe.  My humble attempt at recreating the blueberry marshmallow breakfast cereal. I think it comes pretty close.\r\nThis is my finalized version of the DIY Mixer's Crew FB Group Cereal Challenge. Few tweaks from what I posted there, it had to be finished.\r\n\r\n**Cereals:** Berry crunch main note, LL cereal for the AP & marshmallows. *see subs* WF marshmallow (candy) for a little more fake marshmallow flavor. Fw bb to turn it into a boo berry type. \r\nMy one other thought on this that I've got on paper but not mixed yet just uses tpa crunch cereal & blueberry. If you get too much mixed berry you could probably sub that at about 2%. Lmk how it is if you do, I'm cerealed out for now.\r\n\r\n**Milk:** flv smoothie base for it's lemon tint to boost the blueberry & creaminess. Fa milk because it's the shit.\r\n\r\nDash of sweetener because it is a sweet cereal.\r\n \r\n\r\n**Steep:** Give 5-7 days for milk to do it's thing & meld with Smoothie Base. Like most things a week+ will give a better representation of what I was going for. Should be a nice blueberry heavy berry cereal w\\marshmallows.\r\nEnjoy ðŸ˜ŽðŸ’¨ðŸ’¨\r\nJoin DIY Mixer's Crew on Facebook!\r\nhttps://www.facebook.com/groups/dmcdiy\r\n\r\n**Subs\\additions:** I'm sure your favorite milk combo would work in place of the smoothie base\\fa milk combo. Would advise adding a little lemon though to make up for the lack of smoothie base to stay closer to original. I highly recommend this flavor though. \r\nTpa crunch cereal @ 2% instead of berry crunch if you hate it.\r\nThe wf marshmallow candy isn't a deal breaker in my eyes for this recipe to work, just helps to sell the marshmallow. Could probably be subbed (nothing real & not tpa. Also remember what's in lucky leprechaun to start)  or omitted.",
