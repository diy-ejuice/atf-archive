    "description": "A thick, layered custard slice adorned with honeycomb. \r\n\r\nFILLING\r\nThe filling is comprised of my unfailing 1-2-3 brulee stone with the br\u00fbl\u00e9e knocked down ever so slightly. I have been using this base for a while now & it keeps on delivering.  To me, the is a pre-eminent custard which just works magically here...Thick an d creamy oral pleasure...\r\n\r\nPastry Layer\r\nI recently discovered WF Croissant and very impressed with it's brilliant performance. It manages to encapsulate the delicate croissant pasty notes perfectly and with relative ease. A touch of FA cookie provides a bit of texture to round of the pastry layer.\r\n\r\nVT honeycomb is a remarkable revelation and allows us to mix honey based recipes with confidence. This provides a subtle honey note with a touch of texture to bring this recipe alive! \r\n\r\nGive this baby 5 days to settle...",

You even get the buttery pastry notes thanks to WF croissant and FA cookie working in harmony together. INW Creme brulee and VT Honeycomb are a delicious combo and add a rich,bright caramel\/toffee top note and finishes this recipe off in a satisfying way. Do yourself a favour and mix this up but rather than cracking into it at 5days leave it for 2-3 weeks and be transported to vape bliss. Well done Rudi 5 star recipe buddy,thank you for sharing! \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb"

UPDATE:  I made a 120ml and after testing after 5 days,  thought, I remember this being so much better, put it back into the steep closet and forgot about it for a couple of weeks.  At day 21, I  tested again and I said, oh there it is.  It went from good to great.  For me, a 5 day steep is almost a sin, but hey, it's DIY and that's only my opinion.    Thanks for kindly sharing your work, sir."

Steeped 6 days before testing on BTFC dual coil with a build too low to list on a mech so the watts are up there. Mixed a 60ml and will likely mix another 60ml. Thanks for sharing this mix!&#xD;\n"
