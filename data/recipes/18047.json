    "description": "I added a bit of strawberry and blueberry to kick up the fruit flavor a little. Feel free to sub any sweet strawberry flavor if you do not have this one. It is just there to add a little oomph. I used 2 different crunch berry cereals as one has more berry and the other has more crunch.\r\n\r\nIt needs a minimum of 2 week steep. 3 weeks would be better.",
