  "description": "A clone of the juice that got me in to DIY. Didn't realize I didn't have this on ATF. Just dripped a little that I made a little over 3 months ago, and it ages just as well as the real deal. If you've ever had Indigo's juices, you probably loved them. I know I do. This was like my holy grail for DIY, and it didn't come together until I got FE Hongtashan. From all the research I've done trying to clone this, Hongtashan was the missing link. Once I tested it, everything fell right in to place. ",

      "text": "been meaning to take the time to rate this for a good long while. this recipe is such a great example of what restrained use of vaguely unknown but great flavors can produce when someone takes the time to experiment with them. it's a lovely deep caramelly tobacco- a dessert tobacco recipe for sure but not lacking in actual tobacco flavor like your standard ry4 stuff. the hongtashan is the star of the show- what an interesting flavor this one- i would have never bought it if not for this recipe and now i've been using it in almost everything. the soft cinnamon is so interesting- and honestly i can and do vape this almost SNV- it's totally good to go after 24hours for sure. but yes it improves with time. A++ recipe, thanks again."
