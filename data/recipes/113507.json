  "description": "WF Galia Melon @ 2% Is an earthy , rinney and rip tasting Melon , coupled with the Cap Honey Dew Melon @ 1% made this melon very enjoyable.. and even now i think adding FLV's Melon would further enlighten this recipe, but that's for V2...WF Champagne Soda was used to give it that soda spritz and add alittle body to the mix..The Cap Cool Mint was added to give a refreshing cool undertone to the mix, thats what  mint tends to do.....\r\nAnd lastly the Cap Super sweet .. was added to round out the  rough edges ..... enjoy and please leave feedback ..thats the only way we all become better mixxers.......",
