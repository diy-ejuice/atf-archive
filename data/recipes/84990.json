    "description": "A hip granola tobacco vape, as hipster-icious as they get. It's bold, it's woody, it's nutty, it's got dried fruit, it's sophisticated, complex and will keep you interested for hours. I'm in love with FLV Granola and I had to share this recipe because this wonderful flavor needs more love (and recipes for it).\r\n\r\nFlavor notes:\r\n\r\nFLV Granola: The star of the show. Really great as a cereal vape if you help it with some crunch,  and so unique that I had to test it with tobacco after the first SFT. It's a strong flavor with lots of stuff going on in it and I'm surprised I had to use it above 1%, but it's in company with very complex and deep tobacco.\r\n\r\nFLV Cured \/ FLV Red Burley: Two of the greatest tobacco flavors known to mankind. The Burley is here just to give volume and depth to Cured.\r\n\r\nFLV Bourbon: Not a full bourbon flavor by itself, but its dark oak notes fit so well with FLV Cured.\r\n\r\nFLV Oatmeal Raisin: Granola may carry some raisin notes but they are vague and to me they're more dried fruit candy than raisins. Oatmeal Raisin has different fresh raisin notes that make your granola even hipper.\r\nCareful with it, a drop per 10-15ml is enough. Try the recipe without it if you don't have it, but consider getting it if you like raisins, it's the Rich Cinnamon of raisin flavors, it will last you forever.\r\n\r\nThis is not a bad shake-and-vape but FLV flavors are very concentrated and need some time and shaking to saturate the VG. The percentages might get tweaked after the first test batches pass the month mark.\r\n\r\nVariations:\r\nA. Skip the raisin and add 0.75% FLV Sweet Coconut (and  amplify it with 0.15% FLV Coconut if it's too light for you) to throw some candied coconut in your granola and take the entire recipe into Castle Long territory.\r\nB. Skip the raisin and add 1.5% DIYFS Holly Vanilla if you need some vanilla with your tobacco. If the Holly Vanilla\/FLV Cured combo is too woody for your taste, add 2% CAP French Vanilla. If you're tempted to try other vanillas like INW Shisha or Vanilla Swirl, beware most of them will mud the tobacco part. \r\nC. Skip the FLV tobaccos and raisin and add 4% FA Soho. A very different experience but just as good (I was actually thinking of releasing a seperate recipe for Soho) \r\n\r\nSubs:\r\nFLV Cured \/ FLV Red Burley: If you have mixed with these (or FLV Native) you can play around with the tobacco part of the recipe to suit your taste better, but I have to say Cured was the best match when I initially tried pairing FLV Granola with various tobaccos. You could always try the Soho variation.\r\nFLV Bourbon: Try 0.5% of TPA Red Oak\r\n",
