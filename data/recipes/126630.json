  "description": "EDIT: OK, anything below is out the window. It's gone through so many changes since I posted this that the profile has nothing to do with where I began or was striving for. HOWEVER, it came out to be a really tasty vape so that's why I'm leaving it up. \r\n\r\nWas trying to emulate my favorite pipe tobacco I used to roll into cigarettes back in the day. It kind of took a turn when the profile matched, but the experience was just meh. Added some depth with the fruit and it rounded out nicely but nowhere close to what I was going for. Incredibly smooth. \r\n\r\nThis is one of those, that if you don't have all the flavors, you can probably mix and match, but if you're getting sick of the same fruit/desert mixes, winter is rolling around and you need a change, go for the Nic Riv splurge and get em all. You need these in your pantry anyways. \r\n\r\n\r\n",
