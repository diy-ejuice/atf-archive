  "name": "PISTACHIO RY4 OLD SCHOOL (Mtl)",
  "description": "After countless tests and recipes I keep coming back to this one. I know the percentages are high but after research and development reading interviews with the originator Matt Topolski  of Charlie Noble and his mixing style  and use of flavor concentrates most likely he used Capella V2 in the commercial market but for personal use it would be V1.... (Tpa) ry4 double is relatively weak the percentage is higher than most recipes I mix and (Tpa) Pistachio can be pushed at higher percentages (tpa) caramel original to boost the entire recipe. I used capella super sweet @ 1% but that's my personal preference  A.P @ .5% to help with the light tobacco notes and Pistachio.You can check out the discontinued recipes @ Charlie Noble. Com",
