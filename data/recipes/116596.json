    "description": "This is my take on a blueberry, cotton candy and bubble gum ice cream.  I have been trying to amp up my Blue Moon Ice Cream concentrate since I got it.   I was not quite ready to release this yet but I am still happy enough with it that I will share it for the show.  I have the original VG version and it requires a bit more steeping and a lot more flavoring.  If you have the SC version you can get by with a few days of steeping instead of 14.  You will also need to lower the percentage to about 2% instead of 6%.  The cotton candy may be muting this a bit so I am going to cut it in half.  It was still a work in progress so don't be surprised if the percents change a tad over the coming weeks lol.\r\n\r\n***You can use another sweetener if you would like.  You can also add WS-23 at around 0.3-0.4% if you want a cooler vape.***  ",
