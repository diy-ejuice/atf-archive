  "description": "Pretty much what the title says, it's a Samoa cookie shake. Don't look for a heavy cookie note, as you may not get it. I was moreso looking for the gooey part of the cookie which is a caramel/coconut/buttery concoction on the top layer of the cookie. This recipe is very sweet, as the picture would imply so also be aware of that. All that being said, I think it's good. Definitely reminds me of the GS cookies. \r\n\r\n*I mix low percentage wise, you will probably need to increase up to double what I did*\r\n\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k76C9p4buyM",
