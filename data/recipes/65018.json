    "description": "A cigarette. Probably the closest I've gotten so far. It's funky, smoky, and dirty. \r\n\r\nFLV Arabian- If you've struggled with this flavor like I have, make a 10% dilution and start playing with that at .5%. It's strong and funky, but once you find your comfort zone with it, it is a pretty interesting flavor to play with. It adds a musty, grassy, earthy taste. Not something you want in your face, but it's nice when hidden in the base. \r\n\r\nFLV Classic Cigarette- FA Burley, but usable is how I like to describe it. Grassy notes, a bit of ash, and a pretty satisfying throat hit. It's strong as hell, and even at 1% it is going to be the star of your mix. \r\n\r\nINW TA Cuban Cigar- one of my favorite additives to use in a cigarette mix. Taste wise it doesn't add a whole lot. There's a pleasant Tobacco Leaf taste, but I use it mostly to dry things up a bit. Never had a cigarette with really wet smoke, so I throw this in to give it a dry smoke feel. \r\n\r\nINW DNB- no burning cigarette recipe is complete without it! At least in my opinion. Gimme all the dirty ash taste. \r\n\r\nAdding 1% FA Polar Blast (or cooling agent of your choice) can turn this in to a nice Menthol cigarette. I've given some to someone that was struggling to give up Newports and he said it was crazy how accurate it was to a Newport. Hated menthols, so I can't say much about that. But if you liked menthols or you're trying to help someone quit menthols, give it a go!",
