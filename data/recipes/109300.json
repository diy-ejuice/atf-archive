  "description": " A mythical Drink ..From My days on the \"Rock\" Okinawa Japan.....This Drink is originally made with Absinthe, which i do not own the flavor for..hence why the Delosi Black licorice is in this recipe(if i had another black licorice i would have used that instead of delosi) but so goes life.... this drink would knock you down if you had more than 2 lol... it was that good .. AnyHoot \r\ni chose WF S&S purple drink- due to its unique drink like flavor..and the main body of this profile ...\r\nVT- Light rum & Russian vodka make up the alcohol portion(Minus the alcohol)..\r\nFLV Sweet Coconut to compliment the Lt Rum and make it more of a Malibu style rum...\r\nCap Golden Pineapple to add that tropical flair to it ..\r\nand the coup de gras.... Delosi Black licorice to give it that absinthe like taste...\r\n\r\nthis is still a work in progress and as i get more appropriate flavors i will consolidate this down to a more suitable and flavorful recipe.",
