    "description": "This was made as an easy 2 flavor hitter quitter. Super easy at 1% FA Walnut and 1% FLV Classic Cigarette. First 5-6 days the walnut is the major player here but its a moist mouthful feel. after a week the ash from the classic cigarette peeks through and start to mingle with the walnut. The walnut eases n smooths the transition between the 2 flavors.\r\n\r\nCan be a SnV if you want that walnut dominance but if you wait a week or 2 then it gets alot better overall",

            "text": "This is aptly named! I don\u2019t even like Classic Cigarette - which tastes like chewing on a partially smoked cigarette - but this mixer has found the perfect complement to it, like these flavors were made for each other. Nutty and sharp, subtly sweet yet dirty and a little smoky, very moist but not soggy, thick and flavorful with just 2% flavor. It\u2019s not one of those \u201ctobacco recipes for people who don\u2019t like tobacco,\u201d but for people who do really like tobacco, I think it\u2019s a must-try. This might be my new favorite vape for pairing with extra nicotine, hard drinking, and mornings after.  "
