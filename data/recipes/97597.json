    "description": "The Combo of TPA Papaya, FLV Mango and FA Passionfruit create the tropical mix \r\nThe Cream base used here with TFA Vanilla bean ice cream and HS Ice Cream make for a nice creamy flavorful vape\r\nFeel free to use a different vbic if you get pepper, my 2nd choice was LB Vanilla ice cream (But lately, I use that in everything)\r\n\r\nThis is pretty tasty off the shake but gets real nice after about a week.\r\n\r\nThanks for the look.. If you choose to mix this, any feedback is always very much appreciated",

HS Vanilla Ice Cream or something like CAPS Vanilla Whip Cream would work just fine I bet.&#xD;\n&#xD;\nI think I'm going to do this with HS VIC .40% 3% LB VIC due to the low % of fruit - Skip the VBIC and sweetener add 50%  WS-23. I'm thinking a possibly a low % of either FA Marshmallow, FLV Cream, or FA Fresh Cream. Although Mango might have to go up higher. Have  you tried it higher as it seems a bit low. "
