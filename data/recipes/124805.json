  "name": "Berry Tart",
  "description": "**FW Wild Berry Cobbler**. This concentrate has been a favorite of mine for over a year. This is like a jammy blackberry with slight bakery notes. This is a great concentrate to start any cobbler,, pie,, or dark Berry pastry. Just yummy. Can you tell I like it?\r\nThis recipe is a blackberry & blueberry tart. \r\nThe berries for this tart, I used **FW Blackberry and Hangsen Blueberry** . They work great together in this recipe. \r\n\r\nI use **FA Custard Premium** to add the creamy pudding in with the berries. \r\n\r\nTo enrich the slight pastry note of the wild Berry Cobbler.  I added **TFA Graham Cracker Clear** & **JF Biscuit**\r\nEnjoy. \r\n\r\n\r\n",
