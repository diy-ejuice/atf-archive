  "description": "What happens when you combine a botanical gin with some chopped up avocado add some gomme syrup, lemon juice and top it all off with some chilli sauce?? Should it work??? It actually does very well.\r\n\r\nTake this recipe as a bit of fun as much as I‚Äôm enjoying it it‚Äôs never going to win recipe of the year but it does highlight what can be done with flavours at first glance you wouldn‚Äôt deem workable.\r\n\r\nVTA botanical gin is such an awesome gin it highlights what a gin should be without really needing anything else to compliment it. It holds up very well to what you throw in there with it and it‚Äôs profile hits you on the inhale every time without fail.\r\n\r\nFLV Avocado is very accurate it has some meaty inner flesh that‚Äôs very creamy,fatty and slightly nutty in its texture adding a little guanabana lifts this flavour to another level giving it a more creamy tropical flavour without losing what it‚Äôs meant to be.\r\n\r\nVTA Lemonade clear and sour lemon add the gomme and some acidity to the gin and avocado. Creating gomme isn‚Äôt something I‚Äôm familiar with it‚Äôs basically a simple syrup however a lemonade flavour should mimic this very well without just dumping sweetener in there that could mute flavours.\r\n\r\nFLV Heat seems strange but I wanted to finish this cocktail with a little twist. Think of this as a dressing avocado is always dressed with some kind of dressing especially in salads so why not here. Let‚Äôs mimic the FLV heat here as a little chilli üå∂  sauce drizzle over the top. It honestly works gin,avocado,lemon and a little heat at the end is just wonderful.\r\n\r\nMix it up and see for yourself I could of showcased gin the traditional way but who wants boring \r\n\r\n‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è\r\n",
