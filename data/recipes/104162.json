    "description": "What happens when you combine a botanical gin with some chopped up avocado add some gomme syrup, lemon juice and top it all off with some chilli sauce?? Should it work??? It actually does very well.\r\n\r\nTake this recipe as a bit of fun as much as I\u2019m enjoying it it\u2019s never going to win recipe of the year but it does highlight what can be done with flavours at first glance you wouldn\u2019t deem workable.\r\n\r\nVTA botanical gin is such an awesome gin it highlights what a gin should be without really needing anything else to compliment it. It holds up very well to what you throw in there with it and it\u2019s profile hits you on the inhale every time without fail.\r\n\r\nFLV Avocado is very accurate it has some meaty inner flesh that\u2019s very creamy,fatty and slightly nutty in its texture adding a little guanabana lifts this flavour to another level giving it a more creamy tropical flavour without losing what it\u2019s meant to be.\r\n\r\nVTA Lemonade clear and sour lemon add the gomme and some acidity to the gin and avocado. Creating gomme isn\u2019t something I\u2019m familiar with it\u2019s basically a simple syrup however a lemonade flavour should mimic this very well without just dumping sweetener in there that could mute flavours.\r\n\r\nFLV Heat seems strange but I wanted to finish this cocktail with a little twist. Think of this as a dressing avocado is always dressed with some kind of dressing especially in salads so why not here. Let\u2019s mimic the FLV heat here as a little chilli \ud83c\udf36  sauce drizzle over the top. It honestly works gin,avocado,lemon and a little heat at the end is just wonderful.\r\n\r\nMix it up and see for yourself I could of showcased gin the traditional way but who wants boring \r\n\r\n\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\r\n",
