  "description": "This is a very simple easy candy mix. It is an almost exact match of the taste of the peach berry flavor from the Berry Blast style of Mike and ike  candy. Its a very self explanatory three flavors. I don't use any sweetener in this mix but feel free to add some if this isn't sweet enough for you. I feel it is plenty sweet as is but sweetness is subjective. This is pretty good as a shake and Vape but after sitting for 12 hours the throat hit which is present directly after mixing settles down and pretty much disappeares. ",
