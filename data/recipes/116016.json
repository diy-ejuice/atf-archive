Only three flavors yall. \r\n\r\nThe banana combo here has quickly become my goto for bananas. These two together makes a great creamy banana not too candy not too real either. No runty flavor for me out of thus combo. \r\n\r\nForest fruit. Enough said. Mixed berries ",

The berries seemed a little harsh to me after a short steep, so I let it steep a couple of weeks.  The mix is just perfect for me now.  The berries give a little zing that is much appreciated during the summer, but do not overwhelm the banana.  "
