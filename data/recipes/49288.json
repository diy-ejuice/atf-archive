  "description": "when i saw skiddlz thin mint frap recipe, i knew i had to mix my own version of it. starbucks White Chocolate Mocha Frap is delicious but with mint should be even better. doing my own version of skiddlz recipe for a couple of reasons. first i was missing most of the concentrats and second FA UP is shit imo with its cereal alcohol undertones. so pretty sure skidz recipe wouldnt do it for me. \r\n\r\nCAP Cap, FW White Choc and CAP Pep are the main notes here. Caps Cappuccino is actually pretty good, tastes a bit like cappuccino candy, and fits profile better than other coffee flavors i got. i I love FW white choc so that's a nobrainer for me. used with tpa's version to back it up. it is a little bit dry so therefore butter cream and sweet cream come in. both are sweet and milky, they make white choc a bit softer and the profile more creamy. lastly cap peppermint for candy peppermint note.\r\n\r\ni find it pretty hard to make complex recipes with mints, because it tends to overpower subtle notes. here in this recipe you can't taste too much of the white chocolate, although fw's version is pretty strong and distinct in most situations. It's subtle but definitely there with its sweetness and cacoa butter powder flavor. recipe is still good, not perfect, but decent. for me i could only taste a stronger white choc flavor without peppermint in the recipe. so i guess that would be an option\r\n\r\nFW white choc apparently has sucralose in it and the other conc are also sweet ... so there's not really a need for extra sweetener.
