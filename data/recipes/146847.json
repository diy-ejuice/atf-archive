            "text": "After 10 days steeping my opinion: Its not bad but its not good either. I enjoy many of your recipes but this is definitely not a base i would run into my recipes. FLV Vanilla Pudding is a weak and creamy like flavor for me and does not fit well in a custard. It turns custards more to a creamy vape like TFA Vanilla Swirl. Most of us know custards need time to steep. If it changes positively to a heavy and bold custard, ill edit this review."
