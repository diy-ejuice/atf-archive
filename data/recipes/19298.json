      "text": "FLV Biscotti is a terrific flavor and bold enough to stand up to any cream thrown it's way. You get a little almond and a nice cinnamon sugar dusting with a heavy biscuit/cookie/bread thing going on . Just like the real thing, Biscotti is a bit dry (I dare anyone to eat a biscotti without washing it down with milk or other beverage). This Ice cream base is great and I'll probably be borrowing it in the future : ) It also does a great job keeping you from grabbing water after every pull. &#xD;\nThis recipe is one of only 3 that I vape regularly and absolutely awesome with a cup of coffee! Great job Thadentman!"
