    "description": "Refreshing slightly spiced Thai Iced Tea. ideal for this summer.\r\nSimple, sweet and sensational aromas packed in this refreshing mix.\r\n\r\nMost ingredients speak for themselves but the new kid on the block is Lemon Wedge from FLV, A real fruit lime that is crisp and bright with strong notes of both juice and skin.\r\nRF-SC Baja Soda is a lemonish sparkling aroma, one of their best soda aromas.\r\nFLV Thai Chai is a rich Thai tea flavor filled with cream, toasted coconut, and spiced tea. Thai Tea is made from strongly-brewed black tea, often spiced with ingredients such as star anise, crushed tamarind, cardamom, and occasionally others as well (often making this beverage a favorite among masala chai tea fans).\r\n\r\nAdd (more) sweet and\/or cooling at your liking. \r\n\r\ns\/v 24 hours rest but perfect in 3 days, enjoy",
