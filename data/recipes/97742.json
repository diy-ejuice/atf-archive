            "text": "Exceptional example for simple recipe that beats most others in flavor depth department. The WF peaches get turned around by the eggnog like 180 degrees. It adds an insane depth to the cream part, it\u2019s bends the peaches into a more cooked like taste and adds extremely delicious spice notes. To me cardamom seem to stand out a bit but there are many more to be tasted. The balance is insane and for me this will be a perfect vape introducing fall until well after Christmas. Great work "
