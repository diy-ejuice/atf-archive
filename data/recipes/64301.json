But i know its missing a creamy vanilla or something like it in this recipe have you tried some cap vc yet with the mix ? As i remember there was a darker shade of yellow to the OG  (maybe forgot its been a while). This is very nice but just wish it had more creamyness to it which would tone down the fruit just a little, as i remember the OG when i vaped it had just a slight fruit to it (a little tang) just above the base creams. GREAT mix though and a very good stab at the OG."
