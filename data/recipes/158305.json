  "description": "Since everyone seems to be dropping pineapple recipes . . . here's something I've been working on in anticipation of the Stranger Things season 3 release.  A while ago, my wife made pancakes with pineapple rings in them, which led to the idea of waffles with pineapple.  I've long been trying to find a decent pineapple upside down cake, to no avail.  Setting that aside (again), I turned my attention to this Stranger Things inspired concoction . . . Upside Down pineapple waffles.  LB Belgian Waffle, JF Cookie, and AP to get that crispy, maple waffle.  FW Butter Pecan and Sweetener to go with that JF Cookie to make up the buttery, nutty syrup.  CAP Golden Pineapple and WF Pineapple Candy for the sweetened cooked pineapple rings.  Finally, topped off with a dollop of CAP Vanilla Whipped Cream.",
