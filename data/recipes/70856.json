    "description": "My take on my favorite ice cream treat. I've been working on this for a while I think it's as close as I'm going to get. I think peanut butter fans will enjoy it. I add 0.5% super sweet but I like a sweet vape. Sweeten to your liking. Hope ya enjoy and comments and criticism(constructive) always welcome.",
