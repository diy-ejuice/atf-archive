    "description": "Strawberry Filled Cream Cake Recipe\r\n\r\nMy mom used to make this when I was a kid and everyone would always ask for the recipe and I remember being SO proud that my mom made something so fancy. \r\nAfter several attempts to recreate this lovely creamy cake into a vapable mix, i finally think i came very close, close enough to share this with all of you. \r\nI hope you enjoyed this recipe as much as i do.\r\n\r\nBuilding blocks:\r\nFLV Cupcake Batter and FLV Pound Cake for a light and fluffy cake.\r\nFor the strawberry filling and top note i used RF_SC Strawberry Gelato mixed with Succulent Strawberry from OSDIY, a slightly jelly tasting blend of strawberries, both aromas are layered perfect in this recipe, the gelato and Vanilla Cream Extra from WF are playing nicely to give that soft creamy layer.\r\nFLV frosting finish this recipe with that nice creamy vanilla with sweet mellow edges. \r\n\r\nOptional:\r\nI used 2 drops (0.10%) per 30ml of CAP Super Sweet 30ml from CAP, i just like it sweet.\r\n\r\nCan be vaped s\/v 24hours rest, best after a day or 7+ or even longer.\r\nTasted it myself after 2 days, 7 days and it really starts to shine after 14 day's. made a first batch on 29\/10 and on this day it still taste as bright and fresh as it was freshly made. No strawberry degradation at all.\r\n\r\nI am one of those unlucky people who rarely taste strawberries, i can guaranty, in this recipe, i do taste them strawberries! ",

I can taste all the layers, the cake, cream and strawberries.   I subbed VT vanilla cream as I didn't have WF, dont know if that made a huge difference.  Making a bigger bottle now so I can see how it steeps!  thanks for the recipe :)"
