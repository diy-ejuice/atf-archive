      "text": "You really nailed the fruit profile of this recipe. The candy was a favorite of mine growing up and while I haven't had the candy in years vaping this brought it all back to me. Right off the shake the lemon is a bit too forward, but after a solid night of steeping it moves to the background just enough to compliment everything else and tie in that sour patch flavor you get when you throw a bunch of them in your mouth all at once. I do feel like there could have been more jelly texture, but I think that's just me. I seem to have trouble tasting \"gummy\" and have tried a number of gummy recipes hoping for that mouth feel. Perhaps that's my white whale. Either way this is a fantastic recipe, taste true to the profile and I really enjoyed it. Thank you !"
