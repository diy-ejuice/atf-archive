  "description": "Original rant:\r\n\r\nRationale behind the marriage of rosemary, vanilla, and lemon:  From time to time, my wife will simmer a pot of vanilla extract, slices of lemons, and sprigs of rosemary with water to scent the house.  It is a delicious smelling aroma . . . and apparently, one of the scents that Williams-Sonoma uses to scent their stores (hence the name).  I've always been enthralled by the scent and thought it might make for an interesting vape.  Recently, she bought a cool mist aromatherapy diffuser and got amber vanilla, lemon, and rosemary scents to use in it.  I found myself drawn to it.  The amber vanilla added an almost bakery type aroma to the mixture, and I decided to get some rosemary concentrate to try my hand at this flavor.  I got into DIY to scratch the itch for flavors that I could not readily buy . . . and this is something I've been wanting to try for quite some time.\r\n\r\nI wanted vanilla to be dominant with lemon and rosemary falling in line behind it.  This was not originally intended to be a custard, but I felt lacking the body of a custard really affected this and made it fall flat rather quickly.  I knew I wanted it to have that same full-bodied flavor that I was getting from the aroma, so it needed that thick mouth-feel that only a custard can provide.  This also helped add to the richness that I was getting from the aroma my wife concocts . . . when she boils water, lemons, rosemary, and vanilla, the scents come together to equal something much greater than the sum of their parts (I suspect it is due to the ingredients slowly cooking in the simmering pot).  \r\n\r\nThe remix:\r\n\r\nVariations on a theme.  This is a remix of my first shared recipe.  This mix seems much more cohesive with flavors layering and settling in together instead of on top of one another.  The lemon is a bit more prominent with the rosemary blending in and acting as an earthy accent.  This is perfectly sweet without any added sweetener.  All in all, I feel like this mix better represents the original scent that inspired it.  I used Wayne's combination of FW Butter Cream and French Vanilla with TFA Meringue from his [Maple Vanilla](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/123051#maple_vanilla_live_mixing_by_enyawreklaw).  I kept Holy Vanilla and Shisha Rosemary from the original recipe.  I used FE Lemon and INW Lemon Cake for the lemon layer and used FA Custard Premium for the custard layer.  I used OOO Vanilla Marshmallow to blend the layers together and for its extra hint of vanilla and mouthfeel.  \r\n\r\nMixed 60vg/40pg . . . works as a SNV but give it a day and it shines.  Enjoy!\r\n\r\n",
