      "text": "Very good recipe and extremely accurate to the description. The only thing keeping this from a 5 star for me is the amount of sucralose. I know it's minor but I don't have the option to give it a 4.25 and I try to be as Fair as possible so I had to go with a 4. I find in mixes that have an overall minimal flavoring percentage (which is completely fine), the sucralose needs to match it or I can actually taste the sucralose and it's a bit distracting. I did mix this again with only .20% super sweet and it got rid of that off note and I'm loving this mix. I'm excited to see more mixers using HS creams, I feel they don't get enough love... they're so rich and some of the best IMO. Great work as always Wayne, I thoroughly enjoy your work my friend, and this is no exception. "
