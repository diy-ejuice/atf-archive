    "description": "A bright, clean and complex mix of kiwi, melon and dark berries. A fully flavored recipe that\u2019s perfect for the coming warmer months. \r\n\r\nKilanca is delicious. Like a lot of the nicotine river concentrates, it\u2019s not terribly concentrated. I start around 10% with it, for this recipe we went to 12. Don\u2019t freak out, it\u2019s how these flavorings work. Try it. \r\n\r\nThe nicotine river concentrates are overall really good, but they\u2019re weak and require some help to get the point across. \r\n\r\nIn this case I accentuate kilanca\u2019s profile with a little wild melon and cantaloupe from Flavorah. \r\n\r\nI use Bull City\u2019s 30% ws-23 because it\u2019s the fucking best. Works great in this recipe. \r\n\r\nFinally, some super sweet cos that\u2019s how I roll. \r\n\r\nEnjoy. It\u2019s very very good. ",
