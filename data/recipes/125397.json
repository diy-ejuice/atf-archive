    "description": "During Prohibition, the simple gin-and-orange-juice Orange Blossom tipple was a big hit among illicit imbibers. The recipe, which is very similar to a Screwdriver, was a perfect way to disguise booze.......\r\nWe are disguising it now as a delicious after dinner Vape .....\r\nI used the Flavor Monks Gin Orange high in this recipe ..not as high as FlavorMonks recommends but higher than i normally use flavors...\r\nThe Gin orange and blood orange together gives this recipe a strong orange essence aroma wise, but very smooth taste wise you almost cannot taste the gin or alcohol graininess the grenadine adds a cherriness to the mix and mellows out the Citron notes the blood orange usually gives off but was in a very pleasent and appealling way, the Lemon lime was used for juiciness or add the feel of wetness, to further add alittle depth to the recipe WF champange soda SC Was added to further add wetness to the recipe, I was looking for the tartness but unfortunately these ingredients didn't add that note.. I will have to look for something to give that sweet and tartness I'm looking for poss VT Fizzy Sherbet... I hope you all enjoy this recipe it is quite good even lacking the tart note this particular drink inherently has..... Thanks FM for these awesome flavors... ",
