  "name": "Rainforest (Soda Remix)",
  "description": "I love the fruit/floral combo that @RockyHarlow uses in his \"Rainforest\" recipe. It's hard to describe with words what it tastes like, since it's more of an abstract work of art, but I think his name \"Rainforest\" fits very well. The sweetness of the guava, sweet/floral honeysuckle and funky cactus makes for a very interesting combination.\r\n\r\nAs I keep throwing things at my soda base (FLV Citrus Soda, CAP Lemon Lime & WS-23), I think this combo turned out great. It preserves the unique taste of the original mix, but adds a slight fizzyness to it.",
