  "description": "A lemonade so delicious that the haters start to come out of the woodwork.\r\n\r\nFLV Lemonade- Base, delicious tangy lemonade\r\n\r\nTFA Blackberry- Adds the darker berry notes\r\n\r\nFLV Pink Guava- Really comes across more like a grapefruit here.\r\n\r\nCap Super Sweet- Absolutely subjective. It's in almost every one of my mixes, but when I mixed this for my supervisor he asked for it to be dropped down to .2%\r\n\r\n\r\nI mixed this for a Tuesday that I was going golfing. I had hoped it would turn out well, but I was pleasantly surprised! This one is absolutely a good SNV, but I do think that it gets better after about a day. Please give any feedback.\r\n\r\nFA Fuji- For sweetness and juiciness.",
