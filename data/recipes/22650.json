  "description": "Lisbon - Breakfast Of Champions\t  \r\n \r\n(coffee & strong Portuguese cigarette)\r\nIIf you like this, here's another version: [Paris-Breakfast Of Champions](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/22648)\r\nHave added other bits & pieces, but to my taste at least, this simple base is solid as is.\r\nVery customisable as preferences for both cigarette & coffee strength vary wildly;\r\nFrom one individual to another. But also any one of us, depending on time of day!\r\nWill probably work out creamier versions & daker versions (probably with a touch of FA espresso)\r\nP.S. WARNING\r\nthese are pretty strong.\r\nTry a 10ml tester, see how you get on!\r\nI originally made these for when i'm having a drink, I like Brandy & would always have a coffee on the side, now I don't always need the coffee.\r\nI soon noticed their worth as replacement for my habitual nutritious breakfast.",
