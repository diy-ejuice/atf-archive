  "description": "During a manic mixing session just over a month ago I was playing around with both TFA's Berry Mix and FA's Forest Fruit and came up with this. It is a pleasant  fruit mix for when you're in the mood for something full flavored and a little sweet. I mixed a bottle with TFA's version and one with FA's version. I then put them away to give the FLV Cream a chance to open up. I promptly forgot all about them until today. They both turned out to be very good. I prefer Berry Mix over Forest Fruit, but each to his/her own.\r\n\r\nI would imagine that this recipe would be hard to mess up, so feel free to try out different flavors.",
