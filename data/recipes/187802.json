  "description": "This is a collaborative creation by DEVELOPED: NaChef, Max Savage, and Folkart. Ok, ….we got a little geeky with this one.  What does 1707 have to do with Butter Beer? Well, if you're as geeky as I am when it comes to Harry Potter, you'll know that Butter Beer 1707 is a \"special reserve\" type of Butter Beer.  So what does Butter Beer 1707 taste like? We have no idea, but we imagined it might have a spicier note to it. That's why we used FLV Root Beer to differentiate this Butter Beer from any other Butter Beer. Mix it up, I think you'll be amazed!

It seems like they got the profile down fairly well, but I just could not get into it. I think it has too much of that VT Butter Toffee Base. I get a strong sour milk twang from that one and I think it tastes a bit more like movie theater butter than real butter. I’d hoped they’d tamed it but I get enough of that here I actually found the recipe a little naueasting. Sorry guys. "

It's a Butterbeer Kit-Kat. light crispy cookie undertone, BUTTERBEER throuought, and the vaguesty hint of a creamy toffee flavored coating.&#xD;\n&#xD;\nGood god, what'll the lads at Honeydukes think of next?"
