  "description": "I vape this shit every single day\r\nIt’s freaking simple and obvious... but since I found out how I LOVE FA cookie, I almost stopped developing, that’s how addicted I got to this single flavor @5% (yes, insane). \r\n\r\nBut then I thought about putting some work upon it. That’s how my adv was born.\r\n\r\nJf Milk chocolate brings the chocolate chips... but you could take it out and would continue mind blowing. Or swap to double chocolate clear @ 1%\r\n\r\nAlready lovely  as S&V, but it’s definitely best after a week or two\r\n\r\nHope you enjoy \r\nLots of love and flavor <3",
