  "description": "Deliciously creamy custard with a vibrant strawberry throughout, finished off with a biscuit crunch.\r\n\r\nNotes\r\n\r\nFA Custard Premium/INW Custard\r\n\r\nCustard Premium gave me a nice creamy custard, while combining it with INW Custard turned it into a truly deep, rich custard base for this particular recipe. It's creamy, strong and a natural sweetness comes through.\r\n\r\nINW Shisha Strawberry/FA Juicy Strawberry\r\n\r\nJuicy Strawberry is another great strawberry flavouring from FA.  It gives both a ripe and sweet taste, so really the best of both worlds.  Shisha Strawberry I added to give vibrance and a long lasting strawberry flavour.\r\n\r\nFA Meringue \r\n\r\nMeringue adds a touch of natural sweetness to the mix, while adding a creamy feel and also a bit of texture to the finished juice.\r\n\r\nINW Biscuit\r\n\r\nThis flavouring speaks for itself and adds the biscuit crunch I wanted to implement to the custard and strawberry profile.\r\n\r\nCAP Super Sweet\r\n\r\nBesides adding a little more sweetness to the mix, it also gives me a great mouthfeel from the juice and bit more vibrance.",

      "text": "Awesome strawberry and cookie dessert recipe.  Im a new mixer and was hoping to stay away from liquids with added sweeteners so I made a 30ml tester of the recipe without the SS and it was pretty good, not something I'm in love with but definitely a good recipe.   Well I broke down and said screw it (I love sweets, sweet liquids, and anything with sugar) and got FW Sweetener and some CAP SS and  added the SS to the batch i already had floating around and the difference it made was amazing.   This may become my new favorite strawberry liquid,  I just have to give it a few days and see how my taste buds react vaping a lot of it. Thank you for the recipe. "

Excellent custard base, great usage of the new FA Juicy Strawberry. A lot of strawberry mixes I can't taste but I think the thickness of the custard base really lets it shine here and it's delicious. The biscuit does have a nice snap at the end of the vape too, the crunch is definitely there. Definitely an ADV now."

I have become a big fan of Custard Premium by FA since trying this recipe and it really seems to shine here.  Easily an ADV for me, I will always have a bottle of it on hand! Thanks for sharing this recipe! "
