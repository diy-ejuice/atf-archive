This is a damn tasty recipe, though I really don't get much almond from it. That said, I mixed it up as posted, am enjoying it immensely, and I'm looking forward to mixing it again with that suggested 1.5% FW Yellow Cake added in. So far it hits all those notes I look for in a decadent, cuddly custard while staying very low in total flavor percentages. Great stuff!"

But I am an ADDICT when it comes to butterscotch, and since a very highly rated review...as soon as I saw I had the ingredients, had to throw it together.&#xD;\n&#xD;\nAnd I'm very glad I did.&#xD;\n&#xD;\nThis is a rich, decadent custard. Smooth, filling mouthfeel to the point where I had to double check a few time to make sure I was just vaping. The nuttiness surrounding the sweet eggy vanilla...sinful. And the rich as hell butterscotch (with the rum notes of the ripple adding a dark sweetness)...it's like someone took the butter rum life saver and figured out how to turn that into a custard, then top it with finely chopped almond.&#xD;\n&#xD;\nThe fact it's this damned good with three ingredients?&#xD;\n&#xD;\nHoly freakin Hannah, this stuff is GREAT.&#xD;\n&#xD;\nThis vape is for: butterscotch lovers, custard junkies, desert lovers, people who like creamy or rich desserts, and, most importantly, people who are burnt out on or don't like custard. This flavor changed my mind on the issue of custards. Guess it's what I get for all my previous experience with custards being store bought, neh? ADV, no doubts or discussions."
