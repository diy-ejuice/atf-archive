  "description": "I took some inspiration for the profile from falon1000's \"strawberry wafer\" recipe. \r\nThis was a profile I'd been fiddling with for some time and dazcole's suggestion of using buttercream completed the puzzle.\r\n\r\nJF Strawberry Sweet and TFA Ripe is my current favourite strawberry pairing and works well here to infuse the creams with a bright yet syrupy strawberry.\r\nThe overall strawberry profile is lifted by the addition of super sweet.\r\n\r\nThe butter cream, vienna & VBIC create a nice buttery, slightly gooey cream for the strawberries to blend with.\r\n\r\nSugar cookie v2 + a touch of FA cookie make a nice, light wafer.\r\nThe reason i went for v2 here is because v1 is too buttery, interferes with the crunchy wafer quality I was after.\r\nThe v2 stays nicely in the background and the touch of FA cookie adds some crispness and texture the six.\r\nYou absolutely can substitute sugar cookie v1, the steep is just longer to get a similar effect.\r\n\r\nI do find JF strawberry is at it's best when steeped a few days, but it's still a really good shake & vape. \r\nAfter some time the sugar cookie v2 will start to contribute more to the wafer as well.\r\n",
