  "description": "A fresh honeydew forward melon soda for y'alls!\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n**FLV Citrus Soda** the only flavor that gives me that \"fizzy\" feeling. I usually think it needs some help from another tangy lemon lime flavor, but here I opted to use **FLV Lemonade** instead, to kind of sweeten it, rather than making it pop. I think it works great together with the melons, as they are so sweet, so the sweeter citruses blends great.\r\n**FLV Wild Melon** is just an incredible flavor by itself, a blend of many different melons all mashed together. I opted to make the honeydew part even more prominent by adding **FLV Honeydew**, which can be a bit thick if you use it too high, but at 1% I think it does just what it should here, add even more of that great honeydew flavor.\r\n**FLV Cucumber** was just some experiment I did, but I think it turned out great, as this flavor in particular has a quite distinct almost salty cucumber note to it, and cucumber/melons are a well known pairing. It's used relatively low here, so you have to look for it to taste it, but I think it adds a great juicyness and complexity to the whole mix.\r\n**WS-23** for cooling, as a soda should be cold! This is optional though, and use at your own prefered percentage, but I highly recommend it.",
