  "description": "Apollo Feijoa & Peach Pudding.\r\n\r\nAfter ordering Apollo Feijoa from BCF. I started researching culinary recipes that used it, and I came across a AF & Peach Rice Pudding. So I figured I would take a stab a creating an ejuice using that profile. Though i have never taste a feijoa in real life. I think i did a pretty good job in creating a great tasting ejuice out of it.\r\n\r\nVTA Apollo Feijoa: This stuff wasn't as potent as I hoped I single flavor tested this at 6% and didn't get any weird off notes. The recommended single flavor range according to vta is 5%-9%. Range for mixing is 1%-5%. So I went with AF at 3% that way I could still taste. Through the vanilla cream, rice, and peach.\r\n\r\nFA Peach: it is one my favorite peachs i own. I used it at 1.5% so it would push through the rice and pudding.\r\n\r\nFE Sweet Rice: I stole this from @Shyndo. I had a problem with losing this in the steep & to the other ingredients . Shyndo uses it at 5% in his Mango Sticky Rice to ensure that doesn't happen. I tried it in here at it worked out great and solved my rice problem.\r\n\r\nFLV Vanilla Pudding: This is my best pudding option I own & I believe it works great in here at 2%",
