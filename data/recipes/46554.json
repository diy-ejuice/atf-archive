    "name": "BBIC (Brown Butta Ice Cream)",
    "description": "Shyndo asked me to make a brown butter ice cream. After a couple of attempts, I ended up really happy with this. Had to keep it simple.\r\n\r\nFW Butterscotch Ripple\/FLV Milk & Honey\/TPA Bavarian Cream - This formed perfectly the \"brown\" side of the brown butter, while helping out the creamy ice cream angle. FLV M&H really plays the star of this group, besides giving Matthew Kocanda the \"O face\", really bringing out some of those carm and butterscotch sweet notes, as well as the three of them making a nice amount of sweetness.\r\n\r\nCap VBIC\/HS Ice Cream - The ice cream base, where these two work perfectly to help boost the butter notes depth, while adding a solid cream background with out too much vanilla. Along with the ripple, and the butter cream, and bav cream, we get into that nice ice cream city (it's better than flavor-town, aight).\r\n\r\nCap Golden Butter\/Cap Buttercream - The best way I could think of adding a heavy butter note, that isn't utterly offensive. They combine, along with the HS, to get it nice and buttery. \r\n\r\nAll in all, I'm really happy with how this came out. It's not spot on brown butter ice cream, but god is it good. A solid, slightly dense, carm butterscotch buttery cream.",

            "text": "DECADENCE. When I first tried this recipe it had only a few days to steep and I liked it, but didn't think it was anything super special. Today I come back to it after a six week steep and it's just wonderfully rich buttery decadence. It's astounding how sweet it has become without any added sweetener. While I agree with the 3-star reviewer that a touch of some nut might help with authenticity on the browning, it seems to have the perfect amount of butteryness, very rich and not at all light, but also not overbearing. And authenticity kinda goes out the window when you taste something this good. I want to keep on vaping it and then mix some more for another long steep.  Thanks for a great vape! "

The way the \"brown butter\" lingers on that buttery note in HS Ice Cream is fantastic. I'll definitely be mixing this again in a larger quantity. Thanks for sharing!"

Its definitely tasty, but I think its light on the butter, and that nuttiness you get from browning the butter.  A little salt would be nice...(jk).   maybe adding a little hazelnut or walnut or almond would help with authenticity.&#xD;\n"

They are surprisingly quite similar even though they are using different ingredients. I used tpa butter because i like it more than caps golden butter and I did add .5% super sweet on both. Both are great recipes so I gave you both 5 stars. Good job."
