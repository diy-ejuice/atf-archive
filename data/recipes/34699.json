  "description": "My clone of Vape Chemist's MPC \r\n\"MPC is an irresistible combination of our world famous Philippine Mango baked into a fresh-from- the-oven Pound Cake.\" -Vape Chemist\r\n\r\nThis is what I'veâ€‹ come up with, and it's really quite simple... Now this juice has won the Spinfuel Choice Award. So it just goes to show that you don't need to have a recipe with 87 different flavors and crazy ass percentages... It's still a work in progress and I'm not sure about how much sweetener should go into it. I don't have any of the original and nobody near by sells it... I ABSOLUTELY LOVED this juice when i had it and I hope you will enjoy what I've come up with.\r\n\r\n(TPA) Philippine Mango: a nice ripe sweet mango with an almost buttery sweetness. Not overly sweet, just nice and sugary ripe sweet. It's the ðŸŒŸ of the show here (as stated in the name) and I believe that 6% does it here...\r\n\r\n(FLV) Pound Cake: a nice sweet and dense pound cake flavor with an almost coconutty after taste/hint... This here is the other half of the name and at 3% comes out enough to handle the mango but not overtake it. THIS IS the pound cake flavoring used in the original because it has that aftertaste.\r\n\r\nPlay with the percentages and or sweetener to see what you think, but from the last 4 batches I've done I think it's close enough to drop the recipe on y'all...ðŸ˜Ž If anyone has any ideas and or comments hit me up and let me know what you think. Happy mixing... Enjoy!\r\n\r\nUPDATE: since the release of this recipe I've updated it..\r\n\r\n(FA) Coconutâ€‹/(FA) Nonna's Cake/(FLV) Mango: all these add to/enhance the flavor profile that I've got going on here... They give the juice a more vivid flavor and now I think this might be better than the original! ðŸ¤” \r\n\r\nHope you enjoy theâ€‹ recipe!!!",
