  "description": "A very simple but tasty Vanilla Cola. \r\nI pushed the FA Cola as far as I dared and gave it some FA Marzipan to push it further. INW Shisha Vanilla is fantastic, it’s strong enough to infuse the Cola with a lingering vanilla through the vape. \r\nSuper sweet to get closer to the sugary authenticity of a Cola, and WS-23 for the ice cool beverage effect. \r\nDidn’t attempt to add any ‘Fizz’ type flavours as to my knowledge they don’t work too well and I didn’t want to risk ruining the flavour.\r\n",

Ive been looking for something to give an ice cold effect without changing the flavor. For the fizz try 1-1.5% cap lemon. The cola overpowers any lemon notes and the added citrus gives it a slight fizz effect. Cool to see other mixers coming up with similar liquids in a sea of flavor concentrates!"
