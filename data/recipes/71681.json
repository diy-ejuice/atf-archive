    "description": "Imagine you\u2019re 90 years old, cold when the temperature is less than your age, and afraid of leaving the neighborhood. What do you do for exercise? Mall-walk. You\u2019re a mall-walking, tall-talking, stall-stalking machine. One thing you\u2019re sure to build with that sort of lease on life is an appetite. Naturally, you settle down at the Factory where it\u2019s a cool but comfortable 84F. When your 2:30pm dinner is said and done, it\u2019s time for business to begin. Enter the dessert you dreamt up in the depression era dustbowl despair of your childhood: oreo ice cream cheesecake. That was likely science fiction back then, so cheers to you for having such a forward-thinking mind during a time when people smoked cigarettes to cure disease. Before you start devouring this contemporary delicacy, you better put on your windbreaker.. Ice cream always puts a chill in your bones, but it\u2019s just so darned tasty.\r\n\r\nHappy mixing. \ud83d\udc7d",
