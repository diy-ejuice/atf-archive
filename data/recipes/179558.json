    "description": "Absolutely in love with this recipe \r\n\r\nEqual parts Graham crackers and thick, rich custard \r\n\r\nThe Graham crackers take a couple of days to come through but the custard takes a full two weeks to mature. It\u2019s well worth the wait though as the custard just laps up the side of the dark crunchy  crackers with it\u2019s sweet luxuriousness.\r\n\r\nThe custard is based around FA custard prem with the Bavarian cream and Creme Brulee to back it up and the FW Graham Cracker is the main cracker note with the butter and brown sugar (FLV Caramel) to back that up\r\n\r\nI\u2019m so happy I made this as it's not only become my ADV but my favourite liquid. I can\u2019t stop vaping it\r\n\r\n***Edit, I\u2019ve cranked the caramel up to 1% as I forgot that that\u2019s how high I had it originally and it\u2019s better that way. It just adds a touch more darkness which makes all the difference***\r\n\r\nThanks to all the people who have mixed it\r\n\r\n\r\n",
