  "description": "Absolutely in love with this recipe \r\n\r\nEqual parts Graham crackers and thick, rich custard \r\n\r\nThe Graham crackers take a couple of days to come through but the custard takes a full two weeks to mature. It’s well worth the wait though as the custard just laps up the side of the dark crunchy  crackers with it’s sweet luxuriousness.\r\n\r\nThe custard is based around FA custard prem with the Bavarian cream and Creme Brulee to back it up and the FW Graham Cracker is the main cracker note with the butter and brown sugar (FLV Caramel) to back that up\r\n\r\nI’m so happy I made this as it's not only become my ADV but my favourite liquid. I can’t stop vaping it\r\n\r\n***Edit, I’ve cranked the caramel up to 1% as I forgot that that’s how high I had it originally and it’s better that way. It just adds a touch more darkness which makes all the difference***\r\n\r\nThanks to all the people who have mixed it\r\n\r\n\r\n",
