  "description": "Made for Fresh 's saturday DIY show   https://youtu.be/vBCjmp8jgiU  \r\n\r\nWell  GOT  came to an end  and for me  this season was like waiting to ride the  Kingda Ka  roller coaster in Jersey, finally getting  to ride it  and  after the ride is over  promptly  puking your guts out.     Sansa and Daenerys   should have teamed up and RULED all!!!   \r\n\r\n  Instead   the writers  turn Danerys  into an entirely different character, that  BBQ an entire  city  - which is  then supposed  to justify  the  homicide  by  the  man who knows  nothing   and to   top it all off   they placed a three eyed  raven on the  iron throne .  THE one redeeming aspect of the season was that SANSA declaring the Norths independence and   took her rightful place as queen in the north .   \r\n\r\nScone  base is mainly the Biscut, and Brownsugar cookie with a little of VT pudding  for body  - nice body with a  touch  dark  biscuit bakery on the back \r\n\r\nRaspberry jam and  Sweet currant is lovely   -   as that currant gives  you that nice tart bright note \r\nSweet cream adds a touch of cream note  with out overpowering the bakery  ",
