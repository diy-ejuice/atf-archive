  "description": "Simple Shamrock Shake from Mcdonald's. For all those times when you want a Shamrock shake but they are only here for 2 months out of the year. Give this thing a good 3-5 days for all of the Creams to work their magic and the mint to fall into the background like a true shamrock shake. If you like your Shamrock Shake extra minty bump the Creme De Menthe to 3%. The Butter Cream is what sets this Shamrock Shake apart from other recipes of the same. It adds that buttery cream that is perfect for this profile. ",
