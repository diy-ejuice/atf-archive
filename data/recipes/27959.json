      "text": "To start off with, Cavendish is \"flavored tobacco\" depending on the tobacconist it can be any variation of tobaccos and flavorings but usually a mix of Kentucky, Virginia and Burley that have been treated, pressed then fermented. The flavorings are usually dark fruits, nuts and liquor. So you have a mellow smooth sweet tobacco that is flavored. Which is pretty much what INW Cavendish Type brings to the table. The addition of the caramel and vanilla are a welcome addition to this blend, as is the FA cream fresh I would like to have seen a thicker cream used here to pair with the INW Shisha Vanilla but not a negative by any means. I would like to also mention that vaping this has a distinct \"room note\" It is a pleasant \"someone's grampa is smoking a pipe\" kind of room note but does not linger forever. This is very much a \"tobacco dominant\" recipe, but also one that is accessible to desert tobacco lovers and non tobacco vapers as well. I cannot wait to see how this develops on a longer steep. Excellent recipe!"

I mixed this up and at first taste its everything you want from a good vanilla pipe.Its got the smoothness of the Vanilla from the shisha and cream fresh that will only get smoother and help round out the cavendish from INW. To make a long story short I am not a normal tobacco vaper however this recipe may have changed my life.. "
