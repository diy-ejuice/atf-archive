  "description": "This my first 1-2-3 recipe. The Virginia Tobacco is a sweet, leafy flavor. I used TPA Pear and FLV Apple Filling to bend it into something else entirely. I wouldn't really say this qualifies as a tobacco recipe. It's more of a rustic and light autumnal fruit mix with a hint of cinnamon.  The steeping part is up to you. It works as a shake and vape recipe, but FLV tobaccos are known to get better at the two week mark. ",

Even though you can't really taste much of the Virginia tobacco in here, it combines effortlessly with the Apple filling to make this one of my new favorites ADVs.  It perfectly defines Fall for me with the warm notes it provides, but I've been vaping it in the heat of summer because it's THAT good!"

It's warm and very comfortable to vape. The taste of this liquid will lead your min onto the colors of fall. Very, very nice indeed. Great job, Alfred!"

In theory, it's a tobacco, in practice...this is a beautifully amazing flavor. Max nails it with \"this is fall in a bottle.\" The Apple Filling is gently backed up by the sweet leaves of the Virginia. Just a nice hint of pear to let you know its there but also provide some body to everything else in the mix. Seriously 11/10 on this excellent flavor."

      "text": "This is a fantastic vape. The first few days, I really couldn't decide if I wanted it sweeter like a dessert or earthier like a tobacco. At one week, it is simply something special. The Virginia just dissolves into the apple filling making it a superb combination, like a dry earthy leafy goodness. The pear lifts it all just enough to keep you coming back for more. I adore this in my mtl tanks. I could vape this for weeks on end. It's also a nice break from tobaccos which I usually vape without the shock of going sweet desserts or funky creamy. Truly a masterpiece in my opinion. Not a tobacco vape. Not a dessert. Not anything specific but truly amazing."

      "text": "This is magnificent! There are three recipes that I think put my favorite season in a bottle - Deer Lodge by ConcreteRiver, Pheasant Ridge by Fear, and now this. It is like inhaling a painting called \"Autumn.\" It tastes like celebrating the harvest. It's raking leaves while drinking cider and watching football. The spice-like edge on the sweet Virginia combine with the bit of cinnamon in Apple Filling to make it warm and a perfect pairing for being outdoors in the fall crispness or just being reminded of it anytime.
