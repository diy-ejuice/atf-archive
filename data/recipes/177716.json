  "name": "Booberry Cheesecake an Ode to DIYorDIE",
  "description": "This is pretty easy to decode if you have spent a lot of time here or on DIYorDIE. I took Wayne's Cheesecake layer and added the Blueberry Trinity. This juice is so fricken amazing. Blueberry Cheesecake was one of my earliest flavors when I quit smoking. I had searched and tried to recreate that for a long time and then this came to pass. It is easily three times better than the juice I was trying to make, by combining some simple layers from other recipes - you can do so much. Give this a mix, pull the Blueberry Trinity layer if you have not seen it before, it works very well in other ways.\r\n\r\nYou can shake and vape this - but if you put it in a closet for a couple weeks or so... you will enjoy it even more.",
