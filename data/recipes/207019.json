    "description": "OOO Chocolate Milk is a REEEALLY good base for this chocolate milk shake profile. It has a nice milky dairy note and a subtle hershey's chocolate syrup note.\r\n\r\nLB Vanilla Ice Cream is going to be our ice cream note. It's a little eggy, which is perfect for an ice cream. You won't get any notes of pepper from this flavor.\r\n\r\nOur cake note is JF Yellow Cake. Yellow Cake i a nice sweet bakery note, it's a bit dry but it blends up nicely with the dairy and chocolate notes.\r\n\r\nSweeten to taste.\r\n\r\nWatch the video here:\r\n\r\nhttps:\/\/youtu.be\/rhJPYjTvRO0",
