The graham cracker and sugar cookie add the just right cereal notes and the perfect amount of sweetness to bring across the drier side of the bowl. The genius bit comes in with the milk. The vienna cream is a touch heavier than even whole milk, but damn, that with the cream cheese icing and the hazelnut add just the right amount of extra sweetness to excellently approximate the sugar saturated milk at the bottom of the bowl. This is one seriously well thought out vape."

I may put the recipe up on ELR as an adaptation.... "

This smells like pebbles, but the taste after 14 days isn't fruity pebbles.  3% TFA Graham Clear gives me a slight burnt taste, (as it has to my own recipes in the past as well, I like to stay under 2 or 2.5%) and I would prefer less Sugar Cookie and Meringue if I were to mix it again.  I personally didn't have any issues with the Lemon Lime, but I think the other fruits could use a bump or even another fruit to represent the full spectrum.  I'm sure you've meant to adjust this (maybe not?) but if you're like me, you just keep coming up with new recipes and trying new flavors and don't get too hung up on any particular recipe for too long.  Kudos on a tasty recipe that really uses some \"outside the box\" ingredients to drive home a specific profile."
