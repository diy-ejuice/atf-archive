  "description": "Due to VSO flavorings not being on this site, i have had to substitute flavor companies to be able to post this, but please, mix this with VSO fruits only.... They really make this recipe shine...\r\n I recommend a steep to let the creams work their magic, and to let the sharpness of the lemon work in with the berries...\r\nA luxurious dark berries and (ice) cream experience with a bright note from the raspberry and lemon cooked in with the darker berry flavors...\r\n(I'm a firm believer of BRING YOUR OWN COOLANT, so if you want it, you probably know how much you like)\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter the steep i have decided i would like to add a touch of sweetener, although the meringue does add some sweetness as it steeps..I'm waiting on my cap Super Sweet to come in, and will try a batch at .25%\r\n",
