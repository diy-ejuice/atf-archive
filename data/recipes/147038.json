  "description": "Hi all,\r\nI bought the \"Graham Central Station\" by Plus One Vapor when i was in Paris. \r\nThe seller told me that this liquid is no longer been produced and he sold me his own last 50ml bottle he had left and\r\nwhen i came back home I really wanted to clone it so we can keep vaping it.  Afterwards, i found out you can still buy the juice lol!\r\nThe juice is not a banger and nothing crazy about it but maybe someone finds it interesting.\r\n\r\nAs always a simple and typically very sweet profile for a commercial juice, enjoy.",
