  "description": "Ok, i have secretly worked on this for a while, it may not be acceptable to some but it tastes like the juice I get at my local vape store and that is their most popular juice, they sell s**t loads of em\r\n\r\nFA tahity lime cold pressed: probably my favourite lime, in small amounts it's perfect IN MY OPINION, and I'm pretty sure it's in that juice I spoke about ^^^\r\n\r\nINW biscuit: I know it has changed, used to be my favourite bakery, but still goes well IN MY OPINION in this mix\r\n\r\nCAP yellow cake: nice and sweet, fluffy in a way, almost an anise aroma to it, works in this recipe\r\n\r\nCAP Butter cream: just wanted it to be a bit buttery and this has worked in my favour\r\n\r\nINW yes, we cheesecake: just a good cheesecake for the base, it's my favourite. \r\n\r\nFW sweetener (sucralose) : OK I get it, I should have got CAP super sweet, but my local DIY store didn't have it. \r\n\r\nAt the end of all this you get a nice sweet, buttery, custardy cheesecake with a fluffy centre and a touch of lime, it's probably my favourite mix. But the idea of it is supposed to be light, not heavy. That's my spin on key lime pie",
