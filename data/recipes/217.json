I naturally changed the SS to FW's Sweetener at the same % however, after playing around a bit I'm digging FE Lemon at 2% instead of the Lemon Lime and I don't find it harsh what-so-ever. "

That just means the flavor is potent enough to make this a special treat every once in a while to help treat that pesky mixers block. This is THE recipe that has inspired multiple mixes for me. Thanks Manson for this super underrated banger."

The throat hit on this, and as far as I can tell anything with lime, is pretty harsh. I can only vape this for about a day before it becomes way too much. This is 100% worth mixing and, if you don't have a bitch-ass throat, it'll make it into your daily rotation easily."
