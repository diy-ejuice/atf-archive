  "description": "Very interesting \"request\" from [ID10-T](https://alltheflavors.com/users/ID10-T) that fit with our theme of \"Not a dessert\" for @Freshepies show. It's not bad at all, cheese and cranberry forward for sure with supporting notes behind. It is a Brie Cheese with a Cranberry sauce. Might need a small few days to sit for the brown sugar. ",

      "text": "Not the baked brie with cranberry sauce that I actually suggested, but a great vape, especially for something a bit savory. I got a bit of something acrid from it as a S&amp;V and the Brie was intensely cheesy. Then I let it steep for a month. Now the cranberry really tastes sweet and saucy, without that kind of bitter edge. It also cuts into that cheese and prevents it from being offensive, without tamping it down too much. The end result is a satisfying vape and proof that FLV Brie can be used higher than I would have thought without being offensive, as long as it has a smart paring. My only beef is that while it might still be doing something important to the cranberry sauce, that little bit of orange is completely gone as a discrete flavor and it seems like a little twist of orange that I could actually taste would be an enjoyable accent here that would kick this up another notch.
