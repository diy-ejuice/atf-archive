  "description": "The OG Honeycomb custard!\r\n\r\nThick creamy custard smashed with honeycomb throughout, not one person who has tried this mix to date has given negative critisicm.\r\n\r\nFairly explanatory use of concentrates, \r\n\r\nVTA honeycomb has to be here and it has to be bold, 6% I find is the perfect amount as itâ€™s not too much and itâ€™s not too little, the warm custard, cap V1 and the sugar cookie make up the custard base and I really wanted a tinned custard here and thatâ€™s what I got because of how milky the VTA warm custard is, donâ€™t be scared by the sugar cookie itâ€™s in there as a thickener and you will not taste it apart from a nice sweet finish at the end that adds to the cinder toffee. The Creme BrÃ»lÃ©e  showcases how I go about mixing, that caramelized sugar on top accents the honeycomb perfect and the custard base boosts the base just a little bit more. This part of the description was added 30/01/19, when I mix I sometimes just go head first into it and not explain my use of concentrates and I didnâ€™t understand how badly other mixers like to know the reasoning behind the choice of flavours, I have gotten better and I hope other mixers can take something away from my recipes.\r\n\r\nCreated by myself, Nevans.\r\n\r\nGet the one-shot now at chefs flavours.\r\n\r\nhttps://www.chefsflavours.co.uk/nick-n-mix-one-shots/6626-honeycomb-custard.html\r\n\r\n",
