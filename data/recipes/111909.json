  "description": "This is a “clone” of sorts of a local-ish vape shop’s juice called Pegasus Milk. I usually don’t post my non-Tobacco ventures because I don’t tend to enjoy them enough to consider them share worthy, but I’ll be gosh darned if I don’t like this one. And I’m not even a cinnamon fan. It’s simple and definitely not ground breaking or original, but I like it, so maybe others will. ",

      "text": "I tired a bunch of cinnamon recipes this past week and this one was easily my favorite.  It’s like Cinnamon Toast Crunch in heavy cream with extra cinnamon. A CTC for cinnamon lovers. The cereal is tasty and authentic to CTC but it takes a backseat to the delicious rich cinnamon. Although it tastes yummy and fairly authentic, I get a little maple off-note with FLV Cinnamon Crunch, and the texture is a little soft. The extra Rich Cinnamon and Cereal 27 fixes both of those issues beautifully.  Although cream base is more of a heavy cream than an authentic milk, but that really just makes it extra yummy; I wish I could put heavy cream on my cereal instead of milk and not die of extreme fatness. The bottom line is that CBV should post more of his non-tobacco adventures. "

This is a very clean and crisp cinnamon cereal recipe, and I will certainly be adding this to my rotation. It's incredible right after mixing, but once the 7 days pass the cinnamon will calm down and blend into the cereal/cream combination wonderfully.  "

      "text": "I kind of have a love/hate relationship with CAP Cereal 27. The cereal part itself is great but depending on what it's mixed with the corn flake flavor is way too forward. Using FLV Cinnamon Crunch in this recipe was a genius idea and is a straight knockout combo with Cereal 27. To anyone just looking for a damn good Cinnamon Toast Crunch recipe, mix this up."
