    "description": "I have been messing around with flavor combos for this profile for a while, this is my favorite rendition so far. Its just a simple butter cookie with strawberry and imo its quite tasty. I will continue to mess around with this profile and different flavor combos since its such a tasty profile to experiment with, but this one i think was worth sharing.",
