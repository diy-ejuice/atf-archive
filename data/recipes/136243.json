  "description": "Honey Custard Tobacco\r\n\r\n\r\nINW Gold for Pipe has a bit of metallic note that requires a bit of bending but the flavor itself is an incredible honey pipe tobacco that I've wanted to use for a while now. VT Golden Syrup brings that honey note found in Gold For Pipe forward, fills it out, and adds richness that was needed to blend both the honey and custard layer. OOO Creme Brulee is very toasted and creamy but lacked the true custard note which is where TFA Vanilla Custard comes in. I have struggled to find a custard that works well with tobaccos and overlooked TFA Vanilla Custard many times, but I find this to be my favorite custard in general for it's flexibility. FLV Fucking Native.. enough said. Anyone should know by now my love for FLV Native is beyond belief. It's an amazing dry tobacco that I've found hard not to put in any tobacco. If you don't have it, grab it, I love it. I really do love this mix with .6% FLV Virginia to add that light, spicy, golden tobacco flavor that really does fit with the honey profile... BUT with the help of Alfred Pudding going against my better judgement I went with FLV Kenutcky Blend at the same percentage because it adds that bold tobacco that provides a great balance of tobacco and custard.\r\n\r\nThis is the version I chose to release, if you like more custard than tobacco just bump the custard up to 1.5-2%. If you get pepper from TFA VC sub with FA Premium.",

      "text": "Steeped for a month before trying. For whatever reason Gold for Pipe has always tasted like chewing tobacco to me. When i first got VT Golden Syrup I mixed the two trying to make a chew styled tobacco but never could get something I was proud of. With that being said the spices in the Kentucky and Native keeps this in pipe tobacco leaf realm. Also the pairing of the INW and FLV is a smart idea I have noticed it keeps the FLV from fading out. The cream base is good too, and the butteriness the TPA VC has compliments the  butter that the golden syrup has. Excellent job and thanks for sharing. "

      "text": "This is my new favorite tobacco recipe. The amount of honey that Max managed to pull out of these flavors is still blowing my mind. He claims it's from the use of golden syrup, but I'll continue to believe it's magic. The 2% Native already makes this a stellar recipe in my book. You could probably leave everything else out and have a phenomenal tobacco vape. I don't recommend that though, because everything used here was expertly assembled by a fellow tobacco connoisseur. TPA Vanilla Custard and OOO Creme Brulee are used at the perfect level to keep this a tobacco forward recipe, instead of a dessert recipe with tobacco sprinkled on top. Then Kentucky (a solid choice) is used to add a nice back note of spicy tobacco that pairs insanely well with the custards. I highly recommend giving this one a shot. "
