  "description": "Ever since I started vaping I've been fascinated by TFA Pistachio, the smell is just amazing, but I have never been able to find a recipe with a satisfying strong pistachio flavor. I have done countless bad attempts trying to nail down the Pistachio/RY4 combo (made famous by Charlie Noble), but almost all of them have ended up in the sink.\r\n\r\nI did however have an epiphany when the legendary @shyndo released his recipe for his \"Karl Custard\" oneshot, where he not only uses TFA Pistachio at 8%, but also wrote an incdedibly helpful note on how to tackle the sharpness that such a high percentage of that flavour brings.\r\n\r\nAs I did not possess the flavors he is using, I started making my own version with 8% TFA Pistachio as a starting point, and with his notes as help. I also got some very encouraging words from him on the DYI_eJuice discord: *\"dont be afraid to push shit just because some pretentious bastard tells you he gets \"off notes\"\".*\r\n\r\nSo here I am. PUSHING!\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n**TFA Pistachio:** I set out to copy Shyndo by using this at 8%, to really bring that powerful yet creamy pistachio note.\r\n**TFA RY4 Double:** At 4% it is just enough to force mute the heavy pistachio note to a perfect level, while bringing that lovely caramel tobacco note to the mix.\r\n**DFS Holy Vanilla:** Creamy eggy wonderful vanilla. At 2% this also helps take the edge off the pistachio, but mainly blends it together to a lovely vanilla pistachio cream that you just want to eat out of a spoon.\r\n**FLV Milk & Honey:** I would say this is optional, but I think it brings a complexity to the whole mix with that dark sweetness that works very well with the pistachio and tobacco notes.\r\n\r\nAgain I just have to thank @shyndo, who not only came up with this amazing recipe (Karl Custard), but also went out of his way to answer my questions and gave me invaluable advice on how to develop recipes. So please make sure to check out his Karl Kustard\r\nhttps://alltheflavors.com/recipes/99973#karl_custard_by_shyndo\r\nhttps://chefsflavours.co.uk/karl-custard-30ml-shyndo/\r\n\r\nExtra notes:\r\nRegarding steeping, this only gets better the longer it steeps. After a month this is incredibly tasty and the pistachio has blended perfectly with the rest.\r\nIf you want to add more tobacco flavor, don't add more RY4, but instead add @Fear 's Cardinal combo: 0.25% FLV Kentucky Blend and 0.75% FLV Red Burley.\r\nTFA RY4D can be swapped for DFS Holy Grail RY4 at 7%, if you want you can also lower DFS Holy Vanilla slightly to make up for the extra cream that the Holy Grail brings.",

Most of them taste very one dimensional and flat but this one really hooked me. Most recipes don't work well with my pallette but Pistachio RY4 usually does especially if it is a simpler recipe. This one is simple but the flavor is so complex. It's definitely my favorite in this category and possibly by favorite RY4 period. Good job man!"

      "text": "I picked up TFA pistachio to mix this, PistachioRY4U and Trinistachio and this one is by far the best of the 3. TFA pistachio is a great flavor and bert does a great job showcasing it alongside TFA RY4D, which normally I'm not a fan of. The inhale is mostly pistachio and on the exhale you get the pungentness of the tobacco swirled in pistachio cream with hints of that dark sweetness from the M&amp;H. It's not a very nutty pistachio but more of an ice cream pistachio, that bright, green, creamy goodness. It developed a lot over the course of a steep, and really came together after two weeks, the RY4D really mellows out, getting less dirty and more sweet as time goes on. bert doesn't think it needs it, but I added some CAP SS to see what would happen and I think just a touch really helps solidify this into a luscious dessert vape. Very nice job bert. (I also think JF RY4D would be as good if not better in this, with less steep time required. But I only mixed it as written so I can only review as written.)"

      "text": "I was really afraid I might not like it when I mixed this up. I'm not a fan of the bacco's at all, but the way RY4 blends in with the rest of flavours is just pure heaven. I really love those slight Milk and Honey sidenotes you sometimes get while vaping this, and the Vanilla that somehow pulls and holds all of this together, while the Pistachio does what it's supposed to do. Deliver a f*ckton of pistachio-goodness. If you like Pistachio - go mix this up right now"

Really delicious mix that while vapable and delicious early, is only going to get better with age! Thanks for sharing your hard work staybert."
