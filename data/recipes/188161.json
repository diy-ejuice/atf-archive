  "description": "A set vanilla cream pie topped with cinnamon sugar.\r\n\r\nMy base here is FA cookie and Graham cracker V2, the graham cracker also brings a cinnamon note that helps the magic sprinkles on top :) \r\n\r\nThe cream part is self explanatory being the VT vanilla cream, the Sugar cookie brings more vanilla and also kinda sets it a little an adds a touch more bakery.\r\n\r\nFLV caramel is the brown sugar, paired with FLV rich cinnamon is a nice little combo for that final dusting.\r\n\r\nThis isn‚Äôt a groundbreaking recipe but it‚Äôs so delicious and moreish you won‚Äôt be able to put it down. You can shake and vape this but it is better after a week once that VT butter from the vanilla cream infiltrates the recipe as a whole.\r\n\r\nIf you like what I do and this recipe then please rate and review accordingly ‚ù§Ô∏è \r\n\r\nIf you would like to support me then you can do by purchasing some of my products\r\n\r\nUK: \r\nEPIC!
