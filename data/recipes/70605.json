    "description": "A delicious and subtle pear flavored tobacco - perfect for the bacco novice and pro alike!\r\n\r\nIn my slow exploration of tobacco recipes, I wanted a mild, slightly sweet tobacco experience without the often off-putting \"wham\" of full-on tobacco.\r\n\r\nINW Pear Tobacco\/INW Pear\r\nA mild, slightly sweet tobacco with fresh pear top notes, but just not enough pear for my liking. I boosted the subtle pear notes with with a touch of INW Pear, which is still the best pear around IMO.\r\n\r\nINW Gold Ducat\r\nA fabulous tobacco for tobacco virgins! The ducat boosts the pear tobacco and brings with it natural honey and nuts which perfectly marries with the pear.\r\n\r\nINW Biscuit and HS French Vanilla Ice cream\r\nI find tobacco recipes to be too linear and the addition of these two superstars adds that roundness and fullness to take this to the next level. this also brings a of familiarity to the bacco novices... The HS FVIC can be subbed for 1% FA Cream.\r\n\r\nEnjoy!\r\n ",
