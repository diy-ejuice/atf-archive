  "description": "This is a butterscotch mix with elements of custard and creme brûlée \r\n\r\nI wasn't really happy with a lot of the Butterscotch recipes I had been mixing so I went ahead and made one from scratch. There's no chemical/weird taste in this one which a lot of other recipes have. Butterscotch is not really the prominent flavor per se, so adjust your percentages accordingly if you want it to be more \"there\".\r\n\r\nAging time is about a week+. Obviously the longer you can wait, the smoother and tastier it gets. Feel free to try it out before a week and it'll still be pretty damn good.\r\n\r\nEnjoy!\r\n\r\nMisc Notes:\r\nAll these flavors are available at Bull City Vapor.\r\nFW Butterscotch (natural) is not the same as FW Butterscotch!\r\nLeave out CAP Graham Cracker if you want.\r\nFW Sweet Cream and VBIC are quite different from their TFA counterparts. Please keep that in mind if you decide to sub with those (I haven't tried it personally)",

      "text": "After an 8 day steep I've just started vaping this. This is insanely  flavourful. Heaven in a drop of vapour! Really creamy dark sugar custard background with a rich Butterscotch on the exhale. Didn't have FW Butterscotch Natural just the regular version. Great job mate! Full marks for this profile. You really knocked the ball of the stratosphere ! Update: &#xD;\nI added 2% FW Butterscotch Ripple  ; 2.5% JF Yellow Cake and subbed Cap VC with INW Custard 1%. I'm on a butterscotch buzz so  I find JF Yellow Cake provides more body and gives the butterscotch sth to soak into. Once again, Thanks a mill for sharing, you're certainly a shark at the aul' mixing! "
