    "description": "During last months i have been experimenting with tobacco flavors that i have in my stash(and i really have a lot),which are not very popular amongst tobacco mixers.The results of these experiments are sometimes good and sometimes they end up in the sink.When i think that something is good enough to go on public,i upload it.The only reason i upload these tobacco mixes is only one;i don't really care if they become popular or whatever,at the end mixing is just one of my hobbies.But,for what is worth,a public recipe with these flavors might be a good start for someone for further experiments and more good results.\r\nFA's Shade is a good tobacco aroma,slightly sweet and really smooth.mixes well with cigar aromas and also gives that necessary cigarette-like note.INW's Sunset Virginia is a tobacco aroma that has a slight walnut note and a little of dark chocolate.TFA's Toasted Marshmallow adds sweetness,but also gives a toasted accent and a thick mouthfeel.INW's shisha vanilla doesn't really need any introduction,it mixes really well with desserts,bakery,tobaccos,you name it.one of the best vanillas out there\r\nEnjoy and experiment!",
