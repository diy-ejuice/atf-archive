  "description": "Mixers club: March 2020. The ice cream man @eyemakepizza is about to be a father. To toast this, I've mixed a pink \"milk\".\r\n\r\nPink here is a true amalgamation of flavors. INW cherry and INW shisha strawberry are both syrupy by nature, and the FA red touch is helping reinforce the strawberry to stand up along side the cherry. Pushing past that CAP sweet guava helps crank this otherwise pedestrian fruit combo into an oddly tasty medley of red fruits.\r\n\r\nPudding in this case is pretty cut and dry with FLV vanilla pudding and INW custard sharing the duties while FLV smooth vanilla helps cut through the fruit with a sweet soft vanilla.\r\n\r\nSpecial shout out to @rainbowdragon for helping with the art(okay, that's selling her efforts short, she did all the work) in this month's series of MC recipes.",

I am not giving this a star rating since I don't feel like it is a recipe I would have mixed up on my own since I do not typically like cherry vapes. They all unfortunately taste medicinal to me. However, if you enjoy cherry vapes, this may be a fantastic recipe for you to try out! Every other aspect of it was really really good.&#xD;\n&#xD;\nJust from smell, I am guessing the pink is strawberry. Definitely something else in there, but I cannot place it on smell alone.&#xD;\n&#xD;\nWhoa, based off of smell, this is not what I was expecting at all. I have now changed my mind from strawberry to cherry. I think I am sensitive to the medicinal off-notes of cherries because all of my medicine as a child was cherry flavored, but this one is extremely minor and not offensive at all. Definitely some sort of custard/pudding/cream mixture in here, but I cannot place any of the individual flavors. Whatever it is, t is definitely tasty and thick. I am also getting some vanilla in the background, but most custards and pudding seem to be vanilla flavored by default.&#xD;\n&#xD;\nAfter looking at the recipe, I am very confused. I get the strawberry off the smell, but only taste the cherry when actually vaping. I’m actually really embarrassed that I can’t taste any of the CAP Sweet Guava either since it is one of my favorite flavors. However, I normally use it a bit higher cus I like the “funkiness” that it brings. I think using INW Custard to thicken FLV Vanilla Pudding up was a smart move and works very well. The vanilla is nice as well, so I’m glad that little bit of FLV Smooth Vanilla was added to help out FLV Vanilla Pudding.  &#xD;\n&#xD;\nOverall, I really enjoyed the recipe, but I personally didn’t get any strawberry or Sweet Guava. That is more than likely just me though since I’m very sensitive to the cherry. &#xD;\n"
