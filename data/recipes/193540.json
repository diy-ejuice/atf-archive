  "description": " UPDATED...Tpa peanut butter is  what I had at hand  when this was mixed  DX peanut butter would be sufficient if you prefer...........This recipe has been in my flavor stash for a year now just recently mixed  this up again substituted \r\nall TPA flavors  it's kinda old school but it's tasty and simple if you're into RY4 profiles.. I usually mix all my RY4 recipes @ 65/35 for use with tanks and MTL's any new mixers would have these flavors at hand to give it a try...thanks ðŸ˜Ž",
