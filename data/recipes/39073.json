  "description": "Spring is upon us and it's about time for the guilty mixes to come in again. This mix blends perfectly with the fruit and light cream ratio.  I wanted to make it very simple. \r\n\r\nTPA STRAWBERRY RIPE gives it that true fruit feel. Almost that natural ripeness. \r\n\r\nTPA APRICOT & PINEAPPLE is what you really taste here. Together they almost give it a tart sweetness. \r\n\r\nTPA RASPBERRY SWEET gives it sweetness that's add to the other flavors without destroying coils.\r\n\r\nTFA VBIC blends it all together. It really doesn't serve as a cream just helps glue the fruit together.\r\n\r\nAdd koolada if you'd like for some coolness.",
