  "description": "Recipe inspiration came from a subway raspberry  Cheesecake cookie. Fa cookie and inw biscuit give you a nice buttery crunch for the crust. Obviously ny cheesecake is where the cheesecake comes in nice and fluffy. Strawberry ripe and sweet raspberry play so nice together. They pick each other up in all the ways necessary to give you a sweet bright raspberry flavor. 4:2 ratio is perfect. Mix and enjoy ðŸ˜Š ",
