      "text": "This is great, because cherries are very hard. It kind of sort of threatens to do the new vinyl shower curtain thing, but never actually crosses that line. It’s a tart-sweet juicy red cherry and everything here seems to be playing a role to make that happen. Although it’s a really, really neat trick to have such a bold cherry flavor that doesn’t taste like plastic or medicine at all, overall I get flat cherry soda. It seems like something is missing? I want to add some fizz. All of the best ways to add fizz would also bring along some citrus, but that’s ok. Citrus and cherry sodas are awesome. Cherry 7-up. Maybe a legit Mountain Dew Code Red recipe. As far as I know, no one has actually made a great recipe for either of those, so that would be an accomplishment made possible by Drippin Churries. Either way, 7-Up or Code Red, it seems like a little FLV Citrus Soda would go a long way here."

Dope recipe although i had to sub tpa apricot for fa.&#xD;\nIve struggled a little with cherries but this is banging get a tart sour juicy cherry, loads of flavour here. Thinking about doing another mix and turining it blue with some blue razz and maybe a little ws23 for the summer. Nice one bro this is a great vape"
