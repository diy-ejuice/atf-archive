    "description": "This recipe is a delicious cranberry sauce sprinkled with cinnamon sugar meant for vaping right after your Thanksgiving feast. \r\nDon't forget to remember the thousands of lives destroyed for no reason other than empirical prowess and religious conquests. \r\nOtherwise, you wouldn't be able to watch the NFL on your Flat Screen while you pig out on a dry bird covered in the secretions of said bird. \r\nVideo and Flavor Notes -> http:\/\/bit.ly\/2mSQcMV",

            "text": "This one is hard for me to describe. It's tart, and most assuredly a cranberry sauce in the middle of the vape. It's figuring out the inhale and exhale notes, and what they do to the vape that's confusing me. If the temperature\/wattage is too high, it's pepper spray time, cos hooboy, the cinnamon. When it isn't though...it's like...inhaling a cinnamon danish with cranberry sauce filling that was sitting in a pan with a brown sugar glaze. Very sweet, and very delicious, with lots of tart and spice intermingling. I can't call it a straight cranberry sauce, as I can totally detect the bakery notes. Maybe with either the CDS lowered, or just a straight cinnamon? Possibly a drop of pumpkin pie spice (either flv or cap) would be a better spice note, and help this live up to its name better.&#xD;\n&#xD;\nThat said, this is still thoroughly delicious and enjoyable as hell. Goes great with pumpkin pie (regular or vape), but sadly I can't give this a five for accuracy due to that prevalent bakery note. &#xD;\n&#xD;\n4.5\/5 An extremely well done seasonal taste that wouldn't go amiss at breakfast time."

            "text": "This tastes like as big a mess as the title after steeping for six days. It's not harsh but it is sharp and boozy, coming across less like a cinnamon-spiced cranberry sauce and more like chopped raw cranberries soaked in cheap spiced rum with some undissolved sugar at the bottom of the glass, garnished with a cinnamon stick. Instead of cinnamon-sugar on top, cinnamon and sugar are on opposite ends of a vape that starts with cinnamon and ends with sweet. What's in the middle tastes tart and fruity like cranberry, but also a bit bitter and oddly warm. It is both camphorous and acetous at the same time, camphorous without the accompanying coolness. I'd say it almost goes balsamic if it weren't so brown sugary sweet. There's also an intermittent woody note that's just strange. However, it's oddly far from unvapable for me, in part because of the absence of harshness and in part because it's so weird I kind of want to keep vaping it to figure it out.  Also worth noting that I appreciate the message here, and that quite a bit of my displeasure might be attributed to trying it in the middle of July and NOT AS INTENDED  \"for vaping right after your Thanksgiving feast.\" As noted by @inrespekkt , a longer steep might make it more enjoyable. But mostly I think this is the wrong solo cranberry for the job, and way too much FA Pom. "
