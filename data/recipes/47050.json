    "name": "3 Peanuts: Simple Peanut Butter Cheesecake",
    "description": "Another simple 3 ingredient recipe, (all TFA) here is my simple Peanut Butter Cheesecake recipe. I like to make this with 1% FLV PB and 1% LA Cream Cheese Icing added but it's still a great recipe as is, and a great recipe for those who don't like to add in a bunch of flavors. Feel free to add sweetener to taste. Just to be clear this is a shake and vape recipe. In my opinion, peanut butter dies and kind of taste bland after a steep. So again this is formulated as a shake and vape only, and is best right away. \r\n",

I may try it adding just a touch of sweetener and a few drops of saline. But thank you MrColdOne for showing me that I have an interest in these flavor combinations and I hope to hear your thoughts and or revisions on this recipe."

Not sure why people would rate this recipe so low after an extended steep, the recipe clearly says SNV, pretty sure it's common sense to follow a recipe exactly if you're going to judge it. This is one of my favorite mixes in a good while."
