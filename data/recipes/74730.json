  "description": "i Was loooking for something sweet to make. Lately I’ve been on this dessert vape kick. So I decided to mess around a make a nice frosted Cupcake with some sweet goodness.\r\n\r\nTFA Vanilla Cupcake : Such a great flavor that works so well to build that nice moist cupcake taste with nice vanilla notes. \r\nFLV vanilla Pudding.: This flavor is just such a great flavor perfect in so many desserts. I brings that nice creamy feeling to the recipe while adding a bit of wetness.\r\nCap: French vanilla or DiyFS french vanilla. just adds a bit more creamy vanilla flavor to recipe. If using caps give it extra day or two to steep.\r\nFW : Butterscoth This Flavor is just reall delicious when mixed low brings that sweet flavor that you would taste in a Donut or a nice balanced cupcake. \r\nFW Buttterscoth Ripple: This works well with the butterscoth to give a bit more richness to the cupcake and plays well with FW Butterscotch.\r\nFLV Frosting: This Flavor provides the nice icing flavor that you want on a real cupcake. It just adds that perfect amount of sweetness. \r\nInw biscuit  used this to add a bit of texture to the recipe  authenticity of a real cupcake. \r\nCap Supersweet: This Flavor is optional but I like it as it adds just a bit more sweetness that I love in a recipe.\r\nI mixed this up at 70/30 and it taste good after a shake. I steeped for 5 days and it’s just so delicious everything just blends together so well to make the perfect sweet creamy Cupcake. Give it a try , I absolutely love it.",
