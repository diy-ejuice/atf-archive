Since I've gotten into DIY, I've been cloning and remixing these 3 often. Sagamore is simply a RY4 with a bit of cupcake, creams, cinnamon, maybe graham cracker. In this remix, I forego the cracker, the extra creams, and the obvious choices like TFA RY4 Double, CAP CDS, or CAP Vanilla Cupcake. Instead, I went in a different direction but aimed to keep it simple. Think I struck gold. A thick, smooth caramel, touch of tobacco that cuts through all the heft, a nice cakey base to build it all upon, with a hint of that good ol' cinnamon tickle.\r\n\r\nThis one's solid, cost effective, and easily an ADV or big-batch worthy. Give it a go :)",
