    "description": "Flavourart's RY4 is excellent as base. tobacco with a dark caramel scent and low vanilla,unlike tfa's ry4d.Kentucky blend and Red Burley add their distinctive notes,such as caramel(a light one),wood,nuts,maybe just hint of spice and leather.overall we have a pipe tobacco base.Irish cream from FA is more like the taste of Bailey's liqueur,which is a good thing,but lacks on the cream.so i added the bourbon vanilla from FA,because of its darker vanilla taste.also i didn't want the final mix to be covered with a bright and sweet vanilla aroma.\r\nA pipe tobacco recipe with a light scent of alcohol and cream..enjoy!",

It's just a little rough around the edges this early but I can see where it's going and I'm loving the dark nutty pipe tobacco with just a touch of spice and sweet vanilla cream finish with a hint of caramel. It's already a banger that DELIVERS. "
