For this month’s submission, I googled “Irish Tobacco” and hit up [this page](http://www.tobaccoreviews.com/blend/929/peterson-irish-oak) for Peterson Irish Oak. Tobaccoreviews.com is a really great source for inspiration because people that take the time to write reviews for Pipe tobaccos usually use some great descriptions for what they’re tasting, and the reviews are sorted by “most helpful.” So you usually get some ConcreteRiver level reviews at the top. \r\n\r\nI’ll read the top three or four reviews and start thinking of flavors that fit the description. \r\n\r\n> A freshly opened tin reveals tangy woody and dry grass aromas with an upfront sweetness and background pepper note.\r\n\r\nSo right off the bat I’m thinking FA Oak Wood (woody), INW TA Virginia (grass), INW TA Garuda (sweetness), and INW Black for Pipe and FA Black Pepper (pepper.)\r\n\r\n> The flavour builds down the bowl, and mid-bowl the smoke transforms into more nutty and wood-like flavours. Overall the flavour is dominated by Virignia and Burley, but it is very much a unique blend (and I wouldn't say this is a classic Va-Per). The perique is detectable and adds spice but the taste overall is dry-nuttier...\r\n\r\nAlright, so we are going to need a nutty Burley and probably give that Virginia a little boost. I’ve been messing around lately with mixing HS No. 5 with FLV Red Burley to create a toasted, nutty Burley. So that’ll get added to the list. FLV Virginia is a nice sweet Virginia that will give a bit more depth to the TA Virginia (in my submission to mixersclub I used INW Sunset Virginia, which I’m really liking, but my first version that used FLV Virginia is really good, and it’s a more common flavor.) I’m also thinking the Black for Pipe/Pepper should be quite low, so it doesn’t overpower the Virginia and burley. \r\n\r\nAll this is from the first review, and I’ve mostly got it figured out. The reviews after I will start playing around with the ratios and maybe seeing if someone got something completely different that I maybe should consider adding. \r\n\r\n> If there is burley present, it's blended harmoniously as I don't pick it up as a dominant or distinct flavor.\r\n\r\nUh oh, is there a strong Burley note or not?! Should I drop it? Better read more. Scroll through and see “nutty” mentioned a couple more times and feel safe to keep it in there. There’s really only so much you can get from a few reviews, and eventually you’ll have to start making decisions based on how you want the mix to taste. I’ve been in a Burley mood lately, so my Irish Oak is gonna have some gosh darn nutty Burley. \r\n\r\nAnyways, figured I’d throw out a little bit of my mixing technique when it comes to trying to create a real tobacco profile. In case anyone ever wants to give it a whirl. \r\n\r\nSubs: \r\nHS Virginia and INW Virginia are both fairly similar to FLV Virginia. INW I would keep the 1.5%, HS I would go 2-2.5%. INW Sunset Virginia at 2% is also pretty nice, and has a bit of a nutty flavor to it that compliments the Burley. \r\n\r\nIf you don’t have FA Black Pepper, you can try FA Perique Black at .15-.2%. Or bump the Black for Pipe up to .8% and add .15% FLV Heat. \r\n\r\nIf you don’t have HS No. 5, get it. In the meantime, turn that Red Burley up to 1.3%. ",

      "text": "Sniff test: A nutty tobacco really reminds me of a liquid i had before many years ago from a company called Halo but i cannot remember the name of it&#xD;\n&#xD;\nOff the back of the hand i am not getting the nutty tobacco more a cinnamon red hot thing going on.&#xD;\n&#xD;\n With a single coil@35 watts i am getting the wood, some sourness thinking that is the “grass” element, with a pepper/cinnamon at the end of the exhale. Onto the dual coil @70 watts definitely getting some virginia tobacco notes with some pepper on the end.&#xD;\n&#xD;\nFull disclosure I have worked with one the ingredients you used that being FLV Red Burley. So I am going off how you described the flavors. This reminds me of pipe tobacco more like how it smelled when my grandpa would smoke it. The pepper taste comes but it more like a cinnamon to me, and i was worried when i seen FA Black Pepper because i have never tried it and I thought it would be harsh AF but this is far from harsh. It has a grassy sourness like you described as well. It has a smokey nutty woody part to the vape as well. Which is probably what i enjoy the most. Has a touch of sweetness it there. Not getting much if any dryness. All and all I really enjoyed this recipe. It is a intricate pipe tobacco, and truthfully makes me question my abilities at creating tobacco recipes.&#xD;\n"
