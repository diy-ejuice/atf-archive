    "name": "mango sticky rice (benoz not shyndo)",
    "description": "so i am a big admirer of shyndo i watch most of the youtube stuff he does and respect the mans attitude towards other mixers and the way he addresses questions even tho they are some times trivial. i wanted to make his mango sticky rice but didn't have any of the ingredients to do so. so i chucked this together and it has come out sweet not sure if it is better than his (probably not lol) but is quite tasty and authentic considering the limited flavours i have in my stash. some i wish i had would have been a sweet coconut and i know heaps of people have the vta mango and are raving about it so maybe try this with them if you have those. \r\nalso i probably over complicated this recipe and could have left out the zeppola and suggar cookie but they seemed like a good idea at the time and i am trying to use up my sugar cookie before it goes bad and it came out good enough for me to share this with the world. \r\nmuch love.....",
