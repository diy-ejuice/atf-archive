The tpa pistachio brings a nice creamy base which is deepened by the flv pistachio and then this is perfectly contrasted by the persian lime which is an outstanding citrus aroma. Together it brings a nice balanced combination of citrusy and bakery kinda. Definitively worth a try"

Would need to be a gastronomer to describe the taste from this. All i can say is, Amazing. Thanks a mill for sharing such a complex-tasting yet low ingredient recipe. Don't know how you guys do it. "
