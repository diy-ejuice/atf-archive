  "description": "Idea stolen from @rockyharlow\r\nThe profile is a tropical perfumed guava.\r\nLove cap sweet guava. To me it Is a sweet nectar with that little bite of bitterness. It plays very well with dragon fruit and cactus.\r\nThese three were made to be vaped together.\r\nInw pitaya:\r\nThe juice emulsifier with some floral nuances. Here it plays better than tpa df\r\nJust for that floral feel.\r\nInw cactus: a little lemony back note and tons of wetness, it makes wonders paired with guava.\r\nFa jasmin: one of my fav floral flavors. It provides  very well that petals perfume I wanted in the mix.\r\nThe ws-23 is the perfect coolant to get a summer refreshing vape.\r\nCap super sweet helping the guava become more vibrant. \r\nFor a smooth juice let it steep for 8-10 days. Can be S&V but better after steep\r\n",
