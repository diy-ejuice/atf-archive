  "description": "Sometimes the logic works better then memory. I never had something like this recipe in my life, but I knew that these ingredients should work well together.  So I mixed them and... BOOM. It's delicious!\r\n\r\nTHE RICE BASE\r\nFE Sweet rice 3% and just 0.25% of FA cinnamon ceylon it's what I always mix when I want rice desserts.\r\n\r\nCOCONUT\r\nFLV Sweet coconut 3% is the true fruit, the white pulp of coconut. But it is weak, so I need a bit of commercial coconut flavor. Fa coc√≤ 1% it's the perfect pairing.\r\n\r\nPISTACHIO\r\nI need a sweet candy pistachio here so I use RF pistachio at 2%\r\n\r\nBLOOD ORANGE\r\nFW blood orange is a complex flavor: it has a fruit part that talk with coconut and a bitter part to make a compensation to the sweeteness of RF pistachio.\r\n\r\nFINAL THOUGHTS\r\nYou need a 0.5% of sweetener to help the coconut to rise up and to mute down the rice off-note.\r\nI'm very proud of this recipe and I have to thank a lot of mixers for inspiration:  @ENYAWREKLAW for his note about FE sweet rice, all  the NOTED crew ( @mlnikon - @ID10T - @CheebaSteeba ) for their explanation of RF pistachio and FLV sweet coconut.\r\n\r\nEnjoy and don't forget to review.",
