  "description": "  Alright here we go. Cap double chocolate V2 (thanks folkart) turned out to be a pretty damn good chocolate. The only issue is a little bit of a lingering fakeness on the tail end. So the recipe was pretty much just finding a way to fix that. Rf cookies and cream does a good job overpowering the tail end of it with a somewhat thin authentic chocolate finish.\r\n    So next I just set out to thicken that chocolate and enhance the overall full body richness with some dairy and vt devon cream is basically T H E B E S T concentrate to do that job. It is THE chocolate enhancer.\r\n   After mixing that up as my control I split it into smaller bottles cause it still needed something to really set it off. One of my batches had sa banana flambe in it where I used fw yogurt to make the banana taste more authentic. I loved what it ended up doing to the chocolate so I tried taking the banana out for curiosity's sake. Sure enough that was the money. I don't know why or how but it really brings out that wonderful trashy golden arches shake kind of authenticity. Also I don't have sweetener in the recipe but I absolutely DO RECOMMEND YOU ADD SWEETENER if you want the authentic experience.\r\n  Feel free to throw things on top of it like banana, mint, vanilla, strawberry, or peanut butter. I hope you enjoy it as much as I do. Special thanks to mlNikon (emily) and method01 for testing the recipe with me and Alfred pudding for providing some great feedback!",

I'm not sure there's any actual chocolate in those things, but it's not what I'd call tootsie rollish, either. It's just... Micky D's chocolate shake stuff, whatever that is. I admit I thought Shyndo was lying when he said it wouldn't gunk my coils because it's pretty brown but about 40ml in I'm not seeing any gunk. Remarkable. About 30 ml, I dropped around 0.5% FW Sweetener in there. Perfect. "

It steeped for a good week, I smelled it daily, letting it breathe and shaking it. It turned out really great. I tried it in a 22 mm Nudge RDA. It has become one of my new alldays. If I close my eyes and vape it, it really takes me back to a time where I would visit the Golden Arches once a week. Thank you Shyndo for this beautiful chocolate shake. And I will make the original version as soon as I get my hands on those cookies (not easy in Germany)."

      "text": "Shyndo, you've nailed yet another authentic profile. This is one of the best chocolate mixes I've had. It is very authentically milkshakey. It is very chocolaty and delicious. I agree with pudding that it can use some sweetener but sweetener is like salt, add what you want. I don't think it needs it at all but might help push it a little more chocolate milkshake direction. The devon cream/fw yogurt combo is a great, thick creamy base for this awesome balance of chocolate to sit on. "

      "text": "I'm going to be completely honest. I didn't expect this to nail accuracy this well. As Shyndo mentioned, CAP Double Chocolate V2 has a very \"artificial chocolate\" aftertaste and I can still pick it out a bit in Mayan Milk. It turns out RF Cookies &amp; Cream really does completely cover it up and provide a pretty decent actual chocolate flavor in its place. I don't understand how FW Yogurt managed to set this thing off either, but it really does a fantastic job here. I absolutely recommend mixing this up, trying it, and then adding a solid amount of sweetener. You should try it first because its an incredible demonstration of a chocolate recipe working without adding any sweetener, but this is a McDonald's chocolate milkshake after all... "
