    "description": "Banana Biscuit sprinkled with cinnamon Sugar \r\n\r\nI almost always have some sort of idea, of a road I want to go when making a new recipe, but in this case I was so afraid that the ingredients I used wasn\u2019t something that Sydney vapours had, since my last recipe had FA \u201cup\u201d which they didn\u2019t have, that i went through they\u2019re site looking for inspiration. \r\n\r\nI hadn\u2019t used tpa banana cream in a long time, and I actually didn\u2019t enjoy banana vapes since Wayne had that whole week about bananas, which where when i purchased the banana cream. \r\n\r\nBut... when I saw that on SV site, i knew I wanted to make some kinda cookie. \r\n\r\nI went with the inw biscuit because it is so damn delicious. It\u2019s almost like a cookie custard to me, and with that and the cream from the banana cream, it was the perfect match to make a \"raw\" cookie dough with mashed banana in it. \r\n\r\nThe cinnamon Sugar is doing 2 things. It is the sprinkle on top, but it also makes the raw cookie dough into a nice crispy baked cookie...\r\n\r\nLet it sit for a good 2-3 days and enjoy yourself a easy cheap Vape. It doesn\u2019t have to be so damn complex everytime, and I really love that with this challenge \ud83d\udc4d\r\n\r\nThanks to Cathy wood for making me do these notes. I know I means a lot to me when I\u2019m looking at others recipes, so of course I should do em my self. Not sometimes, but always! ",
