  "description": "Rich, spiced cream with yam and some bready, bakery from the Pumpkin Bread. A very autumnal recipe. Nice and warming on a cold day. \r\n\r\nI originally made this as a possible submission for the #Developed FLV assignment. But I didn't have time to finish it then. I really liked it, it's kind of addicting, so wanted some time to tweak it. It took a few versions to balance the spice notes. \r\n\r\nTested on Citadel RDA, 0.6 ohms, around 35w. ",
