  "description": "Shoutout to ID10T, Matthew Kocanda, Rageisalotofwork, and my boy J E R R Y!\r\n\r\nFA Carmel aka Caramel is used quite high. This is our top note and after testing it at multiple percentages all I can say is it just works at 2 percent. It just freaking works. Gives a nice soft caramel flavor reminiscent of brown butter to the mix. 2 percent might seem high to most but I just ask them to try it.\r\n\r\nCap Vanilla Custard is what really makes this ice cream and not gelato. This concentrate increases our steep time but also adds fresh yolks tempered in sugar lending a nice richness that is sorely needed in thick French ice cream.\r\n\r\nINW Shisha Vanilla adds sweetness; a nice complex and wonderful vanilla that compliments our caramel and brings the mix to a whole new level.\r\n\r\nHS French Vanilla Ice Cream is our soft slow-cooked buttery note with a nice slightly cold ice cream flavor. It has unparalleled richness so we must use it low. This also increases our steep time but it's worth it.\r\n\r\nFLV Cream works as an emulsifier for the creams and a nice soft background creamy note that doesn't mute or lower our flavor ceiling. Truly an amazing concentrate. Also, I can't stress enough how well this and fresh cream work together.\r\n\r\nFA Cream Fresh is the dairy brother of flv cream, This is our half and half unpasteurized and a necessary ingredient in our ice cream.\r\n\r\n\r\nFull write-up of the process behind this recipe can be found on diyordievaping.com\r\nYou can find Jerry's version here: https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/46554\r\nTRY IT! IT'S FUCKING FIRE!!!",

The sweet, almost tangy caramel is backed up by a rich vanilla ice cream. The FLV Cream really emulsifies everything together through the steep. Such a good call. It isn't overbearingly sweet; I can vape it all day long. This is a definite keeper. I'll be mixing a major stash. Thanks for sharing, Shyndo. Very well done, my friend."
