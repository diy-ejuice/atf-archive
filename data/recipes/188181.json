    "description": "When I first started vaping, Betty by Pinup Vapor was the hot flavor everyone in my area was vaping.  I got a free bottle of it and it was enjoyable, but at almost $30 for a 30ml, I was not going to buy it again.  I've seen some good clone recipes for it, bur they all had the same off note the orignal got when it was too hot.  This is my attempt to remix it without that off note.\r\n\r\nFA Forest Fruit:  The core flavor of what makes Betty.\r\nTPA Blueberry Extra: To round out the fruit notes.\r\nCap Super Sweet:  It's got to have the sticky syrupy sweetness.\r\nINW Lemon Mix:  A little bit of tart to make the berries pop.",
