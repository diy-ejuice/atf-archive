    "description": "So a while back my girlfriend was at Walgreen's picking up some candy for us to bring to our friend's house to begin our Star Wars marathon when she noticed a new, peculiar candy in the isle. When she looked at the white box she saw what would soon become her equivalent to crack-cocaine: Toffifay. I'm not even exaggerating in the slightest when I say that she always has a box on her at all times.\r\n\r\nSo what is Toffifay? Essentially, you have a whole hazelnut coated in a thin layer of caramel which is then coated in a milk chocolate\/nutella-like coating. Its pretty damn good and it makes sense why she has become addicted to this shit.\r\n\r\nLong story short she's probably spent over $300 on this candy in the last month alone and I needed to break that habit. So I came up with this recipe to HOPEFULLY ensure that she doesn't go bankrupt over a fucking hazelnut candy.\r\n\r\nFA Hazel Grove, FW Hazelnut - These two make the basis for our hazelnut as well as make our semi-nutella chocolate cream. FW Hazelnut is the star of the show because when you bite into the candy you immediately taste the whole hazelnut in the center. It is used at 2.5% to withstand the creams that come into play, but at that high of a percentage it can start to almost taste like a sweet hazelnut and the real deal is an almost bitter hazelnut. This is where FA Hazel Grove comes in, at just a half a percent it helps in making the whole hazelnut slightly bitter and more authentic. These two concentrates also help in mixing with TPA DCC to give it that \"nutella\" impression.\r\n\r\nFA Carmel, TPA Bavarian Cream - FA Carmel is used to give us that slight impression of caramel that is present in the real deal. There isn't much caramel in the actual candy, so 1.5% was enough for it to be noticeable but to also have it stay at the bottom of the food chain in this recipe. TPA Bav. Cream is used to make the caramel more smooth and add some mouth feel while also working with TPA DCC to make it more of a milky chocolate and not just chocolate syrup.\r\n\r\nTPA Double Chocolate (Clear), CAP Vanilla Whipped Cream - TPA DCC is obviously the base of our chocolate coating. As stated earlier, the actual coating is almost like a hybrid of nutella and regular milk chocolate, so when mixed with the hazelnuts and bav. cream, it helps us achieve that strange hybrid. CAP VWC is used to add some mouthfeel and boost the milk chocolate aspect of the chocolate coating.\r\n\r\nSweetener is used at .5% simply because my girlfriend has a MAJOR sweet tooth. For me, I like it at only .25% but I also vape it without sweetener as the FA Carmel lends some sweetness to the recipe as well as TPA DCC.\r\n\r\nSo there you have it folks; a recipe representing the candy that has made my girlfriend consume approximately 1,300 calories a day in candy alone! I hope you guys enjoy and remember,\r\n\r\nStay sexy folks ;)",

            "text": "Man, the flavor is fucking on point in this mix. If you've had any hazelnut candies like this, you know what's up. If not, enjoy this vape and call it a day. And this is a bastardized mix I had to make, I'm missing hazel grove and using TFA Caramel instead, so I can't wait to mix the actual thing. 5 stars right off the SnV. You get the hazelnut flavor, strong but not over the top, the chocolate is nice and present, and the Nutella\/chocolate cream is there too. Banger \u2604\ufe0f\ud83e\udd19&#xD;\nWill update with proper mix and steep"
