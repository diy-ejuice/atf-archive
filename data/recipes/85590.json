  "description": "I was searching for a good Caramel Coffee vape for awhile. After trying PUR Caramel Coffee with Sweet Milk I finally had a direction. It has a good coffee flavor that I didnâ€™t find totally bitter or burnt. The Caramel in it was not completely burnt flavored. The Sweet Cream was there but needed the most help. \r\nâ€¢PUR Condensed Milk, FA Meringue, & TPA Vanilla Swirl combo makes it a bit sweeter with a more milked flavor. It also gives it gives it a bit more mouthfeel.\r\nâ€¢FW Butterscotch Ripple was an obvious choice to deepen the caramel, make it creamier, and gives more weight.\r\nâ€¢WS-23 30% was another obvious choice to make it a cold coffee. (It can be omitted for just regular caramel coffee.)\r\nâ€¢CAP Super Sweet to make it sweeter. Adjust the percentage or omit to fit your taste. I add TPA Sweetener at 1% to the 0.50% CAP Super Sweet when I wanted to crank up the sweetness. Yeah I like sugar. Fat boy problems. If using only TPA Sweetener use 1% to start and 2% for the Fat boy version.\r\nâ€¢You can use just EM if you are sensitive to sucralose, but I wouldnâ€™t go over 2% and it will slightly mute the flavors.\r\n\r\nOff the shake it is ok, vapeable, but is not very creamy and bitter.\r\nâ€¢It is ok at a week of steeping, but the coffee is still a bit bitter/burntish.\r\nâ€¢At a 2 week steep it is getting better, but needs more time.\r\nâ€¢After a 3 week steep it is a lot better. The milks and creams start to come out and the coffee settles down.\r\nâ€¢4 weeks is definitely the sweet spot, but to be honest I was at the bottom of the tester bottle by then. With only about 2ml left. Just enough to tell a difference.......then it was goneðŸ˜¢.\r\n\r\nIf you have more patience than I do it is definitely worth it.",
