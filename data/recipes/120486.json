  "description": "Posting this because I mixed up TamVapes Goo In My Butter Cake but with a few swaps.  I initially thought they were errors but realized, I completely bastardized the original.  TamVapes created the base ultimately for this.  https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/119884#goo_in_my_butter_cake_by_tamvapes\r\n\r\nOn to the Creamy Nut Cake - \r\nSince I am obsessed with vanillas and creams, I cannot stop vaping this. \r\n\r\nI had been searching for a couple of years for an elevated but more calm  use for Cake Batter Dip and a way to make it work with TPA Pistachio.  FW Salted Caramel is my go-to caramel because on a couple of my mesh tanks I actually get the salty sweet.  I know, I know, you don't get salt in a vape - I beg to differ. I might be hallucinating it but either way, in at least 2 applications the saltiness of the FW Caramel (Salted) comes through on the exhale.  I don't like sugar lips (don't come for me on the Yellow Cake) but salty lips - all day errday! \r\n\r\nI am still a fan of FW Yellow Cake but I would imagine WF Angel Cake would suffice in this recipe at 2%. \r\n\r\nThe FW Vanilla Butternut brings the recipe together and gives an overall vanilla back to the fluffy layers in this recipe.
