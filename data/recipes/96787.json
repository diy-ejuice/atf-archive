    "description": "A pretty simple, creamy, slightly sweetened milk tea with just a touch of coconut.  Satisfying one day after mixing.  Local Thai restaurant's Thai Tea inspired me . . . it's a strong brewed black tea sweetened with condensed milk and topped with half and half.  It is sinfully sweet and robust.  There isn't anything in the way of citrus or spice.  The cream swirling into the tea made me think of Jupiter.  \r\n\r\nFLV Black Tea feels non-negotiable . . . in my opinion, it just outperforms the other black teas I've tried (INW and FA).  I thought the touch of vanilla and coconut would really push this towards the flavor I was seeking.  Milk & Honey kind of mimics that condensed milk note.   0.3% Super Sweet to help with that sinful sweetness mentioned above.  \r\n\r\nI looked to ID10-T's Hello Daddy Hello Mom (https:\/\/alltheflavors.com\/recipes\/84337#hello_daddy_hello_mom_by_id10_t) for the milky inspiration, where he states, \"You do NOT need to purchase FA Milk to make this. FA Cream Fresh makes a good 1:1 sub. Or try CAP Sweet Cream as a 1:1 sub. Or use OoO Cream Milky 1.5% or TFA Sweet Cream 1% instead of 2%.\"     \r\n\r\nEnjoy.  I've been mixing everything 60vg\/40pg because it seems to work for the devices I use most (Hadaly clone for taste testing\/home use and Joyetech Penguin and Dolphin for commute\/on the go).",

I tried to keep them as close to the intended profile as possible, but of course mine isn't the same as the original.  What I ended up with in MY rda, however, was a nice sweet vanilla tea ice cream that was plenty rich, plenty thick, and had just a touch of a caramel note from the milk and honey."
