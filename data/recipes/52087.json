  "description": "Another Food Pairing concept here, there is something about this combination i really like.\r\nI have a sweet apple base, topped with the floral notes of hibiscus and counter it with lemon grass and passion fruit and cinnamon.\r\n\r\nIt's definitely not a usual strawberry cream, but it's made for those vapers who like their juice a bit more special.",

      "text": "I don’t consider myself a basic strawberry and cream guy, but this is so weird that despite vaping a ton of it I still can’t say for sure whether I like it or not. The top notes are tart and citrusy, warm with a hint of spice, and little floral. The base is sweet juicy apple and tart and syrupy passion fruit along with that strange sort of woody richness of lemongrass. It’s a well rounded, full-flavored juice that combines many different elements without being muddled, and that makes it interesting. It’s not harsh at all, despite being citrusy and spicy, it has a smooth finish. "
