    "description": "I was try to go for an authentic preserve type Blueberry in this recipe and I believe the HA AND MB Paired together achieves this the MB has sweetness that goes all the way thru the flavoring it could most definitely be a single flavor mix all by itself, the HA BB is the opposite it has a tartness on the draw and gets sweeter thru the pull.I also added MB Eden Apple for alittle juiciness and to brighten up the blueberries. . So I chose FLV custard and fresh cream(FA)\r\nAs my custard base in future mixes I may add some CAP custard for its egginess and to make the custard fuller... But for now it's still good wanna see where the FLV ends up in a week or so\r\nAdded a small amt of super sweet to smooth out the edges ",
