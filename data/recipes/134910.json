    "description": "I'm a donut junky, and I really enjoy a good dessert vape from time to time. \r\nThis has been a labor of love for me for quite some time now. I combined WF Glazed Donut SC, and FA Zeppola for a donut base. I threw in FLV Pound Cake for a more \"cakey\" feel. I added LA Cream Cheese Icing and FLV Milk And Honey for kind of a \"Yin and Yang\" sweetness; cream cheese icing being the light, and milk and honey being the dark for a flavorful sweetness. The CAP Super Sweet is something that can be discarded, but I used it for a glazed effect.\r\nSteep for at least 7 days, but I recommend 10-14.",
