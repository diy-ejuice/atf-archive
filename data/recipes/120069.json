  "description": "The key to this mix is the use of **WF sesame candy** to create that dark Kernel of a popcorn ( Thank you  https://alltheflavors.com/users/StarsandClouds Pippa for that tip!!) it is exactly what was needed to add that authenticity to the mix . It really can not be subed.   it is initially strong in  the mix but will fade in about 3 days  and settle in very nicely . \r\n\r\nThe **WF caramel butter and VT salted caramel** pair to create that buttery caramel note.  I tried various blends or   caramel, toffee and butterscotch  and this was the winning combo.    \r\n**TPA kettle corn and TPA sweet cereal flakes** make that sweet kettle corn texture that i was looking for, without being overly dry and providing that very light corn note.  ( SUBs - cereal 27 was too dark for this and added too dry of a texture. **WF caramel rice crispy** can also work, but I preferred the TPA sweet cereal. l Most of the other popcorn flavors are more of the movie theater popcorn butter and did not work. **FLV popcorn** can also work here but I preferred kettle corn) . \r\n\r\n**VT golden syrup and OOO vanilla Marshmallow** are the sweet blending notes to this mix and help to had some volume and mouth feel to off set the dry notes of the popcorn and cereal \r\n\r\nNOTE: This is pretty sweet so I did not add any sweetners but   add to your taste \r\n\r\n\"Learn more about mixing here:\r\nhttps://www.facebook.com/groups/diydownunder/\r\nhttps://discord.gg/kH4Fqbc\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCTCwb7ULyfJALQlehomZZQA\r\nhttps://www.diydownunder.com/\r\nHave you tried this recipe?!\r\nPlease rate this recipe and comment below!
