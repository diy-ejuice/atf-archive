  "description": "Welp, I finally did it, I made a summer-like recipe that I actually quite enjoy. This is a recipe I've been working on since late April and is loosely based off of SVRF's Satisfying. However, I wouldn't go as far as to call this a remix because it's almost a totally different profile. This is a chilled class of green tea with a squeeze of lemon and a hint of raspberry. Originally, I had wanted to make a clone/remix of Satisfying by SVRF, but it soon developed into a mix entirely in of its own. Prepare to be satisfied. \r\n\r\nFE Green Tea - through many bogus testing of different green teas from various vendors, I came back to this bottle from Flavor Express I had bought a while ago from trying Exclusive Girl's GTKK. I use this at 1.5% to stay strong amongst the raspberries I use in the mix. At 1.5%, it holds itself strong without being too weak as to be overpowered by the raspberries. \r\n\r\nINW Raspberry, TPA Raspberry Sweet - normally in my bakeries and dessert recipes, I will use Raspberry Sweet and INW Raspberry at a 2:1 ratio to have a nice raspberry syrup with slight authenticity. However, I wanted less sweetness and more authenticity in this recipe; almost like you have some muddled raspberries floating atop of the tea. At this ratio, it achieves exactly what I was looking for without overpowering the Green Tea. \r\n\r\nFA Lemon Sicily - this plays two roles: it helps make the raspberries slightly more tart and I personally love my tea mixed with some lemon juice. At 1%, it is enough to boost the raspberries and be noticed throughout the recipe. \r\n\r\nKoolada is used at .25% to \"chill\" the recipe without making it completely an iced drink. Koolada can be adjusted to your preference, or left out completely if you do choose. \r\n\r\nSweetener is always subjective. \r\n\r\nThis is 100% a SnV, although if you are sensitive to INW Raspberry or FE GT, letting the bottle sit overnight should take away some of that scratchy throat shit. \r\n\r\nSo there we have it. A recipe that, in my opinion, is better that the source material that inspired it. If you guys have been noticing me as of lately, you probably get that I don't really do fruits/summertime vapes, but this is definitely one that I am proud to have created and enjoy the absolute fuck out of. Please mix this up and let me know what you guys think!",
