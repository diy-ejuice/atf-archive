  "description": "One of my all time favorite commercial e-liquids is Blondie by Centerfold Vape Co.  It is described as, \"Rich, not too sweet, creamy, and full of flavor. This is a vanilla custard with a light hint of fruit - a custard like none before it.\"  It truly is wonderful.  So, I set out to make a custard with just a hint of fruit.  I wanted that hint of fruit to be pear . . . FA Pear.  I used LB VIC because Blondie reminds me of a cr√®me anglaise or the base of vanilla ice cream before it is frozen.  The custard base is made up of FA Custard Premium and FLV Vanilla Pudding.  I added FW Tres Leches because I love the creaminess of it . . . also a key ingredient in Botboy141's Just Cust.  CAP Cake Batter just adds to the overall richness of the recipe.  AP is added for just a bit of that grit . . . to sharpen those smooth edges.  Finally, DIYFS Holy Vanilla . . . because Holy Vanilla!  \r\n\r\nThis Gold Ounce is not trying to be a clone of Blondie . . . it is an homage . . . an ode.  This is, like, version 100 (a bit hyperbolic but with a grain of truth) of my attempt to find my vanilla custard . . . my custard . . . just one in a vast sea of custards.  My quest to rival Ahab's . . . I'm shouting, \"Look ye! d'ye see this Spanish ounce of gold? - holding up a broad bright coin to the sun - it is a sixteen dollar piece, men. D'ye see it? Mr. Starbuck, hand me yon top-maul.\"  I'm leaving this here for now and nailing it to the mast.\r\n\r\n3 day minimum steep time . . . after 3 days the flavors in this recipe start to blossom and open up.",
