It takes a steep but it eventually slides right into the body of the yogurt with an added depth from the Butterscotch ripple. The cream cheese icing (also needs the steep) makes for an amazingly sweet,rich finish with a touch of sugar lips from the drop of Super Sweet.\r\nGive this one a mix...definitely give her a follow! \r\n\r\nThis recipe was tested and designed on the Haku single Clapton at .54ohms at 50W\r\n@s2k on ELR",
