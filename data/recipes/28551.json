  "description": "\"...a smooth combination of ripe strawberries and fresh, thick cream.\" -BDV\r\n\r\nThe point of the recipe was to remix \"Moo Fields\" by Blue Dot Vapors, a staple strawberry milk juice. I know there's a hundred popular S&C recipes, but Moo Fields isn't quite like any of them. A lot of new mixers are probably familiar with BDV and Moo Fields, too.\r\n\r\nFlavor notes:\r\n\r\nFA Cream Fresh is a straightforward cream. It's clean and smooth. There's no vanilla or egg note, only that beautiful cream. At 1.5% it's present, but it doesn't take the spotlight from the strawberries.\r\n\r\nFA Meringue is a well-known bakery and milk ingredient. It lends that sugariness to the Fresh Cream and sweetens it into milk. I found a 3:2 ratio of Cream Fresh to Meringue to be milky without getting gritty. Since I kept Cream Fresh low at 1.5%, Meringue fell right in at 1%.\r\n\r\nTPA Strawberry (Ripe) had to be used for that fresh and ripe note from the original juice. It lacks any body or presence on its own though. Being such a light flavor, I decided 4% was a good place for it. I didn't want to go overboard, and I knew I would be filling it out with another strawberry.\r\n\r\nCAP Sweet Strawberry is definitely present in the original as well. This is the body of the strawberry. A 2:1 ratio of Strawberry (Ripe) to Sweet Strawberry is absolutely delicious. You get the bright, sugary, forward notes of Sweet Strawberry, and Strawberry Ripe gives it some of the fresh authenticity of the real deal. The creams are light, so there wasn't a need for much strawberry. I let Sweet Strawberry guide my percentages more than Strawberry Ripe. At 2% it comes out in front, but the creams are still there. I thought about working JF Sweet Strawberry in, but it isn't in the original. Part of the appeal is how the milk shines through more and more as it steeps anyway, so CAP Sweet Strawberry's slow recession into the mix is welcomed here.\r\n\r\nFA Marshmallow fills everything out. It further sweetens the recipe and gives it body. 1% doesn't let the marshmallow flavor come out, but it works magic on the mouthfeel.\r\n\r\nLet this one steep a week or two. Sweet Strawberry and the creams take time to find their places.\r\n\r\nHappy mixing! 👽",

This is an excellent S&amp;C and one of my several keepers in this crowded and popular category.  Easy, clean ADV.  Also good with FLV Cream and your favorite marshmallow subbed in.  Add a drop of sweetener to make it an even 10% :) "
