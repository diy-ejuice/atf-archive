    "description": "It's orange Jello with shredded carrot and pineapple tidbits in it. Kickin it 1950s housewife style with this one. \r\n\r\nThis one's a bit of a childhood nostalgia trip for me. I've seen culinary recipes for this posted as \"pineapple carrot orange gelatin salad\" and \"sunshine salad,\" but in my family, it has always been known semi-affectionately as \"Granny's Carrot Crap.\" It's more common to see this made with lemon Jello, but my Granny uses the orange Jello and I'm still fond of the pairing of orange and carrot in food. Try some fresh orange zest on honey-roasted baby carrots, for example. \r\n\r\nFLV Carrot tastes great, but it's 100% a raw carrot. Good luck turning that into a cooked carrot. Not saying it can't be done, but it won't be easy. And putting that into some kind of carrot cake profile? No.  \r\n\r\nHere, I just embrace the rawness. I like it raw. \r\n\r\nCAP Golden Pineapple is pineapple tidbits. INW Shisha Orange was cooperative when it came to being turned into orange Jello, unlike a couple of other oranges I tried. It's not a very realistic orange. It's been described as an \"Italian soda syrup\" orange and that description works for me. A little bit of CAP Jelly Candy gives it that gelatinous flavor and TFA Whipped Cream fills it out, rounds it off, and holds it all together. Don't sub CAP Super Sweet or some other all-sucralose sweetener for the TFA Sweetener. The maltol in it is part of the Jello. If I had to recommend a 1:1 substitution to someone who doesn't have TFA Sweetener, I'd suggest TFA Strawberry Ripe over a different sweetener. ",
