  "description": "Candy_\r\nSteep time: 3-7 days\r\nStarted off as a lemonade, but the Inw raspberry ended up giving it that nice candy property and I was instantly a fan of the combination. The Jungle lemon really boosts the tartness of the lemonade dramatically and rounds out the vape. I can't seem to put this one down during the summer months. Very sweet and refreshing. \r\n\r\nCan be vaped after 24 hrs with decent results, but I recommend letting it sit for a week to really meld that raspberry into its intended balance. ",
