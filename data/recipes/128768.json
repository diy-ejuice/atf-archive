  "description": "I found the profile for Moon milk on a food recipe site and decided it would make a great vape.  The flavors go wonderfully together!  The cherry is the top note with a lovely almond and creamy Honey rose flavor.  I vaped it right after mixing and it's delicious!!  \r\nI normally don't add sweetener to my mix and I feel this one is fairly sweet enough without any.  I do think this one is great as is but, would taste great with a touch of tartness added\r\n\r\nI can't wait to see what this one does as it steeps!  ill be back for an update.  \r\nupdates:\r\nsitting overnight:  The cherry is tasting more like a slightly toasted milky cherry, rose with cream and vanilla.  wow it's very lovely and totally worth it!\r\ngive it a try and let me know your thoughts.",
