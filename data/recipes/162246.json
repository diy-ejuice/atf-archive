  "description": "!!!!!!!!!READ THIS BEFORE MIXING!!!!!!!!!\r\nThe DFS Holy Resurrection is only representing ENYAWREKLAW'S Holy Custard which was the inspiration for this recipe. It has all the note that you would want in a great custard but is very light and will accept the strawberry concentrates without either of them being bullied by the other. I will mix, I will vape and if it is delicious i will post. \r\nThanks Wayne ðŸ˜¤ðŸ˜€\r\n#allaboutthatbase",
