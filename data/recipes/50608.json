  "description": "A nice, not-too-sweet, spiced herbal tea. Still in progress, but still lovely.\r\n\r\nRF Masala Chai - SC: Provides the body of the recipe. Delicious.\r\nFE Green Tea: Adds an earthy, herbal flavor while also toning down\r\nthe sweetness of the spices in Masala Chai while keeping the flavor present.\r\nFLV Cream & TPA Vanilla Swirl: This combination gives the impression\r\nof a splash of vanilla creamer in your chai tea.\r\n\r\nS&V is possible but recommened steep time is 5 days\r\nto let FE Green tea calm down and FLV Cream build up the creamy mouth-feel.",

      "text": "This is one very interesting tea, depending on what wattage/temperature you vape it at. At lower temperatures, it's a delightfully spicy tea with nutmeg and cinnamon, with the barest hints of creamer and green tea. At around 380F/40 watts, it's a very mellow chai tea with the barest hints of cinnamon with a splash of green tea and a goodly portion of vanilla creamer. Anything higher is a more watered down tea, so didn't enjoy that. That said, this is one hell of a tasty tea for those of us who like chai.&#xD;\n&#xD;\nNicely done!"
