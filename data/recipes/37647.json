    "description": "Id say the only sub u can prolly make would be for the FLV vanilla puddin...u can use FLV Vanilla Custard ~3%. They are similar but I do find flv vanilla pudding to be a bit sweeter.\r\nThe vanillas in this recipe work nicely together added to the cookie, the oreo filling, and the pudding. Vanilla bourbon is usually my go to in bakeries\/cookies but here it was just a bit too \"dark\" for me...madagascar along with holy vanilla gave me the vanilla to creamy that i was after.\r\nJF cookies is a really great flavor...its somewhere in between Fa Cookie and cap sugar cookie.. the 1:1 worked nicely for me. Of course with some butter and fw graham cracker to just add something special to that cookie.\r\nLA CCI completed the cookie filling for me...\r\nI LOVE GOLDEN OREOS AND HAVE EATEN PROBABLY TOO MANY OF THEM IN MY LIFE this recipe is pretty darn close...ENJOY!\r\n  ",

I mixed this at 70\/30 3mg - first week it was more cream filling from a golden oreo... then week 2 some bakery started to come out, week 3 (I forgot to test it) and week 4... it ROCKED! Very nice cookie and cream vape, rich vanilla note and I am picking up a faint hint of lemon... could be me, but it almost has that lemon butter cookie note, the ones that are like blonde oreo's but with a touch of lemon. It does not matter really - it is just lovely. You get a nice cookie inhale with creamy vanilla on the exhale followed by that very faint hint of acid. It is just amazing. New fav recipe to make on the regular."

Not sure I agree with the 4 day steep timer but if your taste buds are like mine just wait a few weeks and its well worth it."
