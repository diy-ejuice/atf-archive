  "description": "This is profile is slightly sour lemon lime up front with a hint of a peach note in the middle and sweet meringue on the exhale. This seems to be the favorite for most vapers out of the Space Jam line and I can see why. Its a great sweet and sour candy fruit experience, great for spring. It has a medium throat hit on a shake n vape but its gone after a couple draws and will steep out after a couple days. Im not a huge fan of menthol but I would say that this recipe would make a good candidate for adding just a little bit. Menthol is not in the original profile and neither is raspberry but in testing I found that 2 drops per 30ml of INW Raspberry adds another layer and works very well in this mix. So there you have mix it up, enjoy, and never have to buy Pulsar by Space Jam ever again.",

I get zero throat hit from this juice, I don't get much peach for that matter, I get more of the candy peach ring notes, helping to give more of the candy profile to the lemon and lime. It's sweet but not too sweet. Reminds me of downing a handful of yellow and green sour patch kids. Very good work here, I imagine I will be vaping this a lot throughout spring and summer"

I used .75% TFA sweetener to sub for cap SS.&#xD;\n&#xD;\nUpdate: after a few days rest the S&amp;V harshness fades and I'm really starting to get addicted to this profile. Definitely adding this to my normal rotation. Thanks "
