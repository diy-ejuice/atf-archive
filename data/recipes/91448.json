    "description": "Black currant and strawberry tobacco. \r\n\r\nVt shisha black currant- is a syrupy black currant. Initially I used this at a higher percentage and it completely took over the mix. So i dialed it back a bit\r\n\r\nINW Shisha Strawberry- is a syrupy strawberry that smells and taste alot like a strawberry jolly rancher to me. \r\n\r\nFLV Native & Kentucky taste very similar to me. Mildly sweet & lightly spiced tobacco with a hint of smoke. But in my experience with FLV tobaccos most tend to fade in a steep so i paired these together\r\n\r\nFLV Cured- the tobacco note in cured taste very similar to kentucky and native, but cured doesn\u2019t have spice that the others have. I also get kind of a syrupy note with Cured which i figured would go well with the shisha flavors. Cured also fades rather quickly if it is not paired with another tobacco \r\n\r\n\r\n",
