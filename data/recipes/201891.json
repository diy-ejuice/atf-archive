  "description": "Samuel Thierstein you fucking asked for it...\r\n\r\nMajor Filth relaxed at last. He'd been in space with Colin his co pilot for six days and he'd been incredibly tense the whole time. Something had shifted in his psyche, it may have been the fact that he'd been able to hit a deep sleep for the first time the previous night, or it may have been the three skin space reefer Colin had convinced him to share, but he definitely felt more at ease. His trademark white spectacles pinched his nose and he removed them momentarily and giggled as they floated before him. Colin sidled up behind him and poked a finger through his flesh tunnel. Filth spun around angrily and was taken aback to see Colin wielding a tube of KY jelly and a hopeful look on his face...\r\n\r\n;) Thanks Dean\r\n\r\nA fluffy Pancake spread with Butter and mixed Berry Jam, melted under delectably sticky Maple Syrup.\r\n\r\n1-2 weeks for the cake to come through and the syrup to soak into it. Very delicious.",
