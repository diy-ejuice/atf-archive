  "description": "Quick and easy 1-2-3 Strawberry Cheesecake.\r\n\r\nThanks to the LB Strawberry Cheesecake, this can pretty much work as SnV. I suggest give some steep over night, and you're good to go.\r\nIt's heavy on the strawberry, with exhale notes on the NY Cheesecake.\r\nGood to go if you're in a hurry!",

I think the \"fluff\" is the perfect word to describe it, because it's definitely lighter than some of the other more popular SBCC recipes out there.  Definitely needs a couple of days steep if you ask me, but once it gets there, it's there.  Great recipe. "

I saw something .. something.. I thought I had long but forgotten.. &#xD;\n&#xD;\nI gathered up my ingredients.. drove to my mothers house.. and made that bitch mix up my shit.&#xD;\n&#xD;\nAfter 3 painstakingly long hours. It was finally ready..&#xD;\n&#xD;\nI filled up my electronic cigarette, and subsequently my lungs with this vapour ..&#xD;\n&#xD;\nA tear ..&#xD;\n&#xD;\nA tear rolled down my cheek ..&#xD;\n&#xD;\nThis was it ..&#xD;\nThe thing which I thought was lost forever..&#xD;\n&#xD;\nSweet .. strawberry .. love .."
