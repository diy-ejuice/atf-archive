  "description": "This was surprising. I started out just vaping the BMIC and VBIC but when I added the fruits it got so much brighter and more vibrant. I have to say that I haven't fully tested this and made sure that everything is actually needed or doing anything. All I know right now is that it tastes good and that there aren't many recipes or uses out there for Blue Moon Ice Cream so I wanted to get a little more out there. I know RF aren't usually very good but this is one of their gems IMO. Steep for at least 6 days. If anyone actually mixes this or has any input or constructive criticism please leave a review. \r\nFURTHER TESTING: After a 3 week steep the \"blue\" flavor kind of faded and the vbic and cap v1 are pretty strong. Thinking about taking away vbic and adding 1% to the blue moon. RF flavors can usually go pretty high  so that should be fine. As always if anyone has suggestions or experience here I'm open to criticism here, just want to make bmic as good as possible. ",
