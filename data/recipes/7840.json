      "text": "This is the first recipe I mixed with Forest Fruit. I've mixed it many times since then, both for myself and others. I've tried it with Forrest Fruit at 2%, 3%, 3.5% and 4%; I found 3.5% to be the best concentration for me. Great in wattage, amazing in TC. The only reason i'm not giving 5 stars is I get an distracting off note every once in a while - I think its the marshmallow. Kind of caramellic/burnt sugar.&#xD;\nVery good stuff, thanks for sharing.

      "text": "Not really a fan of this recipe unfortunately. I get a really strong &#xD;\ncinnamon off-note that I think is probably from the Marshmallow. Maybe it's just me that gets this note but it really overpowers the other flavors. I also don't get much berry in this recipe. Could be that my setup isn't ideal but it's a 2x Tricore Clapton in the BTFC.&#xD;\n&#xD;\nEdit: After another week or so of steeping the berry was more pronounced but still kinda hidden behind the cream. The off-note subsided to some degree but I still found it present."

For those wondering this is enough flavor for the forest fruit at 2% I was so surprised how much flavor it has for being such a low % over all. Just start at 2% you will see, I mixed this at Max VG, dual claptons SS on a tsunami if that helps. I highly recommend this juice."
