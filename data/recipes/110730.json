    "description": "Strawberry only, created specifically to  my taste buds.  Pretty much Shake and Vape but does taste better every day since creating.  I will be adjusting as my taste buds demand.  :D  Update:  Since this has become my all day vape and I could drink this stuff it is so good I am going to call it DONE.  I do not want to add any creams etc... as that isn't what I want right now.  I will play with mixing more flavors with Strawberry later.  I am a happy camper that I was able to please my palate so easily!  I use 80 VG\/ 20PG 6ml nic base premixed from LiquidBarn.  Easy peasy!",
