  "description": "Decided to start a fight during Listen To This With Yanchunis when ol CenCalVape said fruit recipes were boring. Tried to coax him into a live mix off but he displayed true cowardice, so I still went with it. My dude DrunkLord aka Jerry aka Barry aka Dairy aka Mary suggested a dragonfruit recipe, so that's what we got here. Something like a dragonfruit/pineapple bubble gum. I'm not going to give crazy notes on this because, well, this was a bullshit five minute off the top mix.\r\n\r\nHowever, it's pretty decent if you're looking for a new shake and vape fruit recipe. That Juicy Fruit bubble gum flavour is up front here, but the body of the mix has some nice tropical and pineapple notes, and that strawberry candy sweetness comes in on the back end.\r\n\r\nIt's been a minute since I've enjoyed a simple fruit mix, so I'm happy. Give it a mix and keep fucking up.",
