    "description": "When we thing energizing we think Red Bull, Monster, V or even Gatorade. I challenged myself to think differently about what fruits are refreshingly energizing?\r\n\r\nI concluded that it's exotic tropical fruits of course. Although you could also just be lazing about on a beach in the south pacific ocean getting a tan, still its super refreshingly energizing.\r\n\r\nA delicate balance of exotic fruits smashed together in a power-packed smoothie that is sure to impress. A tropical taste with bright notes and floral\/fruity undertones. Dragon Fruit tastes something between a kiwi, a pear, and a watermelon, So if you combine that with lychee and the sweet or sour of pomegranate, you have an extremely popular and refreshingly delicious smoothie. The main role of the marshmallow and the whipped cream is to increase volume, without adding any dairy or weight. You could pump up the sweetness with a few drops of ethyl maltol but I don't think it was needed in my case.\r\n\r\nI found that it is best to let this one sit for a few days to allow the texture to build.\r\n\r\nAfter a bit of feedback and trial and error I have reduced the lychee to .75%\r\n\r\n#DIYDOWNUNDERJULYCHALLENGE\r\nhttps:\/\/www.diydownunder.com interested in participating in the challenge then join DIY down under and check it out.",
