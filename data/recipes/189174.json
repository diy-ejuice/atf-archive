  "description": "In the midst of my boredom during my self isolation I wanted a candy vape that somewhat reminded me of Chews candy.  Why?  I have no idea why.  It was just something I was craving so, I created this!  Threw some ingredients together and it came out pretty damn good for the first mix of it.  Give it a shot and see if you enjoy it!",
