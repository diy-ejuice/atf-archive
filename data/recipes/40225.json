  "description": "The INW Grape at 3.5% makes it prominent enough to ride right up front with the Wild Melon. The HS Grape is there to give the INW Grape a slight boost of candy aspect. You can sub the HS Grape with TFA Grape Candy. I didn't want to use the TFA because I wanted to gain more experience with Hangsen. The FLV Candy Roll percentage is perfect but doesn't do much in the way of flavor, its more there for the candy like chalky sweet mouth feel. The CAP Strawberry Taffy is  rather weak so at 4% the Strawberry flavor is just there to take the sharpness away that the Wild Melon gives and the taffy note is useful in helping along the mouth feel of the FLV Candy Roll. CAP Super Sweet gives the vape a nice sweet candy finish on the exhale. ",
