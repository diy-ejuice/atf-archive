  "description": "I have been playing around with a few simple recipes and ended up liking this one quite alot. Inspired by ID10-T 1 2 3 recipes, I made some Icing with a little bit of Cake!\r\n\r\nVery Simple and Tasty Cake with Strawberry Icing! and its an Extra dollop of Gooey Strawberry Icing, Just How I Like it!! I mean, What is a cake without Icing... a dry piece of boring spongy nothing!! that's what it is!! So Icing is King!\r\n\r\nThis little mix explodes with flavor, that sweet sweet Strawberry Flavor and Really pays homage to my Favorite... Strawberry Shisha!\r\n\r\nAdd SS if you like.\r\ngood as a SnV but get much better after a steep\r\n\r\nGive this a Mix If you Love Strawberries!!!",
