  "description": "This is a remix of LEMON TWISTS: PINK PUNCH LEMONADE.\r\n\r\nIt's quite close, and to be honest, I think its a bit better. It's more \"pink\" and isn't nearly as harsh, but still damn sweet. If you've had the original, i'm interested in your thoughts about this remix. \r\n\r\nMade on \"Live Mixing: Pink Punch Lemonade\" \r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGYRvxWUILk",
