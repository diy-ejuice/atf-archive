  "description": "DEAD HOOKER is an attempt to fill a gap in the diy community. For the guys and girls who are just starting out in the world of diy E juice I bring you a ranger of recipes that aim to use as few different brands of flavouring as possible without sacrificing flavour. When I first started mixing I struggled to make any of the highly rated recipes as it would have cost me a fortune to order the flavours I needed from different retailers, all with there own postage costs. I appreciate that this may not be an issue depending on where in the world you live.\r\nI wanted to create a range of classic flavours that you could recognise from there shop brought counterparts, but 100% better.  I hope you enjoy my Dead Hooker range and keep your eyes open for more to come. \r\n\r\nA well balanced classic recipe of ice apple.  A combination of flavour arts Stark and Fuji apple to give a vivid apple flavour. \r\nCap pear to moisten the vape and soften the apple on the exhale. \r\nTPA kiwi giving the apple a sharp inhale. \r\nThe combination of Cap pear and TPA kiwi create an amazing experience. \r\n\r\nMenthol can be substituted for another ice or menthol flavour but adjust the percentage accordingly. \r\n\r\nEnjoy...... \r\n",
