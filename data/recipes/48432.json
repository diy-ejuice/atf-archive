  "description": "Based on the profile of a well known fast food establishments apple 'pie', although it's more of a deep fried sweet apple pocket in reality, the pastry is nothing like a traditional pie and I've tried to achieve that thin doughy fried pocket that it comes with the use of the CAP Churro and FA Zeppola. \r\n\r\nCAPple Pie adds a little summin summin to the fuji and works as the go between the apple and the pie profile. \r\n\r\nTFA Brown Sugar and CAP Cinnamon Danish Swirl are seasoning to a degree, the CDS gives the doughy crust a bit of cakeyness (if that's a word?). The Brown Sugar helps with a slight richer sweetness and goes with the shell and cooked apple.\r\n\r\nFA Fuji & FA Liquid Amber stewed/fried/seasoned sweet apple.\r\n\r\nFeel free to Vape at 600F for blistering authenticity.\r\n\r\nThat's about it.\r\n",
