    "description": "Inspired by Skiddlzninja Bangin bourbon bread definitely have to him  all the credit.\r\n\r\nSo why take a classic recipe and try to make it easy. Truth is I drunkenly ordered 4 ounces of TFA banana nut bread and had to figure out a way to use it.\r\n\r\nIt worked out well this is been in my ADV rotation for a while now and thought I would share.",

            "text": "A nice, simple, banana nut bread vape. It's got the warmth from the bourbon, nutty and breadiness, and a touch of sweet banana. It's obviously not quite as nuanced as Skiddlz' Bangin' Bourbon Bread, but makes for a nice bakery ADV. I think this is an absolutely perfect use of the Monk Fruit, especially since we haven't seen much use from it as of yet. It brings a touch of sweetness to the mix, but I feel its main duty here is to bring forward the Banana flavor that's just kind of hanging out in the background of the TFA Banana Nut Bread with the inherent fruitiness it brings to the mix; without it, the banana would get lost. Kudos on that.  &#xD;\n&#xD;\nThe only criticism I have on this recipe is that with a high % of TFA Banana Nut Bread it can be a little scratchy, especially if your throat is a wimp like mine. Switching from a smooth creamy vape to this can make that very noticeable, but after vaping it for a few minutes I don't find the throat to be irritating. A steep also really helps tame the throat a bit, so if that's a concern, give it a good 3-5 day steep."
