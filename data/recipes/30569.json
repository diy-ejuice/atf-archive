  "description": "I've been stuck in this bourbon phase lately, and so this idea popped into my head.\r\n\r\nSuper simple. Mint-infused, vanilla bourbon with a touch of that simple syrup sweetness.\r\n\r\nThe TFA Kentucky & FA Vanilla Bourbon combo at this ~4:1 ratio yields a smooth, creamy bourbon with a light, creamy feel. FA Spearmint is an awesome mint flavor, and I'm not typically fond of mint vapes, myself. \r\n\r\nAltogether this just works. It's a vibrant, smooth, and light mix. An underlying creaminess prevails. The spearmint/bourbon combo elicits this really awesome sweet, creamy exhale. Especially through a retrohale, it plays well in the nose. The inherent soft cream note has surprised me, I wasn't expecting that. Very pleased, this has become my ADV the past few weeks",

      "text": "I'm gunna have to give you the 5 stars here dude, this is just a good fuckin' vape. Exactly as you described, it's a warm vanilla bourbon that blankets your mouth on the inhale and a beautifully subtle spearmint that lingers on the tip of your tongue on the exhale with a touch of that syrupy sweetness to meld it all together. Smells great in the bottle, tastes even better. I did go a little light on the sweeteners personally. Could do with a hint of lime IMO but this is an easy ADV for me. Thank you for sharing!"
