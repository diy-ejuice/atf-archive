    "description": "     It took about a month just to figure out the ingredients for this recipe. @jbird worked with me for another month helping me create the finished product.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJF biscuit= A great cookie or great for a pie crust or just to hold other bakery notes that fall apart easily.\r\nFlv rich cinnamon= A very great cinnamon, imo the KING. Although it's not right for just anything but when it works it is unbeatable.\r\nTPA butter= Melted butter.\r\nFA almond= A great almond I normally prefer TPA toasted almond for being even more authentic to the profile but most people don't have it anyway.\r\nSC blackberry= A very nice flavor but almost impossible to use, it's a very bland canned blackberries with a floral note.\r\nINW cherries= Very bright also sweet and spicy but again... very tart imo it's the perfect pairing for sc blackberry two complete opposites that play well together.\r\n\r\n\r\n     It was a huge balancing act trying to get the fruits just right and have the mix not taste linear. I really hope everyone picks up these 2 fruits they are very useful esp the cherries . This vape is not dry these are very bright and wet fruits and you can shake and vape this but at around 3-4 days it gets really good. Hope you all enjoy this as much as I do. Thanks again @jbird. Also adding 2 drops of CAP SS is pretty dope.\r\n",

            "text": "The first time I inhaled this juice it was a punch in the face with jf biscuit and almond goodness with a strong slap of cinnamon. As I vaped it more, due to the amount of biscuit in there I got a little bit of vapors tongue from the sheer amount of flavor. The berries started to show up in full force. Unfortunately it doesn't come across as a fresh spiced blackberry compote as I was hoping and I think there are a few reasons for this. The blackberry shows up before the cherries and they don't seem to blend together too well. And the cinnamon even at 0.1 is still a little too strong especially due to the natural spice note inw cherries tends to have. I think the addition of marzipan may have also really helped bind the berries to the crust. I think with a little tweaking this could be a home run and all in all I'm really impressed with dentman's effort at tackling such a difficult profile.  "
