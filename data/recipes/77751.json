  "description": "An Irish potato candy. Coconut flakes and cream cheese rolled into a potato shape, and dusted with cinnamon. It ends up looking like a tiny potato!\r\n\r\nI started doing this for the DIY Mixers Crew Cinnamon Challenge. I wasn't able to complete it in time due to life. I wanted to post this anyway. I wanted to make something kind of out there, that most people wouldn't think to do, so that's where this came in. It's a very simple recipe, not much explanation needed for it.",

      "text": "So, been looking forward to this since I saw it, but forced myself to wait until it was almost St Patty's. Ain't gonna lie, first hit and I was dying, so I checked the settings, and saw you recommended 400 degrees. Dialing back town to that, I quit coughing and burning, and was able to taste.&#xD;\n&#xD;\nOn the inhale, I get the peculiar combination of coconut and cinnamon. It's a delightful combination of sweet and fruity with at spicy earthy sweetness of cinnamon, and a hint of icing towards the end. The exhale is almost pure cream cheese, and this bad boy is rich, to the point I swear to god I have cream cheese on my tongue even after there's nothing left in my lungs. It's an intriguing mixture between sweet and spicy and dairy. Really not sure how to classify this, other than \"YUM\".&#xD;\n&#xD;\nThis one is for fans of dessert, sweet and spicy treats, dairy fans, or looking for something that goes down a treat with coffee. Can't rightly categorize this one (I'm torn between calling it a dessert or breakfast due to all the dairy), but it's very, very good.&#xD;\n&#xD;\nRight tasty treat here! Nicely done."
