    "description": "A warm gooey apple and cranberry turnover filled with some of my favorite Fall flavors.  \r\n\r\nThe Crust:\r\nZeppola & Cinnamon Danish-These work together to make my pastry type crust and bring a little bit of buttery cinnamon to the mix.  \r\n\r\nThe Filling:\r\nI saw apples, pecans and cranberries in the filling, which also happen to be ingredients I like to throw into my oatmeal, so I already knew they went together nicely.  Trader Joe used to carry dried orange cranberries that were amazing and I would cook with them every chance that I got.  The PUR-Cranberry Orange just kind of warms up the mix and adds a nice depth.   I liked the pecan flavor in the PUR-Butter Pecan Praline Ice Cream so I used it to add some creaminess to my filling as well as the nuttiness.  FLV-Maple just works really well with these flavors as does the FA-Liquid Amber to help round out the recipe.  You could sub the CAP-Double Apple for Pur-Country Apple if needed.   The Cap-Super Sweet is optional but it does add a nice hint of sweetness to the mix.\r\n\r\nI let it settle for a few hours before taste testing it and it has not changed drastically with steeping.  I did cut down the original amount of FA-Zeppola because it got a little greasier than I wanted.  I may still tweak it a bit when I have time but overall I am happy with how it turned out.  \r\n\r\n",
