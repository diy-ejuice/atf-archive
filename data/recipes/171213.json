  "description": "A smooth delectable and full flavored chocolate vape that's not to heavy & not to light that is absolutely heavenly! \r\n\r\nBased upon VTA Chocolate Mousse that brings a lovely body to this profile and VTA Desiccated Coconut that not only pleasantly pairs beautifully it also helps with the over all mouthfeel. \r\nThe VTA Vanilla Buttercream frosting assists the smoothness, texture & sweetness here that will get you licking your lips. \r\nThe little bit of VTA Dark Chocolate helps subtly, offering a lovely yet slight contrast to the overall Chocolate. \r\nCapella Choc Fudge Brownie helps to give a lovely density to this over all recipe. \r\nWhile this sounds like it's rich in chocolate & it is, it is also smooth, balanced and a wonderful dessert vape, it's Heaven! \r\n\r\nFYI, no Angels were harmed in the creation of this recipe lol. \r\n\r\nEnjoy! \r\n\r\nBest after a 5 day Steep. \r\n\r\nI enjoy this at 60W on a Single 0.2ohm SST coil on a Recurve RDA. \r\n\r\nI hope you enjoy this just as much as I enjoyed creating this recipe, but let me know what you thought in the comments below.\r\n\r\nSeriously if you like a solid recipe that works give it a go!\r\n\r\nCheers for reading this far, now go and get mixing!\r\n\r\n\"Together, Let's Discover!!!\"\r\n\r\nFacebook - https://www.facebook.com/groups/diydownunder/\r\nDiscord - https://discord.gg/kH4Fqbc\r\nYoutube - https://www.youtube.com/c/diydownunder\r\nWebsite - https://www.diydownunder.com/\r\nInstagram IGTV : @diydownunder",
