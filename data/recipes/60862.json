  "description": "[hashslingingslashur](https://alltheflavors.com/users/hashslingingslashur) suggested adding \"a fruit like strawberry, pineapple, or maybe some lime\" to his delicious [Jango](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/37882) recipe, which is worth a mix on its own but  seems especially well-suited for use as exotic tropical base to build on. I've been playing around with some combinations of Jango and other fruits off and on and this is the first one worth sharing. Sweet, ripe mango with bright, juicy watermelon. ",

But somehow I've vaped through 10ml of this thinking there was FLV Cream in it when there shouldn't be.  I really don't think there's enough golden pineapple in this to send the whole thing wonky, but I'm sure it wasn't the watermelon either.  It's still a good recipe, but to me there was something in it that just seemed a little off."
