  "description": "Sweet purple mango and rich vanilla ice cream come together to take you to paradise. \r\n\r\n#E-Juice Makers \r\n\r\nSince this recipe was discontinued as a one-shot by Chef's Flavours, I've gotten a couple of requests for the recipe. After being told today that someone spent a bunch of money trying to find the same passion fruit flavor that's in there (as you can see, there isn't one), I thought I'd better release the recipe just in case there was any chance of anything like that happening again. The FLV Mango + FA Violet combination is a pairing I've been enamoured of since Kopel released his recipe, Mango Beauregarde. I used it in this with his permission. The vanilla ice cream base is the same one I used for Longing, but with a lot more TFA VBIC to thicken it up against these thinner, juicer ingredients, like FLV Mango. I'm still in love with this profile, but I've been meaning to improve the recipe for some time now and then release the improved version... just haven't gotten around to it. When I do, it's definitely going to have the TFA VBIC replaced with LB's Ice Cream. It might also have a touch of VT Shisha Mango... and who knows what else. We'll see. In the meantime, hope anyone interested enjoys the original recipe. ",

It was a Dave Mango for crying out loud, someone who has blood type Mango.. I had to try it. There was however something about it that gave me an off note and  I should have known it was just the dreaded pepper that I get from the VBIC. I am very grateful for the release of this recipe in so many ways. This is a selfless gift to the community. . Thanks Dave."
