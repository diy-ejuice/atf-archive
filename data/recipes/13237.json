  "name": "Circus Cookie Remix ",
  "description": "This is a remix of the infamous circus cookie e liquid. It was created by 3 mixers including myself Aaron Vause and John N Jill Szollosi so credit has to go to all 3 of us. \r\nMany a long night was spent creating this e liquid and finally after 8 versions between as all we came up with this finished version which all all agreed is very tasty.\r\nHere are some notes.\r\n\r\nFA cookie / cap sugar cookie / FW hazelnut \r\n\r\nThis created the cookie Base for the recipe we decided on cap sugar cookie for the main staple for the cookie but it does tend to hide behind other flavourings so needed some boost to make it shine.  A small amount of fa cookie and FW hazelnut gives the cookie abit more weight and flavour and makes the cookie more enjoyable and noticeable on the exhale. Without the additions the exhale was somewhat lacking the texture of a hearty cookie.\r\n\r\nCap butter cream\r\n\r\nThis adds the butter cream into the cookie and rounds of what otherwise would be a dry biscuit flavour. \r\n\r\nFA meringue / fa marshmallow / Tfa VBIC / fa joy\r\n\r\nThis creates the icing that you find on circus cookies and totally plays an important role in the recipe.  We could of gone with loranns cream cheese icing but it tends to overpower and gives a waxy texture that seems to artificial. Adding meringue boosts the sweetness alongside adding weight to the marshmallow which is the star of the show.  The VBIC combined with the meringue and marshmallow creates a perfect icing that totally works in conjunction with the cookie. FA joy is the magical addition that ties the icing together and creates the sprinkles over the icing.\r\n\r\nINW shisha Strawberry \r\n\r\nThe recipe required a candy Strawberry flavour for the icing and after playing with capella sweet Strawberry it didn't cut the mustard and faded considerably with the other ingredients so after playing around with INW shisha Strawberry again a Strawberry known for its candy aspects we found it a bolder Strawberry that held its own against the other flavours and worked in its favour.\r\n\r\nSo imagine the experience you get that full on bold Strawberry inhale that turns into creamy icing with sprinkles that ignites buttery cookie. Perfect all day vape experience that will want you lusting for more. \r\nEnjoy.. \r\n\r\nAdd sweetener should you wish\r\n\r\n0.5% seems to be the sweet spot.\r\n\r\nSTEEP TIME 5 DAYS",

But without it and I upped the butter cream to 1.5% I definitely get a circus cookie! So great job achieving that! I tried to tackle this profile a few years ago and it's not easy to get that circus cookie flavor to shine. Again anyone that is sensitive to FA Joy I suggest to just leave it out and you'll still get the profile!!"

      "text": "Had this steeping for a couple weeks, and so far the shisha strawberry hasn't mellowed enough to let the cookie through. I think the reason why this doesn't taste like a circus cookie to most people is because the original pink frosted circus animal cookies aren't strawberry flavored. - just vanilla with pink food coloring, same as the white ones. If the strawberry calms down eventually this recipe could turn out great, but it's not going to bring back any childhood memories of stealing cookies from the cookie jar."

(mine took 12 days)... wow. this is delicious, and so balanced! shisha strawberry is perfect here. it really does come across as \"strawberry icing,\" not fruit, and in doing so, avoids juiciness that would overly complicate the butter cookie base. the result is a resonant flavor that isn't arrogant about its complexity. ie, there's a lot going on without seeming like it. clearly the work you guys put in paid off... thank you so much!&#xD;\n&#xD;\nimo if you pick up on that joy off-taste, it's a sign that more steeping is needed. i noticed it too at first and was worried, but now with everything else present, it fits right in."

This could just be me, but i think the joy is throwing it off a little but also making it as interesting as it is.  I know that doesn't make sense, but it kind of tastes like a eating a strawberry frosted cookie with a little piece of a plain dry saltine cracker.  And at first I didn't like that, but now it is whats making me come back to it.  It's a more unique tasting strawberry cookie.  Especially compared to most \"strawberry (anything)\" dessert vapes, which all just taste like slightly tweaked versions of the same strawberry vape we've all had a million times. I recommend it and will be making more"
