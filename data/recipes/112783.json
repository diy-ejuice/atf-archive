I tried it with the ice cream combination used in the recipe, and I recommend doing the same. The mild combination of cream and vanilla adds a perfectly pleasant and mellow background to the always delicious combination of bilberry and blueberry. The notes of graham cracker and cheesecake are quite subtle, and do not overpower the rest of the flavors at all. "
