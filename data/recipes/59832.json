Give it a try and let me know what you think in the reviews!!!!!ðŸ˜ƒðŸ˜œ I just realized I had to put butter pecan pie wonder flavors when I used butter pecan pie real flavors super concentrate because it wasn't available for a selection teach me to put up recipes late at night because I forget to right down what I did. Sorry if anyone mixed it the way its written but I bet its good either way lol.",

I think it might be a little placebo that I prefer HS Banana to any other however you made a great recipe here and props to MlNikon for suggesting it a DIY OR DIE show or chat recently because I wouldn't have ever found it otherwise.  I'm hoping the vanilla comes through more on a 5 day steep as both of my batches are 3 days currently but great recipe!!  Thanks for sharing it with us!"

Anyway I just wanted to let you know I am enjoying the shit out of this. One of my favorite banana vapes to date. I love the touch of rich cinnamon in this. "
