    "description": "Toasted Marshmallow squished onto a Graham Cracker and drizzled with Chocolate. \r\n\r\nWas watching Wayne\u2019s Let\u2019s Mix video the other day and realised I\u2019d never made a S\u2019mores vape. Didn\u2019t have FW GC so I left that out and tweaked his recipe slightly to get as close as possible to my ideal s\u2019more. \r\nIf you want his exact recipe you\u2019ll have to watch the vid as I don\u2019t think it\u2019s on ATF. \r\nAnyways, I kept the FA Cookie, TFA GCC and AP the same as his, banking on it giving me enough Graham without using FW, which it does... just! \r\nFor the Marshmallow I opted for FW instead of FAs because it\u2019s a more authentic artificial\/gooey marshmallow flavour in my opinion. I love FAs but it wasn\u2019t the type of Marshmallow I wanted to taste in this recipe. \r\nI had to add some TFA Toasted Marshmallow to \u2018toast\u2019 the Marshmallow, gives a little diversity to it as well as the obvious toasted notes that I think helps the Cracker out a bit too. \r\nTotally agree with the FW VBIC. Gives a bit more weight to the Marshmallow and very subtle vanilla, without smacking you in the face with it like TFAs. \r\nDropped the FA Meringue half a percent, so it\u2019s an almost imperceptible sugary little accent.\r\nI used the old INW Choc, but JFs would be fine in the same percentage. It\u2019s not enough to scream Chocolate, but it\u2019s there sitting nicely at the back end of the vape doing as it\u2019s told. \r\nSuper Sweet to enhance the perception of chocolate. Adjust to preference. \r\nAnd that\u2019s that! \r\nIt\u2019s still not what I would consider \u2018perfect\u2019, the only thing I think it\u2019s lacking is the Graham Cracker. It\u2019s there, underneath the \u2018Mallows but it could do with a boost. The Marshmallow and Chocolate are spot on in my opinion though.  Benefits from at least an overnight steep, more if you don\u2019t enjoy fresher flavours.\r\nBig thanks to Wayne for the base recipe to tweak from, legend as always! \ud83d\udc4f\r\n",
