    "description": "Praise be to Flavorah. My favorite flavor company. They are great people and they care about the community. They have the BEST tobaccos around, period. So this mix is a shoutout to flavorah!\r\n\r\nI haven't played with Horchata yet, which is surprising, its one of my favorite flavors in general. I went with a \"spicier\" style by adding ginger and lemon grass with it. The cream was added to blend everything more, and give it a slightly deeper mouthfeel as well. Sweeten to taste :) ",
