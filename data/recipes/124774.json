    "description": "This is my representation of the flavors I envision when I look at this photo. The green tea satisfies both the green headdress as well as the asian vibe. The blueberry and pomegranate flavors make up the purple feeling. I used the tried and true holy trinity discovered by edible malfunction on reddit for the deep blueberry taste and the fa pomegranate is bright and tart and just pulls the flavor up. Add sweetener of your choosing if you so desire. ",

It adds a purple hue to the vape without relying on a grape flavor, and that is impressive in its own right. The green tea base is a perfect compliment to TPA Blueberry (extra) and FW Blueberry, and I would love to try this overall profile in an actual beverage. The description states that you can add a sweetener if you'd like, but I don't believe this recipe needs it. "
