  "description": "Who doesn't like a refreshing sorbet? With spring right around the corner and my trip to Florida coming up soon, it was time to make a refreshing vape to bring with me. This is my take on a lime and coconut sorbet.\r\n\r\nI understand many people will not have Vape Train's Sorbet Base, get it if you can. Chefsflavours carries it. It's a magical potion. When you get it, be careful not to get too heavy handed with it, as you will mute the sharper notes. Without this flavor, the recipe is still good, it just doesn't have the sorbet effect.\r\n\r\nFor the lime note, it was a no brainer to use Lime FLV, because it tastes like sweet lime slushy juice. It's a phenomenal flavor that holds its potency as the juice ages. I could have used it as the only lime flavoring, but, I experimented with a few other limes to add. When I tried adding Lime Tahity Distilled FA for some zest, it just filled the lime note out so well. This is optional.\r\n\r\nThe coconut note is not very strong in this recipe, and that's what I was going for. Sweet Coconut FLV is what I decided to use. It's a milky coconut that sits nicely in the recipe, and comes out more after a few days. If you want more coconut, I added Coconut Candy TFA at 0.75% in my different variations while developing this recipe.\r\n\r\nFor the base of the recipe, I chose Frozen Yogurt WF. It's a sweet, creamy and not very tart. This is a great flavor. I experimented using Vanilla Bean Ice Cream by FW and TFA, but decided that the frozen yogurt worked better for my liking.\r\n\r\nTo sweeten it up, I added 0.50% of Super Sweet. This is optional. It's pretty sweet without it.\r\n\r\nAdditional cooling agents are optional. The Sorbet base provides some cooling effect.\r\n\r\nFEEDBACK IS WELCOMED. IF YOU MIX UP MY RECIPE AND REVIEW IT, IN RETURN, I WILL MIX UP A RECIPE OF YOURS AND GIVE YOU AN HONEST REVIEW.\r\n\r\nI tested many different variations and I'm happy to release this.\r\n\r\nThis is a shake and vape, but the flavors pop after 2-3 days. I primarily use the wasp and serpent mini, and usually mix it at 60-70VG. I don't like a hot vape and usually use a resistance around 0.5 \r\nEnjoy!\r\n\r\n\r\n",

      "text": "I stumbled upon this, while looking for ideas to use VT Sorbet Base. The sorbet works great with the lime. Not only adding that cooling effect, but I also get some citrus from it too. The combination of frozen yogurt and coconut does a good job of thickening up the mix. While the coconut is subtle, I do pick it up on the tail end of the exhale. A very refreshing and well-balanced recipe. Definitely going to be making more. Great job!&#xD;\n I did sub out Super Sweet for FW sweetener (personal preference). &#xD;\n "
