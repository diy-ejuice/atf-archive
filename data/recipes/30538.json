    "description": "A creamy apricot drinking yogurt, I've been chasing this flavour since I first started mixing. It's a very artifical apricot with a creamy and sweet yogurt base.  \r\n\r\nFruit base: TFA Apricot, TFA Juicy Peach and TFA Cotton Candy (Circus). I used TFA Juicy Peach to boost the apricot flavour, when used with apricot and cotton candy the harsh edges gets refined and the peach is no longer a throat killer. I wanted to apricot to stay in front of the mix and at 5.5% it stays as a top note. I also chose TFA Cotton Candy Circus to help boost the candy profile. \r\n\r\nYogurt base: CAP Creamy Yogurt, FA Cream Whipped, FA Marshmallow and CAP Super Sweet. I used CAP Creamy Yogurt at 3.5% because I wanted a subtle yogurt base, at this percent it isn't downright offensive when mixed with other creams. I used FA Cream Whipped because I wanted a milky tea base that didn't mute the fruits, at 2% you get a nice milky undertone that pairs well up with CAP Creamy Yogurt. FA Marshmallow is used to fluff up the creams. The reference was sugary sweet, I used CAP Super Sweet because I didn't want the water content or maltol from TFA Sweetener. CAP Super Sweet at 0.5% is perfect to create sugar without making the mix nauseating.",
