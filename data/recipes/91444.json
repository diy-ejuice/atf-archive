  "description": "This was made for a DIY Down under face group mixers challenge which was 2 main flavors and an additive .   if you are interested in joining the monthly challenges you can  find the DIY down under group  here  https://www.facebook.com/groups/diydownunder/  \r\n\r\n  I actually love this type of challenge since it really makes you think about the flavors you pick  and is a very different  style of mixing then layering multiple flavors - liquid barn or capella flavors are ideal for this type of challenge since they are pretty true to their profile across a range of percentages and work well as the main flavor notes in recipes. So this was obviously inspired by  SPRING. \r\n\r\nLB Cherry blossom is a lovely light cherry with some tea notes at 3 %.  If you are looking for a stronger tea flavor then this would benefit from a another black tea . You can increase  the  percentage to 5 - 6 % if you want to  pull the cherry more forward. \r\n\r\n The LB vanilla mint works well here since i wanted a slight menthol/spearmint and vanilla back note.  But must be added at a significantly lower percentage then the recommended 15% \r\n\r\nThe honeysuckle adds the creamy sweet body and floral notes and brings the cherry and vanilla mint together . ",
