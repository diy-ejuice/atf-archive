  "description": "This is something that my mother and grandmother used to make for special occasions - not only weddings but baby showers and birthdays too.  There are a few variants of this recipe - the \"leaded\" one contains pink champagne instead of the traditional 7up.  Some people make this with ginger ale, some add Hawaiian punch, and I have seen it with orange juice and pineapple juice.  This reminds me of being a kid :-)   Its a sweet juice, but it is meant to be.  Enjoy a little blast from my past.  PS - it really DOES need a week to steep.",
