    "description": "This is by far the closest to a clone I've manged to mix to date. The original was my all day vape for many months and helped so many people switch to vaping from smoking. True credit to it's creator... I stumbled upon FA Forrest fruit mix a while ago, as soon as i smelt the bottle i knew i'd found the key.",

I also cut the SS down because I knew I didn't need that much. Mixed this up for a friend who is trying vaping to get off menthols and he thought this was solid flavor. For him, I did add a bit of menthol and some ice and he found the ice intrusive but liked the menthol touch. Either way, this is a solid showcase for Forest Fruit that I've been to scared to take up high and let it feature like it does here. Try this one!"
