    "description": "This isn't quite ready yet, but I think it does taste like a refreshing grapefruit and pink guava juice. I taste a nice sweet pink guava on the inhale, with a bright grapefruit on exhale. The throat hit has a nice burn that isn't overwhelming, and I have been Vaping this OTS and loving it. This is my first mix I can really describe as juicy. I wanted something refreshing and easy to mix for the mixers club's January 2018 \"detox\" submission.",
