  "description": "1 drop Capella Golden Butter per 10ml. If you use Butter and don't let this age for 2-3 weeks, you will have a very buttery custard (which may be okay for some people). Just a heads up, Capella renamed \"Butter\" to \"Golden Butter\" so everything is pretty much the same as before.\r\n\r\nFeel free to sub marshmallow with whatever brand you have. I've made this with cap and tfa before and didn't notice too much of a difference in the overall flavor.\r\n\r\nIf you prefer your custards to be a little less sweet or plan to age this for an extended period of time, just change the Vanilla Custard and French Vanilla Percentages at a 4:1 ratio. (ex. 8% VC & 2% FV or 6% VC & 1.5 FV)",
