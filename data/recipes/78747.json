  "description": "damnit wayne! ive been working on this juice for 2 months, then you had to suggest TFA bananas foster. off to BCV i go, tested and holy freholes batman thats the guy! best christmas ever!\r\n\r\nin the original im SURE they are using TFA bananas foster as “honey” and it should die off quite a bit after a steep becoming a pretty convincing honey flavor. \r\n\r\nthis recipe tastes damn close (tested side by side). i am sure TFA VBIC is in there as i am sensative to its cardboard notes, and that funk that i get seems matched at 4% with the advantage of adding weight, and rounding out the throat hit of bananas foster. it does however seem to be missing some bakery??? towards the top end that adds a toasted (almost burnt) bread quality. i used 2% TFA cheesecake (graham crust) because it seems they are only using TFA and it works pretty well bringing a bit of that sour dairy i was looking for with a prominent cookie and just a hint of coconut that i always swore i tasted in M&H - may just need to be bumped up to 3%. still might need a graham cracker, likely TFA’s, but it could be FW’s, CAP sugar cookie, or even just AP. i will be trying a small percentage of TFA gingerbread cookie in the next week.",
