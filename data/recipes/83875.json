  "description": "Steep time: 3-4 weeks.\r\n\r\nHoly Grail RY4 - The only one I have and the best that I've tried. Caramel and tobacco.\r\n\r\nCAP VCV1 - thickens and deepens HGRY4.\r\n\r\nFA Marshmallow - more thickening, sweetness. I haven't tested this flavor on it's own yet, mostly going by flavor notes for this one. HiC said it's best for \"Caramel or Torrone\" and RY4 is a caramel flavor. She also noted it's good for creams.\r\n\r\nCAP Bavarian Cream - I haven't used this before so this is where i'm not sure if it will turn out the way i want it to. Flavor notes say 'buttery, nutty, bakery, slightly sweet' which is exactly what I wanted. at .75% it should be a mid to background note.\r\n\r\nFA Cookie (Biscotto) - neutral cookie flavor, Acetyl Pyrazine. AP is nutty itself so i figured it might go well with CAP BC to give the recipe more of a baked custard taste.\r\n\r\nprediction:\r\n\r\nhigh - caramel, marshmallow\r\nmid - cookie, slight tobacco\r\nlow - Thick baked custard\r\n\r\nmixed : 1/8/18\r\n\r\nTested: 1/16/18 - It's about where I expected it to be. A thick, creamy - slightly 'dirty' - caramel with custard and the bite of a cookie. Not overly sweet. cookie has a slight harshness to it. It tastes good enough at this point that I can't stop vaping it. a full 30-45 days and this will surely shine.\r\nFA Marshmallow and CAP Bavarian cream worked exactly as I wanted them to.\r\n\r\nTry a lower wattage than you're used to. I usually run around 90 watts with a 0.14Î© dual coil, 55 seems to be much more enjoyable.\r\n\r\nI had over 100 credits so I gave this a pretty border. There's no specific reason for it other than that.\r\n\r\n**Test 2/6** - much, much nicer. slight throat hit. Cookie can be easily picked out. Tobacco isn't as 'dirty' as before. much more caramel and cream. Thick. much better than i expected.\r\n\r\n\r\n2/23 - This is *Fantastic*. If you mix nothing else I've uploaded, Mix this.",
