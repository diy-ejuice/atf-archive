    "description": "**VG: 85%-90%**\r\n**Steep Time: SNV-2 days**\r\n\r\n**DESCRIPTION:**\r\n  \r\nA smooth, thick, sweet instant vanilla pudding mix.\r\n \r\n\r\n*(No. You can't sub anything out. This recipe works because everything is delicately balanced due to it using FLV-only flavors.\r\nMARSHMALLOW VANILLA will be released in a week or two so be patient and keep this recipe bookmarked!)*\r\n  \r\n**NOTES:**\r\n\r\n**FLV White Chocolate** was added at a low percentage to only utilize its' \"buttery\" quality. Any higher, and that powdery essence in FLV WC would have come through. And I didn't want that. I also didn't want any white chocolate flavor...just the buttery nature of the concentrate.(*because* of this buttery quality, you cannot sub this out)\r\n  \r\n\r\n**FLV Marshmallow Vanilla**(an amazing *new* FLV flavor soon to be released) was added for a boost in vanilla & to provide some fuller body that FLV VP is missing. I didn't want an obvious marshmallow flavor here, hence the low percentage.\r\n  \r\n**FLV Sweetness**: 1.25% of this heavenly stuff will NOT gunk your coils. In addition, its *truly* the *best* sweetener out there! This sweetener brings to the table, a perfect pudding-type sweetness that real vanilla pudding possesses. I could actually see bumping this sweetener up another 0.1% if you like your pudding sweeter. You can't sub this out for that coil-gunking crap because FLV Sweetness makes the pudding feel *inherently* sweet--as opposed to just making the whole mix feel *blanketed\/smothered* with sweetener, if that makes any sense.\r\n  \r\n\r\n**FLV Vanilla Pudding(I saved the best flavoring for last)** is an outstanding flavor. It took me quite awhile to figure out how to build off of it. This flavor reminded me of when I first learned my scales on the guitar(so many years ago)..but I had no idea how to build off of that knowledge. Well? Just like the guitar? Practice makes perfect!! Honestly, I've worked with this flavor for months(and...more months) but could never really \"get\" what to do with it. Until Dat P\u00fcd popped into my brain, that is!!\r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n*Please do not use my recipe for personal gain. Please do not post to other websites. Thank you & if you like this please rate it.*",
