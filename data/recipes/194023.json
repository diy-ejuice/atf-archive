  "description": "#####**Description & Setup**\r\nSweet Strawberry and Kiwi mingled into one nice Hard Candy! I made this mix on a whim, and after a few adjustments, I've been in love with it since. \r\n\r\nTested on a Cthulu 1928 MTL RDA / Pasito Pod RBA 15w 6 wraps 2mm 25mg/mL Nicotine\r\n\r\n#####**Notes**\r\n\r\n**FA Kiwi** - I found this to be a wonderful sweet kiwi flavour. It ended up really mixing in well with CAP Sweet Strawberry and made for a delicious mix on its own, but I wanted to take it up a notch.\r\n\r\n**CAP Sweet Strawberry & FLV Alpine Strawberry** - I've found that these two strawberries are AMAZING in pod / MTL devices. Seriously, if you have these flavours and are a Pod / MTL user, give it a try in any type of mix. These two also mixed very well with FA Kiwi, and laid down the foundation for the mix.\r\n\r\n**FW Hard Candy** - This is a pretty weird flavour to work with, and I had to tinker with it a touch to actually get where I wanted it to be. This brings in a hard candy element that tones down a lot of the more natural notes that come in from FLV Alpine Strawberry, and bring an overall sweetness to the mix.\r\n\r\nAs always, make sure to leave a review if you can! It helps me develop more recipes and I love feedback. ",
