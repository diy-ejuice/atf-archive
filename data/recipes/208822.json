    "description": "#####**Description & Setup**\r\nI'm already missing summer, and a mix with green apples takes me back to the days of nice sunshine and the sun not setting at 5PM. This mix really packs a punch, and I could see it even working in your lower end pod systems if need be. \r\n\r\nTested on a Cthulu 1928 MTL RDA \/ Pasito Pod RBA 15w 6 wraps 2mm 25mg\/mL Nicotine\r\n\r\n#####**Notes**\r\n\r\n**CAP Double Apple** - This is the base of the green apple, I find it to be the perfect balance between sweet green apple candy, and a real, delicious, and somewhat tart green apple. I have become very fond of this flavour overtime and it never dissapoints.\r\n\r\n**FM Green Apple** - FM Green Apple brings out the true apple for this mix. It has a really nice tart flavour, and has a juicy mouthfeel along with it. This really helps support the \"skin\" of the apple too. \r\n\r\n**FA Apple Fuji** - Wrapping it all up, I decided to leave it at FA Fuji. FA Fuji is another really good realistic but semi-sweet apple taste. It really rounds out the whole recipe and makes it feel complete. \r\n\r\n**CAP Super Sweet** - This is just to bring a bit more sweetness to the mix, as with most of my mixes its completely optional. \r\n\r\nAs always, make sure to leave a review if you can! It helps me develop more recipes and I love feedback. ",
