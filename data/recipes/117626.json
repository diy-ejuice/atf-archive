  "description": "Like the blue one, but using Sasami flavouring as the main base.\r\n\r\nV2 was very close to the real thing, but with less cooling once steeped, so adding some WS-23 (I'm using a 30% solution, so tweak the percentage of you have a different dilution) in to the mix.\r\n\r\nAlso can't find any of the Boysenberry I was using, so I've switched it to the FLV one. ;)",
