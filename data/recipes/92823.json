  "description": "FLV avocado isn't exactly a realistic avocado, but they did a very good job capturing that fatty thickness you get from an avocado. The reality is an avocado isn't packed with a ton of flavor to begin with. You get more of the actual taste as it lingers rather than when you vape it, but none the less this is the closest to avocado out of the others I've tried. This flavoring is actually fairly strong and can be used lower depending what you're doing, I liked it most in this at 0.75% to stand up to the creams. It needed to separate itself rather than just thicken things up, which you can also use this for lower at around 0.25%.\r\nI initially created this using VTA creamy avocado because I had it first, and while that was also very good, this was more in line with the actual flavor. The VTA offering is also nice and fatty, but I get a heavier nutty banana like note from it. FLV also has a bit of this going on but not as much. I like the VTA offering a lot as a sub, but it's completely different from this even though it's very good in here as well. If that's all you have, throw it in at 1.5% for a really good recipe of it's own.\r\n\r\nThis is a nice rich ice cream base to go along with that fatty avocado. It will need a good 4-5 days for the buttery note in the creams to tone down and let the coconut  come out a bit more.\r\nThe coconut is a nice and sweet layer that lays in here underneath all that thick goodness. I know this is an odd profile, but I can tell you it's very good and I can't get enough of it. \r\nIf you like thick creamy mixes this is right up your alley.",
