    "description": "Well I will start by saying I've never had \"Normal View\" from Grimmgreens signature line but when I heard the description of \"cranberry orange sugar cookie\" I couldn't get the thought out of my mind. I wanted to eat and Vape that profile immediately! Went to order a bottle online and couldn't bring myself to do it so I added a couple flavours to my cart and waited for them to show up.\r\n Building this liquid was a surprising challenge but with a little help I was able to dial in the right percentages and flavours to create what I believe to be a near perfect Vape. \r\n\r\nEnjoy!
