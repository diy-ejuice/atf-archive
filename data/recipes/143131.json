So this is a combination of that, even though I didnt use any chocolate concentrates in this mix, Red Burly has a chocolate note in it. \r\n\r\nSweet and Smokey - this adds the sweetness and smokey vibe to the tobacco \r\nRed Burley - This tobacco is one of my favourites, it has a chocolate note in it that I really love\r\nShisha Vanilla - adds the vanilla note, and a smidge of body with the creaminess it has built into it.

I’ve been looking for an opportunity to use the FLV Sweet and Smokey since I got it- I wasn’t sure what to do with it myself but it works so well in this. The % you used gives just the right amount of smokiness for me, with a little sweetness that compliments the chocolate note of the red burley. The vanilla adds just the right touch of creaminess that rounds out the tobaccos. I’m definitely gonna make more. Thanks for sharing the recipe. "
