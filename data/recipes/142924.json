    "description": "Cardamom rose gingerbread......\r\n\r\nOn VU, we have a DIY challenge going right now.....I was looking for an idea that was unique and interesting. My idea wasn\u2019t chosen, but I was intrigued.....so I mixed it.\r\n\r\nCaps Gingerbread was my first choice, but it needs help in the cake department so I went with JF Yellow Cake......mostly because it happened to be sitting on my desk. JF Bavarian for the creamy, dark sweetness and mouthfeel. FA Rose and Cardamom because it\u2019s the only rose\/cardamom I have.....used em low so they didn\u2019t take over. FA Meringue mostly for the sweetness.\r\n\r\nOff the shake, everything was in your face. 10 days later, all has mellowed quite nicely. Cardamom gingerbread on the inhale, a nice light rose on the exhale. Yum.",
