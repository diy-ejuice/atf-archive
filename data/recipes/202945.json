  "description": "Bread (sweet), Fluffy White Cake, and glazed donut make up my donut base here. Sweet bread and fluffy white cake making the base bakery, and glazed makes it a donut.\r\n\r\nI add some buttercream frosting on top bolstered by some wf vanilla cream extra and flv frosting, and cover it with wf lemon orange rice candy which, to me, tastes/smells a LOT like fruity pebbles, but without any of the berry pebbles. So in comes fruit circles. I used FW here because it has less of a sharp citrus note than tpa, which i am already bringing with wf.\r\n\r\nGive this a week so settle the sharper citrus notes and bring balance to the vanilla, buttercream, and bakery notes\r\n\r\nI will be adding some CAP super sweet into this, probably around .3%, but as always sweeten to your individual tastes!",
