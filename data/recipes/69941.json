  "description": "Quick and simple Banana Nut bread Covered in peanut butter.\r\n\r\nBanana Nut Bread Is the main profile and using a little bit of vanilla cupcake helps to fluff it up\r\nBanana cream accentuates the banana flavor and adding creaminess to the peanut butter\r\nGCC helps to sweeten up the recipe a bit without providing the cookie feeling.\r\nCDS gives it a nice twist from regular banana nut bread  \r\n\r\n",
