  "description": "This was mostly a result\r\nOf me playing with some ooo bubblegum I have a surplus of and trying to make the sweetest pinkest abomination going. Well it’s safe to say it worked but as with anything like this we have room for tweaking and improvement! \r\n\r\nOk let’s start at the gum side. The pink bubble bubble has the scent but I felt it is lacking in depth and mouth feel, so we combine that with vanillin to add more of a “thick” almost waxyness when your vaping it. Finally that tiny amount of cinnamon spice adds the somewhat authenticity for me. You can also use watermelon in a similar way but I feel it would screw with things to much. \r\n\r\nThe actual pink HAD to be strawberry imo and I went with an over the top trio of pinkness letting the FA red touch take the lead, ripe strawberry adding the candy and sweet strawberry bringing the syrup. \r\n\r\nNow the sweetener I personally think is kind of essential here but of course you may leave it out if you like. However this is supposed to be a fucking tooth rotting hyperactivity inducing bubblegum profile minus those things of course. Plus after testing with and without I noticed an interaction with the gum and red touch that doesn’t take place without the sweetener. \r\n\r\nAll feedback welcome ",
