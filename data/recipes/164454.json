    "description": "Simple 1-2-3 banana custard.\r\n\r\nI wanted a simple shake and vape banana custard for when I\u2019m feeling lazy and don\u2019t want to wait on a long steep.\r\n\r\nINW Custard is amazing and doesn\u2019t require a steep, this was an obvious choice.\r\n\r\nVT Banana Custard adds a realistic banana while bolstering the custard base\r\n\r\nTFA Banana Cream was used to bring the custard and banana together. By itself, Banana Cream has a nice banana pudding flavor and it brought the other two flavors together nicely.\r\n\r\nCan definitely be a SNV, but it does get better with a few days steep\r\n\r\nInspired by @EdibleMalfunction\u2019s Custard Now",

The spice-note from the INW Custard, and that more \"natural\" flavor from VT Banana Custard really calms down the candiness of the TFA Banana Cream. &#xD;\n4 days steep yields a much better result than the recommended 3 days imo - It was \"Ok banana-yay\" yesterday, today it is \"Damn bae, I'm Banana-gay\""

It\u2019s definitely creamy, and it\u2019s definitely a banana, but it\u2019s not quite a natural banana. It is at the same time really enjoyable. It\u2019s sort of like you took a ton of those fake banana candies and blended them into a DQ blizzard or equivalent milkshake kind of thing. I don\u2019t really get anything super eggy here, but it is a weighty cream with some very sweet banana candy hanging out as well. All in all it\u2019s enjoyable if not the very most accurate banana recipe I\u2019ve ever tried.    &#xD;\n&#xD;\nI believe the culprit here is the TFA banana cream, which I say having also pushed it fairly high in recipe. I still dig it, and I totally get why the INW custard is here, but I feel like you could probably adjust the recipe to live more on something like the VT banana custard and perhaps SA banana flambe with a more complex custard-y base to really get to a fully authentic banana pudding\/banana custard type recipe. All in all for 3 ingredients meant to steep basically 0 days this accomplishes the job and it is enjoyable. This feels near what I\u2019d expect a commercial banana custard to be, just short on a lot of sweetener. I dig it and I could see throwing it together again in a pinch if I wanted something for a day or two with no steep. For the stated purpose of bananas, heavy custard\/cream and no waiting, it\u2019s very good, but I think a bit of patience and a little more work could really elevate this into an absolute \u201cnana cream\u201d killer."

            "text": "That's an ingenious use of the 1-2-3 format. This is what VT Banana Custard should taste like. For one thing, VT Banana Custard has no custard. Also, it's a nice clean natural banana, but there's no punch to it, it's not bold enough to really carry a banana recipe by itself. This tastes like it fixes both of those problems without introducing any new ones, which is just terrific. That bright banana top note still has an artificial ring to it, but it's not full-on candy, it's like the banana flavoring in banana pudding, plus real bananas, and it's plenty flavorful. Then you have that thick rich custard and full, creamy mouthfeel, but without anything obtrusive getting in the banana's way.  Other than adding some bakery if you wanted some Nilla Wafers with your Nana Custard, I don't think this could be any better."
