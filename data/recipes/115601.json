    "description": "This is hands down the best granola I\u2019ve ever made.\r\n\r\nThe FLV Granola and Crunch Cereals ingredients actually make this granola stand out cause it tastes like granola. Every layer has a different seasoning\/spice\/texture. This mix is awesome. The Cranberry\/Fig flavored granola topped with the thicker texture and tangier flavor from Greek Yogurt. Sweetened with Honey Bee, this granola is so good, I plan on making another batch of it tonight.",

            "text": "Very tasty mix. I love FLV granola, possibly to a fault. It's such a good flavor. The crunch cereal adds a little something to granola to give it a taste and texture. The fig\/cranberry combo is very very good. I enjoy Sweet Fig quite a bit. It's a very noticeable flavor in this to me, but in a good way. I would have to say, if there was one criticism, its not \"yogurt\" enough to me. I didn't get any kind of tang or anything like that from this, the mix just seemed to have a creamy texture, and if that is what you were going for then it was spot on. To me, if you were looking for a slightly tangier yogurt, for me it missed the mark, but still a very good mix. I enjoyed this quite a bit. "
