    "name": "Strawberry Macaron (ID1O-T Ripoff)",
    "description": "After seeing ID1O-T mango macaroon I knew I had to use his awesome macaroon base and throw strawberry in there. Right of the bat with no steep it's pretty damn tasty. But it'll take a few days for the strawberry to calm and let everything else pull through. Thanks ID1O-T for the base. I know I won't be the only one to utilize it! ",

Ive only had Macarons a few times so its hard to compare, but this is a tasty recipe.  The creams really come together after a few days and meld with the strawberries.  Awesome recipe!"
