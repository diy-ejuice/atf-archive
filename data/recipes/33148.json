  "description": "I didn't get the first awesome box so i made something out of the ingredients i had on me and i think it turned out pretty well.\r\nIt might not be something groundbreaking new,but for sure it's tasty as hell.\r\nFor those who don't know the flavors:\r\nJF Strawberry sweet - a sweet,almost syrup like strawberry\r\nTPA Vanilla Swirl - I want vanilla in my Strawberry milk and Vanilla Swirl does a great job in infusing some vanilla notes combined with creaminess\r\nFA Vienna Cream/Meringue - My number one combo for a sweet Milk taste.those 2 together can't be beaten imo\r\nFW Hazelnut - You won't taste Hazelnut but you get a more malty taste from the Milk\r\nJF Biscuit - It adds some body,some thickness and buttery qualities to the whole mix",
