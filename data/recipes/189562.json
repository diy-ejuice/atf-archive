  "description": "Crap! You're late because you got caught up enjoying this sweet and delicious crepe filled with smooth buttercream with apple chunks and crushed almonds, topped with a gooey spiced amaretto sauce. Still have to get to that AA meeting though!\r\n\r\nUpdate:\r\nSo I've had this sitting around awhile and it seems to have gotten a bit harsh even though it was smooth to start with.  I am trying to work out of it's the apple, the cinnamons or just my change in hardware.\r\n\r\nUpdate 2: lowered the fuji, marzipan and crepe. Much smoother now.",
