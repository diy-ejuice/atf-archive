  "description": "Butterscotch Banana Bread with a twist.\r\nFW Butterscotch for candyish butterscotch sweetness. FW Banana Pur√©e & FA Banana is a great banana combo that mixes well with the butterscotch. OOO Cornbread for that bread/cake flavor. The slight corn note layers nice beside the banana.  TPA Acetyl Pyrazine gives it that grittyness and pushes the corn flavor a bit. WF Walnut for a sweet buttery walnut accent that sits in the background. FA Meringue for more sweetness and more mouthfeel. PUR Super Sweet at 0.50% is where I like it, but I like it sweet. Any sweetener may be subbed for PUR. As a lot of my recipes the sweetener may be added at a lower percentage or omitted and it will still be tasty. I understand not everyone has a sweet tooth the size of Texas as I do. It could go off the shake, but I find it a bit harsh and the layers form better the longer it steeps. After a week it is good and after two it is üëçüëç",
