  "description": "A remix Method1's Lemonaids which is a remix of SlashaLO's Satyra.\r\n\r\nThis shit bangs. No subs possible. Best damn ratio of concentrates in the game. Fuck me up, fam.\r\n\r\nATF won't allow me to put the accurate steep day for this one, so please note that this recipe is best at about 5 days BEFORE you mix it. Trust me.",

It's the everlasting gobstopper of the mixing world. One minute it's a strawberry cake, the next minute it's a strawberry cream cake. Very good use of FA Lemon Sicily. This recipe brings a whole new meaning to \"being on 100\" as well as a new meaning to \"all the flavors\", fam. Definitely nothing like it and that's a promise. Great job.."

Just looking at this turned me blind, so I had to vape Satyra to get my site back so I could use Best damn Lemon Aids as nair to shave my legs. I realized my mistake though, I subbed JF and FW Yellow cake %'s, and I think that made the world of difference. Once I did that, I have seen the light."
