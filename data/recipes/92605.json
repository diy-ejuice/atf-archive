    "description": "Imagine a sponge lemon cake glaced with meringue, that's it. Nothing more. \r\nIMO it's damn accurate, and very balanced..\r\n\r\nNotes : \r\n\r\nLemon : FA and CAP make the perfect combo, FA for the tart, CAP for the juiciness.\r\n\r\nMeringue : FA's, as we all know, is the best on the market, Accurate as F###\r\n\r\nCake : For lemon recipes, Nona's was an obvious choice.\r\n\r\nSugar : You can sub FLV by Cap SS at 0.1  , be careful if you add to much sugar (CAP or FLV) you will loose the balance.\r\n\r\nIMPORTANT : This mix absolutly needs 3 weeks of steeping, less than that and you'll have chemical lemon notes and non-existent cake..\r\n",
