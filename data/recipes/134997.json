    "description": "A simple and delicious strawberry cupcake.  It would be better if it was steeped for a month but at 2 weeks it was really tasty.  This would be great to mix up and have ready just in time for Valentine's Day.  I wanted it to be fairly sweet since cupcakes usually are but you can adjust this to your taste.  You can also use your preferred sweetener.",
