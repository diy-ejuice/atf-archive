  "description": "My take on a fluffy pink cotton candy that one may get at a fair or carnival. \r\n\r\nI'm just a newbie in the mixing game and this is my first shared recipe, so be warned lol. But after 3 people tried it and said it was a good vape that fit the profile I was going for I decided to jump off the high board and share it.\r\n\r\nAll critics, comments, and reviews would be greatly appreciated.\r\n\r\nEnjoy",
