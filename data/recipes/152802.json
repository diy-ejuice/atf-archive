Came up with this simple recipe. -I think there's room for improvement in a v2 (possibly just having some flavors increased) but I enjoy it as is.\r\n\r\nHas a butterscotch cookie on the inhale with the tobacco coming out on the exhale. \r\n\r\nI hope all enjoy, and if anyone has ideas for improvement feel free to send me a message!",
