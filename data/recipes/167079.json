      "text": "This is some serious good stuff. I was a little sceptical at first with the 1.5% INW biscuit, as we are so used to this around 0.5%, but I must say that the CAP Vanilla Custard really combats the dryness INW Biscuit usually has. So a very easy and tasty recipe the Developed boys has made here."
