    "description": "https:\/\/youtu.be\/6DmtsAfizFU\r\n\r\n\r\nPROFILE - Vanilla cream with a nutty note. Rose vanilla on the exhale(use 1 drop smooth vanilla per 30)\r\n\r\nINW CUSTARD\/WF TAHITIAN VANILLA CREAM - Makes the cream base\r\n\r\nFLV SMOOTH VANILLA - STRONG FLAVOR. USED HERE AT 1 DROP PER 30ml\r\n\r\nFLV KINAKO SOY - Provides a slight nutty note or a slight darkness and some texture to the cream\r\n\r\nFLV ROSE ESSENCE - This recipe would not be possible without this flavor. All the other roses on the market are way too floral. This concentrate is like smelling a rose not eating it. It\u2019s a light rose scent on the exhale not floral at all IMO",

            "text": "I had some doubts about this one going in, nutty and rose didn\u2019t seem to go together in my mind. But that was silly, how many dishes famously combine rose water and pistachio? So why not the sort of peanut-butter-cereal nuttiness of Kinako Soy? The result is delicious. A rich, creamy, custardy vanilla with prominent dark nutty tone, full flavor and mouthfeel, and just the barest touch of rose behind it that comes out more in the finish. It says the recipe is a work in progress, but it sure seems finished to me. I don\u2019t know that I\u2019d change anything about it, but there\u2019s room to bump up the Rose Essence a bit if you want more of that, I think you could even double and make it live up to its name better without it getting perfumey or anything like that.  &#xD;\n"

            "text": "I have to say    I was not really sure what to expect with this mix,  the combination of rose  and kinako soy  was  so  intriguing .   The kinako soy  definitely does something in this mix   LOL....  and I am not entirely sure what it is  but what I suspect  that it creates a really nice base note for  some of these light top notes. with out taking over  and bridges to the  custard and smooth vanilla.   IN a word this mix is just round and soft and lovely .      It is  like sitting in your favorite chair  with your favorite beverage at the end the of the day.   It is a lovely combination of the vanilla and rose   that has a full mouthfeel,    Do not be afraid of the rose it is    light  and subtle and just works here .   "
