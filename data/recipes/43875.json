It might be too rich and sweet for ADV but over coffee or instead of dessert it's decadently delicious after a two-week steep. The sugary-ness is on point for a creme brulee and if you're the type to always add a little sweetener to your stuff regardless of the recipe, try this one without that: you get sugar lips without it. I get an almost boozy note from it and while that might be considered off for the profile. Update: Had to revise my review after vaping on it for bit. That slight tobacco note that Jerikorayne mentioned starts to gather on the palate over time. I still think this is a very good recipe, but I bet it could be improved by a little less of not only the INW Creme Brulee, but everything. I might mix it again with the flavors cut by 25% across the board and see if it's still as thick, sweet, and rich but without any distracting offness. "
