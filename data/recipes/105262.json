    "description": "Something quick, simple and fruity. Not that complex but still tasty.\r\n\r\nInspired by oriental canned drinks with jelly pieces.\r\n\r\nSweet Lychee and Jelly Candy are the base here and both compliment each other quite well. Although the percentages might seem high, the Jelly helps tone down the floral notes from the lychee.\r\n\r\nBlackcurrant and dragonfruit are added to round out the body and mouth feel. ",
