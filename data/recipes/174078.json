    "description": "Been playing with some cavendish and different tobaccos\/sweeteners to make mixes that have fallen on the range between straight tobacco and something smoother and sweeter. This combination was developed for an mtl rta and never tested outside of that. I imagine DTL would add more nuance which would likely bring out more complex tobacco notes and sweetness so some adjustments could be made depending on your tastes. \r\n\r\nThis comes across as a slightly sweet, dark flavored pipe tobacco with some emphasis on the tobacco and a hint of nuttiness to balance the sweet. \r\n\r\nBaccos: hs ry1 provides the bulk of the bacco as a kind of neutral ciggie type flavor which gets slightly bent towards the more pipe feel with cavendish. At 0.5%, cavendish adds sweet syrupy pipe darkness without any ash or spice notes. Any higher than 0.5 and that part gets more intense and I wouldn\u2019t take it higher than 0.75-1 if you wanted more of that here. \r\n\r\nAdditives: Arabian adds a distinctive nuttiness and body to the baccos. It settles down a bit by day 3 but is fairly prominent nonetheless. m&h provides a boost for the sweet and can be reduced for less sweetness particularly if you add more cavendish. I\u2019d drop by 0.25 for every 0.1 of cavendish added if that\u2019s your game. Smooth vanilla is intense at 0.2 so I use one drop (approximately 0.2) per 30ml because I\u2019m too lazy to make a dilution. It\u2019s a subtle amount here that needs about 3 days to come forward. I\u2019ve found 0.02g\/10ml to be a bold ass vanilla that needs at least several days to settle, 0.02g\/15ml for a strong distinctive vanilla to settle in a few and 0.02g\/30ml for the vanilla to creep in after a few days. As this is mostly snv (3 days) I stick with one drop per 30ml and I like it that way. \r\n\r\nAs always, there\u2019s room to play here. You can sub out hs ry1 for a variety of baccos for different results. Flv Turkish at 1.5 for more spiced notes is my second choice. M&h can probably be subbed for something suitably sweet or even sweet cig at 0.5-1. Vanilla of choice at appropriate amounts. Smooth has some body so I\u2019d probably stay with inw shisha before any others but I can see most any other working if you want some variety.\r\n\r\nThis one is good as is and is mostly balanced out by day 3. If you try it, I hope you enjoy it. If you change it, let me know because I am always tweaking and like how the parts here can be altered to keep it fresh. ",
