Maybe the apple is a bit too high for some, but you can always lower it, if that's the case. I like to add a little Purlium Watermelon to this or MB Big WM to it. But even alone its a good waternelon. Definitely a classic now."

Apple is a terrific base for a lot of fruit mixes. Personally, I'm a fan of INW Two Apples @ ~0.5% to add some color and sweetness, but the CAP Double Apple really fits the bill here. FLV Watermelon is also outstanding on it's own. Kudos to Flavorah!&#xD;\n&#xD;\nThe fact that GrimmGreen likes this so much is just a bonus, much-deserved applause for all of Wayne's hard work in building out this community. (Though, personally, I hope Grimm chokes on it.) Way to go Wayne-O! "

      "text": "Nice recipe, the double apple(which i SFT and noticed the mealy texture) really does provide a nice texture that feels like biting into fresh watermelon. I would however drop the percentage of double apple down to 2-3% as the apple flavor is a bit too forward and distracts from the pure juicy watermelon profile you were going for. I think I will try adding a small percentage of a slightly more candied watermelon too, such as SC Watermelon, or MB Big Watermelon, as this tastes a bit under ripe to me. All in all this is a wonderful recipe that could be absolutely amazing with a small tweak or two. Awesome summer vape especially with 1% of ws-23 added. "

      "text": "Full disclosure: I don't really like watermelon. Then again, I don't really like any melon. Mostly it's the texture. In watermelon's case, I like the flavor, but hate most things with watermelon flavor, because they're too candy-like. Anywho, this one had a lot of strikes going against it going in, but hell with it. Got curious enough to try it, as there's been many a fruit I've previously hated I love to vape, so why not?&#xD;\n&#xD;\nSo, right off the rip and for most of the first day, this stuff tasted just like biting into a watermelon right down to the rind. Even left this light aftertaste of the fruit even after my lungs were clear, which was awesome. By the end of the day, I could parse some of the layers, and it makes for a more even interesting effect. The watermelon is most blatant, as it should be, and that a good thing. I can tell the combination of the apple and dragonfruit making a juicy pulpy combination from a previous eliquid I've mixed, but this works towards authenticity, which is key. The wild melon punches up the melon aspect, but also give the whole thing that earthy green rind that seals the deal. And the super sweet, well, I can't taste it, but it makes perfect sense. One, it's Wayne. Two, have you ever had a sour watermelon, save for the candies? Thought not.&#xD;\n&#xD;\nThis one is for watermelon junkies, those who want summertime anytime, fans of fruits, or anyone looking for a very light in feel but heavy on flavor vape. Seriously, slid this to a pair of friends who don't vape for mostly that reason, but are vaguely interested, and they both dug it.&#xD;\n&#xD;\nComing from someone who doesn't like the fruit: Wayne, you knocked this one straight outta the park. Taking into account this was from a live mix, this one was just flat out inspired. Absolutely killer!"
