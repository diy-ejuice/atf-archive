  "description": "I love a good Peppermint vape during the Winter months...\r\n\r\nThe original version of this recipe became muted and lost its Peppermint flavor after a few weeks. My suspicion was the EM had a lot to do with it, so I set out to make this recipe without any EM and minimal Marshmallow flavoring added\r\n\r\nAs it stands this is a very refreshing, creamy, smooth, Peppermint forward eLiquid recipe that I can easily vape all day\r\n\r\nTPA Peppermint is a much stronger and better tasting Peppermint IMHO - I tried different levels and settled on this as the best, but YMMV\r\nFW Creme De Menthe reinforces and brings longevity to the Peppermint flavor\r\nCAP Simply Vanilla adds a very light vanilla creamy note to the recipe\r\nCAP Vanilla Whipped Cream, FA Meringue, and CAP Sweet Cream produces a very full, creamy, and smooth initial exhale to the vape.\r\nTPA Marshmallow is used for sweetness with little to no Marshmallow flavor\r\n\r\nI found steeping this for 5 days minimum works the best to smooth out the peppermint and raise the cream up",
