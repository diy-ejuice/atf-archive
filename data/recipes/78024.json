  "description": " This is a Toasted Coconut Banana Cream Pie. The Banana is perfect not overbearing.  I normally don’t vape banana because it’s overbearing but in this recipe its not the case.  On the inhale you get the toasted coconut and on the exhale you get the cream pie.  I used Banofee Pie by WF as the body ingredient.  I used Coconut Custard and Coconut cookies to play off each other,  I chose the Coconut Cookies because I felt like it would imitate a crust. The coconut custard adds to the cream factor.  The creme brûlée is the topping here.  ",
