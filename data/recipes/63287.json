  "description": "Spiced tobacco blended with whiskey-soaked oak wood and topped with smoke and ash. \r\n \r\nBlack Jack Tobacco is a nice medium tobacco with hints of liquorice. It's a little lacking in the fullness department, so I used the bold taste of Black for Pipe to boost it up. Clove isn't too strong at 0.5% and it adds a spice friend for the liquorice. \r\n\r\nINW Whisky is a flavor I've really fallen in love with. It's quite strong, so even at 0.75% it is very noticeable. I'm amazed at how Oak Wood seems to have \"soaked\" up the whiskey and created a booze-infused wood taste. \r\n\r\nBlack Fire and DNB add smoke and ash respectively. These two flavors pop up in tobacco recipes for a reason- they're delicious!",
