    "description": "#TheChristmasMix\r\n\r\nThe TEA: VT Jasmine Green Tea makes up the bulk of our tea base. It's got brilliant green notes and subtle Jasmine that are excellent on their own, but since they'll be mixed with some strong competitors I've decided to bulk that base up with a little FA Black Tea to boost the tannic\/tea base and some additional Jasmine from FA to create a strong over all tea base. These 3 together in this combination make an excellent tea base with room for fruit or any other additives.\r\n\r\nThe Melon: FLV Wild Melon is a brilliant melon mix that never dissapoints. The downside to it is that when you take it up to 1-2% it starts to overpower more delicate flavors like our jasmine. So I've left it down at .5% and boosted the sour\/melon notes with FLV Sour Apple. You could likely use FA Fuji here in it's place if you don't have FLV Sour Apple, but I really like the way FLV Sour Apple interacts with FLV Wild Melon. Over all you get a sweet, mixed melon overtone to the tea base.\r\n\r\nSweetener: Sucralose works here if you don't keep Erythritol handy, but the earthy sweetness of Erythritol works incredibly well with tea. It's a fair bit weaker than traditional sucralose, so I've settled at 2% here to keep things nice and sweet.",
