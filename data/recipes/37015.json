    "description": "Simple, dense and flavorful.\r\n\r\nDon't really feel this one needs flavor notes since everything pretty much speaks for itself as far as where each thing fits in to place. I think this one with a little tweaking could turn into an amazing key lime pie. Some day I'll get around to it and nail the unicorn flavor that got me started on diy to begin with. Until then enjoy!",
