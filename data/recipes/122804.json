It's vibrant and sparkly and doesn't carry a perfumey aftertaste and throat sting that FE Green Tea seemed to. I actually tried using FW Green Tea when I was just starting out, and god that stuff is vile.\r\n\r\nFLV Peach and FLV Peach Gummy form the top note, thanks to some recipe help from \/u\/stuckinrussia.\r\n\r\nCAP Hibiscus was a tremendous improvement over FW Hibiscus. I could barely use more than 2 drops before the entire thing became engulfed in it. CAP Hibiscus comes through without harm and is just awesome.\r\n\r\nI wanted to compliment the darker, bitter floral that Hibiscus was with something bright and sweet, so I went with FA Lavender. After trying it out for the first time, I'm in love. There's so any different applications that I want to put it to, so this is just the beginning.\r\n\r\nWith the florals and the tea and the unavoidable dryness of peach, I had to juice this up as best as I could without diminishing the profile. So, I threw in some FA Fuji, as is tradition, and a little bit of INW Raspberry. To soften them up without becoming too noticeable brings in TFA Dragonfruit. It all just settles as this interesting fruit mesh below the dominant Peach.\r\n\r\nAs delicious as it all was, I felt it needed just a tinge of sweetener, so in comes FW Sweetener.\r\n\r\nThe WS-23 throws off nothing, so a significant improvement over TFA Koolada, and for my first experience with WS-23, it is amazing. Fluffy icyness throughout. 0.5% was a tad too much, so I dialed it down to 0.25% and it's perfect for me.\r\n\r\nFeel free to adjust koolant and sweetener to taste.",

The Fuji helps to plump up the peach notes, the raspberry... this is a brilliant notion. It adds beautifully to the whole mix. The peach gummy adds texture and sweetness and the ws-23 just the right amount of chill to the whole mix.&#xD;\n&#xD;\nThis stuff is fantastic, good anytime,  and utterly brilliant for summer."
