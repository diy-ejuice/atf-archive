  "description": "Nice, creamy Peach Yogurt.\r\n\r\nVape Train Peach Yogurt is the star of the show here. On it's own it's already a pretty solid peach yogurt but I just boosted it a bit.\r\nI usually add some Bavarian Cream & Whipped Cream to my yogurts to make them extra creamy .\r\nI added a bit of Greek Yogurt , because the VT peach yogurt on it's on is very much like a yoplait and I wanted just a bit more yogurt tang. \r\nINW Peach at a half % just to brighten up that peach with some realistic, natural tasting peach. Simulating the little chunks of peach in a yogurt.\r\nAll in all this came out somewhere in between a yoplait, and a full thick Greek Yogurt. ",
