      "text": "I'm tempted to ding this one for not tasting exactly like the picture on several fronts - the orange is more like a real orange or tangerine than Blue Curacao liqueur, there's a bunch of vanilla that doesn't belong, etc - but I can't because it was so, so good. My 50ml is gone and I'm sad and might have to mix up some more.  Orange-vanilla-coconut is a an amazing trio of flavors that I'd definitely like to explore some more, so this recipe is an inspiration.  It's smooth, it's a little rich, and it's just so flavorsome. Good to the last drop. "
