  "description": "I think this is a pretty straight forward profile.  The Aurora and Fizzy Sherbet base give you that limeade start.  Once I added the strawberry trinity I realized it would over power that lime so I added the Florida Key Lime and Tahity cold pressed to even it out.  I get this earthy spice from the Tahity that I love, but I also felt the sweeter florida key lime would help minimize it in the mix.  Overall I'm really enjoying this mix after a full day steep.  On SNV its super floral and you can't really taste the strawberry.  On day 2 the strawberry really pops.  I think FA Kiwi could work really well in here so there may be a V2 coming.",

I personally like this mix better after a 5+ day steep when the lime has calmed down a little bit and the strawberry opens up more, will be mixing again, thanks puck!"
