  "name": "Septet : Strawberry Kiwi & Cream ",
  "description": "This recipe is a sweet strawberry and tart kiwi, blended with a light cream.\r\n\r\nThe strawberry is candyish, juicy, ripe, and syrupy. I used Strawberry Harvest  JF for the main strawberry note. It's a clean candyish strawberry that is similar to Juicy Strawberry FA, but I personally like strawberry harvest more. I boosted the strawberry with Red Touch Strawberry FA.\r\n\r\nThe kiwi note is candyish and slightly tart. I used Kiwi FW for the candy note, and layered Kiwi FA for its tartness.\r\n\r\nI wanted to add some Vanilla since it goes so well with fruits. I decided to use Vanilla Bean Ice Cream by FW, because it's a plain vanilla that does not add alot of weight at this percentage.\r\n\r\nI added Whipped Cream by TFA to blend all the flavors together.\r\n\r\nTo sweeten it up, I added 0.50% of Super Sweet. This is optional. It's pretty sweet without any added sweetener.\r\n\r\n####Feedback is welcomed. If you mix up my recipe and review it, in return, I will mix up a recipe of yours and give you an honest review. \r\n\r\nI tested many different variations of flavors and percentages, and I'm finally happy to release this one\r\n\r\nThis is a shake and vape, but the flavors pop after 2 days. I vape this in various rda's and rta's, and usually mix it at 60-70VG. Enjoy!\r\n\r\n*I initially posted this recipe with Red Touch Strawberry FA @ 2% instead of Strawberry TFA.",
