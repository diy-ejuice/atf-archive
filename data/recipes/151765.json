  "description": "As the title states, STRAWBERRY MILKSHAKE! Lol, however, this is more of a realistic strawberry/old fashioned milkshake. This is about as far away from a McDonald's strawberry as you can get so don't expect that sickly sweet artificial berry/fake ice cream. This is a LONG steep too... I only found this by accident in the bottom of my steep box, lol!\r\n\r\nMilkshake by Molinberry - Fantastic stuff, hard to explain other than it's a milkshake with no flavoring. This and the VBIC make the backbone of the recipe. The length of the steep is due to these two ingredients I'm sure.\r\n\r\n3 Strawberries - Overkill, right? I don't think so... To get that REAL strawberry flav I wanted some of each of these 3. JF Sweet because CAP Sweet was too candy-ish, TPA Strawberry to fill the bulk of the flavor and TPA Ripe to really get that fresh ripe berry taste.\r\n\r\nVienna cream - I usually add this with my tart berries because it really brightens them while adding even more cream. 2% seemed like a lot at the time, however, turns out it was just right.\r\n\r\nBe patient with this one... Time is key. Don't cook it or the berries will go bye bye.",
