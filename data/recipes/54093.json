Nice smooth and full-flavored vape but even at 0.25% the coconut extra is sticking out like a sore thumb for me personally. Just feels a bit odd amongst the rest of the profile, and wondering the reason behind it's inclusion just out of curiosity. I'm sure to others' palettes it's not so strong though. Still, delicious tobacco profile with the hint of honey and bourbon is tasty as fuck. It's not overly sweet by any means but it hits that sweet tooth perfectly and nothing about the vape leaves me wanting something more."
