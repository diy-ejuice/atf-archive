    "description": "This is DMC's final released version of Boba's Bounty. While the first mix was there but not quit what I was looking for. I feel it was missing some sweetness and overall bakery profile from the OG Boba's  In v1.  I still seemed to get to much of the leather from the Arabian tobacco after a few days of steep. It was still in the middle where I wanted it but it was still playing to much of a dominate rule. Dropping it down to .15% seems to do the trick just giving that accent I need but by doing this the raisin profile was there but still needed a lift. Trying different types of bakeries starting with Capellas sugar cookie seemed to get the job done but was lacking the sweetness and raisin.  It works but had limitations maybe even causing some muting or over taking the mix it was okay but I felt we can do better. So off to graham cracker. It was a no go for us. The graham cracker for me at least was not playing nice and seemed to clash and cause overall muting and overtaking the whole profile.  Then Blackmamba reminded me of the oatmeal granola notes that I seem to pick up from the og profile. Milk and honey? for me yes but still seems to fall short. Pushing milk and honey? Well if you have worked with it you know it can be a dominate one that likes to be the star when pushed and that's not what we want. So Tpa oatmeal cookie hmmm... Wait did he say oatmeal. YES! YES! and YES!!! This one was is weird I know!!!  Starting at suggested  1.5% from mamba I knew it was going to be to high but what the hay.. So yeah 1.5% was to high and had to much of the oatmeal profile and was distracting the tobacco notes. It had that sweetness, bakery and tricking your palate into to thinking there is raisin in there while overall boosting the raisin notes from the Arabian.  Now don't get me wrong 1.5% is a pleasant vape but it was boba's oatmeal instead of bounty. Playing with percentages knocking it down to 0.5% balanced it self out tying the whole recipe together giving you a pretty accurate profile of boba\"s. Granted Clones are not 100% dead on but we feel if you are a boba's fan this will sure fill that void. Enjoy!!!!!  https:\/\/youtu.be\/BVmnajUXIso",
