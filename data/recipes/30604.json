    "description": "This is a butter pecan and vanilla bean  milk shake. I get this by using flavor west butter pecan as my butter pecan ice cream part of my mix I do this  at 4% at this amount I feel it doesn't overpower the creams and works well. I use Capella vanilla bean ice cream for none other than my vanilla bean ice cream part of my ingredients and also I find it to work better in shake and vape situations than its counter part. I use vanilla bean ice cream at 2.5% because it works good at tgis percentage. I then use Vienna cream to basically pull all my ingredients together not only does it really help the vanilla bean ice cream become a full bodied ice cream but it does the same thing to the butter pecan flavor it also helps fill out the malted milk flavor. The last of my four flavor's is malted milk by tfa tgis gives the recipe it's milky part of the milk shake I accomplish this  with only 1% of malted milk because first of all I don't use muck milk in my milk shakes and further more this flavor puts off a harsh after taste I feel at a higher percentage. I then used ethyl maltol to sweeten up my creams and help calm down the  Butter pecan without drying it out.",
