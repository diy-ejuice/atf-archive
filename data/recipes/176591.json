  "description": "Just another lemon meringue pie? \r\nNot exactly.\r\n\r\n 7# version and I’ll keep updating.\r\nI used to love dinner lady when buying commercial ejuices... With diy I Found that I prefer more creamy and cookye than fruity and sugary.\r\n\r\nSo if you’re opposite than me, just go back and choose another recipe. \r\n\r\nSo... In here...\r\nBecause of the sugar cookie,  you have more of a fluffy crust than what a 0.75 FA cookie would do “crunchy-wise”. Feel free to choose that. \r\n\r\nI almost left the responsibility of “lemon” in the hands of cap meringue pie as I’m not a great fan of strong fruit vapes, but had to give it a go to the pair lemon Sicily + FE Lemon, witch rounded the profile and was just enough to make sure it does taste like there’s any authentic lemon there.\r\n\r\nEnough with this  shit about process. \r\n\r\nHope you enjoy!\r\nLots of love and flavor <3\r\n",
