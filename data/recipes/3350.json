I used a different Honeydew and Cantaloupe last time, and it was alright, but Wayne is ALWAYS correct when he says the flavors he uses produce a very distinct flavor. This last batch I used exactly what was on here and the flavor was day/night difference. I Love this flavor and will be ordering a larger quantity to maintain my stock. I can vape this ALL day and it never gets old.&#xD;\nThanks for the Recipe."

I love the balance of flavours. I love the texture. I love how refreshing and smooth this stuff is. It's a simple recipe that I keep returning to. It deserves a bit more love on here. "
