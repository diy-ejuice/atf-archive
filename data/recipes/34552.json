At first I thought it was good, but could have been better if it used INW Pineapple instead of that tinny CAP Golden. But after a vaping on it a bit, it grew on me more and more just the way it is. I definitely recommend giving it a decent steep. I'm sure it's fine S&amp;V but that whipped cream gets thicker and sweeter if you give it some time, yum yum yum. "
