    "description": "Just a little something fun for #theyearofmixing pudding pie week! This is a recipe based off of a pudding ice cream pie with a graham cracker crust. The real recipe I based this off from took caramel and poured it in the bottom of the graham cracker crust. Then they layered on top of that vanilla pudding and ice cream with toffee chunks through out. Then the pie is frozen before being served. Now I didn't follow the recipe exactly because I was testing some new flavors out. I figured golden syrup would be a good sub for caramel. I also figured toffee ice cream could take the place of ice cream with toffee chunks through out. It seems to have worked because this is a father enjoyable Vape in my opinion. I have a version steeping with Vape train macadamia nut as well . I have a feeling it's going to be good with the macadamia nut  also. I am leaving this as a work in progress because I want to possibly add a little more graham crust and or golden syrup but it tasted way to good to not put it out around #theyearofmixing week it's made for. Enjoy!!! \r\n\r\nSweetener: I used .25% of Flavorah sweetness but I do not feel that sweetener is a necessary evil on this recipe. Use or don't use your sweetener of choice. At your percentage of choice.\r\n\r\n\r\nSteep time: this is actually quite enjoyable almost immediately but it definitely comes together after a 3 - 5 steep. Lol. I say 3- 5 days because I was loving it on day 3 but it was even better on day 5 lmao.\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude06\ud83d\ude06 so who knows it could be even better after two weeks if it lasts that long!!! Enjoy!! #theyearofmixing",
