  "description": "Creamy marshmallow goodness. It's as simple as that. I wanted a marshmallow vape. I was watching Pineapple Express. Davinci's Brush was born. I honestly don't have any notes for this recipe. It was thrown together pretty quickly, but turned out wonderfully. I'll try and go through my thought process, though.\r\n\r\n\"TFA Marshmallow and FA Marshmallow taste yummy. They're both marshmallows. Fucking Franco. I bet they'll taste like hot air if I don't do something, though. Graham Cracker. That shit's tasty. Just enough to sit under the 'mellows. VBIC. Tasty. It's white, too. Throw that in there. Add some volume to the 'mellows. Bavarian Cream? I guess. Turn it into some kinda cool creamy marshmallow thing? Huh. Okay, then. You are crazy with them names, Ted. You are. \"",

I thought this one looked good and I was in a hurry so I went for it. It's fluffy, sweet and very satisfying. The graham is very subtle and does a great job at adding just a little texture to round everything out. The balance of the marshmallows and cream really play well off each other.  While it didn't work necessarily as a shake n vape due to the off-notes in tpa marshmallow, it doesn't take very long for this one to bloom. I think the 2 day steep time is perfect for this one. I'm thinking of adding some butterscotch to this one and seeing how that goes. Great job"

Makes the whole thing way more interesting, without getting in the way of the primary fluffy marshmallow notes. Seriously impressive work. Thanks for sharing!  "
