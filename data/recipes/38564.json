  "description": "This is a toasted coconut almond milk. So I should have said this when I first posted recipe. There is no coconut specific flavors in this. I get light coconut notes from cheesecake graham crust. So if you don't get these notes than this is more of a toasted almond milk. Enjoy\r\n\r\nCheesecake graham crust:\r\nThis is the coconut flavor with thick cream. \r\n\r\nCream fresh:\r\nThis boost milky aspect of recipe. \r\n\r\nAlmond/marzipan:\r\nThis combo is a sweet almond. \r\n\r\nToasted marshmallow:\r\n\r\nThis adds that toasted taste to coconut and also adds overall sweetness to mix. \r\n\r\nTell me what you all think\r\n\r\n\r\n",

I might experiment with adding a bit of coconut to see what it does, but as it is, it is a very delicate and smooth almond milk that is lightly sweetened. It is very balanced, Almond on the inhale, the marzipan on the exhale, with the toasted marshmallow bringing a slightly robust and darker sweetness and the cheesecake and cream fresh being a solid cream to support it. There is no dairy note, but there isn't in almond milk anyway :). I wouldn't call it thick. But I have issues with tasting thickness anyway, so I can't comment on that. "
