      "text": "From the other 2 reviews, I figured I was safe to make a 30 ml tester on this one, and was correct in my assumption.  As S&amp;V, it is a sweet, candy like blue berry, and stronger candy blueberry on the exhale.  The creams are noticeable, and I can imagine after a few days steep, this will be delightful.  I have not had good luck with FW Sweet Cream and VBIC in the past, favoring TFA / Caps in recipes.  But in this recipe, they seem to work great.  &#xD;\n-Thanks for posting, and thank you for your time in supporting the rest of us."

I have the correct flavors on the way so I can match the exact recipe, but it is VERY good even with those. Can't wait to try with the correct ingredients. Thanks for ALL the work you do on these and the DIY videos."
