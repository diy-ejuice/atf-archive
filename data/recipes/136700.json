  "description": "A voluptuous oral orgasm of ripe bananas smothered in whipped cream and sultry toffee...\r\n\r\nA simple interpretation of a traditional Banoffee without the pie crust element.\r\n\r\nWF Banana Puree is an intriguing mix of ripe and \"runty\" banana, which makes it perfect for this creamy application. It is a vibrant, ripe banana flavour without being too dominant at lower %'s. I noticed slight fading over the 20 day mark but significantly enough to impact negatively on the vape experience. \r\n\r\nCap Vanilla Whipped cream provides an intense, full, whipped cream taste and texture to enrobe the bananas beautifully. The slight hint of vanilla is evident on the exhale and finishes the creaminess dazzlingly.\r\n\r\nFLV Toffee is a phenomenal toffee if treated with (love &) care. At 1% it fulfils its  intended purpose of providing a sweet, thick toffee accent, blending with the sweet whipped cream with ease. I experimented with various caramels but this toffee came out tops and stayed true to its' name...Toffee!\r\n\r\nGive this baby at least 5 days to settle, best after 7.\r\n\r\n",
