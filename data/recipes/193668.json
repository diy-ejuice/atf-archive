  "description": "Btw Inw grapes and grape are the same flavors....my grape journey began as all my other projects begin with 2 flavors that work really well together. This time it was Inw Grapes/JF blueberry which make a banging 2 flavor mix. But still it wasnt a full recipe it needs a supporting cast in the form of american bubble gum, but it still needed something else. Shoutout to Isuamadog and Robot because without their use of cap double apple I dont know if I ever would have finished this. The mix needs an overnight steep as Inw grape needs a minute to calm down a bit. Sweeten to taste.",
