  "name": "Rum Balls v1",
  "description": "This is my first original recipe. I wanted to try my hand at something my family has loved since childhood. It turned out pretty good. The aftertaste is what seals this as a good rum ball. After the exhale you are left with the great flavor of thick dense chocolate cake and rum with just a hint of powdered sugar. That might be able to go up a little more. I'm going to keep working on this, though, so look for updates in the coming weeks. \r\n\r\nI hope someone that loves these little delicacies gives it a shot and leaves some thoughts. \r\n\r\nThanks go to all the great people over on the DIY_Ejuice group over on discord for holding my hand at the beginning of my journey into DIY. You guys are the best.",
