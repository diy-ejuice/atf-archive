  "description": "**θv€Г T|~|€ R@i|\\|Bθ￦**\r\n  \r\n**Description:**\r\n  \r\nA really smooth & creamy Rainbow sherbet-type ice cream perfect for the hotter weather. Nicely balanced & not lemon-strong.\r\n  \r\n**NOTES:**\r\n  \r\n**Ice Cream:**\r\n  \r\nI formed my ice cream using LB Vanilla Ice Cream. On its' own it's delicious although a little linear. It's for this reason I boosted the vanilla part with DFS Menage è Trois & TFA French Vanilla Deluxe. These 2 paired in combination with the LB VIC form the perfect creamy smooth texture of vanilla ice cream I wanted to push forward. TFA FVD is NOT the same as their French Vanilla, French Vanilla II, or French Vanilla Creme. It's quite different and I love it so much that I purchase it in 120mls at a time.\r\n  \r\n**The Rainbow:**\r\n  \r\nAgain, I started with LB Rainbow Sherbet as my foundation for this portion of my mix. And again, very delicious but not quite enough 'umph'. This is why I included a touch of FE Lemon & TFA Raspberry Sweet. Only a little lemon was needed to make the note more noticeable. Raspberry was used at a higher % because it's more of a weak flavor and can easily get lost in a recipe. I find that the FE Lemon also provides a boost in order to bring the raspberry out of hiding. LB RS has a nice light tart/sour note as well that pops after a 3 day steep.\r\n  \r\n**The Enhancers:**\r\n  \r\nI use FA Polar Blast here at a low percentage but if you like your ice cream colder, this can be increased to 0.25-0.5%. Quite honestly, the next time I whip up a batch for my personal use I will raise this percentage to around 0.4%.\r\n  \r\nI use CAP Super Sweet at a low percentage because frankly, ice cream is sweet. You can increase the percentage to 0.5%, but personally I wouldn't go any higher than that due to the sweetness of the other involved concentrates.\r\n  \r\n**Remember: This is Rainbow Ice Cream, not Rainbow Sherbet so you will have a completely different mouth feel than with sherbet. Mix at 70% VG for ice cream thickness. At least a 3 day steep is recommended. I don't recommend any subs(especially CAP or TFA VBICs). LB ice cream has an authentic flavor with no off notes(pepper or plastic)**\r\n\r\n\r\n**Do not take it upon yourself to copy and publish this recipe over to ELR. THIS ACTION IS STRICTLY FORBIDDEN.** \r\nRespect mixers, they are not your ticket to success...They are your friends.\r\n\r\n#EJUICEMAKERS",
