  "description": "A thick vanilla custard with a blanket of zingy lemon :)\r\n\r\nThis recipe was requested and as I‚Äôve been vaping killer custard‚Äôs lemon custard recently I happily obliged.\r\n\r\nLaying down the foundation I start with  Cap custard V1 and FA premium to get that heavy mouthfeel and generic custard taste then FLV vanilla pudding and Cap sugar cookie puts my spin on things to make the base a bit silkier and sweetens things up a bit and they all work together brilliantly.  This base can be used for any other fruit of your choice or can be vaped on its own and is still very satisfying.\r\n\r\nEnter the lemon... I have to start with FA sicily as it is defintely the best lemon in my opinion, I know blah blah it fades blah, it is prone to fading but adding sour lemon in here at 0.75 gives the Sicily another layer and then with VTA sherbet helping them both out you have a really good lemon, I know you looked at the recipe before reading this and thinking to yourself  ‚ÄúWTF, sherbet and custard‚Äù but forget the custard for a minute, Marry all those lemons together appreciate the acidity, appreciate the tartness, appreciate the zingynes... you won‚Äôt have to ignore any ‚Äúevercescent/fizz‚Äù at 1% it‚Äôs not there it‚Äôs just another citrus that‚Äôs in a twisted citric threesome with FA Sicily and VTA sour lemon ;)\r\n\r\nI‚Äôm gonna go right ahead and say this lemon custard is ‚ÄúThe best yet‚Äù......................... In my opinion üòè\r\n\r\nAdd sweetener to suit your tastes, I recommend 0.5% super sweet as it also really helps that lemon and drags it to the end of the vape but to each their own :)\r\n\r\nIf you like what I do and like this recipe then please rate and review.",
