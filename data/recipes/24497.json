    "description": "strong bakery I vape this everyday for last 3 months. 1% Fuji is good reduce ry4 to 3% and cds to 1%-2% and add almond .5%. I vape that half time. or I put fa ry4 in there gives it a cool lemon taste which is different to say the least but works good. Before this recipe sometimes I felt I wasn't satisfied vaping. I didn't want to smoke. Been 2 years since I smoked anything . haha  thanx to sad panda, krisi, and wanye. This is a stolen from three diff mixes. there is so many ways to go with this. I've made 50 diff mixes testing. no meringue, and don't go any higher or lower on vcap or sugar cookie. the almond does something weird with these flavors it bonds to the cds instead of sugar cookie like normal. Just mixed op  adding almond to make sure its sable and good. ",
