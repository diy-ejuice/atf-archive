  "description": "Continuing with our chocolate theme the last few weeks, we wanted to utilize the awesomeness of WF Nanaimo Bar.  If you don't have this flavor and you want to create a chocolate candy bar, pick it up, it's a great flavor to build around.    We wanted to create a caramel filled, crunchy, chocolate covered bar, and after a week or 2 steep, we think this comes pretty damn close.  Full recipe notes at \r\nhttps://youtu.be/rrDOUgfwQq8  .  \r\n\r\nThis is a collaborative creation by DEVELOPED: NaChef, Max Savage, and Folkart.\r\nOur weekly episodes are released at 6:00pm EST every other Tuesday, and catch our live shows every Thursday at 6pm EST.\r\n\r\nCheck out our website at https://www.DevelopedDIY.com - We now have Merch!\r\nFind us on YouTube https://www.youtube.com/c/DevelopedDIY\r\nFollow us on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/developeddiy/\r\nCheck out our FaceBook Page at https://www.facebook.com/developeddiy/\r\n\r\n![Legacy](https://imgur.com/LA0lhIG.png)",
