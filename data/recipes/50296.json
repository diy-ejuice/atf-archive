  "description": "**Don't actually mix Funfetti and Rhodonite with Coconut and Toasted Marshmallow!**\r\n\r\nOr do, it would probably be delicious. But I'm using these two tasty one-shots to stand in for two ingredients that aren't in ATF's database: Sugar Cookie Fluff by Ckemist and If You Like Pi単a Coladas by yours truly, which are now available at ECX's Mixer's Showcase:  http://www.ecigexpress.com/shop/diy-e-liquid/one-shot-concentrates/diy-mixer-s-showcase.html\r\n\r\n**Here's the actual recipe:**\r\n\r\n**ECX Showcase Sugar Cookie Fluff 9.5%**\r\n**ECX Showcase If You Like Pi単a Coladas 3%** \r\n**FA Coconut 1%**\r\n**TFA Toasted Marshmallow 0.75%**\r\n\r\nWhat you get is delicious pi単a colada cookies! Soft, chewy coconut-scented sugar cookies topped with a thick, fluffy frosting that has a hint of pineapple. Om nom nom. Shameless self-promotion never tasted so good. \r\n\r\n*If You Like Pi単a Coladas* is a classic island cocktail with fresh pineapple juice, Jamaican rum, and Coco Lopez coconut cream. \r\n\r\n*Sugar Cookie Fluff* is described as \"sugar cookies layered with sweet cream and a hint of marshmallow fluff.\" I found it delivered on that description and kinda reminded me of a vanilla Moon Pie. \r\n\r\n*FA Coconut* is like coconut flakes here, ups the coconut flavor without making the cookie soggy or weird, and *TFA Toasted Marshmallow* lends a toasty aspect to the coconut flakes while giving the frosting some more sweet, smooth richness.
