    "description": "Graham Crackers, drenched in Sweet Milk!\r\n\r\nUsing (CAP) Graham Cracker at 3% & (TPA) Graham Cracker Clear at 4% creates a crunchy texture with slight hints of Cinnamon.\r\nThe (CAP) Sugar Cookie at 5% fills out the Graham Cracker, while also providing some softness to the center of the Graham Cracker.\r\n(TPA) Dulce De Leche at 2% is just little enough to pull out the Milk, and paired with (FA) Custard Premium at 4% helps boost the Vanilla & Caramel notes both from the (CAP) Graham Cracker & Dulce De Leche, and at the same time helps add sweetness and a nice silky mouthfeel to the Milk.\r\nFeel free to adjust your desired ratio of (CAP) Super Sweet.\r\n\r\nRESULT: Crunchy Graham Crackers, with a sweet Milky finish.\r\n\r\nI can't seem to put this one down. I hope you enjoy this as much as I do!\r\nHAPPY MIXING, & HAPPY VAPING!!! :)",
