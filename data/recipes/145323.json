    "description": "Some credits goes to mlNikon for the inspiration and Humanpuck as we have discussed flavors (he's making his own version - http:\/\/alltheflavors.com\/recipes\/145179)\r\n\r\nThe idea here I got from mlNikon when she once mentioned a croissant with jam she had made (https:\/\/alltheflavors.com\/recipes\/95371#raspberry_jam_and_croissant_by_mlnikon).\r\nI decided, that since I love jam and since I love croissants - why not make one too!\r\nThe choice of the jam was tricky, as I'm generally pretty tired of strawberry and raspberry this and that. I wanted something dark and deep.\r\nSo my obvious choice was blackberry, blackcurrant and boysenberry.\r\nFA blackcurrant as it is potent like hell, so I keep it low and let VT Boysenberry do a little legwork.\r\nIn an attempt to make the \"jam\" a little more... jammy? I have set my heart in FA Maple Syrup. I feel it adds a little texture.\r\n\r\nThe FA Apple Pie has only one job and that is to bring a little crust to the croissants butter goodness.\r\nCAP Graham Cracker is there for a little texture.",
