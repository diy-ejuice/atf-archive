    "description": "*An apple cider pudding pie*\r\n\r\nThis is a flamboyantly autumnal recipe that, being shared in the first week of spring, couldn't possibly be more out-of-season. It's also poached entirely from @ConcreteRiver's delicious [Deer Lodge](https:\/\/alltheflavors.com\/recipes\/90272#deer_lodge_by_concreteriver) recipe, with all of the ingredients being exactly the same, even used at the same concentrations, with just two small additions. \r\n\r\nThis is not meant to imply that there is anything wrong with Deer Lodge, that it's missing or lacking anything at all. But when [FlavorPro](https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/groups\/flavorpro\/) Jennifer Jarvis asked for a pudding pie for the #yearofmixing competition, I knew immediately that I wanted to try to wrap Rick's hopped-up apple cider pudding in a delicate, subtle pie crust. Several attempts with various other crusty ingredients did not work. This one does.\r\n\r\nI don't get any apple or spice (not that either of them would be unwelcome here) out of **FA Apple Pie.** It just tastes like a plain ol' pie crust. And it's the only non-graham pastry crust flavor I could get to work as a main crusty competent here. The others trampled the hell out of that that lovely rich buttery pudding base. A light touch of **FW Pie Crust** provides another layer of bakery, making for a more flaky, less doughy, pie. Its darker sweetness emulates the edges of the crust, where the pie is crunchier and browner. The result? A dessert vape fit for the hunter coming home after a long day on the deer lease. ",
