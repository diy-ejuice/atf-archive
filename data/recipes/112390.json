    "description": "I'm a fan of rice pudding, but I have to lose weight, so I can only vape it. I tried a lot of rice pudding out there, but the rice was too much prominent. So I tried a lot of combination in order to calm down the rice and finally, don't ask me why, I put there the TFA white chocolate. And BOOM. Finally a sweet, smooth, tasty, all-day-vape rice pudding.\r\nYou will find some things strange in this recipe:\r\n- that 4.25% of TFA white chocolate is unusual, it was a mistake in mixing, but it's the perfect percentage, believe me.\r\n- Lemon zest could appear a strange flavor to put in here, but that 0.25 % give a brightness to all the recipe.\r\n- the name it's not only a good word combination, it's the teaser for a lot of rice pudding combination I will recipe in future. In fact you can use this recipe (without cinnamon) as a perfect rice pudding base. Soon I will publish a Rice of a nation - jam, a Rice of a nation - coffee etc etc.\r\nYou can shake & vape or you can wait 2 night in order to taste the perfect combination of flavour.\r\nPlease review it, let me know what do you think about.",
