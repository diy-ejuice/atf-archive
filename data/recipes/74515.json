  "description": "The fruit I enjoyed most in Jamaica was probably the papaya. It has a very unique flavor compared to what we eat Stateside. \r\n\r\nMost notably, it is considerably more “melon-y” and has a buttery mouthfeel, sliding right off the peel, and none of the dank and what some find offputting flavor. \r\n\r\nSo my goal was to emulate that papaya, and I thought pairing TFA Papaya with CAP Cantaloupe would get pretty close and it honestly does. I get no off notes of stank and the dragonfruit really smooths it all together. The coconut is there for shits and gigs, I honestly can’t taste it, just figured it’d add to that tropical smooth vibe.  \r\n\r\nStarted a YouTube series on mixing and stuff. Here’s a video explaining this mix more kinda https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ofi3Ck6oc0&t=17s\r\n\r\n**DISCLAIMER:** This is an SnV, literally just made it and is really tasty. However I make no promises that the dank of TFA Papaya won’t sneak its way out, so if you hate that and consider it an off note, you’ve been warned :)",
