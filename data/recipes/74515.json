    "description": "The fruit I enjoyed most in Jamaica was probably the papaya. It has a very unique flavor compared to what we eat Stateside. \r\n\r\nMost notably, it is considerably more \u201cmelon-y\u201d and has a buttery mouthfeel, sliding right off the peel, and none of the dank and what some find offputting flavor. \r\n\r\nSo my goal was to emulate that papaya, and I thought pairing TFA Papaya with CAP Cantaloupe would get pretty close and it honestly does. I get no off notes of stank and the dragonfruit really smooths it all together. The coconut is there for shits and gigs, I honestly can\u2019t taste it, just figured it\u2019d add to that tropical smooth vibe.  \r\n\r\nStarted a YouTube series on mixing and stuff. Here\u2019s a video explaining this mix more kinda https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=1ofi3Ck6oc0&t=17s\r\n\r\n**DISCLAIMER:** This is an SnV, literally just made it and is really tasty. However I make no promises that the dank of TFA Papaya won\u2019t sneak its way out, so if you hate that and consider it an off note, you\u2019ve been warned :)",
