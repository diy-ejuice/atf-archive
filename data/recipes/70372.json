  "description": "Edit:\r\nLowered the Acetyl P.  It was just a tad higher than what I wanted over time.\r\n\r\nAdjusted the creams.\r\n\r\n-----------------\r\nHey guys!\r\n\r\nWhile on honeymoon in Thailand, my wife and I were lucky enough to have a housemaid that left us (and kept refilling) a jar of coconut caramel toffees. She kept refilling this jar, since I sneakishly kept stocking up the caramels in a bag, obviously to get more of them from her. (She were hansomly repaid, ofc).\r\n\r\nI'm by no means an experienced mixer. Been mixing for about a year now, and these are my thoughts around this mix.\r\n\r\nMy goal were to make these caramels, like butterscotch, gooey caramels that stick to your teeth, just with the touch of creamy sweet coconut milk. Just as I remember the caramels mentioned.\r\n\r\nFA Caramel: The bass to this whole coup. Its by no means the main schaufeur in the mix, but my thoughts were to make it the main layer for everything else to grow on.\r\n\r\nAcetyl P: In there to bring the nuttyness that most caramels have about them.\r\n\r\nWhite Fudge SC: This one gives the FA caramel and the sweet coconut a gentle kiss. \r\n\r\nThe main idea behind the creams and custards were to make a blend that folds together with the caramel. Vienna cream to add a buttery touch to the creams.\r\n\r\nWell thats about it.. English aint my main language, so bare over with my ramblings\r\n\r\nWe are still married, but the caramels are all gone.\r\n\r\nHope you enjoy this one..",
