  "description": "Although I'm sharing this recipe, it was not my idea, but ID10-T's. However, he insisted that it's more my recipe than his and that I should share it. My only contribution was letting him know of a flavour order I made for a bunch of Mango concentrates we were discussing, along with FLV Cranberry and CAP Lemon Lime to try out his 1-2-3 Cranberry Sprite recipe. By doing so, it gave the Mango Man himself an idea - swapping out the FLV Cranberry with FLV Mango, to create 1-2-3 Mango Sprite...and it didn't disappoint. The Mango/Lemon/Lime combo works wonders.\r\n\r\nAnother great example of simple, yet effective! Definitely something that can be tweaked/built upon to make it even more amazing e.g. INW Cactus/FA Pear to add some juiciness and WS-23 and/or Polar Blast because fizzy drinks should be enjoyed cold. Perhaps some sweetener, if desired.",

Set apart from the rest as a guaranteed winner with commercial viability so they can jump right into DIY. This js a great blank canvas. I added super sweet but definitely not necessary. Part of me wants to add FLV Citrus Soda or some MB Red Cherry and WS-23, perhaps. Possibilities.....a great vape with endless customizable options to suit any taste."

I see the other two reviewers added sweetener to it. I may try that, but I'm not sure it even needs it, it's pretty sweet as is. This is really tasty! Thanks!"

For a 30ML I added 2 drops of CAP Super Sweet to make it just a little bit more poppin'. easy simpel delicious recipe. Oh and if Mr. Bellows says it's yours, then it's yours."
