  "description": "Here it is folks. Vape it. Love it. Inhale my juice. This was the recipe I submitted for the inaugural DIYorDIE mixer's competition. Mix it up, let it sit for a few days and let me know what you guys think. If you're one of the unfortunate people that gets a pepper taste from TFA Vanilla Bean Ice Cream, I'm sure you could substitute for CAP's version. However, the TFA VBIC at a low percentage really blends in well with everything else and lends a buttery hand to the Vanilla Custard and Butter Cream. Try my version first then if needed, substitute TFA VBIC for CAP's version.

I subbed out the 1% VBIC for WF Tahitian Vanilla Cream at 0.25% and LB Vanilla Ice Cream at 0.5%, and dropped the FA Fuji to 2.75%.  FA Fuji gets too sharp for me above 3%, and I get disgusting pepper from VBIC.  Holy hell is this a masterful mix though.  Well done, man.  Right off the shake it's a nice, soft, smooth and buttery spiced apple butter!  Can't wait to see what it's like after a week or more!"

I like to fall back on this recipe whenever I get frustrated or bored with my own and other people's recipes. Easy 5 stars right here. In all honesty though, I dropped the Fuji down to 3% for my personal taste as I found it just a bit too strong. Otherwise this is an amazing piece of art. Well done and keep up the great mixing!"

I love the DCS so i may bring that up to 1 and see how that comes out. Great as a SAV but after just a few days its already getting better."
