  "description": "100% credit goes to @alisa on ELR\r\nhttp://e-liquid-recipes.com/recipe/946489/Bust-a-Nut%20v2\r\n\r\nOriginal Notes are:\r\n> Nutty and creamy, very rich. \r\n> My adv. love love love this stuff !!!\r\n> If you want to purchase a pack of flavorings for this recipe:\r\n> http://www.bullcityflavors.com/bust-a-nut-by-alisa\r\n\r\nSolid week steep on this. 14 days if you have the stock and patience.\r\n\r\nVery high percentages, but a lovely recipe and well worth a try if you never have before. Go ahead and leave a review if you mix this.\r\nThis is an adaptation of both her *V1* and  *V2* recipe.\r\n\r\nMy changes:\r\n**TPA Toasted Marshmallow** \r\nUsed for the sweetness of the EM, with the *Toasted* version adding a nice smokiness. *ANY Marshmallow/Cotton Candy/Ethol Maltol* is a perfect sub.\r\n\r\n**TPA Butter**\r\nReally this recipe couldn't get enough DAAP in it, the Butter adds a lovely layer of richness to the creams and saltiness to the nuts. *CAP Golden Butter* is a good sub\r\n\r\nAs an addition, *FLV Peanut Butter at 0.3%* wouldn't go amiss, not has a nice authentic \"nuttiness\" that most of the other nut flavours are missing.",
