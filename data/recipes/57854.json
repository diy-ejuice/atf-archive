Make sure you use the right baked bread concentrate. There is a VG one and a super concentrated version. This is the VG version.",

I'd honestly use this as a concentrate because the bread flavor is overwhelming when used as-is for another mix. I'm considering making a dilution of the VG baked bread at this point. 5/7"

Definitely not for solo use except as a novelty or if you are a complete weirdo, but it tastes like a thick slice of homemade white bread and this wizardry has fully revived what had been a dying effort to create a Goober Grape vape. https://www.reddit.com/r/GooberGrapeVape/"
