    "description": "I've never had Placid by Adirondack, however, I know what the flavour profile is supposed to be. Here's a really simple and quick take on that profile. A strawberry, pear, honeysuckle vape. Please keep in mind that INW Lime is very potent, I typically only use 1-2 drops per 30ml depending on how lime-y I want that particular bottle to be.\r\n\r\nI might add flavour notes later on, but for now, this is really good as is, and everything really blends together after about 3 days. Hope you enjoy, and if you've had Placid before, let me know if I'm even remotely close to whatever that juice is supposed to taste like.",
