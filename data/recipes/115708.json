  "description": "Peaches and cream donut üç©. Absolutely delicious and its delicious without a long steep.  Another great thing about this recipe is that all the flavors used are must haves in my book. Wonder flavours glazed donut isn't a super concentrate like its labeled on atf but it is a super flavor lol. In my opinion its the best donut concentrate on the market not to mention its the only donut that doesn't require a long steep. Shit it doesn't require any steep lol. Next is peach pie and cream again one of if not my favorite peach concentrates thats delicious by itself or in a mix. Last but not least vanilla cream extra. Vanilla cream extra is becoming my favorite and most useful and or used creams. I use it everywhere and in almost everything that i want a vanilla or a cream its absolutely delicious and its very forgiving. You can accent with a lower percentage or you can kick it up a notch and it will work 19 times out of 20.\r\n\r\nSteep time. I think this is at its beat on day 5 of a steep but its almost just as good after an overnight rest.\r\n\r\nSweetener: I used .50% fw sweetener but you can use whatever your preferred sweetener is and at your preferred percentage.  Hey you can even go all natural and use zero sweetener. Your call?",

It's like a mix of peach/cream &amp; creamy frosting and it's delicious! Thanks for this! I agree with your description - these are all 3 must-have flavours and this recipe showcases them wonderfully. Great Work TT :) Thank you for this recipe!"
