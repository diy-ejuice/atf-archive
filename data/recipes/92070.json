    "description": "#*Yep, the 90's are back baby*\r\n\r\nRemember all those great kool-aid flavors growing up as a kid. This is was one that I liked a lot, but haven't thought of until a friend mentioned it. I went out and got a few packs to see if I could get a recipe out of it, and here it is.\r\nThis isn't anything fancy, it's a simple 3 fruit profile but they were made for each other. Once I figured out the actual drink, it was just a matter of finding the right combo of orange and strawberry...then hitting the correct balance.\r\nThe orange sits on top and blends with the strawberry through the vape with a light banana note on the back. It's a nice juicy mix that's full of flavor. Creating a fruit body isn't always an easy task, you can end up with a thin recipe that's all top notes. The banana cream helps solve that by creating a nice base for the others to sit on and the juicy strawberry adding a wonderful dose of moisture that wets your mouth. If you liked this kool-aid, or love a good fruit mix I suggest giving this a shot. It's well balanced and you can taste each layer individually. \r\nYou can S&V this one, but I find a solid 24-48 steep gives the banana time to get in it's role and the orange will tone down a bit.\r\n\r\nEnjoy \ud83d\ude0b",
