  "description": "One drop INW Natural Mint per 10ml-15ml (10 if you a really heavy menthol vaper).\r\n\r\nThis is a mint chocolate chip ice cream recipe I've been working on for a while now. I've tried a lot of mint chocolate flavored recipes, and they all taste like mint, so I've been slaving over this one to get it right. I switched to Hangsen Australian chocolate and Inw Natural Mint and found a balance I like.\r\n\r\n\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nYou are free to\r\nShare — copy and redistribute the material in any medium or format\r\nAdapt — remix, transform, and build upon the material\r\n\r\n(The licensor cannot revoke these freedoms as long as you follow the license terms.)\r\n\r\nUnder the following terms:\r\n\r\nAttribution — You must give appropriate credit, provide a link to the license, and indicate if changes were made.
