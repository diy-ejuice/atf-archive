  "description": "Here is my take on the April 7th episode of Mixin vixens.\r\nIt is a very simple recipe, the ice cream base is my favorite at the moment kudos to @RockyHarlow. The LB vanilla ice cream and TPA Vanilla Swirl combo is a winner. \r\nFor the Orange part I use FW Blood ORange, CAP Sweet tangerine and TPA Orange cream. I try different Orange combo, but this one is the best for this one. We have a bright, sweet and creamy orange with a touch of blood orange.\r\nFor my taste, no need to add some sweetener\r\nFeel free to add 0.25% WS23 for the cold effect.\r\nEnjoy",
