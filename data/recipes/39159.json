  "name": "Mexican Sweet Corn Cake",
  "description": "Profile: A sweet, moist, vape loaded with corn flavor. Mexican Sweet Corn Cake is a traditional side dish served in Mexican restaurants here in Southern California. It has a dryer consistency  than a Corn Pudding with less whole kernel corn and more slightly mushy cake. \r\n\r\nThe Body: CAP Cereal 27 provides the corn base for this recipe. It has the right flavor for the foundation but lacks the proper texture and sweetness. The addition of JF Yellow Cake and INW Biscuit bring out the texture and mouth feel that make this recipe taste like a slightly dry and crumbly corn cake. CAP Vanilla Custard V2 is crucial in this mix as it adds the moisture needed to add a slightly mushy texture without being too eggy like it would with v1.\r\n\r\nSupporting Flavors: The combination of CAP Butter Cream and TFA Sweet Cream add a sweetened condensed milk note that delights the palette. This moves the overall flavor a little closer to a creamed corn.  It is very subtle but present.\r\n\r\nSteep time: It actually tastes great as a Shake N Vape but really comes to life after 2-3 weeks. The depth of flavor and mouth feel are spot on with a full months steep. ",

I really like how the flakey aspect of cereal 27 is not detectable. At least I'm not noticing it. On your quest for a more grainy texture have you tried jf or inw biscuit? Those could also add a buttery aspect that might work with this recipe as well. Great job."
