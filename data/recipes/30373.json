  "name": "Apple fritter",
  "description": "A classic combination - apples, cinnamon in fried pastry form.\r\n\r\nFA zeppola/FA wOw/FA joy- this is your fried doughnut base, some people get a red filling taste from wow but the cinnamon does a good job hiding it, it adds more volume to zeppola. FA joy adds just a bit of a yeast component found in donuts.\r\nFA Fuji/TFA dragon fruit/FA liquid amber- Fuji was an easy choice since I needed a bolder apple to stand up to the cinnamon. I got the idea of adding dragon fruit from returnity on Reddit, it brings out the juicy tartness of the apple and also helps blend the apple and cinnamon. Liquid amber \"softens\" the apples to cooked perfection.\r\nCAP cinnamon danish swirl/FW cinnamon roll- both have a nice cinnamon punch but also have some pastry notes to add overall.\r\nLA cream cheese icing/FA meringue- these combined give the thick icing on top of the fritter.\r\n\r\nGive this a week to come together.",
