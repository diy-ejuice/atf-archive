    "description": "A creamy vanilla milkshake with Fruity Pebbles whizzed in, topped with a dollop of whipped cream. \r\n\r\nTasty enough as a shake-n-vape, but gets much better after a week when the Fruity Flakes calm down and the Hazelnut, VBIC & Vanilla Swirl blossom into more of a malted vanilla milkshake.\r\n\r\nWilly hears ya' about the sugars in FW Fruity Flakes. Willy don't care.\r\nhttps:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=WqfupnpUOoA",

Crepe recipe will definitely make this again. The fruity flakes are definitely The prominent top note and have a very lemon lime flavor to them a good representation of Pebbles cereal. If I had any criticism at all I've always felt like Fruity Pebbles contain blueberry . Think I will add blueberry in next time and see how it comes out. Great job I would give you 10 Stars if Scott would let me\ud83d\ude02"

Definitely good as a shake &amp; vape... Can't wait to see how much better it gets in a couple days\/week... If it lasts that long... Definitely one of the better cereal vapes I've come across! Thanks!"
