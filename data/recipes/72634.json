    "description": "This is my rendition of a cherry\/ lemon-lime type gummy worm with some sweet and sour sensations. \r\n\r\nLB Sour Gummy was used for a candied cherry, some gummy-ness, and a little bit of sour\r\n\r\nFW Rainbow Candy or Skits Candy was used to get a good lemon-lime taste and to get some sugar texture \r\n\r\nCap SL Rainbow Candy is used to bring a fruity  body to the mix and to help other flavors transition \r\n\r\nFA Fuji Apple is used to enhance the top note and maybe add a little sour\r\n\r\nLB Sour is used to enhance the overall sourness \r\n\r\nThis is a great shake and vape but really blends well after 3 days \r\n\r\nThis is already sweet enough for me, but I\u2019f you would like  an even sweeter mix then I\u2019d recommend 0.25% -0.5%  Cap Super Sweet \r\n\r\nEnjoy and please comment and\/or review\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
