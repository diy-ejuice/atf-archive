  "description": "Let's try some Angel Cake...\r\nSupposedly an Angel Cake is virtually fat-free. \r\nWell, F that, I like a bit of butter, hence the 0.25% Inawera Biscuit. ;)\r\n\r\nTasted good as a S&V but give it some time for the recipe to tell it's full tail.\r\nWonderflavor Angel Cake SC at 3.5% is as high as I want to take it. Aside from that, it doesn't really want to play anything more than a supporting role going below. Strawberry Jam with Toast will assist here perfectly.  \r\n\r\nEnjoy,\r\nScrewdriver",
