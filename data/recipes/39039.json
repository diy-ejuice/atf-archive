  "description": "So I know Brie has caught quite a lot of flack lately but, when used properly it can be quite nice. I mixed this cranberry and brie just to prove to myself, and the world that brie cheese has its place and can add quite a bit to a recipe. The muskiness of the brie really showcases the tartness of the cranberry as well as the sweetness from the raspberry. Vanilla shisha was used just to give it a little more creamy vanilla body. ",
