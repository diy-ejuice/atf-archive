  "description": "This has been a tricky profile to nail down due to the cake flavour going under the radar with past attempts, this one finally nails it down.\r\n\r\n*A soft pink and yellow  sponge cake with a light slathering of apricot jam and a coat of marzipan to finish*\r\n\r\nThe cake base comes in the form of WF fluffy white, CAP sugar cookie cake and OOO cornbread, Fluffy white cake and sugar cookie brings all the characteristics of a sponge except the crumb so corn bread just boosts that element slightly making the cake a bit more bolder and visible amongst the other components.\r\n\r\nMB apricot jam is perfect here as it has that jammy feel I’m looking for without using extra concentrates to boost the pectin content.\r\n\r\nFinally the marzipan is built by using FA almond and FA marzipan, using almond aswell as marzipan just helps build layers so the marzipan becomes a bit more “bitey” rather than an almond fondant from using marzipan alone it has a touch of graininess to it representing the sugary feel a bit better.\r\n\r\nSweetener is subjective and if you’re not a fan you can leave it out but I feel it helps the marzipan so bare that in mind.\r\n\r\nIf you make this then please rate and review accordingly, another way to support me is by purchasing some of my one-shots from either of these vendors below :)\r\n\r\nUK: \r\nEPIC!
