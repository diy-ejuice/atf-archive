  "description": "I currently live in the area where Carrot Cake has originated.\r\nSo Carrot Cakes are a thing here, every family has their own recipe. \r\nSome have frosting on it, some not. I like it without frosting which brings out the actual flavors of the carrot and the hazelnut a lot more.\r\nAlthough i am not very happy with the available Carrot Cake flavors on the market, i thought i use two of my favorite ones in a recipe.\r\n\r\nooo Carrot Cake is definitly the one which comes the closest to an actual swiss Carrot Cake, but it fades very quickly and doesn't have that hazelnut note that i am missing in all of the varieties.\r\nI paired it with VT Carrot Cake and ooo Corn Bread and JF Hazelnut to blend all of the respective qualities together.\r\nI added a drop or two of FLV Bourbon and i use up to 0.5 sweetener. \r\n\r\nFreshly mixed it's just a mess as the cakes and corn bread need to calm down.\r\nGive this mix a good steep (1 week) and it will taste a bit more the way i like it.\r\nIt is not a very strong recipe, it is not as strong as some of other cake recipes, but i like it as and all day vape in a lower wattage vape setup.",
