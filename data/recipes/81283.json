      "text": "I like to try and be eloquent when I review these things, but in this case, that would be a disservice. This is a straight up banger of a Dreamsicle. The orange is lush and vibrant, it just pops. It's surrounded by a beautiful vanilla ice cream-like that melds the two perfectly into that frozen treat we all know and love. The fact that it's a combination of vanilla swirl and vienna cream gives this that not quite vanilla ice cream that a real dreamsicle has. Honestly, the only suggestion I could even consider here is possibly adding a cooling agent, and that's down to personal preference. If you're looking for a creamsicle, you've found it.&#xD;\n&#xD;\nThis one's for ice cream lovers, orange heads, and people who need a change from the usual strawberries and cream, but still want your fruit and cream."
