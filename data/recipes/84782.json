    "description": "For the January DMC challenge on Milk...Noted did their Flavor talk on Milk this month so i chose a really simple recipe for all you coconut lovers. enjoy  \r\nI made this this morning so i didn't allow it to steep prior to show due to some other pressing things this past week , but it is pretty darn good off the shake and i forecast it will be even better after a good week of sitting ....\r\n\r\nAfter considering abit o  this recipe and it being mixed by Folkart... I'm am going to follow my initial gut feeling and Folkarts recommendation and delete the FA coco (coconut) he and I both feel it can and will stand on its own without it.... ",

The taste right now is too small compared to the rest and too candied. I might use your base and try it with other coconut starting with FLV coconut (not sweet)."
