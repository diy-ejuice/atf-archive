    "description": "A delectable, thick and creamy pear and ice cream frulata.\r\n\r\nA delicious blended frulata (or ice cream based smoothie) using a (relative) newcomer in the pear category.\r\nMolinberry managed to create something which only 2 other flavor houses have ever managed to do...create a pear flavor which actually tastes like pear! Many have tried, most have failed but a savior is here in the form of Shape up Pear! It is an all-encompassing true, authentic, natural pear: skin, flesh, grittiness and all! \r\n\r\nThis semi-sweet, fresh pear accurately represents the best bits of a ripe pear with ease and, I suspect, will become the natural go-to pear for many a mixer. I bolstered the (delicate) pear note with a touch of FA Pear to make sure it kicks through our frulata base, which can easily dominate less robust flavors. \r\n\r\nThe milkshake base is given a smoothie twist with a dollop of yoghurt to cut through the sweetness by adding a smidgen of tartness, which balances the sweetness of both the pear and milkshake base alike.  The milkshake base, penned by @Freshepies, is simply the very best milkshake base around - thick and creamy vanilla ice cream blended to absolute perfection.\r\n\r\nGive this baby at least 5 days for the creams to meld and enjoy!\r\n\r\nDevelopment notes: https:\/\/youtu.be\/_7hEvaB7LqE\r\n\r\n",

I think I will add a small amount of WS-23 for an icy vape but maybe not because it is wonderful as it. I did sub FLV Greek Yogurt for the FW Yogurt because that is what I have on hand. It seemed to work just fine!"
