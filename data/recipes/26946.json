    "description": "This is my first entry in my first competition, therefore I found it fitting to name it after the first heavy metal song in history... It was supposed to be called \"In the Garden of Eden\" however the lead singer of Iron Butterfly was so messed up, he slurred the words together, thus In A Godda Da Vidda was born.  To me this truly tastes like a blend chosen from the fresh, fantastical, and abundant Garden of Eden.  Heavenly indeed! \r\nThis is a velvety, delicate yet flavorful and exotic fruit blend that could easily be an ADV. This mix is very smooth right out of the gate with no harshness, which is sometimes difficult to do with fruits. Despite the complimentary fusion of these ingredients you can still pick out quite easily all of the flavors and how they add to and refine the entire recipe.\r\n\r\nTFA Papaya - I wanted this entry to be a bit tropical in nature and I really love what the papaya does. It has a deep sweetness that really shines in this mix with a touch of muskiness. I wanted something that was sweet but also balanced with a gentle tart flavor and papaya fills this gap beautifully.\r\n\r\nFA Pomegranate - I just love how this flavor adds an extra bit of juicy tartness to this recipe. It\"s succulent and bright and compliments the fleshy papaya. I chose FA's offering over TFA because it seemed more authentic to me and has a touch of a bitter note that I really wanted to bring out in this mix. I wanted this blend to be multi dimensional and to showcase the complexity of these melded flavors.\r\n\r\nCAP Sweet Tangerine - This sweetens up the mix and adds some delightful citrus. This flavor normally has quite a throat hit, but at this percentage and in this particular mix it is surprisingly polished.  I have added just enough tangerine too to add a mellow but sweet tang to the papaya and pomegranate. The result in my opinion is a sophisticated yet fresh fruit combination.",

Simple and nice recipe, but I had to say that I notice it becomes better with a short steeping, like 3-4 days. For me, it becomes sweeter, less harsh (almost not there), and I can taste pomegranate more now in comparsion to SNV (which was very good). Try it, you won't regret it if you like fruity recipes as me. Thanks for sharing it, keep it up man."

            "text": "Gotta admit, this flavor is weird for me in all the right ways. The pomegranate, papaya, and tangerine are all discernible in their own right, but they blend beautifully into this absolutely tropical storm on the tastebuds. I was describing this to a buddy i slid some to, and the customer standing next to us was going, \"That sounds like an amazing smoothie!\" So, I let out a small cloud (I was on break), and he was all \"I see the appeal now!\" This is indeed a mix that makes me go \"I'm vaping a friggin scented candle without the wax\", and it is a very high compliment.  &#xD;\n&#xD;\nWhat makes this weird for me is that up until now, I've never really liked papaya. It's one of those fruits that makes me go, \"Yup, it's tropical. Where's the rum to get rid of this aftertaste please?\" Not this time. the fact that it can be noted on its own, as well as in the overall melange...sheer brilliance.&#xD;\n&#xD;\nLastly, I'm going to second what @hfatih said. While this is good in a rda\/tank, it friggin shines mtl. Dropped some into my almost empty Icare2, which for all intents and purposes is a closed system, and what comes out (other than a touch of tobacco, cos I didn't change coils) is a brilliant tropical taste that shrieks \"tropical fruit with a bit of sour and sweet\". Anything else I've dropped in there so far that isn't a tobacco or strawberry cream has been meh. And yes, even here, the brain decodes all three flavors, which you shouldn't be able to do in such a device.&#xD;\n&#xD;\nIn short, BANGER. I see this as a total ADV, especially in the summer, or middle of winter when you're longing for summer to come back. For fruit fans, sour fans, people who like tropical drinks, and people who have scented candles in the bathroom for those times when even Calgon can't take you away."

Clean coils for days!&#xD;\n&#xD;\nNow with lung hits, for me, it is tasty for first few puffs, but makes my taste buds insensitive after that. I don't like this on my rda's at all for this reason. The flavor just goes away so easily and you are left with just a sourness.&#xD;\n&#xD;\nWith mtl hits though, this is probably the best fruity mtl juice i've ever tried. Mtl'ers mostly go for tobacco, or heavier,thicker profiles but everyone should try this one imo. I get a ton of flavor in every hit. It is juicy, sweet, smooth. Hit after hit and the flavor just doesn't stop shining. Papaya is always there, pomegranate is always there, tangerine is always there, sourness is always there, sweetness is always there. I don't think my mtl rta's will se any other juice for a long time :)"
