  "description": "Mix made for my dad. The original version had 0.15% INW Marzipan which is nice but overall I prefer it without. Orange also pairs fairly nicely if you keep it low. \r\nIt's not overly \"tobacco\" forward... so even someone that typically does not like tobacco or cigar vapes, may still enjoy this one. It's slightly sweet nutty with the lovely Smooth Vanilla note. ",
