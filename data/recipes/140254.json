  "description": "My thanks to Mark Turner for his help with this recipe.\r\n\r\nAfrican Horned Cucumber is a unique flavor.  It seems rather herbal to me after steeping.  It blends well with the citrus flavors, but is definitely the dominant flavor in this recipe.  The African Horned Cucumber flavor changes dramatically with time.  It starts out very \"orangy,\"  and is very unappealing after steeping about a week, but the second week, this recipe comes to its own.  It really hit the spot for me when I was bored with my typical flavors.\r\n\r\nNote:  After vaping this for a while, I decided it needed more lemon, so it has been added to the original recipe.\r\n\r\nTested on Digiflavor Siren 2 at 1.0 ohm 316 ss \r\nTested later at higher wattage (40), and it had more flavor\r\n\r\n",
