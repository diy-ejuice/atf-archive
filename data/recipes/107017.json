  "description": "Jacker is: Apple, Cereal, and Milk. This is a take on apple jacks cereal but with less apple and cinnamon to be bit more forgiving on the profile.

Enjoy no subs and please leave your review.\r\nIngredients:\r\nCap Apple Snax: Dried Apple and Whole Grain Oat Flour.\r\nCap Cereal 27: Whole Grain Corn Flour.\r\nFa Apple Pie: Ascorbic Acid and Wheat Grain.\r\nFa Stark (Apple): Apple Juice Concentrate.\r\nTpa Meringue/OOO Cream Milky Undertones: Sugar and Milk. (Can sub TPA for FA Meringue @ 1%)\r\nFw Sweetener: Sugar.",
