  "description": "Saw something about a Mango Blackcurrant chutney somewhere, and figured just those 2 fruits would be good together. I know it exists, but I wanted to put a little spin on it. I decided to go with a more natural coconut, not sweeter/creamier coconut to offset how sweet blackcurrant and mango are. This is a simple and low % flavor that tastes great. ",
