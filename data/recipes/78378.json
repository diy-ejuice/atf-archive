  "description": "Back story\r\n\r\nSo a few years ago I was a mixer for a local shop in KC, my one condition to mixing for this shop was that I get to create my own juice line. Aftermath E-Liquids was born. The original flavor was the #1 selling juice in the shop for about a year. The owner and I parted ways about a year and a half ago, but the original recipes are still on the shelf at in stores. So instead of posting the OG recipe I decided to do a remix of it. In my eyes it's about perfect.\r\n\r\nThe flavor\r\n\r\nIt's a apple bread pudding. Thabks to Max Dixon and his recommendation of Baked Bread this recipe is 100% complete and perfect in my eyes. I feel like everything in the recipe is pretty much self explanatory so I'm going to skip actual notes. Just enjoy! \r\n\r\nDoes great after a shake, but even better after 5 days.",
