  "name": "Pecan Tart v2",
  "description": "The butter tart ... the quintessential Canadian dessert! \r\n\r\nMost of these tarts contain raisins, but to that I say NUTZ! A Pecan to be exact. Pecan tarts are my absolute favourite and I could probably live on these if they didn't contain about a million calories each.\r\n\r\nVersion 2, Removed CAP VC1 and replaced w/ INW Custard, Added sweetness with Brown Sugar and added Pie Crust for more texture.\r\n\r\nINW Biscuit / TPA Pie Crust / CAP Sugar Cookie - Make up the flakey goodness that is the outside pastry of the tart.\r\n\r\nFW Butter Pecan / INW Custard / CAP Butter Cream / TPA Brown Sugar - The sweet gooey deliciousness that makes up the inside of the tart\r\n\r\nFA Hazel Grove - Just gives the impression that you are biting into a nut that tops the tart.\r\n\r\nThis recipe benefits greatly with additional Acetyl Pyrazine - I add .5 - .75 which adds additional flakiness to the pastry.",

I have had to make a few changes because of what I had on hand like using CAP Custard instead of INW  Hazelnut instead of Hazel Grove, and I lowered the Butter Pecan from 5 to 3 due to personal taste but this mixture is Amazing...so so good.  Love to all...Kim"
