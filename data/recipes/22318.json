This is definitely a fantastic fruity/cotton candy recipe and I definitely recommend it. Personally I liked it best after a 5-day steep."

I *have*, however, gleefully mixed and vaped along with you since version one, and while V2 was my favorite up until now, I cannot imagine anything more dazzling than this. This is perfection in every way, and unimaginably delicious. I mixed up on 12/28 and cracked it today on 12/30 because I couldn't wait a second longer, and now I cannot put it down. You should be proud as hell of this, and I am incredibly grateful you shared it, because this is one of the best recipes I've ever tasted. Kudos to you, captain!"
