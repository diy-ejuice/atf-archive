  "description": "This is a Pistachio ice cream with caramel swirl. Pistachio is one I enjoy and I love Wayne's Pistachio RY4 so between that and a friend of mine asking if I could do a pistachio ice cream this recipe was born. I hope you enjoy as always any comments or ideas are welcome and like most creams and with the pistachio this recipe will only benefit more from a steep, however I have tried it right after a mix and its pretty tasty, flavor notes are down below.\r\n\r\nPistachio- Its the main profile for this recipe and you cant have pistachio ice cream without pistachio. TFA just does pistachio right in my opinion, you don't necessarily get like a pistachio nut more then you get like a creamy pistachio that just melds so well in mixes.\r\n\r\nCaramels-So for this recipe I didn't just want to throw some pistachios and creams together and call it good and caramel goes almost hand in hand \r\n                      with ice cream and it pairs up so nicely with the pistachio Fa Caramel was used here because its a softer caramel and doesn't give you that \r\n                      sharp candy like note it just blends so well here that it was a obvious choice. FW butterscotch is here because butterscotch and caramel plays\r\n                      so nice together and using one at a lower percent and the other higher they just boost each other up so that's what its doing here its boosting \r\n                      up that caramel and rounding out the edges to refine it.\r\n\r\nIce Cream- so for the ice cream base I went with TFA VBIC and Cap Vanilla Whipped Cream because as nice of a vanilla as TFA is I find it lacking on its \r\n                         own, it just doesn't have that density or thickness by itself that I was looking for and Cap vanilla whipped cream does a great job of helping\r\n                         with that it brings a little more vanilla and richness to the ice cream so that the pistachio can lay in a nice thick bed of cream without either\r\n                         one getting lost but becoming a complete mix instead.\r\n\r\nSweetener- Optional, I know not everyone likes sweetener and that's fine but c'mon its ice cream. The sweetener just helps add more to the ice cream \r\n                          experience, try and tell me if you eat ice cream you don't get sugar lips. \r\n\r\nThere you have it my rendition of Pistachio ice cream. Hope you enjoy, tweak it to your liking, build off of it, just have fun.\r\n",
