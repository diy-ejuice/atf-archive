    "name": "Cuttwood\u2019s Unicorn Milk; Not Remixed",
    "description": "So, you can feel how you want about this, but to my knowledge this is the 100% Unicorn Milk. It started with a friend wanting a \u201cclone\u201d of it, so as most people do, I went and used the recipe of ELR. I\u2019ve read through all the comments on there, blah, blah. I\u2019ve mixed it before, and its good, and fairly accurate to the original, my local shop carries it so I tried side by side. But, just like many pointed out, I found that CAP Butter Cream was not out at the time that this recipe would have come out, so I figured I would try my hand on it. \r\n\r\nI started my search making some assumptions. I assumed that CWS had the percentages correct, and the only thing wrong was butter cream. So then I thought to myself, maybe its a different butter cream? So I went and got the only other one that would be out at the time, FW. I used it, steeped it for a time, and the cream tasted a little closer but something was still off. I know the vanilla custard is in there, I can taste that anywhere, and sweet strawberry is unique and high enough to know that was in it for sure. The only other things it could be was cheesecake, sweet cream, and the graham cracker. I then made the sweet cream switch to tfa and fw, and neither was close to the original, so I kept it. The presence of NYC is very prevalent in a lot of S&C\u2019s so I kept it, its not \u201cnoticeable\u201d that low, but it provides a cream\/dept. The last one was the graham cracker. It wasn\u2019t tfa original, and when I tried tfa graham clear, it didn\u2019t taste like the original as well. I went with FW and I felt that it worked.\r\n\r\nI told my buddy that I felt I had figured out the changes, and he said \u201clets see\u201d and called someone up on the phone there in the shop. He told him he had a friend that thinks he figure out UM and the guy said \u201cIf he reads off the ELR recipe, I\u2019m just going to hang up\u201d. We read this off and all he did was chuckle some, and said \u201cI wouldn\u2019t change a single thing\u201d Apparently he is someone that had left the company a while ago, that knows the recipes. My buddy is someone I\u2019ve known for years, and feel he wouldn\u2019t just randomly call someone up, especially since I just walked in and said I finished it, and without hesitation called the guy. I feel he wouldn\u2019t lie. So at this point, I feel my mix is spot on with the original, and to the best of my knowledge, was confirmed by an old employee. So the CWS was close, but not close enough as far as I\u2019m concerned.  I let my mixes sit a month before ever trying them, so I could compare to bottles that have sat in shops. The custards and creams probably come together at the 2 week mark, but I would say a month to be honest. ",

However, it\u2019s only steeped 17 days and, I didn\u2019t use FW. Subbed that with CAP Golden Butter. So, maybe this isn\u2019t a fair assessment. Really just wanted to say, this is very good, definitely better than \u2018that other\u2019 recipe&#xD;\non ELR. Thank you SlashO. Another of your mixes goes into my regular rotation."

The FW Butter Cream is certainly the right choice here.  All of the familiar notes from Unicorn Milk are there even off of the shake and vape, but the added sweetness from FW pushes this right into the right place.&#xD;\n&#xD;\nWell done Slasha!  It certainly tastes like you've cracked this one wide open."
