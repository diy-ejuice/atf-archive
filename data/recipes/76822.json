  "description": "AKA Folkart's Reserve\r\n\r\nI don't normally buy commercial ejuice. However, I broke down and purchased Cuttwood Boss Reserve to try to clone for Remix Month. I had never tried this eliquid, but as commercial juices go, it's pretty good. Cuttwood describes this profile as: Golden Honey Graham Cracker with Roasted Nut Clusters Drenched in Creamy Milk and Layered with Sliced Bananas. \r\nOn vaping this for the first time, I got Honey, nut clusters, biscuit, slightly milky and banana cream. So this is how I approached it.\r\nFor the Honey and milk I used the obvious, FLV Milk and Honey at 1.5%. This seemed to be predominate top note so I used it at the upper range at 1.5%.\r\nThe nut clusters was tricky. I thought at first to use FA Mixed nuts and maybe TPA Peanut Butter. But the more I vaped Boss Reserve, I became convinced it was just simply AP. Acetyl Pyrazine adds a \"nut cluster\" cereal note to this mix at 1%.\r\nCuttwood says there is a graham note in their juice but I get more of a INW Biscuit but just a touch(.25%).\r\nThe banana note was pretty easy to pick out. TPA Banana Cream at 1.5% was used for this note. Now off the shake, the banana note is stronger than Boss Reserve. Just let it steep for a few days and it settles down to where it needs to be.\r\nThe sweetness level of Boss Reserve is on the upper limits of what I like to vape but not as high as most commercial juices I've tried. CAP Super Sweet at .25% seemed to be spot on for this mix. \r\n\r\nI hope people will mix this to see how close it is to the original. Enjoy :)\r\n\r\nFolkart's Reserve OneShot now available at https://nomnomz.co.uk/\r\n\r\nCan be a shake and vape but is best after a 3 day steep.\r\nVisit Freedom To Mix on Discord https://discord.gg/SmSc8Ef\r\nVisit Freedom To Mix on FaceBook https://www.facebook.com/groups/415341418920740/ \r\nPlease comment, mix, and or rate,....it makes us all better mixers. Enjoy :)",
