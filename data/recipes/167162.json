The CAP VC does a good job keeping it from being dry, and it's a nice balance between the lemon and blueberry.  There's something about it that keeps me from vaping it for days in a row, but it's certainly nice as a change of pace from different profiles.  "

I was a little sceptical at first with the 1.5% INW biscuit, as we are so used to this around 0.5%, but I must say that the CAP Vanilla Custard really combats the dryness INW Biscuit usually has. So a very easy and tasty recipe the Developed boys has made here."
