    "description": "Here\u2019s my take on an ice-cream trinity, Liquid barn VIC is the base as it\u2019s just the best solo ice-cream flavour in my opinion, FA milk gives it the slightly melt in your mouth feeling and then its all ironed out with a touch of FA premium custard. A bunch of naughty DAAP filled concentrates that work a dream together to create an amazing Vanilla ice-cream.\r\n\r\nMake a one-shot concentrate and use between 4-6% with other fruits\/desserts for best results.",

Used this quite a few times now as its becoming abit of a default ice cream for me now"
