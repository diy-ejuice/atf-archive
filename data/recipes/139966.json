  "description": "We spoke about it in this video : https://youtu.be/nDlyaa2zQ0M\r\n\r\nMy initial idea for a Blackcurrant layer was that I could work it into a Energy drink type of Juice, Like our PowerAde we have here.\r\n\r\nI See this Layer working in:\r\n- Booster for Berries in Beverages or Beverages in general\r\n- To add a bit of Juiciness to a dark Candy\r\n- To use in combo with a Citrus profile \r\n- and even in a bakery like blueberry or Blackcurrant Pie\r\n\r\nThis layer serves as a great booster to Juices that need a bit more bang on the berries. \r\ncompliments a recipe with a nice sweet juicy and Fruity layer.\r\n\r\nNotes/Updates:\r\n- I tried this with Blackcurrant at 3.5% and it works well enough, but Felt that it needs a touch more for my Beverage use.\r\n- Could work with some Cream Fresh (low)\r\n\r\nI think this can also work well with @thefogvlog Lemonade Layer\r\n\r\nTHIS IS NOT DONE YET...\r\n",
