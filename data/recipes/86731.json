            "text": "I really like this, especially orange with the inw custard trick. When you use inw custard over 2 percent it tends to thicken anything you vape with it to an absurd point and really mute out some of the weirder or harsher off notes in a vape. The holy vanilla and orange bite turn this almost into a really soft thick orange custard and the creme brulee is right where I like it, nice and low. This comes across as a nice orange vape with a beautiful full body. The orange does lack some juiciness which the FA helps with quite a bit. Overall well done Josh."
