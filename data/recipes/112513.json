  "description": "I've got fond memories of the old style musk sticks i used to get from the corner store growing up. while i found the TPA Musk Candy as a stand alone flavour brought back those memories i felt that it needed a little sweetness and creaminess to round it out. i added the CAP Super Sweet to take some of the tartness out and the CAP Sweet Cream to add a creamy mouth feel to replicate to softness of the old style soft musk sticks.",
