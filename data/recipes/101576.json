  "description": "So this recipe has been in the works for a while. Emily (mlNikon) and I liked  different versions and after letting them steep I have to say she was right and After some minor tweaks we came up with one we agreed on, but staying true to form  I just spaced putting it up on here . Lately a lot of people have been talking more and more about FA Corn and with good reason it's one if those flavors that is so accurate to its source you could sometimes forget it's a concentrate. Combined with the rest of the flavors here this for sure is not one To sleep on and as far as corn puddings go it's gonna be pretty hard to beat. ",

      "text": "This is an awesome recipe. I was expecting it to be more cake-like, but it really sells the corn pudding idea. FA Corn does most of the work here, and the other flavors fill it out perfectly. FW Yellow Cake is at the right percentage for it to be a dessert without turning it into a cake. Vanilla Custard checks the pudding box, and adds a smooth, and creamy richness. INW Shisha Vanilla adds another awesome textural component, and just enough vanilla to be noticeable without distracting from the profile. "
