  "description": "A typical UK tinned custard all thanks to Molinberry legendary custard, while I do like a custard vape I’ve always felt there’s been something missing from custard concentrates and they’ve never really tasted to what I consider a true custard, until now... MB legendary custard opens the door to a true English tinned custard, smelling the concentrate for the first time it smelt too good to be true and then I licked it, POW! ambrosia custard... \r\n\r\nI start with a healthy dose of legendary custard to lay the foundation, backed up with FA premium to get more of that rich custard, the Devon cream adds a touch of milkyness while also keeping the whole mix rich... sugar cookie helps the thick mouthfeel and sweetener because who doesn’t want a sweet custard :)\r\n\r\nI’ve been vaping this for a few days and now I’ve run out, I’ve made some more and hoping to let it steep this time although everything in this recipe is a quick steeper, even the Legendary custard.\r\n\r\nIf you like what I do and this mix then please rate and review :)",
