  "description": "Smooth and buttery Bourbon Custard with toasted almond and sweet coconut notes.\r\n\r\nCould've called it Cotto's Revenge Bourbon Custard Remix as its truely based on all those 2015-16 clones that were running around about that eliquid back in the day. \r\n\r\nIt was a very smooth custard with the same notes i love from castle long, the toasted almond, coconut and  Bourbon.\r\n\r\nIn this recipe i just changed the coconut and tweaked the precenteges to nowadays DIY Mixing needs.\r\n\r\n",
