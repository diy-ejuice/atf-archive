Thank you for sharing!&#xD;\nIm mixing this up right now, going to report back in 4 days.&#xD;\n&#xD;\nEDIT: So im noticing the Raffaelo cream taste, but there is an off flavor that clings to it a bit very early into the inhale, im guessing its the coconut extra, but its definitely  needed in this recipe.&#xD;\nIf i have some time, i will try different coconuts, while lowering the % on coconut extra.&#xD;\n&#xD;\nSo far id rate it a 3\/5 because of the offtaste"
