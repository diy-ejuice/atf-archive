This is the go to cheescake flavor that all other cheesecakes aspire to be and with FW Yogurt it is elevated even further. I have tried this recipe as is and swapped out strawberry for a variety of fruits such as blueberry, banana, and lemon. All with the same level of satisfaction as the last. This is a true \"plug and play\" recipe that just keeps on giving. I can't wait to try adding chocolates to the mix. Great Job!!"
