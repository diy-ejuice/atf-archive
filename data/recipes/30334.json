    "description": "This is my attempt at the profile for the e juice strawberry drizzle it's a popcorn with a strawberry yogurt drizzle. I have never tried the original but I have been vaping this  flavor of mine for 4 months and Iit never gets old I usually make a 120ml  bottle and never make a flavor again but with tgis one I have probably made over 1000ml granted my wife and all my friends love it too but that's jusr what I made for me and my wifeI have made three times that amountfor my friends lol. I would say the flavors are self exsplanitory. It is good as a shake and vape and is probably 100% after 2 days. This is a very tasty mix don't be scared give it a try!!!! $$$$$",

            "text": "I love this idea, but the execution seems to have quite a bit of improvement. The strawberry could be a little less ripe and a little more candied - like the artificial strawberry I would expect from that strawberry yogurt coating, and the popcorn flavor is there but a little buried under the strawberry yogurt. The texture is lacking. Besides changing the strawberry, I\u2019d try backing up the popcorn with a little CAP Cereal 27 or something like that to crunch it up a bit. "
