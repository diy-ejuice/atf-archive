    "description": "Berry Pebbles is a strawberry and blueberry cereal covered in a divine sweet milk. It has a perfect balance between the actual fruits, cereal and milk. It delivers a nice crunchy fruity cereal vape with the perfect amount of milk. Seriously addictive and delicious.\r\n\r\nThis is easily one of the best recipe i have ever created.\r\n\r\nSome people prefer a steep of 2 weeks, i really enjoy this recipe after 7 days. If you don't like it after 1 week let it steep for another week and try again.\r\n\r\nThe base was inspired by Pebbles from NotCharlesManson.\r\n\r\nhttps:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/DIY_eJuice\/comments\/60p8xj\/berry_pebbles_a_blueberry_strawberry_cereal_with\/\r\n",

It doesn't taste awful or anything, it just doesn't seem to taste like anything specific to me, like it's a mish-mash of the flavors above and they just don't really come together to make a recognizable taste."
