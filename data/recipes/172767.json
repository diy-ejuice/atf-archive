    "description": "A thick, rich, sweet, smooth, full bodied mouthfull of lemon meringue cheesecake perfection without the crust, because why have anything but the best part of the cheesecake in the recipe.\r\n\r\nTo be honest I'm not even sure how or why I chose the ingredients I did for this.  I sat in front of my mixing station one day, looked at my flavors and figured these would make what I wanted and they did, and spot on at that.  The only tweaks I made were with the %s on the CAP Lemon Meringue Pie by upping it slightly from the original amount and the same goes for the CAP NY Cheesecake.  And to make a note on the V2 selection.  There is no shortness of body in this recipe, nor are there any strange off notes due to the use of the V2s.  To be completely honest these two V2 purchases were made when I first started mixing and never used until now or anywhere else in my mixing.  They did the trick perfectly here though without a doubt.\r\n\r\nI hope you guys enjoy this one!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
