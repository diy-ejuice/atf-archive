It's VERY strawberry forward and TPA Strawberry gives it that sort of strawberry soda\/candy taste (think strawberry Fanta). I might try a mix with the strawberry toned down or split between Strawberry and Strawberry Ripe. I'll update my review after a couple days steep so I can see if the VBIC comes through a little more. It's there but very faint and just adds more of a thickness to the taste than any cream."
