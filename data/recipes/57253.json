  "name": "Violoats Beauregard (Blueberry Oatmeal Cookie)",
  "description": "This is a pretty decent shake and vape, but the cookie comes out more with a couple days steep. \r\n\r\nIt's a soft chewy oatmeal cookie with a dollap of blueberry jam baked into the middle. Similar to the Archway apple oatmeal cookies you can buy. \r\n\r\nThe FLV blueberry/boysenberry combination makes for a great blueberry jam with some much needed berry \"darkness\". \r\n\r\nThe JF cookie/CAP sugar cookie combo provides that cookie base without taking it too much in that buttery direction. \r\n\r\nTFA toasted marshmallow and oatmeal cookie at these percentages provide the oatmeal/molasses notes. Much higher with the oatmeal cookie and it starts to get funky. It doesn't have a tremendous amount of oatmeal going on in it anyhow.",
