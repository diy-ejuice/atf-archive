    "name": "Thai Fried Banana",
    "description": "Fried bananas are a popular dessert and snack food in Thailand and throughout Southeast Asia. The dish is more often known as goreng pisang in Malaysia, Indonesia, Singapore, and surrounding countries.When I was a Young Marine out on deployments to the orient i would love to stop and indulge in this simple but delicious snack while on liberty in Singapore... Brings back Nostalgic feelings ... I hope you all enjoy this mix as much as i do ... My Inspiration besides the Nostalgia was to bring something different to the community and inspire others to think outside the normal things we mix .....agian enjoy\r\n\r\nVisit DIY MIXERS CREW on Discord https:\/\/discord.gg\/kUJGkHt\r\nVisit DIY MIXERS CREW on FaceBook https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/groups\/456512471380574\/\r\nWatch DIY MIXERS CREW LIVE on YouTube every Sunday at 4:30 pm EST https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/channel\/UC1ENB0bSNrG_1KETYwZ154g\r\nPlease comment, mix, and or rate,....it makes us all better mixers.\r\n\r\n",
