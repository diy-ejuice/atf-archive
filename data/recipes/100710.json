    "name": "Mango and Coconut Bellini",
    "description": "An elegant Bellini infused with fresh mango, pineapple juice and coconut, kissed with a sprig of mint and a squeeze of fresh lime.\r\n\r\nThe inspiration came from a bottle of non-alcoholic bubbly (why bother?) at my local grocer. The challenge was on to recreate this intriguing combination and this is the result...\r\n\r\nTPA Champagne does a good job in providing the base of our Bellini but it lacks the authenticity needed for that that deep, refined, sparkling wine vibe. INW Grape boosts the grapiness of the Champagne and lays the foundation for the drink.\r\n\r\nThe fruit infusion comes with the compliments of the best mango and pineapple around... FLV Mano is revered for its pure mango goodness and combined with CAP Golden pineapple, provide a fantastical fruit melange.\r\n\r\nFA Coco does a superb job in proving that real, creamy coconut milk type flavour without imparting any candy-like notes and sits beautifully I this mix at 1.5%.\r\n\r\nThe Cap Cool mint provides that delicate \u2018real\u2019 mint flavour which, combined with Lime Tahiti CP, provide the finishing touches to our Bellini. \r\n\r\nGive this baby 5 days to fully come together before sipping gently on her...\r\n\r\n\r\n",
