  "description": "Winning Recipe - HEAT 3 of DIYDU vs TFV - Small Pastries - Find the judging at the end of this video : https://youtu.be/4jT7KEObERo\r\n\r\nWARNING!! FLV Rich Cinnamon is a 10% Dilution. WARNING!!\r\nThis is a collaboration recipe from : Liam, Theo, Rudi, Deetz, Daniel, Richard\r\n\r\nHere is a little secret, if a South African ever makes you a Milk Tart - you immediately know that you did something super amazing or special for them. So it would come as no surprise why we are putting this recipe in-front of the judges for the final heat. To thank them for all the effort they put into the judging to make this whole Mix-Off a reality. Thanks guys!\r\n\r\nAs dangerous as a South African might sound behind the oven, when it comes to Milk Tart - it is at the very centre of the South African culture. We know exactly what a Original Milk Tart should taste like, and in this challenge we wanted to showcase this awesome local delicacy - and how team work done correctly, can really pay off in authenticity. \r\n\r\nGood ol' melktert the Afrikaans name for 'milk tart'; the classic, South African dessert consisting of a sweet pastry crust, filled with a mild, creamy custard of milk, flour, sugar and eggs, baked in a round pie tin and dusted with cinnamon after baking.\r\n\r\nThis sweet pastry is omnipresent in South Africa; it appears at every church bazaar, bake sale, home industry, supermarket, or bakery, and has surely featured on every South African food blogger's blog - and even on International Chef Sensation Jamie Oliver's Instagram. \r\n\r\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/sxCACrq29f/?hl=en\r\n\r\n\r\nMilk Tart Casing Layer\r\nConsidering the flavour house limitation in this round - we decided to use FA Cookie + CAP Golden butter to create a soft buttery pastry, that would allow a delicate creamy custard filling to shine without bullying it. \r\n\r\nMilk Tart Filling Layer\r\nThis was not an easy filling to create, we really needed to work together as a team to find the correct balance and ingredients for this filling. FA Custard Premium was unanimously chosen to add the buttery custard notes, without bringing a hard vanilla note. FLV Cream & TFA Dairy Cream were used together to add a bit more depth to the custard, and help sell that thick creamy dairy note that a classic Milk Tart would have. We used FA Meringue for its delicious eggy notes - and used it low, to make this recipe Ultra Realistic. \r\n\r\nCinnamon Dust Layer\r\nWe used FLV Rich Cinnamon in a PG dilution (10%) as our spice note - like any good Milk Tart, its dusted off with a fine cinnamon - just enough to showcase that classic cream & cinnamon pairing. \r\n\r\nThe FLV Rich Cinnamon Dilution\r\n1ml FLV Rich Cinnamon = 1.00g\r\n9ml PG = 9.33g\r\n\r\n",

And just never gets old. Continuously coming back to it. Quickly became my favourite reliable mix. Thanks a million for creating this one."

The  milk tart filling is amazing , I have never used TPA dairy milk  so was not sure what to expect  but that  milky creamy filling is  really just lovely .  The diary milk note is so well done   not overly eggy or custard   forward,, just excellently  balanced  really impressed with that .   For my personal taste  I would like more separation with the pie crust I find it get lost after a 3 week   steep and the creams really come forward.    but that filling  I will totally walk away with   and USE for sure "

This tastes like as shown in the photo with some discernible separation of crust, filling and a light dusting of cinnamon. If using the 10% dilution there is room to go higher if you prefer more cinnamon which goes perfectly with this recipe. I will be vaping this watching the footy during the winter months to come for sure."
