  "description": "I was home sick with the flu today. I wanted something I could vape that would help with my sore throat and my sinuses so I finally got to bust out my menthol flavors (I'm not usually a menthol guy). FLV Red Apple is usually fairly dry by itself at this % but when backed by FA Fuji it helped create a very cool and sweet apple. So if you're home sick, feel like poop, but you still want to vape, give this a shot. I can personally say this is S&V certified.",
