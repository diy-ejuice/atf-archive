  "description": "This is my donut recipe. I've never had Donut Pounder, but that was my inspiration. It's a bit neutral, but also good enough that I vape it almost ever day. It's got enough layers to it to be interesting, but it's not so overpowering that I get worn out by it. It also makes a nice base for other donut(y) creations. It's pretty good right out of the gate, but the cinnamon calms down best after about a week.",
