  "description": "\r\n\r\nhttps://youtu.be/VtbPa8LnGSg\r\n\r\nThe LB Ice Cream and FLV Vanilla Pudding form a shake and vape custard base CREDIT TO FRESH03 FOR THIS DISCOVERY\r\n\r\nINW SHISHA ORANGE. Imagine a cross between orange sherbet and an orange candy for the profile\r\nInitially it has the peel or white part of the orange but the pretty mush fades after a week steep and your left with a delicious orange cream flavor. This flavor separates like some of the other oranges so be sure to shake well andd any juice itâ€™s in as well. \r\n\r\nThe JF Honey peach and the Armenia are to help fill out the orange as well as provide some brightness and juiciness to the recipe well\r\n\r\nHOPE YOU ENJOY!!\r\n",

On the other hand I could see it being like having a tiny bit of orange zest grated into the custard mix if you are into that."
