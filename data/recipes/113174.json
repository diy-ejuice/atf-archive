    "description": "I was working with another mixer, leptest, on a raspberry\/currant profile. He went another direction. This is what I ended up with.\r\n\r\nFA Blackcurrant is dominant here, turning the raspberries darker and highlighting the show. It sits on top here very well. \r\n\r\nINW Raspberry\/TFA Raspberry Sweet gives us a pretty potent Raspberry with a little bit of sweetness (EM) to tone down the floral notes a bit. If you're sensitive to INW Raspberry you can dial it down to 1-1.5% if you want. I can vape it straight all day long at 2%. Some people can't. \r\n\r\nINW Shisha Strawberry brings more berry sweetness to the base and keeps the mix interesting, giving it that certain something. \r\n\r\nFA Pear is here for juiciness and to lighten things up. I find that it keeps a leash on the syrupy side of Shisha Strawberry. \r\n\r\nFE Lemon here in a tiny amount helps to lift and brighten the berries just a smidge.\r\n\r\nI like this without sweetener and\/or coolant. This mix is really great with a little koolada or WS-23 though. ",
