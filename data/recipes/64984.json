    "description": "Yes this recipe looks like an abomination and the percentages high, but it keeps a relative from smoking menthols. The FW and Capellas are fairly weak anyway.\r\n\r\nI worked with her over about 4 months (through the mail) to get her a recipe that she loved and then tweaked it to her own personal perfection. \r\n\r\nThis recipe gives her the throat hit, cooling, and mint that mimics a menthol cigarette yet tastes like a really good candy cane.\r\n\r\nI know this recipe isn't for everyone. I'm posting it in hopes that it may help others stay away from the menthol cigarettes. It's meant for those just stopping smoking menthols using a MTL tank with out of the box coils. ",
