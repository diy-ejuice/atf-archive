    "description": "This recipe was inspired by Diy or Die's live mixing. I have always really liked tfa kettle corn but until last Friday on live mixing I never thought of using it as a corn bread. Well it works and I really like it!!!!\ud83d\ude01\ud83d\ude01\ud83d\ude01 So here it is my Southern Corn Bread Pudding!\r\n\r\nCorn bread:\r\nTfa Kettle Corn and capella sugar cookie and of coarse some butter I chose tfa butter. This creates a delicious buttery corn bread.\r\n\r\nThe pudding:\r\nI used flavorah vanilla pudding and LA cheesecake and a little holy vanilla for the main pudding. I then added a little inawera creme brulee to add the caramelized\/cooked feel to the mix. I used LA cheesecake because it is a more creamy cheesecake than the other options and it really seems to work in this recipe. \r\n\r\nWhen this is combined it is quite magical. It will need a 5 day steep due to the uses of capella sugar cookie and LA cheesecake and inawera creme brulee but it is worth the wait. Enjoy!!!!",
