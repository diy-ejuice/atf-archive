I also always had an issue with the texture profile of the juice, So I added some jelly to make my Fresh Fruit a Fresh Fruit Jelly.\r\n\r\nThe Citrus:\r\nThe Sweet Tangerine was the main profile I was aiming for so I started with that and built the other citrus around this. Sweet Tangerine just has that Great Light and Clear; Sweet Citrus without killing it on that tart side.\r\nBlood Orange I used here to push a bit more of that Vitamin C vibe from a sweet ripe Orange. I just boosts the Tangerine profile some more.\r\nLemon Sicily layers that Zesty Pop into the middle and and stretches the freshness into the steep\r\n\r\nJelly Candy:\r\nWell its for a Jelly Texture that candifies this Fresh Fruit.\r\n\r\nPeach Juicy:\r\nusing it as the blender and also to soften the Citrus Harshness with the Combo of Oba Oba.\r\n\r\nOba Oba:\r\nFruits can sometimes be quite flat, this is where I normally use a cream like cream fresh, but here I needed something different to work with the Citrus in the same way as Cream backdrop but without any milky/dairy notes. Oba Oba has a special subtle fizz that compliments and boosts a vibrant fruit in strange ways. The magic about this is that it does something special in a different way with different fruits, here is Pushes that Thickness of the Jelly Candy and also works with the Peach to Bind and Shave off some harshness.\r\n\r\n**This recipe was inspired by a few techniques I saw from a Few amazing mixers who used some of these concentrates in awesome ways, So All credit to the DIY Community with people like Ediblemalfunction , Dazcole and Chrisdvr1 and of course Richard (RichJB) for all his advice and pointers on some issues I had with this one!\r\n\r\n.\r\n.\r\n.\r\n.\r\n**Update 04.11.18:\r\n- Added 0.44 TPA Marshmallow\r\n- Dropped the Jelly Candy from 3.33 to 1.77\r\n",
