  "description": "Everyone has probably wakened with regrets from the night before - too much fun - and the only thing that might get you through the day is to jump on that horse again with a salty, savory drink...a Bloody Mary. Well imagine a world without salt or savory vegetables. Imagine a world of only sweet and creamy. This is my take on the Bloody Mary version of that world...a Bloody Berry.\r\nNotes:\r\nSo this is for the contest using only the flavors from the last Awesome Box.\r\nSimple yet flavorful Strawberry Cr√®me drink\r\nnot much to say about the flavor notes, pretty self explanatory.\r\nMax VG\r\nShake n Vape\r\n\r\nEnjoy\r\nfolkart  ",
