  "description": "Mixen Vixen Ep 27\r\nfor a more personalized explanations you should watch the show\r\nThis is a very sweet fruit candy desert mix of Berry Sorbet. It has all the candy elements with s sweet creamy finish. \r\nFW Blueberry is one of the most candied vibrant blueberry I've ever tried blended with TFA raspberry another candies vibrant berry make a fantastic candied type blend I added a tiny bit of FLV Boysenberry for the darker berry swirls in the mix and only needed a little in order not to muddle the other two berries candies effect. The Cap Lemon Lime combined with Flv Candy roll provide the tangy sweet note that is often found in sorbet fro the citric acid and sweetener combination. I finished smoothing it out with a combination of Vanilla swirl and a touch of Vanilla. Sweetener is a must to keep the integrity of the mix in the candy sweet side of things. Yes all the bad notes you think will be here are here off the shake but after an overnight sit it starts to mellow and within 3 days everything blends in well into one solid smooth sorbet blend. I hope you all enjoy! :) If you like creamy candy mixes this one is yummmyyyy!!! \r\n\r\nFA Polar blast is optional but not necessary, I used it at 0.25% just for a tad bit of a chill. ",
