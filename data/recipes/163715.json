  "description": "My goal was to create a simple apple profile - Fresh and juicy.\r\n\r\nWhen I was working on my version of Camp Tigerclaw (@ConcreteRiver), I had an opportunity to test a lot of apple flavours. Many of them were either bad, average or didn't have potential to stand on their own. The few that stuck with me, were FLV Apple and INW Shisha Apple - I knew I could build a nice apple profile with these flavours.\r\n \r\nI tried to find the right ratio with the help of other apples, but somehow always failed or the results were just not satisfying. Then I came across this recipe - Pantsless Krampus by @SlashaLO. It was a tobacco mix, but with a great apple stone. The percentages seemed alright, but for the recipe to stand on its own, it required a few tweaks.\r\n \r\n**FLV Apple** is the main player here. It delivers a mix between red and green apple. It's tart, bright and does a great job of imitating an apple, but was too \"acidic\". It needed help from another red apple, and **FLV Red Apple** was a good fit (another choice might've been INW Shisha Apple, but I liked it more with this one). The problem with this flavour though, is that if you go high, you will not only get a red apple flavour, but also some kind of \"rotten cider\" taste. Maybe this could be covered up in the original recipe by the tobacco, but the original ratio didn't work. \r\n**WF Thai Apple** adds some depth to the mix. \r\n**INW Pear** is not here for the juiciness, but rather to give the mix some \"fleshiness\". Pears are usually very light flavours, but not the INW one. Works really well here, and it also blends seamlessly.\r\n\r\nI encourage you to use sweetener here, CAP SS or FLV Sweetness - Since the apple flavours are very acidic, the sucralose helps tremendously.\r\n\r\nTested on NarCA RDA, 42W, 0.3 Ohm, Framed Staple Ni80.\r\n\r\nLink to the original recipe: https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/130592",
