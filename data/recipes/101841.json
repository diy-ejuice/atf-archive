      "text": "The ice cream base here really delivers. I love the combo of TPA VBIC and TPA Sweet Cream with CAP Butter Cream. It’s a very dairy forward, firm ice cream. CAP Butter Pecan and INW Biscuit compliment each other well. The biscuit doesn’t really stand out; it just gives some body to the pecan flavor. CAP’s Butter Pecan is on the sweet side, and it fits quite well here. FLV Milk &amp; Honey adds a little bit more sweetness to the mix. FLV Sweet Coconut keeps that Biscuit from drying things out too much. Good stuff. I might add a touch of sweetener to what’s left of my bottle, but I put it in everything so don’t put much weight into that. Great mix!"
