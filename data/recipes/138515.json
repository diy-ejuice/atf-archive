    "description": "Made For Mixin in the Kitchen  episode on Mango \r\nOn the inhale you get the  frozen yogurt with a slight sweet vanilla note that transitions to the mango\/ pineapple and ends with a light cinnamon\r\n\r\n**Island mango** is a Sweet meaty  ripe juicy  mango    paired with **flV mango**  to help hold that sweet ripe syrup mango   with the  frozen yogurt .  There can  be a slight floral off note and harshness from FLV mango that the  frozen yogurt  really helps to round out.  \r\n\r\n**Sugarloaf Pineapple** adds a nice sweet acid note   that will be a back note  in this mix \r\n\r\n**Frozen yougurt and Yogurt drink**    work to create the frozen yougurt base.  The  WF frozen yogurt is  fantastic   full creamy slight vanilla note with a light tart note, that needed to be pushed high  here to  really bring  the creamy body.     yougurt drink was added to  provide a slight lemon note to add vibrancy and support some of the notes   \r\n\r\n**golden syrup** was added for some dark sweetness to contrast some of the top notes\r\n\r\n**rich cinnamon** is an additive that works so well with mango and pineapple \r\n",
