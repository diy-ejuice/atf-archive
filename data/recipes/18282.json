  "description": "Flavor Description:  A velvety smooth cheesecake topped with fresh apples, caramel cinnamon syrup, and a dollop of fresh whipped cream on top. Similar to the cheesecake one would get from Carnegie Deli with my own personal twist on it. \r\nInhale: Fresh apples that are almost candied in nature as the caramel cinnamon syrup starts to come through.\r\nMid-note: The candied apple drenched in caramel cinnamon syrup sits on top of a smooth cheesecake that’s extremely light on the crust.\r\nExhale:  Fresh apple dipped in whipped cream to finish off on a perfect note. \r\n\r\nJF Fuji and CAP NY Cheesecake- This makes up the main profile of my recipe. I used JF Fuji to give a very fresh and realistic ripe apple taste, but in conjunction with the other flavors it begins to transform into an almost candied apple by the end of the vape experience. I found 4% is the perfect amount to keep this flavor going strong throughout the entire vape, any lower and it just doesn’t hold up as well with what I had in mind. I prefer CAP NY Cheesecake to TFA Cheesecake with graham crust because of its realistic cheesecake taste when compared to TFA’s version which, to me tastes like a cheap no bake cheesecake. I used this flavor at 6% to really bring out that cream cheese taste from cheesecake without going overboard into the realm of sweaty socks and sour cheese taste, any lower and it loses its vibrant taste in the recipe. \r\nTFA Strawberry Ripe- To very simply put it, I used this flavor for its ethyl maltol and maltol content. I wanted the sweetness from this flavor to really shine, rather than using it for the strawberry flavor. \r\nCAP Cinnamon Danish Swirl and TFA Caramel Original- These two flavors make up the syrup topping on the cheesecake. TFA Caramel original, to me, gives a very realistic caramel syrup flavor and at 2% I found that it really pairs well with the cheesecake to give a drizzled effect. The CAP Cinnamon Danish Swirl is a strong cinnamon type taste when used above 3%, but at 2.5% it combines with the caramel syrup in such a way that it becomes a caramel cinnamon syrup. This combined syrup brings out the full flavor of the apple while also transforming it during the vape from a fresh apple into an almost candied apple flavor. \r\nTFA Sweet Cream- This flavor is mainly found in the exhale of the vape. I don’t really care too much for whipped cream flavors because of the waxy taste they leave behind, so in order to replicate a whipped cream type flavor, I found this works perfectly for a dollop of fresh whipped cream. At 1.5% this flavor gives a fresh homemade whipped cream taste that’s not overly sweet, but pairs well with the other flavors to give just the right amount of sweetness. \r\n",
