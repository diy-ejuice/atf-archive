  "description": "This is a strawberry kiwi banana recipe that's based around authentic fruits, and not a candy profile. It's actually quite delicious and I ripped through the 10ml's I made pretty quickly.

Also my first time using the Sweetleaf Stevia Clear sweetdrops and I'm quite impressed as well, very nice sweetener (yet I used it at 1.5%, no off-tastes for me). This one is S&amp;V and ADV certified in my book. Thx Wayne for yet another learning, I appreciate it bro. ;)"
