    "description": "i've been trying to create the perfect vanilla pudding and i've gone through a ton of different flavours and combinations.Nothing worked so far.Every pudding flavour or vanilla cream combination was missing something or brought notes to the recipe which would take away from the profile.\r\nThen it hit me,the solution to all my problems.The revelation..CAP Fucking Sugar cookie!\r\nThe combination with TPA VBIC gives me the pudding flavour i've been looking for.It sits under the VBIC and gives it some thickness and some distinct sweetness.It also lends some texture to the pudding,which sells it even more.JF Bavarian Cream is just there to close the gap in between those two flavours.TPA Diary\/Milk obviously adds some more of a dairy note .\r\nYou can add some sweetener if you like but i like it just how it is.\r\nEnjoy and let me know what you think",
