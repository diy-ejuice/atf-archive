  "description": "#FatKidHype\r\n\r\nLook no further. Here I bring you a Chocolate Cookie Pudding. This is more of a chocolate pudding with crumbles of cookie layered around and a nice dollop of vanilla spread layered on top.\r\n\r\n\r\n- JF Milk Chocolate + FLV Vanilla Pudding + CAP Vanilla Custard make the strong pudding base.\r\n\r\n- CAP Sugar Cookie + JF Biscuit layer in a cookie bakery appeal. You could probably sub in INW Biscuit at the same % for a similar effect.\r\n\r\n- TPA Vanilla Swirl + FA Meringue really put that vanilla silkiness into the flavor.\r\n\r\nI would recommend at least 3 days to let the flavors get to know each other. 7 is prime time.\r\n\r\nVape it, Love it :) Comment with any feedback below!",

Not because it's difficult to describe my feelings, but because I really wanted to drag every nuance out of this liquid, especially since for some weird reason, I need to take an extra week of steeping with anything with cap VCv1. Just can taste the chemicals as it steeps or something. None of my friends have this issue...&#xD;\n&#xD;\nAnyway, after 2 weeks of steeping, this is a VERY rich chocolate pudding with hints of cookie popping up, and a very creamy burst of vanilla on the middle and exhale. It's sheer rich decadence on every hit. I mean, I can feel myself getting heavier when I vape it. That good of a dessert.&#xD;\n&#xD;\nThis bad boy is for dessert fans, pudding fans, chocoholics, and anyone looking for something to kill that late night sweets urge stone dead. VAPE THOSE CALORIES!&#xD;\n&#xD;\nSeriously tasty stuff."
