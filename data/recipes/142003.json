For this reason, I added it at 3.5%.\r\n  \r\n**FLV Citrus Soda** is very enjoyable. I noticed that higher percentages make its' \"fizzy\" soda quality more prominent. I also wanted its' lime nuance to be the highlight of this mix.\r\n  \r\n**FLV Boysenberry** just *had* to be included here for its' delectable candy-like taste. I used it low because it can easily smother a mix.\r\n  \r\n**FLV Black Currant** to me, is a very potent flavor. For this reason, I included it in my soda pop but kept it on the low side.\r\n  \r\n**FLV Sweetness** was added because I wanted my pink soda pop to be nice & sweet!\r\n \r\n**Add 2 drops WS-23 per 15ml for that cool punch!!**\r\n \r\n**SNV Certified**\r\n  \r\n**70% VG**\r\n \r\n  \r\n*Please don't use this recipe for commercial gain, as it is being shared in good faith for the enjoyment of the community. I hope you enjoy!*\r\n  ",
