  "name": "Billowade (Currant Lemonade)",
  "description": "I do 2 drops of Cap Super Sweet per 15ml for this one  with one drop of ws 23 for a 30 ml but that my palate adjust to your level. I came up with  this one to help U/ICbillows when he needed help with the sweet currant. The cap sweet currant is a tangy jammy currant flavor and it adds that dark currant tang to the mix that the LA Lemonade compliments beautifully ofc all this tangy sourness needs some sweetness so i added my favorite duo of strawberries into this to get extend the syrupy vibe I was getting from it. The dragon fruit is in there to emulsify and bring everything together. This was my first time helping someone and i hope i did not steer him wrong.",
