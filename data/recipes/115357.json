    "description": "I know, I know... not another floral macaron.  I was not sure which profile I would want to use in the end.  Needless to say I made several versions of floral macarons thinking that I would settle on just one of them.  However, I liked where they were all going, so I have kept working on the other ones as well.  It has taken several failed attempts to get the ratios\/flavors that I am happy with.  I wanted light floral accents, not perfume.  This will not be for everyone, but if you are feeling adventurous you should give it a try.  You might surprise yourself!  \r\n\r\nThe Violet and the Sugar Orchid accent each other nicely and the Holy Vanilla and FLV-Frosting blended them together seamlessly.  Props to @Shyndo and anyone else who had a hand in coming up with the base macaron flavors\/percentages.  \r\n\r\n***Personally I liked this without sweetener but if you like sweeter vapes I suggest using Vanilla Sugar Daddy.  I think that it would blend seamlessly with these flavors.  If you are a serious floral devotee then you might want to raise the percents a tad on the Sugar Orchid and Violet.  The image and idea were found on Pinterest.***",
