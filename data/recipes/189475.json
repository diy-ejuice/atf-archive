  "description": "A deeply delicious strawberry milk.\r\n\r\nI have NEVER released a strawberry milk and thought that I would never see the day... However, the lockdown does strange things to one and this is the result after mixing the missus her usual strawberry cream... This is a self indulgent thick and creamy strawberry milk which was inspired by combining the best bits of my favorite strawberry milks and adding my own spin on 'em.\r\n\r\nStrawberry\r\nEach strawberry plays its own role here and, combined, delivers a wonderfully sweet & flavourful strawberry base while delivering a semblance of mouth feel - compliments of WF Strawberry Gummy Candy. I realise that 3 strawberries may seem  excessive but this threesome has proven me wrong. Used sparingly, I have coaxed just the correct amount of flavour out of these babies to deliver the ultimate strawberry milk strawberry. \r\n\r\nCreamy base\r\nVT Vanilla Cream has been a revelation in the mixing scene and for good reason... This voluptuous, creamy beauty is laced with fresh vanilla and is just sublime in any creamy base. Combined with FA Milk and a touch of meringue, it is catapulted to greatness... \r\n\r\nThe sugar cookie adds that little bit of familiarity and prevents the recipe of being linear - the slightest bit of cookie flavour just elevates it perfectly.\r\n\r\nThis baby is ready after 3 days or so.\r\n\r\n",
