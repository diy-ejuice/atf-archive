You can taste the orange, strawberry and peach individually, but they blend together. All my friends agreed with my thought: yup, this has to be what it tastes like. This is what my brain envisioned.&#xD;\n&#xD;\nFor those not Fallout inclined: think making a cola heavy suicide with orange fanta, strawberry fanta, and a splash of peach something.&#xD;\n&#xD;\nSeverely excellent. I've been ADVing this for almost a week.&#xD;\n&#xD;\nWorth crawling out of your vault and brawling with a Jet addicted deathclaw for. Absolute banger!"
