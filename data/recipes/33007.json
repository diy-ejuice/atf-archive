    "description": "\r\nThis recipe is an attempt to recreate the powder sugar coated shortbread cookie with inclusions of candied lemon zest that I enjoyed as a child\r\n\r\nExcerpt of review of the rebirth of the cookie under a new manufacturer:\r\n\"The crumbly cookies, coated with powdered sugar, and sprinkled throughout with enchantingly tart and yellow bits of lemony stuff, were so amazing that sometimes we\u2019d polish off a whole box before we even got to the check-out counter (hey, we paid for the empty box!). But in the 1990s, Lemon Coolers disappeared from grocery store shelves after the cookie\u2019s maker, Sunshine Biscuits, merged with Keebler in 1996.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThis recipe is 100% DIY or Die community created. I started with a simple Biscuit and Lemon sicily and asked the group (via Facebook) how they suggested I tweak it to give it that powdered sugar feel and taste and a good lemon bite that was blended into the cookie, not overpowering it.\r\n\r\nI will take 100% of the criticism as I published the final recipe under my name, but the guys in the DIYOD facebook group deserve the credit for getting this all-day-vape off the ground.",
