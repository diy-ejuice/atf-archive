  "description": "This is a very unique tasty Melon recipe FW Apple provides a nice tart note that really brightens up the melons. The blue raspberry from Real Flavors is just a really good flavor and brings in a nice sweet but tangy flavor that bursts this flavor to beyond it limits adding such a great amount of flavor. Inw raspberry is a strong flavor but used at very low percentage adds just a great dark raspberry note to the recipe. This truly is just a sweet melon that will keep your mouth begging for more all day long. No steep required definetely a Shake and Vape that has the perfect amount of flavor and sweetness. Steep 3 days and the flavor is absolute bliss. Try it you won't be disappointed. Simple but great. Mixed 65/35PG if you like it sweeter add .25-5 FLV Sweetness or Cap Super sweet",
