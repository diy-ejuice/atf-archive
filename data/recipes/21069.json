  "description": "This was to see if I could make a cinnamon bun custard. It turned out differently than expected It tastes like a very strong cinnamon bun with almost a caramel flavor backing it. I really enjoy this recipe, and I hope you do too! Everyone is free to edit this recipe and change it!\r\n\r\nIt turns out that this actually makes for a great shake and vape! 3 days later is when it is best though. ",

The only thing I would change is to lower the Cinnamon Roll to 7% but only as a personal taste to make it more ADV. Congratulations, you have an incredible recipe! (PD. Sorry for my bad english)"
