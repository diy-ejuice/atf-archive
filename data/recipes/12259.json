Can only just barely taste the rum as an aftertaste (like a good mixed drink), and the friggin mango is an inspired touch. Kicks up the tropical vibe and add that extra something that just keeps me coming back for more. This is the vape that's gonna get me through black friday."

The coconut candy was a smart choice and I think helps get rid of that drying effect that FA coco can have in some applications. Everything is very well balanced here. I think I was initially weary of the rum as I’ve had it ruin quite a few recipes for me, but it sits in the mix very well. The mango makes this one absolutely cravable. My only regret is that I only had enough FLV cream left to make a 30ml. I’m going to have to put this one in rotation, beautiful work."

This is a beautifully delicate balancing act! That juicy, sweet mango flavor gilded with the perfect, light shine of coconutty cream and pineapple is the bee's knees. Excellent recipe, ID10-T. I wish I could give it 10 stars!"

I'm actually surprised that the coconut is not more \"in your face\". This is easily the best Pina colada I've had. Steep time says 5 days but I've been vaping it out of my kayfun since day 2 and it has been great. Seriously adding this to my ADV rotation. If (for some weird reason) you are on the fence about this one and maybe need a few flavorings for it, do not hesitate. If this profile interests you even slightly, then this would be a very enjoyable vape for you. Great job on the recipe!"
