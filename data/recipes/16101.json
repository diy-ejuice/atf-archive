    "description": "This is a blue raspberry jolly rancher\r\n\r\nRaspberry\/Razzleberry - this is where the main \"blue\" raspberry flavor comes from, that razzleberry is very candyish which lends perfectly in this mix. \r\n\r\nCotton Candy (Circus) - this flavor helps sweeten up the mix and give it more of a candy taste while helping out the blue raspberry taste\r\n\r\nSour Wizard - this is what gives this recipe that extra tart and in your face flavor. It really makes the raspberry flavors pop.\r\n\r\nSweetener - I really wanted to drive home the whole candy idea and needed more sweetener to do this. Jolly Ranchers are a very sugary candy.",

But then I tried this again after sitting for 10 days and I must say, this recipe pulls off a sour blue raspberry jolly rancher very well. The raspberry doesn't get lost or muted in the sour wizard and the sweeteners perform their functions beautifully to turn this into a sugary candy. Good stuff. Well done!"
