  "description": "Profile: Black licorice and dark berry candy - flavor of my childhood.\r\n\r\nDevelopment:\r\n\r\nWas a bit up and down with this one to get the licorice balanced correctly. Goal was to get some anise and some salmiak but not too much of either.\r\nFirst version contained 2.5% FA Black Touch and 1% CAP Licorice - Too much anise and too little (none really) salmiak.\r\nSo I took FA Black Touch down .5% and added that .5% to the CAP Licorice - great success!\r\n\r\nNext up was to balance the berries. \r\nFirst version I used 1% FLV boysenberry, 0.5% FA Blackcurrant and 2% WF Sour Blue Raspberry Candy.\r\nThe Sour Blue Raspberry Candy added some good taste, but sadly brought along some perfume as well, which I didn't care much for.\r\nAfter talking it over with @nowar - who suggested CAP Jelly Candy (lots and lots of credit to him for that), Sour Blue Raspberry Candy was scrapped in favor.\r\nSecond version - now with @nowar onboard, we felt the berries lacked a little, so we added another .25% to the FLV Boysenberry and struck gold!\r\nPowdered sugar is mainly there to help the FLV Boysenberry with the taste of candy.\r\nCAP Super Sweet does not need an explanation why its there.\r\n\r\nTo me this taste just like my childhood, where to @nowar this taste like adulthood - thought that was a funny little quote to have in.\r\nWhere I come from, a mixture of black licorice and berries is not unheard of - in fact, it's very common and kids do enjoy that flavor a lot.\r\n\r\nPlease do enjoy!",

I didn't really understand what the vision for this was (despite enjoying it) until I tried the licorice candies this was based on. A great recipe and a fun experience. Thanks for bringing me along for the ride and expanding my palate. An excellent mix for licorice lovers!"
