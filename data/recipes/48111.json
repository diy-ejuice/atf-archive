    "description": "Aight, so here we go again. Yet another FLV Tobacco recipe.\r\n\r\nTLDR: Tobacco, Apple Praline\r\n\r\nI originally started this one with vanilla toffee in mind playing off the sweetness of FLV Sweet Cigarette as a base. There are just so many good RY4-ish tobaccos out there without adding another that does not truly stand apart. I also really wanted to use my BAE Red Burley in here and started thinking of playing off of it's inherent nutty tones using FLV Praline to bolster them a bit. I used Granny Smith in this profile to keep the recipe grounded outside of RY4 territory by giving it some fruit tones and a different sweet edge. I needed some ash here but not the Kentucky Blend \"crutch\" ash I have been using and thought the FLV Turkish played nicely here in that it brings a bit more complexity in the tobacco profile while adding a little bit of ash.\r\n\r\nP.S. One iteration of this took me down a very rich dessert praline tobacco trail, it is still in the works and will be coming out eventually. #staytuned ;)\r\n\r\nSteeping Disclaimers: I really like FLV Tobaccos fresh, not that they fade away but on the Shake and Vape they have a very strong, rich and sometimes almost overwhelming presence that I enjoy. This one really comes together about day 5\r\nVG Disclaimer, Yes, I still think tobaccos benefit more from 50%-60% VG, but do as you please, it is nice at 70% VG as well.",
