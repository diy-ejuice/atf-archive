    "description": "This is a candy based slushie using flavours i feel work really well together to create a mixed medley slush. Not alot gone into this one tbh kind of just had the idea, mixed it, vaped it & enjoyed it.\r\n\r\nThe blue raspberries with hibiscus speak for them selves as theyre pretty popular combo's although using hibiscus candy to fit the profile.\r\nSour water melon and jelly cherry are also a tasty combo and turning them blue works a treat. Using VTA sherbet as a candy like fizzy additive whilst sorbet base lifts the melon and provides some moisture for the slush rather than a straight candy. Also using sour apple as an additive as it carries little apple flavouring and more of a sour note.",
