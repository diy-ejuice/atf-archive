  "description": "I use a pod for vaping 50 mg juice while I'm at work. I haven't found a single recipe that was for such a high nicotine mix so after trying out several of the mtl pod recipes on here and being dissapointed I decided to work on something simple and strong to get through the high nic mix.\r\nThis is the best 50mg nic juice I have vaped and decided to share since this area is lacking in diy.\r\nIt's simple and could easily be adapted to be better I'm sure but so far this has been working for me and I no longer waste 25 bucks on store bought juice that tastes terrible most of the time.",

I will definitely be making more of this. Personally, the flavor is a bit too high for me but the balance of flavor is great, I will probably mix at 20% flavor next time since I'm not using as much nicotine as the recipe calls for. Mixed at 50/50 with 24mg nicotine and let it steep over night.&#xD;\n&#xD;\nUpdate: adding a drop or 2 per 10ml of WS-23 really makes this juice shine!"
