  "description": "I HATE to make such long recipes but this one needed to be like this.\r\n\r\nWhat i wanted for this profile was a milky creamy taste and chocolate/peanut butter flavour like they have been drenched like a syrup on the glass.\r\nAlso some cruchy notes like you're drinking straight from the cup on the image and not from the straw, and as more you vape it, you loose a bit of that crunch and you have the sensation of being drinking now from the straw.\r\n\r\nFor the cream base i wanted a milky, creamy, thick and rich milkshake so i used a classic mix such as: Fa Cream Fresh, TPA Vanilla swirl and TPA Bavarian Cream but the cream was still a bit soft for what i wanted so i added CAP V1 Vanilla Custard and Boom! The milkshake base worked perfectly.\r\n\r\nFor the peanut butter part i used TPA Peanut Butter Dx, and FlV peanut butter at just 0.25% as everything higher added too much dry peanut top notes.\r\n\r\nFA Cookie gives the crunchy notes and adds to the milkshake base.\r\n\r\nObviously JF Milk Chocolate as the chocolate syrupy flvour that blends with the milk.\r\n\r\nAt least a week of steep for everything to blend together and from 2-4 weeks and on it only gets better.\r\n",
