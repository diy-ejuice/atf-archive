    "description": "**Berries n cream**\r\n\r\nThe idea behind this mix was to get a creamy vape with minimal steep time while adding a nice berry blend to the mix. Off the shake its killer IMO, super wet and flavorful but after a quick steep it comes together.\r\n\r\nCAP Sweet Currant was used as a main note here as I had gotten the flavor awhile ago but never made good use of it. It is a really nice flavor, juicy and well rounded and can be used as a stand alone if desired.\r\n\r\nFLV Jammy Berry and TFA Blackberry is a blatant rip from Foment_Lifes use of the combo in DAAPLBerry Cream. The 2 concentrates just meld real nice together and worked wonderfully with the sweet currant as a dark berry mix for my fruit notes.\r\n\r\n(Original mix was 1% FLV Sweet Coconut) this stuff is just killer and works well with berries. Its not real pronounced in this mix at 1% but I was using it as a note to lighten up the berries as well as a bridge to the cream. \r\n\r\nAfter revisiting this mix I switched to an equal percent FA Coco as I enjoy the flavor a bit more and it melds with the creams better. Either coconut is fine though.\r\n\r\nINW Custard and INW Yes, We Cheesecake the idea of the juice was to have a quick steeping mix so this just seemed to fit. I was originally going to just use the custard and a vanilla but wanted a thicker body so the cheesecake came into play. There is room for a crust or bakery note as well but I was just going for a cream\/fruit aspect here.",
