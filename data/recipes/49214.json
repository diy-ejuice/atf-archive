  "name": "Summer Spice: A Marriage Of Persimmon & Pear",
  "description": "**In response to the recent spotlight on INW Shisha Punch in Ep. 1 of the new \"Noted\" podcast on the DIYorDIE Network, methinks another Shisha Punch offering is due.**\r\n\r\n*\"A fantastic treat for those summer nights, and pairs perfectly with an adult beverage.\"*\r\n\r\nINW Shisha Punch is an incredible, spicy, yet fragrant and satisfying blend. It is usually the cornerstone of any recipe it joins, as it is highly potent and hard to subdue. Thus, we use it here at a careful 0.3%. Shisha Punch also blends famously well with the oily, zesty nature of FW Blood Orange, used here at 2.5%. Once again, the two are joined successfully for a light mulled-orange spice.\r\n\r\nHere, we blend the subtly-spiced orange base together with the fragrant fruit combo of the amazing FLV Persimmon, and our old reliable pal, TFA Pear. A simple recipe sure to set your olfactory system right again. (A great cure for olfactory fatigue, a.k.a: Vaper's Tongue, as well) \r\n\r\nWorks great as a shake-and-vape. Allow 48 hours for the Shisha Punch to back down a bit for a nice balance.\r\n\r\nI do hope you enjoy!\r\n\r\n(INW Shisha Punch also works best as a dilution. When using a 10% dilution, one can add more to a given recipe. This achieves a higher accuracy with a flavoring where ONE SINGLE extra drop can be the difference between awesome and offensive.) \r\n\r\n(The 0.3% noted here is the full-strength, non-diluted commercial flavoring.)",
