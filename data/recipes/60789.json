  "description": "I've been working on this recipe for the last month and a half, I feel it's really close to the original and delicious as it is. I used fw blue raspberry because I know it's definitely in the original, I used the harvest berry to tone down the blue raspberry and add a BlackBerry type of note. The citrus punch I thought was the best citrus for this type of recipe as I was looking for a light citrus note not something thats gonna dominate the mix. And finally cap super sweet was definitely needed in this mix to give that commercial type taste and it brings everything together, without the sweetener this recipe wouldn't work. This is the type of recipe that tastes better and better as it steeps, when the mix turns a light yellow thats when its ready.",
