    "description": "I make ejuice for a friend of mine. He ran out of his Triple C stash. So he picked up a bottle of Milkman Hazel to get by. I didn't get to try it, but I smelled the bottle a bit.  I have no idea if this recipe tastes the same as Milkmans Hazel. Good news is it's very very tasty. Triple C was my ADV for 2 year or so. This is now my ADV. Goodbye  4 to 6 week steeps.\r\n\r\nFLA Cookie Dough and FW Hazelnut play very well together. The FW Butterscotch Ripple is my bridge to the creams. There might be better ice creams out there, but these are the best two I have. It tastes good the next day, but is much better with a 5 to 7 day steep. A long steep has not been tested.\r\n\r\nI will be getting LB and HS Ice Cream soon. If they work better in this recipe I will post a V2. ",

The cookie dough works great in this application and almost adds a thick maltyness along with the hazelnut.
