  "name": "Breakfast Lunch and Dinner Lemon Tart (The Worst Yet)",
  "description": "I made this on the fly and it really surprised me.\r\nMy thought process was to lay a thin crust for a backnote (OOO Pie Crust). Next in my mind, it needed some of that stuff you get at the bottom of a tart between the crust and filling so I added some lemon squares to it. MB Lemon Tart is pretty nice on it's own at 6%  with some nice creamy biscuit notes but I knew I was going to layer this up  so  I dialed it down to 4. I wanted to add more creaminess to it and WF lemon custard was on point here providing a smooth mouth feel.  A good lemon meringue needs good egg white fluff and flapper pie with a touch of FA meringue is my go to . I spiked it with some tangy sour lemon and It hit the spot, I gave it a good shake, let it sit for a few hours, dripped it and then tried it after half an hour and was quite pleased.  To be honest I don't really know what the OOO Pie Crust is doing here and if you want more biscuit add maybe 0.5% of your favorite e.g INW or JF biscuit or try it without if you can't find it.\r\n\r\nSweeten to taste: I use 1 drop per 10ml of FW Sweetener.\r\n\r\nTested on a single coil Dead Rabbit, 1.6 Ohms 60 Watts.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Possible changes:  You could try VT lemon meringue pie, FE lemon is also good in this if you want it less candied or optional addition for more in your face lemon. if you have MF lemon add one drop per 10ml**\r\n\r\nTL;DR \"mix this now\"\r\n\r\nA similar previous recipe: https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/133405\r\n",
