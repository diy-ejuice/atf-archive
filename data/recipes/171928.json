  "name": "Cash Register Mint",
  "description": "When I was growing up, before health restrictions put an end to the practice, restaurants frequently had a bowl of after dinner mints by the cash register. I still enjoy a mint after a spicy meal, so this is my after dinner vape. A soft mint that lingers after the vape.\r\n\r\nPurilum's Butter Mint isn't bad, but it needed a little help. \r\nVanilla Cream Extra by Wonder Flavors adds the softness I was looking for, and the vanilla compliments the Butter Mint well.\r\n\r\nThis can be a SNV, but the Vanilla Cream Extra gets better with time.\r\n\r\nTested in OFRF Gear 0.28 ohm, 40 watts",
