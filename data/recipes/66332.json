    "description": "A strawberry chewy candy born of an otherworldly realm.\r\n\r\nThis recipe uses JF Pink Burst as its base. Its the first time I've used the flavor in a mix. Nothing too out of the ordinary in regards to flavors other than that.\r\n\r\nFLAVOR NOTES:\r\n\r\nJF Pink Burst @ 3.0%: PB is only decent on its own in regards to its strawberry notes. It is definitely useful for the chewy candy texture it brings to the table, though. Adding a small amount of JF Juicy Lemon adds a tiny bit of sweetness\/wetness to the candy profile so we don't have to use sweetener. CAP Jelly Candy is a flavor I add to any candy type profile I'm going for, regardless of whether I'm specifically looking for \"jelly candy\" or not.\r\n\r\nJF Sweet Strawberry @ 2.0%: This is a candy recipe, so I didn't want to choose a fresh strawberry flavor. Sweet Strawberry is perfect for this, as its candy-like on its own, and brings its own sweetness into the fold.\r\n\r\nTPA Marshmallow @ 1.0%: Using this for more added sweetness and for a bit of body.",
