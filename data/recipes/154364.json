  "description": "**THIS IS HAWAIIAN PUNCH** \r\n\r\n*If you've ever wanted to vape Hawaiian Punch and been frustrated by flavors like TFA Hawaiian Islands Punch Type, FW Tropical Punch, CAP Silverline Tropical Fruit Punch, and FLV Tropical Punch, which fall short, this recipe is for you.* \r\n\r\nSweetener is optional but so highly recommended that I've left the high amount of FW Sweetener that I prefer with it in the recipe. It drives that super sugary drink experience home. You could use less. If you don't have FW and want to use CAP Super Sweet, 0.5 to 0.75% should get 'er done. Or again, use less if you prefer. TFA Sweetener is not recommended here. Coolants are optional but are not recommended. WS-23 kinda ruins it, unfortunately. A touch of FA Polar Blast doesn't hurt much, but it does somewhat distract from the experience. \r\n\r\nThis recipe is the product of a partnership in which I played a relatively minor role. I asked @AlfredPudding why he does this to me, refuses full credit for his work like he did with the [Back Nine](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/122659#the_back_nine_by_id10_t) recipe and makes me be the one to share it, and he says it's to torture me. That's ok, I like the abuse. But this time, instead of merely asserting that Alfred did all the work and moving along to flavor notes, I offer a mostly unredacted report of the events that led to this recipe: \r\n\r\nThis all started when I tried Alfred's [Cherry Bomb](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/152014#cherry_bomb_by_alfredpudding) and told him I thought it was about 5% INW Pineapple shy of Hawaiian Punch. He sent me back a recipe he called \"Counter Point\" that did indeed have 5% INW Pineapple, but also had more Cherries, less Sweet Guava, FA Forest Fruit instead of Rainbow Candy, and CAP Yellow Peach instead of TFA Jackfruit. So I tried that and responded with \"Counter Counter Point\" - A recipe with little less Pineapple, a little less Peach, a little more Sweet Guava, some TFA Smooth to blend it together, and a bunch of sweetener that it seemed to be crying out for. Minor adjustments and fairly obvious additions. I got back a Counter Counter Counter Point, with a hair less Apricot and no more Forest Fruit. This was Hawaiian Punch.... but yet... not. It was too soft. More like Hawaiian love tap. The only difference in this final version is half as much Smooth as the Counter Counter Counter Point, as it is still providing the blending it needed but not over-softening its punch.  ",

It's quite sweet, but not in an unpleasant way. I'm not usually a big fan of pineapple but the flavor works great in this mix! The TPA Smooth seems to do a decent job keeping some mouthfeel present for these otherwise evanescent fruit flavors. Great work!"

      "text": "This is really good, like unreasonably close to Hawaiian punch, good. I get something sorta chemical-ish up front, somewhere close to the vaguely plastic taste of some store brand Hawaiian punches. I feel that is likely tied into the cherry, but it's hard to say exactly. However, that little abnormal bite blends into the actual body of the main profile in a manner that is very forgivable. I enjoy this overall, I don't totally understand how you  got here, but the more I look at the recipe, the more it feels like it all makes sense. Cherries, pineapple, peach, guava... it's all at least logically in the vicinity of the flavor you were aiming for. The only other possible point of critique I might have is that while the flavor is right where I want it, the mouth feel seems off somehow, a little too dry, like there might still be a bit of undissolved powder in the punch bowl and each vape is like getting the last sip of your cup where the powder settled.&#xD;\n&#xD;\nAll in all, the flavor is really on point here and the complaints sound way worse than they are."

I added the missing flavor to my next order and mixed up a 30ml batch to test.  Most ejuice recipes I've tried which aim to recreate a real-world flavor fall woefully short or come off as \"inspired by X\" moreso than a true replication of a flavor.  This is not one of those recipes.  I was instantly transported back to picnics, birthday parties and family reunions of my childhood and the memory of drinking room temperature Hawaiian Punch out of paper cups.  my 30ml tester didn't last long at all and I'll definitely be adding this to my rotation for the nostalgia blast (plus it's _REALLY_ good!).  Kudos on an exact recreation of my memory of Hawaiian Punch."
