    "description": "#####**Description & Setup**\r\nMy Girlfriend has always been pestering me about strawberries since I started DIY. I have always utterly failed in that aspect, and I was about to give up until I got my hands on some FLV Alpine Strawberry. I had to do a handful of test mixes, but finally, I am proud to present a strawberry recipe that I am not ashamed to put out in public, and is GF approved!\r\n\r\nThis mix has a sweet & cold country-time lemonade inhale, with a nice ripe and fresh strawberry following through on the exhale.\r\n\r\nTested on a Cthulu 1928 MTL RDA \/ Pasito Pod RBA 15w 6 wraps 2mm 25mg\/mL Nicotine\r\n\r\n#####**Notes**\r\n\r\n**LA Lemonade & FLV Lemonade** - These two have essentially been my go-to for mixing lemonade for low powered devices. It doesn't stray too far from being a powdered lemonade, but it also doesn't straight up taste like it just came from a tub. I find it to be a really nice middle ground that I am super satisfied with.\r\n\r\n**CAP Sweet Strawberry** - FLV Alpine Strawberry is great, but I think it is a pretty authentic strawberry. I debated on a few different strawberries to help with this, and finally came to CAP Sweet Strawberry. It introduces a sugary aspect that layers over FLV Alpine very nicely, and also still keeps FLV Alpine Strawberries authentic aspects in tow.\r\n\r\n**FLV Alpine Strawberry** - The star strawberry of the show. I haven't made too many mixes with it yet, but people are definitely not wrong when they say a little will go a long way. FLV Alpine brings in a really nice and potent authentic strawberry flavour that mixes very well with CAP Sweet Strawberry & the Lemonades. I highly recommend getting this if you can, it is a bit pricey but it is well worth it. \r\n\r\n**WS-23** - Lemonade needs to be cool. Adjust the % to your liking\r\n\r\n**CAP Super Sweet** - A touch of sweetness is obviously needed. Adjust % to your liking as well.\r\n\r\nHope you enjoy this mix! Let me know your thoughts if you mix it up :)",
