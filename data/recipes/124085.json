  "description": "#EJUICEMAKERS\r\n I'm on a weight loss mission and this recipe has really been helping me curb my cravings for sweets.\r\n\r\n--------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n🄵🄻🄰🅅🄾🅁  🄽🄾🅃🄴🅂\r\n\r\n■ **FW Vanilla Bean Ice Cream**\r\nChosen over CAP + TFA for it's sweet, creamy & fluffy vanilla contribution. It's also just simply better than CAP and TPA. 🤷‍♂️\r\n\r\n■ **CAP Sugar Cookie**\r\nOriginally trialing FA Cookie I felt it was leaning a little too far into the \"dry\" category, so I landed on CAP's offering. It's a sweet moist cookie that feels like it melds better into the profile.\r\n\r\n■ **WF Vanilla Cream Extra**\r\nThis is a vanilla milkshake, what would it be without a thick creamy vanilla booster? WF's VCE at 2% offers a slight malt note to the profile, but it also contributes to the body with a creamy finish.\r\n\r\n■ **RF Deep Fried Cookies & Cream**\r\nI've been SFTing this concentrate for a long few months. It's very enjoyable but can be tedious to formulate with. CAP Sugar Cookie helps lift the crunch a bit because this concentrate has very, very little. What it does do well is compliment a chocolate Oreo note.\r\n\r\n■ **INW Shisha Vanilla**\r\nDeepens the vanilla complexity of the shake by lending creamy emulsifying vanilla notes. Transforms the cream into a sweet ice cream.\r\n\r\n■ **CAP Super Sweet**\r\nAn axiomatic fact SS imparts sweetness. So yeah, that.\r\n\r\n■ **Make it Better**\r\nI like adding WS-23 @ .1% to add just a touch more cooling realism and a drop of saline .9% solution to help authenticize the cream.",
