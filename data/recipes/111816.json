    "description": "A light creme brulee on a buttery digestive biscuit base. \r\n\r\nI wanted to go for a creme brulee with my own twist so hope you like this offering. It's great as an ADV as it's not too rich yet still satisfying if you like custards with a biscuit bite.\r\n \r\n2.25% INW Creme Brulee and 1% INW Custard make up the brulee layer. INW Creme Brulee is a light semi-custard with promising hints of caramel but lacks body. INW Custard was used to boost things but kept low at 1% as it's too buttery and eggy higher up so clashes with the buttery biscuit base.  Finally, to top off the brulee layer, 1% FA Caramel adds a hint of that burnt, gritty, brown sugar glaze. \r\n \r\nTo add a light unobtrusive biscuit base, I went with an old-school  formula,  1% FA Cookie and 0.50% INW Biscuit. Wanted to avoid CAP Sugar Cookie as I'm sugar-cookied out of it at the moment and also rely on it too much. Normally, FA Cookie or INW Biscuit wouldn't be my thing as individual flavours, but they work well together when you want a hint of  buttery biscuit in your mixes.\r\n\r\nAs it stands, the biscuit base is semi-biscuity but still mediocre. It needs a kick so add 0.25% FA Breakfast Cereals and it tastes like a light nutty digestive biscuit. It's an extremely versatile flavour so well worth having in your mixing arsenal. \r\n\r\nOverall, the biscuit layer is light and sits in the background but manages to add butteriness and texture to the brulee without making it too rich.  \r\n\r\nFinally,  since it's a dessert and should be sweet, 0.35% FLV Sweetness. \r\n\r\nThis is lovely the next day but best after 3 days minimum; that's if you can hold out that long. \r\n ",
