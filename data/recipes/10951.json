I get a sort of foamy head, I’m guessing from the way the cupcake and meringue works in there. Turns out there’s more than one way to skin an effervescence. I still really prefer Barq’s root beer over A&amp;W and Mug, but if you’re an A&amp;W man or woman, this might hit the spot. The only thing I can say by way of critique is that it seems to vape a little warm for a root beer. FW is already short on wintergreen compared to other root beers and without it, this could use some cooling of some kind.  "
