  "name": "Strawberry Shortcake Milkshake",
  "description": "After a few iterations and some simplification another milkshake arose from the steep box. Sweet, simple, tinge of chocolate drizzle on a strawberry shake with lumps of heavy shortcake in it. Enjoy!\r\n\r\nIt's pretty straight forward. FW Yellow Cake is the perfect fit for a heavy, yet sweet cake, CAP sweet straw to match a strawberry syrup flavor, INW choco for that hint of chocolate syrup and Molinberry milkshake to give it body. I almost put some VBIC in or some cream, but with the cake it doesn't really need it. Feel free to add to this as you wish, :D \r\n\r\n14 day steep for it to really settle in and sweeten up.",
