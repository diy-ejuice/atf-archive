    "description": "When I first started vaping, I loved Smash Mouth by Humble. I tried to recreate that first love feeling and ended up creating something deeper. \r\n\r\nI tried using lower %s but it didn't come out quite right.  Feel free to lower or omit the sweetener. If you want it to be more authentic, in reality you would use 1.5 - 2%.\r\n\r\nGood off the shake but 3-5 days steeping is better as usual. I tend to mix my liquids as needed so I rarely steep anything more than a couple days.",
