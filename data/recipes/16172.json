  "description": "A fruit and yogurt cake parfait.\r\n\r\n\r\nCap creamy yogurt is at this high of a level to shine through the other bold flavors.\r\nIt adds a tartness that would be missing otherwise.\r\n\r\nLayered with cinnamon spice cake and fresh fruit.\r\nThe Fuji and ripe make this layer nicely.\r\nHoneysuckle adds a bit of depth and sweetness needed in this mix.\r\n\r\nThe strawberry is two fold in this recipe.\r\nthe Eythl malto in it helps to tame and smooth the cinnamon and yogurt, while not muting them.\r\nAlong with being a necessary flavor for this competition.\r\n\r\nDragonfruit juicifies the strawberry and Fuji while not changing the flavor of the mix much.\r\n\r\nLemon meringue pie helps pop the fruit a touch more while adding a subtle complexity to the yogurt and boosting out cinnimon crumble.\r\n\r\nSucrolose was NN 5% in VG.   \r\nThis is needed to finish taming the yogurt and not leaving a \"Dry\" feeling in your mouth from the Ripe and yogurt.\r\n\r\nIm sure you guys'll hate this, but  tried LOL.\r\n\r\nThanks for hosting this contest for everyone!\r\n",
