  "description": "So I wanted to create a perfect rhubarb and custard it really is one of my favourite desserts that sweet tart rhubarb and rich creamy custard really is the perfect combination. I did however put a slight twist on this simple dessert, I really like the outcome and I hope you do to. \r\nFrom the first vape you get the rhubarb with that creamy custard but the banknotes of what I added give it fresh flavour. It really does leave you wanting more and more.\r\n\r\nNOTES\r\n\r\nCap Vanilla Custard v1\r\n\r\nThis is the king of custards you really don't need to be told here it's the perfect flavour the Base that forms the rest of the recipe. 4.5% was perfect in this recipe I didn't want it to custard heavy I wanted the rest of the flavours to shine through while the custard still played it's part without taking over.\r\n\r\nINW Rhubarb \r\n\r\nI've only just got this flavour and boy was it worth the wait inawera really nailed this profile. It's crisp fresh bright maybe a little earthy maybe slightly sour but rhubarb is somewhat. Now this flavour is strong go to high and it completely takes over not in a good way it gets to bitter.0.5% is perfect it sits there nicely and does its told. You might think at such a low percentage it won't work but on the inhale it's the first flavour you notice and it lingers throughout which is where I wanted it.\r\n\r\nFA Bergamot / FA mandarin \r\n\r\nThis is part of the twist alongside the ginger which we'll talk about later. The mandarin and bergamot work with the rhubarb they kind of infuse the rhubarb and take it to another level. The bergamot is the rhine of the Orange kind of a zest while the mandarin plays the juice it's a very bright sweet juices orange that creates that effect, a very natural orange. The rhubarb and orange combination works really well together you notice the notes deep into the recipe and I'm really glad I found this combination. \r\n\r\nCapella gingerbread \r\n\r\nThis again is a twist it goes well again with cooked rhubarb and it also works well and melds into the custard. It sits in the background and you'll notice the gingerbread in the exhale. It gets interesting without turning anything weird it really makes you want more. I really wanted an authentic ginger for this part but gingerbread was all I had it was a shot in the dark but it works and ties in the rhubarb and the custard. \r\n\r\nFA Fresh Cream / FA Marshmallow / Tfa French Vanilla Creme \r\n\r\nThese 3 are the players for the custard mix you could probably get away with just using vanilla custard v1 and be done with but that's boring we want a custard with more depth. Let's add some fresh cream it's a great diary flavour that will cream up the custard without weighing it down but will add texture. We want an extra boost of vanilla in the custard like adding vanilla pods so let's add some French vanilla deluxe. It does what it says it's a pure vanilla yes it's got cream but who cares this will do the custard wonders. We have added vanilla but without adding any additional eggyness perfect! . The marshmallow is the glue it ties the custard together it adds some additional sweetness. \r\n\r\nSweetener \r\n\r\nI feel it needs just 1% you don't cook rhubarb without adding sugar it's the magic that takes away the sharpness from the rhubarb. It just wouldn't work without it.\r\n\r\nSo there's the notes mix this up you won't regret it. There are various subs you can use to create a similar profile or you can really strip this recipe back and make a completely simple version. \r\n\r\n",

Used 2% INW Custard instead of CAP VC to lower steep time. Lowerd CAP Ginger to 0.5%. Thanks a mill for sharing. Thought i'd never like rhubarb and custard as a vape.  By the way, love your notes. "
