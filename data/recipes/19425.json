  "name": "This ain't fool's gold tobacco",
  "description": "Started off as trying to clone Foo's gold from Gaslight vapor POH line, while it follows the same profile it's not a clone, but it's damn good and perfect for the cooler months. \r\nRich, smooth tobacco, creamy peanut butter, and oaty cookie notes to round it all out. Either with a cup of coffee in the morning or with some dessert after dinner it's a fantastic vape.\r\n\r\nRF oatmeal cookie is the raw extract, not the VG concentrate\r\n\r\nNotes in the November 2016 recipe thread\r\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/5am6a3/november_2016_recipe_thread/d9st1dq/",

You're right it's not like Foo's Gold, instead I get a delicious full flavored cigar with a creamy peanut butter exhale. TOP NOTCH! Well done Trevor. I will be ordering the needed flavors asap so I can have this in my daily rotation."
