  "description": "I was trying for a Sour green apple. Cap Green Apple and Inawara White Grapefruit combined gave me a tart apple. I used Double apple to give it a more fleshy apple, and cactus for the juiciness. Didnt get the sour apple but ended up with a pretty good tart apple. Added a bit of sweetener, not much, to round out reality.... hope you enjoy...feedback appreciated\r\n\r\nThis recipe was built for and tested on an Elder Dragon RDA 2.5 Stapled Clapton .17 ohm, at 65  watts",
