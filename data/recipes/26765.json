  "description": "Well I wanted a Biscuits and Jam recipe. \r\n\r\nStarted with the Biscuit. strong but not 100% strong so 1.8%\r\nNeeded more butter so FA Butter: .2% (yes it comes through on the steep)\r\nThen it needed more inner texture, but not too sweet of one so biscotto at 1% for that extra cookie/bready/texture. You won't really notice it other than \"hey this biscuit has layers\". Added some joy for a little extra breadyness and that minor sweetness it has mixes with:\r\n\r\nThe inside... I chose the shisha for it's jammy qualities (3%) but felt it needed a little more realistic strawberry to help it out so 5% ripe. Throw in a little vienna and cream fresh for that sweetness and (believe it or not the vienna helps the biscuit here because it is naturally \"fluffy\") you have a biscuits and jam.",

A buttery, flakey biscuit topped with strawberry jam.  The flavour and sweetness of strawberry ripe and the syrupy note from the shisha make a perfect jam. The the biscuit is just the perfect balance of butter and flake. When I ran out of fa joy I subbed in zeppola and it works great too. Highly recommend mixing this up. Great job Joe"
