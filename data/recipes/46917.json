  "name": "The Best Damn MadLad Lemonade",
  "description": "With the warm weather fast approaching, I decided it was time to drift away from the cream and bakery recipes I had been working on. MadLad Lemonade is a simple, summertime lemonade that works well on it's own, but has loads of versatility to add whatever extra fruit flavours you may want. Great as a shake and vape, give it 2-3 days to bring out the unique flavours sitting underneath LA Lemonade. As always, flavour notes below.\r\n\r\nLA Lemonade - the obvious choice for the lemonade base. This shit is just delicious. After a few days, the flavour starts to mellow out, and you are left with a very pleasant lemonade that is equal parts sweet and tart. Also, a pretty versatile concentrate, you can lower the percentage to get the lemonade to sit as an accent note. At 4.25, it holds up to the steep and keeps melding with the other flavours.\r\n\r\nFW Beetle Juice - HUGE shouts out to CaptainCannibal for his tireless work on his SHURB clone over the years. In his latest iterations, he noted that Beetle Juice was the missing ingredient. I had never tried this concentrate until now, but holy shit is it tasty. I typically have an aversion to concentrates that are meant to be a mix of flavours, because I typically would rather build up a complex flavour from scratch. But FW Beetle Juice is one of the rare exceptions to the rule. This shit is fruity, candy sweet, and imparts a slight mouthfeel reminiscent of sherbet. It adds a smoothness to the recipe that I can't get enough of. After 2 days of steeping, this flavour punches its way to the front and brings amazing notes of orange, sweet lime, and maybe even a touch of strawberry. I'd say you could do without if you don't have it, and just build those notes from other concentrates, but there is something magical about Beetle Juice, and it plays SO well in this recipe. 10/10, this is gonna be a new staple in my mixes.\r\n\r\nINW Cactus / FA Oba Oba - FINALLY, after a year of being told I need it for my fruit mixes, I have INW Cactus. Now, I don't believe it fully lives up to the hype surrounding it. While I do like it, and I do feel it brings a nice wetness to the fruits, I still hold FA Pear is the go to for that kind of emulsification. However, in this recipe, it works better than FA Pear. There aren't any off notes, and it just helps boost all of the other flavours in a way that pear just wasn't doing. FA Oba Oba is here to play with FW Beetle Juice. It pushes that mouthfeel a little further, and imparts a bit more citrus note to the mix, as a whole. These two are some must-haves if you're trying to do some citrus emulsification in your recipes.\r\n\r\nCAP Lemon Lime - I initially used FA Lemon Sicily to brighten up LA Lemonade, but it just wasn't doing what I wanted. Enter CAP Lemon Lime. In here, it helps the lemonade note hold up to the steep, while also adding a little touch of carbonation on the back end. It's not EXACTLY like carbonated lemonade, but that's not what I wanted. It just makes the lemonade feel even more refreshing and bright in a way that LS wasn't.\r\n\r\nFA Polar Blast - honestly, the TPA Koolada killer. Y'all know I like to add menthol to almost all of my fruit mixes. And I had been using Koolada for years. Polar Blast is \"just better\" -Shyndo 2017. It doesn't impart ANY flavour at all, there are no weird off notes when mixed with other concentrates, and it is actually a lot less harsh than Koolada is. This shit is great, and helps the lemonade feel cold. Mixing this with the CAP Lemon Lime really creates the feel that you're sipping on some freshly made lemonade.\r\n\r\nSo there ya go. I was gonna save this for my 1v1 with Vurve, but I didn't want to wait any longer to drop it. Mix it up, and play with different fruits to make it your own. Cheers.\r\n",

      "text": "I did make 1 sub as I didn't have lemon lime, I threw in .5% INW lime shisha + RF baja soda @ 6% (cuz its super weak).  I think it turned out nicely right off the shake.  I tried it both with &amp; without the ws-23, both are pleasant.  I love ws-23 but find that excessive vaping with it destroys my olfactory senses so its nice to find a light yet flavorful fruit vape that is good without it as well.  I like that the cactus in this is not overpowering or off-putting, even so, I think I'll lower it to half in the next mix... I kinda went crazy with that one when I first started mixing &amp; made myself sick of it to the point where I avoid it to an extent now.  I actually bought beetle juice for this recipe &amp; glad I did, its not what I would've expected &amp; look forward to playing more with it.  I agree that oba oba is one that you must have"
