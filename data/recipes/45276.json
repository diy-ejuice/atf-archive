  "description": "Cheeba Steeba and I have been working together to bring you another great recipe. This mix was inspired by a simple, real life desert I make in the summertime with cake, cream cheese, sugar, and peaches. The breakdown:\r\n\r\nFA Apricot - This adds another dimension to the peach flavor to give it a little more complexity\r\nFW Yellow Cake - is the main cake note in the desert\r\nLA Cream Cheese Icing - is the cream cheese and sugar mixture that gets baked into the dessert\r\nFA Liquid Amber - This flavor adds the much needed baked note to the peaches\r\nCAP Sugar Cookie - yellow cake needed some help and cap sugar cookie works with yc perfectly to add some body and weight to the cake portion without making it too dry.\r\nFLV Peach - is the main peach note, this is a great peach flavor, not nearly as harsh as some peach flavors can be, this makes the recipe vape-able right after a mix.\r\nFW Tres Leches - The hardest part of this mix was making a wet cake, and tres leches does a wonderful job of giving the cake a bit more weight while adding some creamy goodness to help the custard and cream cheese icing out\r\nFLV Vanilla Custard - this flavor is used to add some depth to the cream cheese icing and make it thicker and creamier.\r\n\r\nYou can vape this mix right after a shake but the whole thing comes together better after a few days to a week.",
