    "description": "This is a remix not a clone of FRYD e juice which is a deep fried Twinkie. A Deep Fried Twinkie is exactly what this is and I mean spot on. This is a strange recipe I suggest a 2 to 3 day steep but you only have about 2 weeks before it starts to fade. So I wouldn't make huge batches because a long steep doesn't help this recipe. Either way I think you will really enjoy this recipe!!!!!",
