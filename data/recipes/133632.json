    "description": "Edit - added LA cream cheese icing after competition.\r\n\r\nPrincess cake \u2014 or prinsesst\u00e5rta in Swedish \u2014 is a layer cake synonymous with Sweden that is covered in a hard topping of marzipan, which is usually green, giving the cake a unique look. Beneath the marzipan frosting are alternating layers of sponge cake, pastry cream, and whipped cream and often contains raspberry.\r\n\r\nFlavor notes for those who are flavor-nerd-ioligists. As taste is subjective this recipe is a ballpark of what I perceive to be acceptable. At the end of the day I hope that at least this combination of flavors will get you pretty close to this profile. \r\n\r\n**WF Princess Cake** is a concentrate that this profile is based on which from the manufacturers description is alternating layers of sponge cake, pastry cream, and whipped cream, topped with marzipan. \r\n**WF Angel Cake** is a  sponge cake with a buttercream flavor and it also carries a light berry note. The Angel Cake also work well with the  WF Buttercream Frosting. \r\n**WF Buttercream Frosting** is a delicate sugary buttercream frosting that needs some boosting from another cream.\r\nThe **WF Pistacio Cream** provides a boost to the buttercream and the creamy almond is bent towards a marzipan with the aid of FA Marzipan.\r\n**FA Marzipan** is used as a sweetener and adds nuttiness of sugar-glazed bitter almonds.\r\nThe **MB Pink Raspberry** provides a soft, lightly floral and tart contrast to the cake layers.\r\n\r\n #DIYDOWNUNDERDecemberCHALLENGE\r\n\r\nTested using a single coil RDA 60 Watts, 0.18 Ohms\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n",
