  "description": "This is my entry into the FLV Developed Challenge.\r\n\r\nIt's a light maple bar donut dipped in eggnog.\r\n\r\nFor the eggnog note I used FLV Eggnog at 1.7% you get a nice eggy spice forward note but it lacks a little cream so and I've added FLV Cream at 1% to give it a better dairy note.\r\n\r\nFor the maple bar I used FLV Maple Bar at 1.2% for a nice light fluffy dough with a little maple icing. This flavor adds a good amount of sweetness so I didn't feel I needed to add any more. What it lacks is a bit of density. I used FLV Vanilla Pudding at 1% to fill out the maple bar with some rich buttery goodness that I would expect from a doughnut.\r\n\r\nI initially thought I might put a little dilution of FLV Rich Cinnamon in here but decided against it as I thought it would distract from the mix. Its great the way it is, its nice and delicate and I didn't want a bold flavor like that in there. Let me know what you think. Should I have added the cinnamon?\r\n\r\nWatch the Video here:\r\n\r\nhttps://youtu.be/BhV_3z_Ncuk",
