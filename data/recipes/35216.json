At first it was frankly painful, that grape seemed to have a medicinal quality and I was taken aback. But I kept coming back to it and as my palate stretched, I began to become accustomed to the way it fits in here, and then pretty quickly started to really enjoy it. Now I don't see myself stopping until the whole bottle is empty!"
