    "description": "I created this for the DMC cinnamon challenge, but this recipe is delicious with or with out the cinnamon.  This is a bright juicy pear coated with a creamy butterscotch, caramel, and cinnamon.  Enjoy\r\n\r\nThe pear is comprised with the FA pear for the juiciness, the INW pear for the bite and texture, and the TPA quince to make it pop.  The coating is created by the FLV butterscotch teamed with the DC and rich cinnamon.  ",

Its one of those recipes that you don't have to vape through several mls to tell if its good, its a wow! on the first inhale...... its juicy then creamy, spicy and sweet on the exhale.  Its rare to find a mix that facilitates both juiciness and creaminess, often one takes over the other but this does it and the cinnamon makes the sweetness linger on the tongue a while longer.   Its vapable and delish right after a warm bath IMO.   Ill be mixing more for sure.  "
