  "description": "This is a collaboration recipe, there are so many people that worked on this recipe - from our viewers to the TFV team, I just want to thank everyone involved. Here are the related videos:\r\n\r\nhttps://youtu.be/DhWmleeFnP4\r\nhttps://youtu.be/2OvTG0lokh0\r\nhttps://youtu.be/TcdO1JO5HLI\r\n\r\nThis category was voted in by the people of Mixologist South Africa https://www.facebook.com/groups/519767141748186/ - we set out on a journey to create something unique with a tropical twist - and in this recipe, the team feels it has been achieved.\r\n\r\nThis is a perfectly blended tropical mango and pink guava juice, fused with sweet lychee and a touch of papaya, giving you a succulent juicy tropical explosion in your mouth hole. \r\n\r\nThe hero's being FE Mango & FLV Pink Guava. Initially you get a full on mango hit, followed by a sweet and lightly syrupy Litchi with a nice thick guava exhale - the Marshmallow helps with the mouthfeel of course. The element that was added to spin this whole concept into tropical realness was TFA Papaya - which puts a nice twist in the recipe.\r\n\r\nIn short - \"Tropical realness in your mouthole\"\r\n\r\nSweeten and cool to taste, we recommend 0.3% FW Sweetener & 0.5% ws23 (20% Dilution)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

But enjoyable over all"

      "text": "Brilliant addition of Papaya to give it that ripe tropical funkiness, but the cop-out marshmallow is just way to get out of putting the work in to balance that papaya just right and have it give all the base note you need, and it candies up the finish a bit, pulling away from the \"tropical realness\" a tad. Still, it's a lychee recipe that tastes pleasant, which is itself an accomplishment. "
