    "description": "This is a Greek Yogurt with Mango.\r\n\r\nTo create the mango I wanted I combined FLV Mango 3% with CAP Sweet Mango 1.5% and added 1% of CAP Juicy Peach to get a more authentic mouthfeel as a perfect ripe mango does. To tame down the sickening sweeteness CAP Sweet Mango brings to the mix I threw in 3% Golden Pineapple and .7% CAP Lemon Lime and these 2 flavors brighten up the mango flavor as well. CAP Lemon Lime has a dual purpose in this mix. It brightens up the Mango and it turns the FLV Cream and FA Cream Whipped into a Greek Yogurt. I have been experimenting with this for quiet some time and usually I would throw .4% of INW Cactus against it to turn it into a Greek Yogurt but in this recipe it affects the mango flavor too much. \r\nAs always .2% Super Sweet is optional and in this recipe not really necessary.\r\nIf you like your yogurt with some cereal in it, 2,5% CAP Cereal 27 does the trick.\r\n\r\nYou can vape it right away, but it takes 1 week to grow to it's full potential.",
