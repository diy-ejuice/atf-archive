    "description": "When I first saw the flavors, I thought oh crap, what am I supposed to do with that??? I thought about some of the crazy flavors that I could put together, but in the end I wanted something that would hopefully be delicious. Then I started thinking flavor combinations\u2026 What can I put together to make this tasty? Given the constraints of the contest, I know I'm going to do cinnamon strawberry apple something. I started out with the idea of a crisp, but given my limited mixing abilities, I knew there was no way that I could make this work with 3 other flavors. So I started a Google search with strawberry and apple and I came across this Polish pie recipe with meringue. I know, I know we're supposed to think outside the box\u2026 and I went Bakery!!! The pie itself looked DELICIOUS! I ordered in every combination that might work in this recipe, some meringues, pie crusts, butterscotches, caramels, etc\u2026 and then I came across Cocoon\u2026hmmm. Plenty of options to start with at any rate. Hey, this will help build my flavor base\u2026right? After multiple a few trials, I think I finally found something that others would also enjoy. Hopefully you'll enjoy this as much as I do!!!\r\n\r\nTLDR - Polish Pie cause I\u2019m a Pollock. \r\n\r\nIt needs a minimum of 4 day steep to really bring out all the flavors, I prefer a week. I don\u2019t use any of those newfangled steeping methods, but if you do\u2026have at it!\r\n\r\nFlavor Notes:\r\n\r\nCAP Cinnamon Danish Swirl \u2013 I used the 1st ingredient to give the apple cinnamon base I wanted the pie to have. I used it at this % so it gives a nice addition of cinnamon without overpowering the rest.\r\n\r\nJF Fuji \u2013 This apple gives a nice tart taste and really works well with the other ingredients. I used it at this % and I think it melds nicely at this ratio. Due to the Cocoon, I used a lower percentage so that the apple didn\u2019t overpower the rest\r\n\r\nTFA Strawberry Ripe \u2013This is a weaker strawberry so a higher percentage is needed. I just wanted a hint of strawberry instead of an in your face strawberry for the contest.\r\n\r\nFA Apple Pie \u2013 I preferred this as the crust. You can\u2019t have a pie without some kind of crust. I used it at this % and I think it gives you enough of the pie crust flavor without overshadowing the fruits.\r\n\r\nTFA Meringue \u2013 This was a harder one. I had to figure out the right amount to add without muting the other flavors but still adding that meringue flavor that makes this pie so special. I used TFA over FA as the TFA was less sweet and gave me more of an eggy taste like a real meringue pie.\r\n\r\nFA Cocoon \u2013 This was the kicker! This added a touch of the brown sugary caramely flavor that I wanted and a little apple flavor. \r\n\r\nSucralose \u2013 I only used .75% here. I think it helps with the sugary feeling you want with a bakery like this, without turning it into a candy.\r\n",
