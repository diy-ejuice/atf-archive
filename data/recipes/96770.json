    "description": "A very creamy vanilla pudding!  Sugar lips tasty.  I built the flv van pudding as the base because I love the flavor! I put more densness into it with the creamy milk OoO and marshmallow OoO.  Added the flv vanilla bean to give it more vanilla flavor and the DIY holy grail for the wonderful silky layer.  Then tipped off with a big dallop of Cap vanilla whipped cream.\r\n\r\nIts so yummy and velvety creamy that I can't stop vaping it!!  Its a snv and only gets more amazin with time!!  For best results give it 5-7 days for the creams to come together.  Its a must try if you like pudding!! I didn't add sweetener because I don't feel that it needs any, its perfectly sweet on its own.  ",
