    "name": "PINK DOVE (paloma cocktail -  pink grapefruit and tequila) ",
    "description": "Traditionally, the Mexican  Paloma is served on the rocks and prepared by mixing tequila, fresh lime juice and grapefruit-flavored soda, like Jarritos.\r\n In the US  -  the cocktail  is often made with Fresca or Squirt.  \r\n This mix is very very much like Fresca with a dash of tequila  and lime.  iIt is incredibly  refreshing and easily an ADV for me.  tested on the reload s  at 50 watrs.  \r\n\r\nThe combination  of citrus  soda,  honey pomelo and Pink guava really create a spot  on fresca soda off the shake \r\n**citrus soda** to me is a slightly flat  sprite  \r\n**Honey pomelo** is a ripe bright grapefruit with out the biting notes and is slightly  sweet \r\n**Pink guava** brings out more of the pink grapefruit notes and at this percent had  a very very light hop note which works with the  tequila \r\n**Lime Tahiti**  pushes those grapefruit notes  up top  and is noted on the inhale \r\n**Tequila agave** is  hard to describe but to me  it is very similar to  cactus  but slightly sweeter  and wetter .  it is smooth no harshness  or  booze in the least .  I am noting it more on the exhale\r\n**NOTE**  I  added a drop of  WS 23 and FLV sweetness   to  add vibrancy and sweetness to the soda .  CAP grapefruit could be  used around 7% instead of Honey Pomelo   but  it will have a slightly bitter tart note and leans more white grapefruit then pink \r\n",
