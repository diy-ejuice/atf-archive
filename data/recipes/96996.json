  "description": "Smooth homemade pudding with papaya chunks\r\n\r\nThey say TFA Papaya is too dank. They say it has too much butyric acid (which I hate.) They say use a different papaya! I like it.\r\n\r\nFLV Vanilla Pudding and FLV Cream are just delicious and to the point. Cream is one of the most interesting flavors I've tried. It's not exactly a realistic tasting cream to me, like FA Cream Fresh, but it tastes like a cream made specifically for vaping. ",
