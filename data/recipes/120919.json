  "name": "Sweet Popcorn Butter MTL/POD",
  "description": "I've got this pod thing I've been trying out recently, and all the top DIY pod recipes are fruity flavors, save one which I don't have ingredients for. I wanted to put a dessert into it (and have been digging Creme Brulee recently) so I made this. Using Yes, We Cheesecake with Creme was inspired by Ruderudi's Creme Brulee Cheesecake.  This is probably not a polished recipe, but the end result is a very thick and sweet dessert that's reminiscent of popcorn butter. \r\n\r\nWould recommend, I've been puffing on it for months and it's still good.\r\n\r\nedit: upped the creme brulee and sweetener, it's better",
