    "description": "Perfect amount of cinnamon spiced snickerdoodle cookie. Dry enough to define the cookie but wet enough with the butter in there to keep you coming back for more. Definitely a lip licker. Cookies are so hard to nail down but this exceeds the mark. Perfect off a shake, steep time isn\u2019t needed but doesn\u2019t hurt either.",

But this snickerdoodle one is probably the best thing I ever vaped! The cookie butter taste and cinnamon really knock it out of the park. I need to order more flv cinnamon crunch and make a 100ml of this asap. Almost vaped 40mls of this stuff since yesterday. First the 10ml tester than a 30ml bottle. When I stock up I'll definitely be making 2 bottles. 1 to steep and 1 to vape right away. But this time around I couldn't resist after the shake, it is that good"
