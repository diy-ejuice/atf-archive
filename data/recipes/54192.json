  "description": "AETHER(pronounced E-THER). This is my first in a series of recipe releases that I will be calling my \"Infinity Stone\" line. AETHER, the Reality gem, is the gem to manipulate reality. It is depicted in the Marvel Universe as a red gem. As such, I thought a strawberries and cream recipe would be an appropriate fit.\r\n\r\nNot much to mention on flavor notes, just a awesome strawberries and cream! Shake and vape but is best after a 3 day steep.\r\n\r\nPlease comment, mix, and or rate. Enjoy :)\r\nVisit Freedom To Mix on Discord https://discord.gg/SmSc8Ef\r\nVisit Freedom To Mix on FaceBook https://www.facebook.com/groups/415341418920740/ \r\n\r\n ",
