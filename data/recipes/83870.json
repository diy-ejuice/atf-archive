      "text": "This mix is pretty good, the Blueberry wild prob wouldn't have been my 1st choice.. But it works with this blend, you get the Blueberry light at first, and gets better thru the vape and on the exhale.. I would really have liked that it had some more depth to the BB, BUT.. The Lemon adds to that juiciness just right . I do like It very much. Great job BMV... Your on your way.... "
