  "description": "Strawberries and cream\r\n\r\nI have come a long way in the past 6 months as a mixer and felt it was time to revisit the profile. Fresh ideas and a better stash.\r\n\r\n(To anyone who suffered my old strawberry delight recipe, this is my apology)\r\n\r\nTo be begin with, I made a 10% dilution of FLV Alpine Strawberry with pg. Added 0.1g of that 10% dilution which equals out to 0.01% of actual flavor into my 10ml tester.\r\n\r\n4% tfa strawberry ripe really fills in the rest of the strawberry notes. It's also still my single favorite strawberry.\r\n\r\nNow, as for the cream and body, I went with a 1:1 FLV Cream and Marshmallow Vanilla which is good by itself but I found that it needed a bit of heaviness. Something to fill in the bottom. Custard really brought the more pudding-like cream that I really wanted for this.\r\n\r\nTime: To be honest, after mixing this up I forgot about it on the shelf. I finally remembered 12 days later. Protip: always write the date it was mixed up on the bottle because otherwise I wouldn't have known how long it had been there.",
