    "name": "Autumn in The Shire",
    "description": "*Years ago, in days of old, when magic filled the air, 'twas in the darkest depths of Mordor..*\r\nYes, the immortal rock gods of Led Zeppelin were also blatant Lord of the Rings nerds, with numerous references in lyrical content and song titles, so uh, if you don't enjoy Tolkien's masterpiece, let's take it up with them! \r\n\r\nOkay fanboying aside, leaves are turning and falling, apples and pumpkins are spontaneously erupting into the external world, logs are being burned, palettes are craving something appropriate to match the change in season. \r\n\r\nMay I humbly introduce this most Autumnal inspiration, an apple and butterscotch pipe tobacco, a flavor that immediately sent me flying through time, space and possibly dimensions into the coziest slice of land in all of Middle Earth. I could feel myself enjoying this as I rest on a nice patch of grass in the sunshine, or as I warm my feet beside the fire.\r\n\r\n\"Apples for walking, a pipe for sitting.\"\r\nThe apple is the center of this vape, strong upfront and carrying throughout, the tobacco note creeping in spicily and growing throughout the exhale, the rest of the cast build a nice background for this flavor to shine. \r\n\r\nAny thoughts, suggestions, tweaks, criticisms, etc are most welcome as always.

            "text": "I was also brought to this recipe by my love of Tolkien and Led Zeppelin! This recipe does not disappoint. I first tried it in my e-pipe cuz hobbits smoke pipes. I loved it in the e-pipe, but it is more of a mtl device. My everyday vaping is sub-ohm all the way. It was a wonderful apple tobacco dessert vape in the pipe. But then I mixed some for my sub-ohm tanks and omg! This is one of my all time favorite recipes. Crisp apples, rich tobacco, and smooth butterscotch tied together by creamy custard. It is truly divine and one of my top five recipes of all time. You are seriously missing out if you have not tried this gem. This should have been recipe of the year imo. And if I had discovered it earlier I would have nominated it. I absolutely believe this is the most underrated recipe in the diy community. I am inspired to create a Shire recipe for every season. With winter just around the corner (Winter is Coming), that's where I am starting.  I will definitely be giving you props when I release it. I will be plastering it all over Reddit and linking to it in all of my Shire recipes. Thanks for this little hidden gem! "

            "text": "So, quote Zeppelin, you have my attention. Bring up the Hobbit, you have my full attention. Then you drop this interesting looking little gem. So, I had to gather up the goods and give it a whirl.&#xD;\n&#xD;\nStraight up, it's like eating a butterscotch frosted apple danish right after having a pull off a pipe. The buttery, sugary flakey topping mixed with carmalized apples is just so damned good, I'm amazed neither Cinnabon nor the state fairs (looking at you, Washington!) have come up with this. The cinnamon wafts together with the pipe tobacco and gives you a dense, rich taste aroma that makes me think of hanging with my great grandfather that summer in Maine, and that was almost 30 years ago, man. The vanilla ice cream gives you the creamy goodness that all those plates of apple pie a la mode have made me just come to expect with apple, and the custard enriches the mouthfeel. Just a lovely, dense, fully flavorful vape.&#xD;\n&#xD;\nIf this is what autumn is supposed to taste like, no wonder it's my favorite season.  Can't wait to see what this is like in the MTL, because it's apple heaven up in my dripper.&#xD;\n&#xD;\nTotally a tobacco for people who think that they don't like tobaccos, and enough tobacco in there to please a tobacco head, yet present a lovely vape.&#xD;\n&#xD;\nNice one!"
