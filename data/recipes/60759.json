  "name": "Olympia - An addictive Blueberry Crumble",
  "description": "If you fancy a blueberry vape, you should give this recipe a try\r\nAfter making several experiences with various blueberry flavors, I went with this combo. Is fruity, bright, authentic. And the FA Blackcurrant just blends the fruit layer.\r\nIt wasnâ€™t easy no reach to a crumble, but Iâ€™m very happy with the final result. The TPA Pie Crust merges very well with the cookies.\r\nThe FA Nut mix is the final touch to the recipe.\r\nGive it 5 days steep.\r\nVisit DIY MIXERS CREW on Discord https://discord.gg/3K56qB\r\nFollow DIY MIXERS CREW on FaceBook https://www.facebook.com/diymixers/\r\nJoin DIY MIXERS CREW on Facebook https://www.facebook.com/groups/456512471380574/\r\nWatch DIY MIXERS CREW LIVE on YouTube every Sunday at 4:30 pm EST https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC1ENB0bSNrG_1KETYwZ154g\r\nPlease remember, smoking is dead, vaping is the present, mixing is the future ðŸ˜Š\r\n",
