  "description": "**Chocolate Cookie Pudding**\r\nThis is just delicious. This is one of my favorite recipes so far I have created using **Flavorah**. Two ingredients that I have fell in love with now, and see they are well under rated, **Beer Nuts** and **Biscotti**. Biscotti is a flavor that if you use it too high, it will probably take over your recipe, but if you use it just right it is a beautiful flavor. I almost would suggest making a dilution of this flavor. In this recipe I only use .06% which is 1 drop in a 30 ml bottle. But that little drop is such a punch if flavor.  \r\n\r\nA great addition if you have some saline, add .25% of saline to the mix.  This really helps to bring the nutty notes forward and the bakery.  \r\nEnjoy.  \r\n\r\n\r\nFB FlvFan Page https://www.facebook.com/FLVFan/\r\nΩhm Grown Alchemy https://www.facebook.com/groups/ohmgrownalchemy/\r\nMixing in the Kitchen https://www.facebook.com/groups/425650464915364/\r\n\r\nYouTube\r\nMixing in the Kitchen:\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCpzG9vsIgaCUzHVrUMHiV_g\r\nΩhm Grown Alchemy:\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCDi_UubimriLWjel5Hr0pIA\r\n\r\nThis was tested on multiple RDA'S, Entheon @.18ohm 42 watts and Wasp Nano @.35 ohm 55 watts.  \r\n \r\n",
