    "description": "As summer weather hits it's peak here, I like to have a nice bright tobacco to relax after a hot day. This recipe is sure to carry you well into colder weather, as fall approaches in the coming months.\r\n\r\nThe FLV Red Burley and FLV Cured Tobacco is a proven tobacco base that's malleable enough to fit nearly any full bodied tobacco blend. FLV Kentucky Blend adds bright and spicy top notes to the base, and FLV Lovage helps tame any dry notes and adds a moist pipe blend type finish.\r\nTop if all off with a bright bourbon from TPA Kentucky Bourbon and you have a tobacco blend that's sure to please. Enjoy!",

I enjoyed this as a SnV after I warmed it up a bit, but it balances out after a few days steep, and the bourbon really blends in nicely.  Well done!"

I mixed a Kentucky Blend-based bourbon tobacco [Two Kentuckies] because I loved that pairing and only used a touch of Red Burley because I didn\u2019t want Red Burley\u2019s nuttiness to get in way of it. Later I made a bourbon-PB blend [Retaliatory Tariffs] because I liked the bourbon and PB played together. This is almost like putting those to recipes together, and it\u2019s better than either of them. I get a lot of nuttiness from the Red Burley but it teams up so well with the splash of bourbon on top. Love this bold, full tobacco flavor and the Lovage makes it moist and pleasant to vape without making it soggy and gross. "

            "text": "Wow. First off, I mixed this on a whim because I am leaving on vacation in a week and wanted a strong tobacco to mature while I am gone. I have vaped enough testers to know that I like lovage and what it can do to a profile like this. I ALWAYS try a tobacco off the shake and then NEVER again until the recommended steep time is over. HOLY MOTHER OF GOD. Period. I love bold tasting mixes. I loved strong tobaccos when I smoked. I don't enjoy subtle mixes where the wisps and tendrils of a slight bakery mixes with the slight egginess of a fluffy custard. I like a flavor to be what it is and to remind me on every pull. That, of course, doesnt mean that I dont enjoy complexity or magic! This one has promised OFF THE SHAKE! I will be back in 7 days like a boy ready to shoot my eye out on christmas to report how everything has settled into its new role of providing smoky lovage to my palette. Im starting with 5 stars because this recipe is the promise of 2nd base while I was just flirting, hoping it wouldn't run away in disgust.&#xD;\nupdate: been vaping this on and off for a while now but recently settled in and really enjoyed it. After a long steep this is a solid vape. The tobacco is bold and the bourbon sits strongly on top with no gimmics. mix this one."

Either way, solid recipe.  I wish more \"tobacco\" flavors were as authentic as Flavorah.  Nice job on this blend!"

But you make it work well in here it definitely moistens up the tobaccos. The bourbon is a nice touch as well. Like shyndo said this well probably destroy my alien coil and ill more than like have to scrub down my Type R atty but it is well worth it "

At 1 week this stuff is full-flavored in your face tobacco but it still manages to have little nuances and spices that change every single time you take a puff. I may be a glorified man-baby but this recipe makes me feel like Burt FUCKING Reynolds! I want to put on my smoking jacket and talk about my sexual escapades just from the experience this mix gives me. If I could rate it higher than 5 stars I would!"

But the bearded wizard pulls it off again! Lovage really seems to be doing some magic here. It's taming the tobaccoo while still keeping the full flavor, if that makes since. Definitely mixing a large batch of this one next, the 30ml I mixed yesterday is almost gone ;)"
