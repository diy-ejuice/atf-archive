Foreground is the fruit mix (here normal People will probably taste strawberry) and on the backend it gives a super nice tropical vibe with the pineapple + coconut combination. I really enjoyed this vape and the missing star is not because any lack of taste but my inability to rate this accurate due to not tasting strawberry."
