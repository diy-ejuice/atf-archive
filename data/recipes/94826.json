As attractive as 1-2-3 recipes are, some percentages are best changed to fit different situations (coming from someone who loved the shit out of Cranberry Sprite)."

A nice healthy dose of WS-23 and a touch of sugar daddy sweetener turns this into something I cant put down. This recipe, as well as shyndos mango sticky rice, helped me use up my tester bottle of coconut candy, of which now I have to replace with a much bigger bottle. Thanks for the awesome recipe, its earned a spot in my top 5 for sure."

I bought the VT fizzy sherbert just for this, I mixed it up today and filled the tank up and I am impressed just how close it is. Very nice coconut Sprite flavor, the back end is almost that fizz that you get when drinking the real thing. The 3 flavors meld together very well to give you that ocean water taste. Great job! "

      "text": "This is a really refreshing spring recipe. The soda base is crisp and has that almost carbonated bite to it. Coconut Candy is perfect here: it doesn’t overpower anything but it slides in right at the end of the exhale to remind you it’s a coconut vape. From what I can remember, it tastes pretty darn close to actual drink. Simple, tasty, and fun. Good job, Dave!"
