  "name": "Coconut ICE",
  "description": "  This  is a  pretty simple profile of a bright candy coconut on the inhale that transitions to a fleshy creamy coconut on the exhale.  It is  a solid  shake and vape  but best at 5 days     tested on a relaod RDA  with alien coil.15 at 55 watts   \r\nSo  coconut  Ice is a real thing  it is a creamy coconut  type candy    that is usually made with condensed  milk, coconut and icing sugar.  Sometimes cream of tartar  is used for a slight citric acid  .   The  pink coloring is just  food coloring. \r\n\r\nThe **coconut candy** is a bright candy type of flavor that  is supported by the VT desiccated coconut  for that bit of coconut body \r\n**Frosting** is used for the icing sugar note and works well here with a touch of vanilla \r\nThe **condensed milk and vanilla swirl** working to add the creamy texture of this mix, with out overpowering the coconut forward  notes \r\nThe  **Sour lemon** is just to add some brightness and pop out  the sweetness in this mix, it not meant to be noticed but is an accent here  , some actual recipes  will use a cream of tartar in the actual candy creating bit of citric acid in the mix \r\nit is pretty sweet  so add sweetener to taste -  but it is a candy  and  I would recommend using cap super sweet at .30  to .50\r\n\r\n**SUBS**:   condensed milk is pretty much   the only condensed milk  I can recommend   - but you could use a  heavy  sweet cream, like FLV sweet cream, Cap Sweet cream or FLV Cream.   If you like  more of  a punch of coconut you can use  FLV sweet Coconut.    VT sour   it is not really needed here  but you could use  TPA tart and sour at around .30  to .50  \r\n\r\n   Facebook - https://www.facebook.com/groups/diydownunder/\r\nDiscord - https://discord.gg/kH4Fqbc\r\nYoutube - https://www.youtube.com/c/diydownunder\r\nWebsite - https://www.diydownunder.com/",
