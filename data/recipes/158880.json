  "description": "Thanks to staybert and everyone on the diy_ejuice Discord for their help and support.\r\n\r\nThis recipe started out as an experiment with FLV Creme de Menthe. After SFTing it I wanted to make a recipe that tasted like Andes mints. Then, I got some VT flavors, and after SFTing them decided to try using them to get the missing cream and chocolate.\r\n\r\nThis recipe will taste pretty boozy and not too pleasant for the first few days after you mix it. It's pleasant by three days and comes together a bit more after a week - the harshness of the mint fades away over time.",
