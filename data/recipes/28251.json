  "description": "I wanted to mix INW Cactus into CAP sugar cookie and make something tasty. After quite a bit of work, I managed to create a warm, soft, cactus cookie with a sugar glaze. Full recipe notes here: https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/5rybyl/phucker_cookies/\r\nThis balancing act requires some patience, so give it 10-14 days to steep.",
