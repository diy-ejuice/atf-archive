    "description": "**Mixed berries, no creams or bakeries**\r\n\r\nUsing forest fruit as a building block will get you a 'decent at worst' result 90% of the time. With as much as it has going on, I only needed a couple berries to push into a bit of a new direction while still keeping the heart of the vape distinctly forest fruit. Wanting to get a little more saturated currant flavor up front, sweet currant was an easy grab. Blueberry juicy ripe is a flavor that I've beeen digging for awhile and it pairs nicely with the sweet currant. The dragonfruit is used at a 1 percent to add a little background note while also blending this whole thing into a tasty mixed berry profile. I like it with a quarter percent sweetener and mix every other 30ml with 1% ws23 but feel free to dress it up how you like.\r\n\r\nThis can be vaped off the literal shake and you will get a delicious currant and blueberry forward vape, 24 hrs and it starts to meld together.",
