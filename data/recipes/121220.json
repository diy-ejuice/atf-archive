  "description": "With the weather changing and the holidays not too far off, I wanted to start working on some seasonal recipes. The first that was on my mind was a nice spiced vanilla cream. \r\n     As much as I love custards, I didn't want to go down that road, I wanted something different. What I envisioned was a creamy vanilla, and just kissed with a bit of spiced. Like if you were to take a thick vanilla icing and add a holiday spice blend to it, and after working on different bases, I was able to create one that gave me what I wanted.\r\n\r\n**Bavarian Cream & Vanilla Pudding:**\r\nReally make a nice thick base for this to set on with a that plays right into the profile.\r\n\r\n**French vanilla deluxe:** \r\nIf you're ever looking for a rich vanilla that can punch through a heavy base, I suggest trying it in your next recipe. It's not that vanilla TFA uses in other flavors like VBIC or swirl, it's different and perfect in something like this where you want a vanilla to stand out while adding a thickness...that isn't a custards.\r\n\r\n**VT Buttercream Frosting:** \r\nThis is a wonderful flavor, and at 1.5% I was able to get the flavor out of it to blend with the cream base. There's room to go higher, but I wanted to keep it even with the next star of this, and that's the Milk & Honey. These together add such a great element to this mix. You get that Frosting note I was looking for and a sweet richness that goes well with the cream. \r\nNow this all by itself is honestly very good and could be an ADV for me... however, I wanted spiced vanilla cream. \r\n\r\n**FLV Eggnog**\r\nThe easiest part of creating this was which spice to use. FLV does spices better than anyone, and eggnog is no exception. It's not crazy potent like clove or rich cinnamon and 1% here gives me a smooth spice kissed vanilla cream. It doesn't turn this into an eggnog by any means, so don't think that at all. I used my vanillas and creams carefully so this didn't happen. There's no egg, we only got the spices from it here and it's delicious!\r\n\r\nSweeten to taste. I mix with 1% FW sweetener but you can adjust. I do suggest a little for the profile though.\r\n\r\nLet it set for at least 5-7 days, it allows the creams get in place and the spice to smooth out and warm up.\r\n\r\nI hope anyone that mixes this enjoys it as much as I've been\r\n",
