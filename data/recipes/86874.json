  "description": "This is my attempt to create a blueberry version of DIYORDIE's Strawberry Jam Monster thus, again, all credit to Wayne.\r\n\r\nFW Blueberry: Even though this is a more candy-like flavoring, I just needed its blue sweetness and a bit less of its flavor so as to not step over the blueberry in RF's Blueberry Jam w/ Toast, therefore, I opted to keep it at 5%...but you can bump it to 6-7% if you prefer and you will get a very bright blueberry.\r\n\r\nRF Blueberry Jam with Toast: I originally had this flavoring at 2% but I have since dropped it a half percent (compared to the Strawberry version).  The blueberry in here is sooooooo \"jammy and bakery\" so I can see myself using it in a blueberry pie or cheesecake profile...we'll see how well the grainy part can be bent into a crust.\r\n\r\nCAP Golden Butter: I tried this mix with TPA Butter as well but it just works/tastes better with CAP...at least to me.\r\n\r\nCAP Super Sweet: at higher VG, I like it at 0.25% for a bit more vividness but it's up to you as always.\r\n\r\nWell, there you have it...it's not original but it's super tasty and blueberry > strawberry for me any day xD\r\n\r\nEnjoy!\r\n\r\nNOTE: the blueberry flavoring is not in the database so I picked blackberry...but it's blueberry just so you know.\r\n\r\nPS.  I'm not 100% sure how to License this so if I have to make changes to it, please, let me know.",
