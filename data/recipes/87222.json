  "description": "Who doesn't love a huge plate of pancakes!\r\n\r\nWF Crepe SC: This is a really clean, simple pastry/bakery flavor. It isn't heavy on maple like most pancake flavors currently available. It's very smooth, but lacks a slight bit of texture I wanted to hit pancakes. We boost the breadiness using FW Hazelnut at .5% to keep the actual hazelnut flavor to a minimum while accentuating the crepe flavor.\r\n\r\nFW Blueberry: You could use any fruit you like on your pancakes here. Since our syrup flavor is not a maple flavor you have a lot of room for creativity. I chose FW Blueberry because it's good enough to stand on it's own without needing additional layers, making for a simpler recipe.\r\n\r\nVT Golden Syrup: This is the real star of the show. It's thick, got a great sweetness to it, and it adds a beautiful butter texture that I don't think I've found anywhere else. It really reminds me of that bite from the middle of the pancake where the butter and syrup sat there together for awhile. There's no maple here, just gooey buttery sweetness that is really addicting.\r\n\r\nFA Vanilla Classic: A nice vanilla finish is a welcome presence in nearly every bakery flavor, especially pancakes. This gives the whole recipe a bit of boost in softer sweetness and a bit of body to the overall profile.\r\n\r\n",

      "text": "Stellar recipe. This promises a heaping plate of pancakes covered in blueberry syrup and boy does it deliver! I get exactly that, a gooey syrupy slightly buttery blueberry bite and a soft fluffy bakery. This belongs in a textbook under how-to mix with both the VT Golden Syrup and the WF Crepe. I can't say this recipe needs any tweaks at all, but because I personally get tired of tasting blueberry over time, I'm interested in trying the rest of the recipe out with other fruit flavors that are already a little syrupy. INW Shisha Strawberry is the first one that comes to mind, probably at that same 2%. It's certainly not necessary for enjoying the recipe, but I might also like to experiment with \"cooking\" these flapjacks a little longer by adding something like 1% or less CAP Sugar Cookie or Cereal 27, or if I wanted to really go after crispy-edged pancakes, maybe a 0.5% or less addition of FA Cookie.
