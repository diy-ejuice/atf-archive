    "description": "This is my grapple!! A grapple is a grape flavored Apple. I have tried so many fruit combinations in the last few days. I finally decided to build a fruit or a genetically modified fruit lol. I chose Fuji by flavor art for my apple I used it at 3 percent because it was the right amount to allow all the aspects to come through without making you forget that it is an apple first and foremost. For the grape flavor of the grapple I used inawera grape. I used inawera grape at 1 percent because its a strong flavor and if I wenrt any higher it would over power the whole mix and you would forget that this is a grapple not a grape. I used inawera cactus at .35 percent because  it  add's  a certain juiciness  texture and feel to the flavor. I may have gone the wrong direction but no guts no glory.\r\n",

I think I would enjoy this more with Cap double apple and FA pear vs the cactus and fuji, but that is my profile.  For a 3 flavor recipe it is simple to mix any many will like it.  So it still gets 4 stars"
