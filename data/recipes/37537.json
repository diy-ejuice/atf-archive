  "description": "This is my second recipe in my healing stone line of recipes. Now I'm not into healing stones at all, but I'm enjoying making out of the box recipes and profiles so I'm going to continue down this path!\r\n\r\nCitrine is a joyful stone with bright energy which lights up many aspects of lives of those who work with it. It has energies of good fortune and good luck, though these may appear in unexpected ways.\r\n\r\nCitrine is a fabulous stone to use to combat negative energy of any kind by breaking them up and dissipating them. \r\n\r\nCitrine is a happy stone. It can bring happiness to the person who carries or wears it. Because of its removal of negative energy and its own bring positivity, it can relieve depression, self-doubt, anger, and irrational mood swings.\r\n\r\nCitrine is used to reduce self-destructive tendencies.  Citrine can help overcome emotional traumas and grief that may lead to these emotionally self-destructive issues. \r\n\r\nTaking this into consideration I wanted to embody the bright orange/brown color, bright in your face vibe, and sunshine type feeling. I wanted to create a well balanced orange, citrus, fruit vape with some dark and earthy notes.  I can taste orange, grape fruit, mango, and apricot all nicely balanced.  I used liquid amber and FA carmel together to give is a sweet, earthy, and over ripe note.  I used the TFA Quice to bolster everything together and give it a fruity zip.  This one took a while to balance out, but I'm thrilled with the result.  ",

      "text": "Mixed this up about 3-4 days ago and I must say I'm pretty impressed. Deweys Amethyst recipe set the bar pretty high but Citrine definitely did not miss the mark. I did have to sub the sicilian mix with grapefruit FA at 0.75% and the FW blood orange for FAs version at 0.75% as well, as per Deweys recommendations. Overall I get a mixture of flavors reminiscent of marmalade. Its very unique and tasty! Like Amethyst, this recipe captures the Citrine description and imagery and translates it perfectly into flavor. I get the bright and bitter grapefruit upfront, followed by the bright and sweet citrus notes of mandarin wrapped in the sweet pear-like quince. The apricot follows closely just a bit lower in the recipe and not quite as present, yet still fairly detectable. The mango is also not quite as present but I believe it is mainly there to flesh out the predominantly thin citrus nature of this recipe. The blood orange seems to be mainly mingling with the liquid amber and caramel to create a deep cooked/preserved orange base. The marshmallow creates a nice light and fluffy white base for all of these flavors to lay upon. Another well crafted recipe. Definitely worthy of a mix if you are into complex and unique fruit vapes. Also, for being a mainly citrus mix the throat hit is almost non existent which is a huge plus for me. I am very much looking forward to that last healing stone recipe to drop! Keep doing what you're doing!"
