    "description": "CAP Sugar Cookie and JF Cookie create an authentic and flavorful cookie base. CAP Sugar Cookie was the perfect choice for that gooey part of the cookie and the JF Cookie adds that baked cookie note.  CAP Cinnamon Danish Swirl adds the cinnamon to the top note of the snickerdoodle cookie. TFA Vanilla Swirl helps add a creamy and eggy flavor to the mix. This is a simple and yet delicious recipe I have been working on this one for a while now trying to find the prefect and most authentic cinnamon \/ snickerdoodle cookie that I could create. I love these cookies and I believe I finally found the perfect combination that works for me. Mix it up, rate it, and leave your feedback. Thanks SAMUEL!!!!!!!!!!! ",
