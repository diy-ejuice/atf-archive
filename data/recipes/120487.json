  "description": "A generous scoop of vanilla ice cream drowned with a shot of espresso and a trickle of chocolate...\r\n\r\n*The Espresso*\r\nAlthough my coffee base is strictly speaking not an espresso, I believe that this combination provides the full bodied coffee base which encapsulates the very best coffee has to offer. Until such time that someone creates a better coffee/espresso alternative, this will remain my go-to...\r\nMF coffee, to me, is the pinnacle of all coffee concentrates and provides an authentic, robust coffee taste, boosted (pun intended) by a touch of FA Booster (tiramisu). I fell in love with this combo when I fist experienced Marietta by @RuntDastardly and have never looked back!\r\n\r\n*The Ice Cream*\r\nMy go-to combo of LB VIC and HS FVIC is the perfect adornment to receive the dark, rich and smooth coffee shower. This combo combined the very best of CAP and TFA VBIC and unites them in a creamy, scrumptious union... Period.\r\n\r\n*The Chocolate*\r\nMB Glamour chocolate is the final touch and it sweetens our ensemble just a tad...  The cocoa notes in the chocolate compliments the natural cocoa notes in the coffee beautifully and balances the  overall taste experience. \r\n\r\nThis baby requires at least a 2 week hibernation, more if possible, for the coffee to adequately meld with it's new friends...\r\n\r\nSubs\r\nMF Coffee - Not recommended but FA Dark Bean (espresso) at 0.5 or INW Coffee at 2% can be used as an suitable alternative \r\nMB Glamour Chocolate - JF Milk Chocolate at the same %\r\n",
