  "description": "Just a nice play on some not so commonly used berries. It is a good blend of flavors leaving a green accent behind to keep you guessing. It's a little weird a bit strange and a lot berry but that's what I wanted something different for my palate. It is Berrylicious!!!!!! What do you think???? I realize this is a rather pricey $$$$$ mix. It is nothing like my normal recipes and I wouldn't rush out to buy the ingredients but it is a good use of these somewhat weird flavors. I hadn't been able to use alpine strawberry up to this point. I was more or less trying to utilize alpine strawberry in a mix.",

This is more along a dark berry flavor, though you do have the Alpine picking up a lot of the bright notes you need here and the touch of sweetness is delicious. A wonderful use of Alpine Strawberry"
