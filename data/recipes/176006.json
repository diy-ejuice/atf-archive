  "description": "Full warm nutty pleasure for all.\r\n\r\nI find RY4 too harsh/chemical/mothballish even steeped for ever. On the contrary, this satisfies my nutty cravings, without being too tobacco forward or custardly wrong.\r\nINW Tobacco Tobacco Symphony is a nutty semi-tobacco (no leaf or ash), tobacco non-lovers will appreciate. Pumped up by:\r\n- Dx Peanut Butter - the most realistic, but little bodied\r\n- Peanut Butter - brings it out forward, not letting it fade\r\n- INW Shisha Vanilla - the base, rounds it off giving body and a touch of sweetness.\r\n\r\nClear as water - will not gunk your coils, which is a great plus!\r\nNeeds little steep, 2 days to come together, but can be S&V.\r\n",
