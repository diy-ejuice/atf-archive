    "description": "Here it is! \r\n\r\nCinnamon Apple Waffle Cookie Thingy!\r\n\r\nSo this is based on my Waffle Butter Cookie Thingy recipe, y'all gave me some great advice and I listened.\r\n\r\nI subbed Butter Cream with CAP Sweet Cream this go round, and I dropped the percentage down to 1%.\r\n\r\nI also lowered the Brown Sugar signifcantly to .5%, it's much better this way. I formally apologize for anybody's throat that may hurt from using Brown Sugar so high the last go round.\r\n\r\nBig thanks to MlNikon (Emily) for suggesting the PUR Country Apple (and being the best mixer on planet earth, seriously check out her recipes!). This flavor is amazing. I wish I would have found it sooner.\r\n\r\nIf you want to see the reasoning for using the rest of the flavors just check out my first Waffle Cookie Thingy recipe. \r\nIt's good if you add a drop or two of CAP Super Sweet, but doesn't really need it if you don't want it. \r\n\r\nThis recipe (unlike the other iteration) is made to be an ADV, not just to be able to vape with the morning cup of joe. It's much lighter, fruit forward, and actually maybe even more delicious.\r\n\r\nAny feedback is greatly appreciated if you can: inbox me, leave a review.... anything. I appreciate feedback and pointers very very much and everybody's advice and criticisms help me out ALOT. Thanks guys, hope you enjoy as much as I do. ",
