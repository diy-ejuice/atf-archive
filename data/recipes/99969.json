  "description": "This is a Boston Banana Cream donut.\r\n\r\nThe Donut : to create the donut we use Capellas donut combo in conjunction with fw cookies and cream to help it out with the doughnut and to push up and balance the chocolate part of the vape.\r\n\r\nThe filling: simple we use tpa banana cream and Fa meringue to create the impression of a sweet banana filling.\r\n\r\nAnd last one sweetener for me if you're going to try to recreate a sweet profile the most effective way to make it is to use sweetener, (if you want to make a real sweet lemonade, you squeeze the lemons put it in a glass ad water and a spoon of sugar, you surely can use honey and other ingredients to make it sweet but for me a spoon of sugar works great IMO),  I use tpa because is easy to use cap super sweet is great but is really sweet and for the amounts that I mix is pretty hard to nail the perfect sweet in a recipe, so I give up, and use tpa is more forgiven .\r\n\r\nKeep mixing!\r\n",
