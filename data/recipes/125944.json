  "description": "A tantalisingly refreshing, chilled, fresh mandarin vape...\r\n\r\nAnother addition to my Icee range,  this time in the form of a lesser renowned citrus champion, the humble Mandarin. This mix celebrates this unique citrus varietal which is less sour but sweeter and more flavourful than it's well know brother/sister/cousin, the Orange.\r\n\r\nFA Tanger is the star of the show and treated as such. It is an authentic representation of a fresh, sweet tangerine in all it's glory. There is a tinge of zest present which adds a stunning 'bite' when you least expect it.\r\n\r\nCap Sweet Tangerine keeps FA honest and prevents it from being too linear by boosting the sweetness a tad. Combined, these two provide an full burst of tangerine goodness!\r\n\r\nThe FA Cream provides some body & creaminess, allowing the fruit to show their full potential.\r\n\r\nWS23 cools everything down without detracting from the stars of show. Feel free to start the WS23 off at 0.50% and adjust up if required.\r\nSub WS23 with Koolada at your preferred % if preferred.\r\n\r\nGive this baby 3 days or so and she is ready to pop! \r\n",
