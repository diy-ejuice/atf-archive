    "description": "This is a sweet full  creamy  vanilla almond cheesecake with a touch  a candied black cherry.  \r\nOn the inhale you get a full sweet almond vanilla cream  with a touch of  black cherry and   finishes with a almond note that lingers \r\nThis is  vapable off the shake  but   really comes together at 5 - 7 days    as the creams really come out\r\ntested on reload  RDA with alien coil at 70 watts \r\n\r\n**WF almond custard**  is a lovely full mouth   non  eggy custard   with a light  almond  that  is present on backend , adds to the  body and almond notes of this mix \r\n**Vanilla chesecake custard and Yes we can cheesecake**  make the cheesecake filling of  this mix .   They work  well together for a  more lush  creamy style   cheesecake rather then a true Italian cheesecake .  The vanilla  is a top note that is perfect with the cherry and almond as it is supportive  and not overpowering here \r\n\r\n**Graham Cracker and Almond Cookie**  are used to create the  crust for this square .  FW graham cracker is  true grainy  honey graham cracker and one of my favorites .    When combined with the almond cookie  for some more of the  buttery shortbread cookie works well for the  bakery base of the square\r\n\r\n**Marzipan**  by FA is   used to really boost that almond  note ( almost like an amaretto liquor)   and add some intrinsic sweetness -  if you want to pull out  more of the cherry note  more use INW marzipan which can have a slight  candied cherry note ",
