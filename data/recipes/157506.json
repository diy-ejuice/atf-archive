  "description": "A bowl of frosted fruity cereal with sweet rich milk\r\n\r\nA cereal recipe made up of concentrates which are not affiliated with cereal according to their title, WF berry cobbler is a perfect modern day replacement for TFA berry crunch cereal, at 6% it provides the perfect soft berry note behind a decent chunk of AP, the lemon from the lemon squares is a really nice lemon flavour and not overpowering although does sit at the front of the fruity side of things to give that cereal vibe and also provides good mouthfeel for a cereal that’s been sitting in milk for a minute or too. The cornbread works in a similar way and has the extra pro of adding a touch of dried/cooked corn to the whole thing really twisting it in the direction of a cereal... the meringue gives the “frosting” element here and finally FA milk and WF pastry cream provide the sweet silky milk.\r\n\r\nOptional dependant on taste: 0.3% AP (5%) for a more grainy cereal.\r\n\r\nAs always sweetener is subjective and is there purely for my tastes but I recommend it for a nice sweet cereal vape.\r\n\r\nIf you like this recipe and what I do then please rate and review.",
