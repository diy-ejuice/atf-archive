      "text": "This is not bad, for an all-LB recipe, not bad at all. The root beer is getting a bit overwhelmed by cream for me though, and missing some of that \"bite\" that you want from a root beer float. Although it finishes smooth and creamy, the top notes are also running a little dry for something that's partially liquid. Personally I think this could be even better without the LB Cream that probably isn't accomplishing anything that the Vanilla Ice Cream can't do by itself. And the LB Sweetener I think is just ethyl maltol, could be contributing to the drier top notes, and the whole recipe might be improved with replacing that with some sucralose sweetener or just leaving it out. But still, not a bad vape at all as-is. "
