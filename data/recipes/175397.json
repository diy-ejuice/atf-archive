  "description": "Profile: Banana Strawberry Smoothie\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nSome time ago, I picked up Chef's Choice Banana Yoghurt, because @Zany (also known as Dico1337) told me to, knowing I fucking HATE banana vapes.\r\nI figured it was time to buckle up, suck in the belly and get done with it.\r\nTo my surprise, I actually enjoy CC Banana Yoghurt quite a lot.\r\n\r\nI find CC Banana Yoghurt to be just about sweet enough to pass as a great banana flavor. The yoghurt part does add some creamy-gooey-good stuff to this flavor, to make it work perfectly in my recipe here.\r\nNext up, I needed some strawberry as banana and strawberry go very well together and is a thing most people can get along with - please note, I didn't want to go down a weird rabbit hole with this recipe. My first choice was 4% TFA Strawberry Ripe, but both Zany and I agreed (as he chipped in a little with advice) that 4% wasn't strong enough. So Zany suggested 1.5% JF Strawberry sweet and I decided to bump TFA Strawberry Ripe up another 0.5%. It worked! The strawberry is now there, but not so much it'll overpower the 3% CC Banana Yoghurt.\r\nFA Cream is just playing a tiny supporting role here to smoothen the whole mix up and lending some back-up to CC Banana Yoghurt. I find 1.25% to be just perfect - not too much and not too little.\r\n\r\nFor your own preference, please feel free to add a little sweetener to this mix if it's not enough. I myself find 2 drops of CAP Super Sweet in a 30ml done mix to hit the spot.\r\nWhich and how much if any sweetener, I'll leave that up to you, dear mixer.\r\n\r\nCC Banana Yoghurt is really best at 3 days steep, but hey... this works perfectly great as a SNV!\r\n\r\nEnjoy!",
