      "text": "A nice, sweet blood orange vape. As a vape, not as soft as a marshmallow due to the strong Blood Orange which has like this Grapefruit tang to it which easily cuts though everything. CCI imparts just a slight bit of cakiness along with the graham cracker, drawing away from the actual marshmallow. Even though I don't think it's a marshmallow, it's still very tasty."
