    "description": "As I awoke from an old man Van Dusky's \"sleepy time tea\" induced coma in the woods, I saw a volunteer sheriffs department officer out of the corner of my eye and grabbed his attention. He had informed me that my mother was worried sick and he would bring me back home asap. Once I saw my mother, she cried and said she would take me to Wendy's. On the way to wendy's she told me \"the bad man wont hurt you anymore, and a vanilla frosty would make it all better\"",
