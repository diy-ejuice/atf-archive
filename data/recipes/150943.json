  "name": "Lemon Lime and Bitters",
  "description": "Since I was young I knew I would be enjoying something special when I was getting a \"Lemon,lime & bitters\". It's such a nostalgic profile for me that I have enjoyed for a long time and I still order these regularly when I go out because I no longer drink. It's the famous balance of the sweet lemonade with the freshness of the lime and the bitters that cut through the tartness and gives you a some what complex yet refreshing experience like no other. Since creating eLiquid recipes I have been thinking how lovely this would be to replicate in a vape. However there just didn't seem to be a concentrate or combination of that would truly help replicate this experience until Vape Train released the messiah of flavor concentrates that I hoped would finally make this happen. \r\n\r\nMany years ago I did a bar course through TAFE Queensland and there I learnt quite a lot about flavors in a short time with a young pallet that was starved for life experience. This course finally gave me the opportunity to single taste that special seemingly elusive (at the time) bottle of bitters. I wanted to get my hand on that stuff and see what it tasted like by itself because I was convinced it would be amazing. How naive was I? lol. It was god awful, it made me spit and gag. There's just no way you can replace these valued moments in life that we can now look back on with somewhat embarrassment and self cursing of how much of a dickhead was I? lol \r\n\r\nWhat I did learn very quickly though was that quite often some flavors can be not great on their own but when paired or accompanied with the right friend that things can go a lot better. I learn't that \"Bitters\" when measured correctly can provide the perfect balance between sweet & tart. This concentrate from VT offered all that I was hoping for. \r\n\r\nRecently I visited an upmarket Thai restaurant and experienced a LLB that was rich, balanced, beautiful and delectable like I had never experienced before. With now over 35 years of life experience and memories of enjoying this lovely beverage I was actually blown away by the depth of flavour. So I did what any avid DIY mixer would do on a romantic date and took notes lol. \r\n\r\nIt needs a smooth vanilla note with depth and an almost creamy soda like feel that seemingly helped to fill out the nuances of the fresh lime & lemon notes while also being refreshing and effervescent. \r\nThis is how I came up with V1.\r\n\r\nThere are 3 variations to this recipe.\r\n\r\nV1: I suggest trying it as listed here, it is beautiful and very close to how i remember it and i could vape that all day, \r\n\r\nV2: I'm a sweet tooth and want a little sweetness and brightness to this profile so added a slight amount of TPA sweet & tart and shazam that did the trick wonderfully.\r\n\r\nV3: This is the original blend I did which is lovely and is more like a middle market version that you may get in a supermarket or a fast food restaurant, it's still great but lack a bit of the body of flavor in hindsight.\r\nhttps://alltheflavors.com/recipes/98540#a_lemon_lime_bitters_mate_by_diydownunderpippa\r\n\r\nnb.the fizzy sherbet works very well here for a little almost fizzy mouth feel as well as giving a little lemon like assistance to the overall recipe in all if these versions.\r\n\r\nHow do you like it? \r\nGive these a try or share your thoughts/comments below and let me know if you enjoyed any of these versions or created another.\r\n\r\nEither way, enjoy mixing & \"Together, Let's Discover! \"\r\n\r\nCheers for reading this far, now go and get mixing!\r\n\r\nFacebook - https://www.facebook.com/groups/diydownunder/\r\nDiscord - https://discord.gg/kH4Fqbc\r\nYoutube - https://www.youtube.com/c/diydownunder\r\nWebsite - https://www.diydownunder.com/\r\nInstagram IGTV : @diydownunder\r\n\r\nIMO this is a very pleasant and enjoyable vape on a single coil RDA at 60W with a SST single coil at 0.2 ohm",
