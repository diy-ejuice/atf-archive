    "description": "My take on an Arnold Palmer updated with a smoother mix and less angst. While originally created as a concept mix, I did actually enjoy it. This is an updated version largely improved and yet different from original in many profound ways. It is a reimagining of life after being focused on problems, this here is the solution.\r\n\r\nMain Note:\r\nINW Plum\/FA BC - Not very many recipes use Plum, but I loved its dryness, yet it was just a hair short of full. Plum to me is a bit thin at 1 and at 2 it's at it's limit. I wanted to give it a deeper fruity vibe and sweeten it up so I went with FA Black Cherry, and a touch of FW Sweetener.\r\n\r\nBase:\r\nFA Black Tea\/VT Lemonade Clear\/VT Sour lemon - This combo was used to create a lighter tea feel and a less sweet lemonade base to fit the dryness of the fruit. FA BT can probably be bumped up a bit if you want more tea out of it or maybe add a support with something less intense\/more forgiving.\r\n\r\nAccents:\r\n\r\nFLV Yakima Hops\/Pink Guava\/INW Cactus - This adds some very slight funk to the whole mix that at these low levels adds just a hint of tropical funk and wetness. It folds under the rest quite nicely to me.\r\n\r\n(Optional) Coolant:\r\nFA Polar blast - I also mix this with Polar Blast at 0.4%,",
