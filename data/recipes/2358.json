      "text": "Very accurate to the mixers stated profile. Taste exactly like the vanilla almond milk from the store in my opinion. I like the sweetened version of this milk from the store personally. So I mixed it exactly to the recipe and let it steep before trying so that I would get exactly what the mixer got. As I said it's very accurate but I prefer sweeter almond milk myself. So after I vaped first tank I went back and added a bit of super sweet to remaining mix to bring it up to where I like my almond milk. Spot on for me. Very creamy milky mouthfeel with a great gentle not in your face almond throughout. Great balance. I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys almond milk. Well done Vurve."

Been so long since I've liked a flavor this much and never would have expected it to be a simple almond milk. Amazing job! I know it's perfect, but I'm always trying to find a way to sneak a tobacco flavor into my juices; wondering which (if any) would play well here. Any suggestions welcome. Thanks for a great mix :) "

A+++, again, i wish i had made more then 15ml from the start. "

Beautifully layered profile with different notes popping out each vape. Solid mixing that deserves more praise. Thanks for sharing, Vurve! "

The aroma is gives off has a great almond smell. The recipe blends together very well and makes for a relaxing vape, it's not in your face or over the top flavor. Just a real smooth vanilla almond cream. "
