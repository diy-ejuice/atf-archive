  "description": "Toucan Sam finally reached his breaking point! He couldn't take the pressure of show biz anymore. For years he held his beak and wouldn't say what was really on his mind. Those fruity circles had drove him to madness. He cracked over wondering \"What kind of fruits are in these fucking circles?\". He started drinking heavy and the stress got the best of him. He ended it all with a bullet to the head. All the years of eating those delicious fruit circles had turned his brain into the very thing that drove him to depression and madness. Now you can taste what was on his mind with ...Sad Sam Circles.\r\n\r\n\r\nOk, ok, I know, it's corny. But, this has been a serious journey into making a great \"Froot Loops\" cereal vape. I can't remember how long it's been since I've had Froot Loops but taste memory is so strong, I still remember what it taste like.  My quest for a better \"Froot Loops\" vape started with vaping Looper by ANML. And to be honest I wasn't impressed. I got weird off notes from it and tried to clone it to make it better but I didn't seem to get there. I also purchased Kilo's Cereal Milk. This was a lot better but it still didn't quite do it for me. It had too much of an orange note that I didn't care for. So I decided to create my own to fit my tastes in a \"Froot Loops\" vape.\r\n\r\n\r\nMost mixers will start with a fruit circles flavoring as their base. With most of these I get a weird lemon pledge note that I just did not enjoy, so I decided to build my own cereal base.\r\n\r\nThe Cereal:\r\nI have recently re-discovered CAP Gingerbread. It's a very versatile flavoring for all sorts of bakeries and cereals. It adds a soft chewy ginger cookie when used at higher percentage and at lower percentages a nice sweet soft bakery with hints of ginger. When paired with JF Biscuit, it transforms into a nice cereal base and without the \"lemon Pledge\" note.\r\n\r\nThe milk:\r\nI tried several different milk bases including combinations of OOO cream milky undertones, FA meringue, FA cream Fresh, and FA Milk. I settled on FA Milk and FA Meringue. It seems to have the best sugary sweet creamy milk I was going for. I also added CAP Vanilla Custard to give the milk an almost condensed milk note to add some thickness and body to the milk.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe \"Froot\":\r\n\r\nAs I mentioned, Cereal Milk by Kilo was a pretty tasty eliquid, however, I didn't like the orange note in the juice. So I decided not to add any orange and base my \"Froot\" on just the lemon. FE Lemon was the obvious choice. To me, it's the best lemon out there that has the least off notes and will not fade as bad as the others. At .75% it is spot on for what I was shooting for. \r\n\r\n\r\nThe sweetness level might be a little high for some. I did try it without sweetener and it seemed to lack vibrancy. If you like less sweet vapes, I would suggest only using .25% CAP Super Sweet. But .5% worked for me.\r\n\r\nSteep time is best at 1 week to let the CAP Vanilla Custard bloom but 2-3 days is good as well.\r\n\r\n\r\nI hope people that love cereal vapes will mix this and see how close I've gotten to a \"Froot Loops\". Any comments, reviews, good or bad is welcomed. It makes us all better mixers. :)\r\nVisit Freedom To Mix on Discord https://discord.gg/cMUjtPf\r\nJoin our Freedom To Mix FaceBook group https://www.facebook.com/groups/415341418920740/ \r\nVisit https://freedomtomix.com/ for resources and information on DIY mixing!\r\n\r\n",

This mix is just a pleasure to vape and it showcases FA milk brilliantly. This is one of those mixes that changes as you vape it. I never taste gingerbread (which is pretty amazing), and I would swear there are more fruits in here than what ingredients are listed. The experience is like other lemon based cereal vapes, but way more complex. On the inhale you get a sweet creamy milkiness, followed quickly by the lemon and then deep in the exhale you are left with the biscuit bent into the most delicious cereal - likely aided by the gingerbread. Great recipe! This Sam is not sad to have found it..."
