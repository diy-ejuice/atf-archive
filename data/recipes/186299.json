  "description": "Original Idea: A classic bowl of cornflakes with fresh strawberries.  Requested by member @DrkRaven ; mixed by @DrkRaven @fieldgreens @HumanPuck in the diy discord. Join today: https://discordapp.com/invite/ufVTyAQ\r\n\r\nProcess: There's no breakfast quite as simple as simple as cornflakes, with fresh strawberries to brighten it up.  Our initial thoughts immediately brought us to CAP Cereal 27, OOO Milky Undertone, and the superb Strawberry Trinity, which can never be a bad thing.  We added a touch of FW Hazelnut to support the milk, and we had our first mix.  It was a good start, but not quite there.  The milk and cereal weren't quite ready to stand up to the almighty trinity.  To support the cereal, we added FA Cookie, and went with TPA Marshmallow to add a little sweetness and base to the milk.  This yielded a delicious cereal with just the right amount of strawberry to take you back to mom's kitchen on a Saturday morning.  That's when @DrkRaven had an idea so crazy it worked.  Add some WS-23 to recreate the sensation of the cold milk to really bring it home.  We did.  It did.\r\n\r\nResult: A balanced mix of everything, sweet but fresh and mildly tart strawberries, crunchy corn flakes, and ice cold, slightly sweet milk.  Sit down with this for Saturday morning cartoons, and it just might bring back memories.\r\n\r\nFeedback always welcome :)\r\n",
