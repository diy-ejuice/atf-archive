  "description": "A mellow yet flavor packed Raspberry, Kiwi, with a subtle apple body and lime tail. This juice has a very velvety and smooth mouth feel. It is SNVable but the lime really tames out and the whole juice emulsifies after 3 Days. This recipe was designed for my Breeze 2 and should work for all like devices. Feel free to leave out the icy elements if you are not a fan! I am interested in any reviews and opinions. \r\n\r\nP.S. this is my first public recipe and I would like feedback on my recipe and the write up",

I would do without the Kiwi Double, I can really pick that out here  Plenty of sweetness. The coolant is WAY too much for me so I just put in 1% arctic. Enjoying out of my KF Lite 2019. Cheers &amp; thanks for sharing!"
