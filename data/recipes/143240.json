  "description": "Hey guys, was playing round with flavours for a diydownunder challenge in December, wasn’t impressed with the outcome and shelved the idea. Put the bottle in the cupboard and forgot about it. I took the bottle out last week and gave it a try.....   after a looooong steep, the flavours combined and settled and what came out is a extremely well rounded raspberry  lamington. 4 weeks for the steep on this one and you won’t be disappointed ",
