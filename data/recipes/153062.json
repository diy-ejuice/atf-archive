    "description": "Profile: Hops with a berry fusion and a little sweet prickly touch\r\n\r\nDisclaimer:\r\nMade this on DIY_eJuice discord with the masterminds @nowar and @humanpuck\r\n\r\nWe wanted to make a flavor with Yakima Hops and some berries.\r\nAfter much dicking around trying to figure out what we all got in common, it took us on a wild ride through flavors that would maybe or maybe not fit with Yakima Hops.\r\nI don't really wanna go though all the suggestions we had, but we had quite a few.\r\n\r\nFlavors:\r\n\r\n- FLV Yakima Hops is the star here and at 3% we felt it wouldn't get drowned and added that nice after taste Hops fans know so much.\r\n- FA Blackcurrant is that bastard child, that you can't really stop loving, even though it's a bitch. Potent stuff but it fits.\r\n- FA Forrest Mix (forest fruits) just fits in, as this is a berry fusion. And as forgiving as it is, we cranked this good stuff up.\r\n- CAP Golden Pineapple was one of the wilder ideas we had, as this mix needed something sweet and balancing to the berries. And it was welcomed with open arms.\r\n- FA Lime Tahity Distilled was the obvious choice to hold berries in balance along the pineapple. It's the binding element here.\r\n- INW Cactus is known to add juiciness, so that's what we did.\r\n\r\nNo sweetener is needed for this mix, but if this isn't sweet enough for you, may we suggest FW Sweetener.\r\nAdd your choice of coolant if you like.\r\n\r\nEnjoy!\r\n\r\n",

But I was very pleasantly surprised by this, and glad I picked up the Yakima Hops to make it. Dark, sweet fruits on the inhale with zesty citrus and the slightly bitter, floral notes from the hops on the exhale. Honestly I'm still not sure how this works, because it doesn't seem like it should...but if anyone knows their way around weird mixes, it's these guys - and they managed to create something pretty amazing that's quite unique, tasty, well-balanced, and greater than the sum of it's parts. Bravo gents. "
