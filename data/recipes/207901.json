  "description": "Vanilla Chai Spice Latte (Dunkin Donuts Style) üòÉ This is mine & my wife's favorite treat this time of year and since it's getting colder again I figured I'd give this recipe a try... \r\n\r\nagain... \r\n\r\nIt's been a year in the making and I think that I finally have it this time üòÅ breaking it down to its core profiles, and with the addition of some new flavorings, simplicity is the best way to go in recipe development. üëç\r\n\r\n1st off I wanna give props to Jennifer Jarvis for her help with this recipe back in the beginning... Thank you! üëä\r\n\r\nNow onto the notes:\r\n(FLV Eggnog) This is the main flavor that comes thru in this recipe. The first time that I drank this stuff, it reminded me of a warm eggnog with a slight tea back note.\r\n\r\n(VT Vanilla Cream) Gives a nice thick/rich mouthfeel to the recipe as well as a nice vanilla base. The drink itself is thick & creamy.\r\n\r\n(WF Tahitian Vanilla Cream) Adds a deeper vanilla layer and more mouthfeel.  \r\n\r\n(TPA Chai Tea) Gives just a little chai tea note to help fill out the recipe. Too much will give weird off notes.\r\n\r\n(SA Black Tea) Gives the backbone for the tea flavor cause the TPA Chai Tea needs a lil help in the tea department. This stuff is STRONG, so be careful if your going to add more.\r\n\r\n(CAP Super Sweet) This recipe I feel needs this for authenticity because the drink itself is SWEET... ü§§\r\n\r\nHope you like this recipe as much as I do (and the real thing) üòâ \r\nFeel free to comment and review. \r\n",
