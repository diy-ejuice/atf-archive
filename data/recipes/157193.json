  "description": "This is version 2 of this profile attempt and I am very happy with it\r\nThe pastry base uses JF biscuit and wf croissant to try and achieve a light buttery flaky pastry\r\nI decided to go with FLV vanilla pudding for that gooey stuff in the pic. It adds a nice vanilla note and some mouth feel\r\nJf Sweet strawberry and FA juicy strawberry to go for a sweet realistic strawberry \r\nAnd WF powdered sugar because it’s on the pastry.\r\nI added .25% cap super sweet to make these delicious flavors pop but feel free to omit if that’s not your thing.",

My only complaint is that I like it better fresh a lot more than steeped for some odd reason. That being said, no biggie I just make what I'll vape in a day or two. I've mixed 30 ml of this at least 4 times in the last few weeks. Love it."
