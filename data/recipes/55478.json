  "description": "ASMR - A Strawmallow Remix\r\n\r\nWhat's going on folks, I'm at it again bringing my first ever remix to the table. I follow a lot of vape pages on Instagram and for the past few weeks I've been seeing a shit ton of posts about this eliquid called Strawmallow. Funny enough, the company who manufactures the liquid doesn't even have a website that you can purchase it from, so I have never tried it. However, on their instagram page they describe the juice as a \"light, fluffy dessert jam packed with sweet, ripe strawberries!\" So I thought, \"what the hell I'll make my own.\" So here we go, A Strawmallow Remix!\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nThe Marshmallow - \r\n\r\nTPA Bav. Cream, TPA Marshmallow, FA Meringue and CAP VCv1 - so if you haven't guessed by now, this isn't a very complex mix. TPA Marshmallow is the star of the show and at 6% it stands up against the rest of the flavors. FA Meringue adds mouthfeel. TPA Bav. Cream and CAP VCv1 add body to the marshmallow and almost a toasted sensation to the mix. \r\n\r\nTFA Strawberry Ripe is pretty much a dead giveaway as per the description. At 3% the strawberry it noticeable but doesn't take away from the marshmallow. \r\n\r\nSweetener is always subjective, but it is a marshmallow so they tend to be sweet. \r\n\r\nThis is obviously an easy mix and funny enoug this is the most authentic that I had mixed up out of my 5+ failed attempts. I was using a shit ton of flavors in my previous mixes, trying to make the marshmallow chewy and using multiple strawberries. It was infuriating. But then I remembered Occam's Razor and landed with the most authentic of them all. \r\n\r\nSNV approved, but will probably benefit from a week steep. \r\n\r\nPhoto cred goes to @buildlab on Instagram. \r\n\r\nDeuces.

I do wish the Strawberry was a little more forward in the recipe, but taste is subjective and that is something I can taylor to my liking. All in all, GREAT JOB!"

I didnâ€™t have TPA marshmallow as I prefer FA marshmallow, so I subbed it in instead. It turned out great. Itâ€™s a very thick vape with a full mouthfeel with a delicious sugary undertone accentuated by a bright and tasty strawberry. Great job. Iâ€™ll be mixing this one consistently. ðŸ™‚"

I gave up on them for a long time and have just got bothered by them recently,sitting in my case and not being used.&#xD;\nI decided to give them one last go before chucking them out when I stumbled upon this recipe.&#xD;\nI get a warm, but not toasted, malted strawberry marshmallow straight off the shake with this mix.&#xD;\nWell done man, think I might just use this as a new marshmallow base.&#xD;\nCan't wait to try throwing some other fruits at this."

The strawberry is just present enough to meld perfectly with the creams without overpowering. The marshmallow is freaking amazing. So very well developed. Thank you sir! "

I can only imagine how good it's gonna be after a week or two.  Maybe I'm more of fruity vaper than I thought.  Nice Job.  Highly recommend to anyone especially if you haven't had good experiences in the past from SnC recipes.  Make room on the shelf.  The TOP SHELF!"

I opened ATF and this recipe came up in the suggested tab. I haven't had a strawberry and cream, or in this case, marshmallow in a really long time, and the percentages didn't immediately scare me off, so I mixed a 30ml of this. I'm enjoying it quite a bit.&#xD;\n&#xD;\nEven though there isn't a whole lot of \"complexity\" in this recipe, the percentages of the flavors are expertly crafted. On a shake and vape, this recipe was tasty, but it felt like a super sugary custard type recipe at first. After a few days, the marshmallow and meringue came through a lot more to build a fluffy, marshmallow-y profile which, I'm assuming is more what OP was going for. I think there could be more strawberry in here, and I mixed a second bottle that used FA Strawberry at 2.5% in tandem with the TPA Straw Ripe, and I think this added a stronger strawberry note to the recipe. However, just StrawRipe is still tasty, it just becomes more of a marshmallow recipe with hints of strawberry. Either way, this mix is really delicious, and I'll be enjoying it for a while now."

      "text": "As much as I love new and unusual flavor combinations I still very much enjoy a basic and sweet commercial type recipe once in a while and this is it right here! The marshmallow although seemingly quite high here works very well in combo with the meringue, bav cream, and custard to create a great fluffy vape with amazing mouthfeel. I replaced the strawberry ripe with regular tpa strawberry as I personally dislike the ripe and I believe it worked very well. The level of strawberry is just perfect in relation to the fluff and makes for a very addictive vape. Another excellent job here 5 stars all the way!"
