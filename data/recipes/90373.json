  "name": "Orange Creme Churro",
  "description": "Week 9 Challenge - dedicated to Emily - I am new to this game so I don't know her nickname but I think everyone knows who she is.  I don't have sugar cone or waffle cone which she has been mentioning alot lately or at least in shows where I've seen her.  Churro is my best next go to for a different kind of bakery. \r\n This tastes great shake and vape - I hope it holds up to some steeping.  I thought churro with orange and cream sounded good so I went for it and added a floral dash to it - straight away it's not obvious but the bergamot you can taste right off the bat even at such a small percentage and it adds a nice extra bitter-sweetness somehow.  If you want something sweeter than this you could definitely bump up the super sweet.  The biscuit is silverline but I don't see that here.",
