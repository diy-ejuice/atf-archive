  "description": "Do yourself a favor. \r\nAll flavorah concentrates mix. Go max vg. With nicotine you can pull off 95% or more depending on your strength. Make big white clouds again like it’s 2017 :) \r\n\r\nNeeds steep. Very sharp on the tongue for the first couple of days. Takes time for the flavorings to blend with the thick shit. Your mileage may vary with added pg. Still. It’ll be better with a few days on the shelf.  If you wanna go even softer, try it with 1% tpa fresh cream or even .25% flavorah sweet cream, but TPA’s is pretty fucking stellar at smoothing out sharp edges. \r\n\r\nWhat you get? Pink Guava with an authentic peach backnote. \r\n\r\nPart of my point blank series of single or dual flavor recipes. I don’t consider sweetener a flavor. I consider it a requisite. :) More simple recipes coming. ",
