I found it delicious."

That said my friends love it so I must just be the crazy one. I may try mixing this with a bit less blueberry next time.&#xD;\nThanks Tootall!"

Day 2 was even better, vaped through another 10ml. Today is day 3, and it's again even better and it is doubtful this will make it to day 7 like the recommended steep time states. This may actually be come the first ADV I've ever wanted to actually vape all day, as well as the first blueberry flavor that hasn't turned me off completely. I'll be making a big steep batch tonight to let it sit until day 7 and see what magic appears. Great job!"
