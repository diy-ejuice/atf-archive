  "description": "So this is just a simple 321 that happens to taste like a juice box to me. Of course you need to add your sweetener of choice, I didn't add it to the recipe just so I could keep it as a 321 but use whatever you want at whatever amount you want. Edit: After letting this steep more it's actually tasting more like a fruity tea which is weird because there is not tea flavor here.",
