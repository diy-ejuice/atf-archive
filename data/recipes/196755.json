    "description": "*disclaimer* I don\u2019t taste strawberry well.\r\n\r\nThis was to taste the base up against fruits and it really worked. The base gives off a sweet milk without being overly heavy on the tongue. The original recipe had TFA Pistachio, but it was too much. I thought of WF Macadamia to play into the creaminess and to add nuttiness that would funk up the mix a bit. The WF Macadamia and OOO Cream Milky Undertones are key in this recipe. \r\n\r\nThe base can used with a lot of other flavors.",

After this initial mix, I was even more excited to try it because you could just smell the macadamia but I \"patiently waited out the steep which I did 4 days. Now that I finally got try it I can't seem to put it down. The initial nuttiness mixed with the cheesecake creaminess. The strawberries seem to work its way through adding to the already deliciousness. I honestly felt like I was guilty of cheating on my diet. Fat kid mode initiated and I have no shame, I'm already mixing a larger batch."
