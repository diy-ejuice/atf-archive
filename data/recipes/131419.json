    "name": "Old Fashioned Yule Log",
    "description": "The B\u00fbche de No\u00ebl is a Christmas tradition among the French that dates back to the 19th century. The cake represents the yule log that families would burn starting on Christmas Eve. The burning of the yule log symbolized the new year to come and would bring good luck to the family. While no one is positive on exactly how the yule log turned into a cake, everyone can agree it's a delicious tradition we never want to end. \r\n\r\nThe cake in this mix is represented by FA Chocolate Glazed Doughnut, I chose this because I wanted to incorporate the chocolate and cake notes of the doughnut.\r\n\r\nThe heavy cream is replicated by using FA Fresh Cream and VT Pudding Base to make a heavy and sweet cream with a hint of vanilla.\r\n\r\nFor the icing I used a combination of VT Chocolate Base and VT Dark Chocolate to make it sweet and a slightly bitter at the same time.\r\n\r\nTFA Butter is used as an emulsifier and the FA Madagascar is used to help with the authenticity of the dessert.\r\n\r\nOOO Powdered Sugar is like the garnish on top and FW Sweetener because it's a cake. It's supposed to be sweet.",
