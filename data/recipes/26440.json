    "description": "Going for an unique blend of mixed of berries here. Starting off with foresr fruit, adding a little extra current, to that flavor with FA black currant, and then giving you a little something unique with the cap fig.\r\n\r\nForest fruit- on its own is a fantastic flavoring, little harsh as a shake and vape, but calms down after a couple of days. Since we've been limited to three flavorings I thought I would go with flavoring that has multiple flavors. This flavoring is very strong and does a great job at 1%.\r\n\r\nFA black currant-can come off very Floral, and wasn't sure it was going to work here. Turned out to be a fantastic pairing with really bringing out the berries in this fruit mix.\r\n\r\nCap fig- I've tried using this particular flavoring with little success in other recipes. Took a chance threw it in the mix and WOW, it compliments the other berries well while sweetening everything, and just making it very interesting.\r\n\r\nI'm super impressed with this combination of flavorings and can't wait to use it in a custard or Bakery.\r\n\r\nUsing my standard testing setup. Clapton coils coming out at .46 ohms, in my recoil testing at 70\/30 with 3% Nic. \r\n\r\nThis flavoring is dark and delicious and should hold up even without the nicotine.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
