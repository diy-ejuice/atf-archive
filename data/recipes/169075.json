    "description": "A thick scoop of vanilla ice cream plunked down into a tall glass of sweet and tangy cherry soda. We all float down here. \r\n\r\n#E-Juice Makers \r\n\r\nAlthough, unlike the Paradise Cream, no one has asked for this discontinued as a one-shot by Chef's Flavours, here it is, anyway. This recipe was inspired by trying a soft drink called \"Cheerwine\" and imaging how it would be as a float. I needed a lot of candy cherry, so I pushed INW Cherries as far as could without getting medicinal off notes, then added as much FA Black Cherry as I could darken it with and still avoid that yuck. Still not enough cherry, but TFA Pomegranate worked very well to fill in the cherry to get where it needed to go without any issues. I used CAP Lemon Lime for the tart, citrusy quality of the soda. TFA Sweet And Tart served three purposes: More sweetness, more tartness, and that powdery aspect to try to emulate what bubbles would remain in the soda after ice cream was floated in it. You have to remember, this was before VT Fizzy Sherbet or FLV Citrus Soda existed. TFA VBIC was an easy route to ice cream, with TFA Whipped Cream the foamy part where ice cream meets soda. As with the Paradise Cream, I've been meaning to improve the recipe for some time now and then release the improved version... and just haven't gotten around to it. As with the Paradise Cream, when I do, it's definitely going to have the TFA VBIC replaced with LB's Vanilla Ice Cream. It might also a need touch of HS French Vanilla Ice Cream , and replacing TFA Whipped Cream with FLV's version. That combination of LB Vanilla Ice Cream, HS French Vanilla Ice Cream, and FLV Whipped Cream worked so well in TamVapes' [Jacked Up Sundae](https:\/\/alltheflavors.com\/recipes\/140386#jacked_up_sundae_by_tamvapes). Of course that might take some rebalancing of the other ingredients, but I'm unlikely to abandon them, even for the likes of FLV CItrus Soda or VT Fizzy Sherbet. They WORK here. But until that all gets sorted out, I hope anyone who is interested enjoys the original recipe.  ",
