    "description": "After Careful Deliberation i decided to redo the previous version s of this recipe, there where some off notes i just wasn't digging in there... so on to the new new ... loaded this one down on the cream notes i really want that to stand along side the awesomeness of the FLV apple filling .. man that's a great flavor ... i was getting a very noticeable anise note on the vapor train FVIC at the 4% i initially used so i toned that back to 2% and it was a whole different vape...  hoping to zero in on this recipe to make it a banger..",
