  "description": "A caramel fit for a caraSMACK head!! The goal here was quite simple... get as close to my all time favourite chocolate bar using the least flavourings and letting quite possibly 3 of the best caramel/toffee concentrates do all the talking. These 3 concentrates work in harmony with each other to create a deliciously smooth,sweet vape that isnâ€™t to taxing on the tastebuds. Itâ€™s quick,itâ€™s simple and itâ€™s fucking delicious!!! I added 0.5% Capella super sweet and I recommend you do the same to really make this recipe pop. **S&V approved** please mix it up,rate and review my recipe and as always happy mixing fam ðŸ’™",
