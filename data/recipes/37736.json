I would consider this to be a simple recipe for beginners looking to get into DIY. I'll be providing a series of DIY E-liquid recipes over time as well as other DIY tips and information.\r\n\r\nRecipe :\r\n\r\nTFA Strawberry Ripe - 5%\r\nTFA Bavarian Cream - 3%\r\nTFA Graham Cracker Clear - 2%\r\n\r\nGravities for mixing by weight : \r\n\r\nPG = 1.01 g/mL\r\nVG = 1.26 g/mL\r\nTFA Strawberry Ripe = 1.041 g/mL\r\nTFA Bavarian Cream = 1.068 g/mL\r\nTFA Graham Cracker Clear = 1.05 g/mL\r\n\r\nPLEASE NOTE : This recipe does contain a flavor that has Acetoin, which is a replacement for Diacetyl. Though it is a replacement for Diacetyl, it can catalyze into trace amounts of Diacetyl. If you are looking for Diketone-free cream flavorings I provided a link for the Diketone-free version of the Bavarian Cream used in the recipe.\r\n\r\nFlavors from The Flavor Apprentice\r\n\r\nStrawberry Ripe : https://shop.perfumersapprentice.com/...\r\n\r\nBavarian Cream : https://shop.perfumersapprentice.com/...\r\n\r\nBavarian Cream free of Acetoin or Acetyl Propionyl : https://shop.perfumersapprentice.com/...\r\n\r\nGraham Cracker Clear : https://shop.perfumersapprentice.com/...\r\n\r\nGravities of Flavor Apprentice flavors for mixing by weight : http://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/co...\r\n\r\nMore information or resources on DIY : http://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/",
