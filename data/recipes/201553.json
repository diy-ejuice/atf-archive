    "description": "***FLV APPLE IS VSO APPLE***\r\n\r\nI\u2019m really, really enjoying vaping this mix. I can\u2019t put it down! \r\n\r\nA juicy, refreshing, summery feeling mix. \r\n\r\nJuicy, tart apple with pink fruity and floral notes from the MB Pink Lady. VSO Apple is the foundation of the mix. It\u2019s the best apple flavour I\u2019ve tried by miles. I could happily vape it as a SF. \r\nI think those who usually don\u2019t like florals wouldn\u2019t be put off by this mix as they more just accent to the apple. It\u2019s a pretty soft floral note. \r\nCucumber is mainly adding to the overall fresh feel of the mix. \r\n\r\nI let it sit overnight before vaping. ",
