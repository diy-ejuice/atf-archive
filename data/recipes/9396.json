Like everyone says, it can't really be described other than to say its totally unique. The floral notes are definitly there. Then you get a whole pile of different fruit flavours. I can't put my finger on what they are but they are all stand-alone, you get this whole bouquet in your mouth... whereas I find most other mixed fruit recipes all end up kind of being the same kind of bland muddle of nothing. The flavour is intense on inhale and exhale without any of that nasty lingering 'stuff' on your pallette (stickiness, or a throat clawing sweetness for example) which is why this is the ONLY juice I've ever mixed myself that could be an ADV. When I'm feeling down about all my other juices, grack juice is there to make me smile. If I had to only mix one juice ever, for the rest of the time, Grack Juice is currently the only contender. "

No matter which way, this recipe blows my mind.  To me, CAP makes the most rounded strawberry flavor for my palate, so I know I'm not getting anything weird from TFA, FA, or INW Strawberries, because each one of those needs a little help from another.  Enough about the CAP SS bandwagon...  TFA Dragonfruit melds everything together with it's unmatched emulsifying properties, and I've also had good luck with FA Meringue as a mild sweetener, so kudos for not using actual sweetener, because this steps in and does the trick without destroying your coils!  Koolada is generally one ingredient I can easily pick out, but it plays in so well here, I wouldn't know it was there if I didn't mix it myself.
