  "description": "This is my peanut butter cookie recipe. It's a fairly straight forward recipe but yet a very well layered cookie. Sorry for no flavor notes I had a whole page wrote and I erased it before i saved it by accident. It tastes just like the peanut butter cookies my mother would make when I was a child. Give it a try you won't regret it.",
