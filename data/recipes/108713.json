  "name": "Chilled Mango Yogurt",
  "description": "I've been on a yogurt kick lately and my mission has been to make a mango yogurt. While developing this recipe, I decided to try to add cooling agents after many variations to see if it would benefit the recipe and it definitely did. \r\n\r\nThe goal was to create a thick creamy yogurt that was slightly tangy and had delicious mango. I settled on using Cap Creamy Yogurt for the body, Cap Greek Yogurt for the extra tang, and VT Yoghurt Base to help make it pop (VT Yoghurt has a slight citrus note).\r\n\r\nFor the mango, I could have just settled on using the great FLV Mango but decided to add VT Shisha Mango. This combo gave it alot more depth and added more juiciness. I love these paired together.\r\n\r\nNow onto the cooling. I decided to add VT Sorbet for the effect. It has a slight citrus note, lemon and lime, that work well with the Mango at helping it pop. The citrus is not noticeable in the mix. I wanted to add a little more cooling without going overboard with it so I settled on FA Polar Blast. It comes out to 1 drop per 10ml. This is chilled and it's definitely not overpowering.\r\n\r\nUse sweetener to your liking. I like it with Cap Super Sweet at 0.50%\r\n\r\nFEEDBACK IS WELCOMED. IF YOU MIX UP MY RECIPE AND REVIEW IT, IN RETURN, I WILL MIX UP A RECIPE OF YOURS AND GIVE YOU AN HONEST REVIEW.\r\n\r\nAfter many variations, I'm happy to release this.\r\n\r\nThis is a shake and vape, but the flavors pop after 2-3 days. I primarily use the Recurve, Wasp, Hadaly, Troll RTA, Serpent Mini, and mix it at 70VG. I don't like a real hot vape and usually use a resistance between 0.25 - 0.50 \r\n\r\nI have not tested this on sub ohm tanks since I don't like them, so I really don't know how this would taste in one.\r\n\r\nEnjoy!",
