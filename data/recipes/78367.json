  "description": "Christmas Confections is an attempt at recreating the date and rice crispies cookies that my aunt used to make at Christmas time.  I'm not sure if a date concentrate exists, but I would say the flavor is somewhere between a jammy fig and a cooked plum.  I used FLV Fig at 0.5% and INW Smoked Plum at 0.2% (a ridiculously low % . . . but that stuff is powerful) to create the gooey resemblance of dates cooked in sugar.  I added the WF Molasses to add the deep sweetness that comes with cooked dates.  WF Almond Cookie (2%), TFA Rice Crunchies (3%), and TFA Coconut Candy (0.75%) make up the body of the cookie that's mixed in (similar to rice crispy treats) after the sugar and dates have cooked into a syrupy sweet mixture.  FA Meringue (1%) and CAP Super Sweet (0.5%) round this out with that heavy coating of powdered sugar that the warm cookies are rolled in before serving.",
