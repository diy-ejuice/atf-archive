    "description": "A cool fizzy lemon lime soda drink.\r\n\r\nThis recipe used ID10-T' s 3-2-1 Cranberry Sprite as a template to make a 7 Up vape I've been after for a while. I made it during the \"cold wave\" that hit Europe last February but due to the weather, I wasn't inspired to vape or publish it.  Now however, we're experiencing a \"heat wave\" and this cool refreshing mix goes down beautifully in the scorching sun.  So mix this up, get out in the sun, slap on factor 30 and chill.\r\n\r\n \r\n4% CAP Lemon Lime is livened up with  1.5% CAP Juicy Lemon and 0.5% TFA Key Lime. I needed a sweetener but it was muting the flavour somewhat. However, 0.5% TFA Honeysuckle came in handy and sweetens this up as well as blending everything. 2% VTA Fizzy Sherbet adds the fizz. \r\n\r\nUse cooling agent of your choice.  0.35% FA Polar Blast also works great. Nice as a S& V but blends better after an overnight's steep.\r\n\r\n",

And I\u2019m glad someone used my silly little recipe as a building block to create something they liked and thought was worth sharing. But, it\u2019s not a Spot-On 7 Up for me. Even at just half a percent, the honeysuckle stands out. It\u2019s like having a glass of cold 7 up with a sprig of honeysuckle with several flowers on it to make it fancy AF. Again, I love that, but it might not be for everyone. "
