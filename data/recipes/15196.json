    "description": "\"Crush\" it out of Camden Yards with the Deputy! Orange, tangerine, and creamy goodness. I took the cream base for \"Ginger Sauce\" and augmented it a bit to make a delightful orange and cream. Despite a large amount of citrus, it's not harsh at all. CAP Sweet Tangering and FW Orange come together to make a beautiful orange\/tangerine combo that is not overly sweet or harsh. The CAP Sweet Tangerine sweetens the harshness that you usually find in orange flavors, and the FW Orange balances out that sweetness with tart citrus goodness. The addition of FA Marshmallow help to add a little mouth feel and to smooth out the cirus combo a bit more. TFA Vanilla Cupcake is added to add a hint of a bakery note that nigh undetectable. It works with the creams extremely well in this small percentage to make the vanilla pop just a little bit. The cream base itself is derived directly from my \"Ginger Sauce\" recipe. I simply took out the CAP Vanilla Custard v1 and the CAP Graham Cracker v1, and voila! I hope you enjoy this recipe as much as I have. I searched for years for a good orange and cream juice, and I was never truly satisfied. This is that orange and cream for me. As a side note, this is not intended to be a dreamsicle. ",
