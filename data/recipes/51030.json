  "description": "We all know the pink ones are our favorite!  There has been many liquids out there with this profile, but this has became my all day vape.  \r\nCredit to Kopel on the Jelly candy/vanilla swirl combo to give that starburst type base which works great on this.  The JF sweet strawberry is the main candy pink strawberry note in this.  The JF pink burst is not my favorite flavoring, but combined with the FLV strawberry it give that pink tart candy pop that is missing.  Best after a couple days, but very good shake and vape.  Enjoy",
