    "description": "Remember the lemon sugar cookies with the clear icing on top? Well this is my attempt at just that a LEMON sugar cookie with icing. If you don't have the cream cheese icing that is fine because it is still a great Lemon sugar cookie without it. It tastes good after  settling over night but gets much better with a 7 day steep.",
