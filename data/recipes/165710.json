  "name": "Cherry Cola Float",
  "description": "A lovely rich ,full and satisfying vape that is balanced and true to profile.\r\nInawera Cola has the most honest cola beverage notes of flavour that I can get out of any cola concentrate I have used and I have used 10 different ones. I have found that a little support of vanilla & caramel really assists though to give it a bit more body. \r\nAs an experiment I thought to add a little Flavorah Root Beer to see how it would contrast with that cola base of flavour. It was an amazing result! At 1.5% it brought this recipe some extra depth with a little rich sarsaparilla like flavor through the middle and also helped a lot with the overall mouthfeel. \r\nThe VT Creaming Soda complements this profile with a lovely vanilla creamy like body. With everything going on here there was only one thing to do and that was to put the cherry on top. \r\nMolinberry Red Cherry is the perfect Cherry concentrate for this profile IMO. I started it at 2% but it was run over by everything else. Stepping it up to 4% is just perfect, it blends and is solid with absolutely no bad notes. This entire recipe is great off the shake but settles really well after 3 days. Although a lovely, full & rich recipe, this is easily an enjoyable all day vape. \r\n\r\nGive it a go and let me know what you thought of this!\r\n\r\nThere are no subs here, but don't let that hold you back from experimenting and trying other ways and let me know how that went, \"Together, Let's Discover\" \r\n\r\nEnjoy!\r\n\r\nI tested on a Wotofo Recurve RDA 0.2ohm SST coils at 60w\r\n\r\nI hope you enjoy this just as much as I enjoyed creating this recipe, but let me know what you thought in the comments below.\r\n\r\nSeriously if you like a solid recipe that works give it a go!\r\n\r\nCheers for reading this far, now go and get mixing!\r\n\r\n\"Together, Let's Discover!!!\"\r\n\r\nFacebook - https://www.facebook.com/groups/diydownunder/\r\nDiscord - https://discord.gg/kH4Fqbc\r\nYoutube - https://www.youtube.com/c/diydownunder\r\nWebsite - https://www.diydownunder.com/\r\nInstagram IGTV : @diydownunder",
