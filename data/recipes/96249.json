  "description": "Perfect [ Peanut butter - Banana ] e-juice\r\n(Banana/Peanut Butter/Biscuit/Sweetener)\r\n\r\nBeen on the quest for a perfect peanut butter - banana combo and I finally nailed it down.\r\n\r\n\r\nBanana (Flavormonks) / Banana Sweet Cream (OOO) - awesome, creamy, realistic banana in 1:1 ratio of these two. Banana Sweet Cream is creamy enough to make peanut butter melt in your mouth. It'll come first on exhale!\r\n\r\nPeanut Butter V2 (CAP) - by far the most realistic peanut butter. A little bit weak so you might want to crank it up a bit. Up to 5% is just fine but higher percentage might choke banana flavor. By me, 4% works perfect - enough to flush that banana along the tongue.\r\n\r\nBicsuit (INAWERA) - only a bit is enough to lend a nice body to the mix\r\n\r\nSuper Sweet (CAP) - fills gaps and rounds all up\r\n\r\nNo, you can't make flavors replacement. Different flavor vendors do flavor namesakes by using different ingredients, that's why you can't.",
