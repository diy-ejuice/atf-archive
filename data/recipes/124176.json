  "description": "A smooth Fruity after dinner drink vape with a hint of peppermint, the Flavor monk G&T sets in nicely with this mix, i incorporated  two watermelons to round this recipe out..i truly enjoyed this recipe and working with the FlavorMonks brand finally .... what im feeling with it :\r\n\r\nThe FlavorMonks Gin and Tonic on hand check and smell: it taste very much like a Gin and Tonic esp the gin , this is probably the lightest of the set of gins from FlavorMonks...\r\nin this mix it sits on the exhale allowing the fruit to come thru on the inhale, the Cap Cool Mint is there in the middle floating around ..\r\nthe Huckleberry and Watermelon combo complemented each other well in this mix they sit side by side and give this unlikely fruit medley a great taste,  the mix is not overly sweet and is a very pleasant  and enjoyable even with the addition of the FLV Sweetness. 3 to 5 days steep or more upto you....
