  "description": "If you love Monkey Mix Papio by Twelve Monkeys you should check this one out.\r\n\r\n8% CAP Golden Pinapple because I'm pretty sure this is the main pineapple note in the original. I'm going this high because it's a really light flavor.\r\nGolden Pineapple is my favorite Pineapple flavor but it's really light and doesn't have a lot of body to it. That's why I layered it with TPA Pineapple.\r\n2% TPA pineapple to give it body.\r\n2% Sweet Guava to help the Golden Pineapple stand up against TPA Pineapple.\r\n.7% CAP Double Apple to get that moisty mouthfeel.\r\n.5% CAP supersweet (optional)\r\n\r\nI'm mixing for a few years now. Most of my mixes are based on premium juice profiles.\r\nMy recipes are remixes and not clones. In my attempts to remix these juices I'm always trying to make\r\nit as good as, or even better than the commercial juice without the loads of sweetener these companies throw in.\r\n\r\nGive it a try and enjoy ....................................",

      "text": "I would like to start by saying that I have never had \"Aloha\". Now that being said when I looked at this recipe i said daaaaaam that's a lot of pineapple and thought that is going to take over. But since I love pineapple I said F it I'm gonna mix it up. I was pleasantly surprised to find that the addition of the Double Apple and the Sweet Guava bent that pineapple very nicely. Oddly but deliciously this profile rates just like Pixie Stix and I love it. I am going to continue to play with this one. Starting with swapping the Double Apple with INW Two Apples, and bumping up the TPA Pineapple and Sweet Guava by .25%. Great job keep up the good work. You got a follower in me from here out.
