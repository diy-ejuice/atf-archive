  "name": "Hemingway's Doughnut",
  "description": "An excerpt from Hemingway's short story, The Mercenaries (the spelling oddities are how it was published; I fought my inner-grammarian to leave them as is):\r\n\r\n“We’ll rally round the doughnut.  The Peruvian doughnut,” mused Graves, disembowelling another cigarette.  “Follow the doughnut, my boys, my brave boys.  Vive la doughnut. Up with the Peruvian doughnut and down with the chili concarne.  A dirty rotten lot those Chillies!”\r\n\r\n“What is the doughnut, mon cher Graves?” asked Ricaud, puzzled.\r\n\r\n“Make the world safe for the doughnut, the grand old Peruvian doughnut.  Don’t give up the doughnut.  Remember the doughnut.  Peru expects every doughnut to do his duty,” Graves was chanting in a monotone.  “Wrap me in the doughnut, my brave boys.  No, it doesn’t sound right.  It ain’t got something a slogum ought to have.  But those Chillies are a rotten lot!”\r\n\r\nReading Hemingway got me to thinking about Key West and doughnuts . . . thus the Key lime doughnut.  \r\n\r\nThe Key Lime Pie/topping components: FA Florida Key Lime, Lime Tahity Cold Pressed, Custard Pi 3.14, OOO Vanilla Custard Cheescake, TFA Cheesecake Graham Crust, and FLV Sweet Coconut.  \r\n\r\nThe doughnut base: WF Glazed Donut SC and Deep Fried Pastry Dough SC.\r\n\r\nMixed 60vg/40 pg and it was good off the shake.  3 days later, and I'm still enjoying it immensely.  Will revisit and rework if/when the lime starts to fade.  Enjoy!\r\n",

Since i single flavor tested them but you managed to cover up all the notes I didn’t like, and produced a delicious doughnut with a key lime cream. I did steep it for 2 weeks before trying it, but I didn’t get any harshness from the limes. The creams blend together nicely and are well balanced with the rest of the ingredients. "
