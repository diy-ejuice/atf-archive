    "description": "Dark Peanut is a morning coffee vape pairing liquid.\r\nAfter waking up, i can't vape very strong juices so i went for a very soft version.\r\n\r\nFLV Peanut Butter\/ FA Pear\r\nthe peanut is the main flavor without being up high, the pear turns your attention away from the nut flavor and opens your palette for the other components\r\n\r\nVT Pudding Base\/CAP Sweet Cream\/FE Sweet Rice \r\nThe body, the middle note of the vape, smooth but slightly upfront thanks to the addition of FE Sweet Rice. The Riceflavor adapts to the Peanut and binds these two characters into one picture\r\n\r\nINW Tobacco Coctail\/FA Up\r\nboth of these two flavors do their job to add depth and more character, darkens the flavor profile and adds that little surprise at the end of the inhale and exhale\r\nCAP Super Sweet, it's there to boost the pear and adds to the overall sweetness.\r\n\r\nNeeds a good steep. I liked it around 1 Week.\r\nFA Up could be changed to WF Brazil Coffee, bt i liked UP more cause it's closer to the slight tobacco note\r\n\r\nFeel free to comment, critique is very welcome",
