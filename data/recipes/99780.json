  "name": " Jammin with the Cronuts",
  "description": "So  I thought why not give a try my hand at a  Cronut  (which is a fried croissant in the shape of a donut- it is very much like a french crueler dounut)  -  with some of the  croissant flavors now available. The challenge is  getting the  buttery  fried Croissant  with light flaky airy inside  to stand out and be noticeable especially when adding a strong sweet jam filling  \r\n  WF fried dough,  croisant and glazed donut along with some cap butter  get  close to that cronut pastry ..  The bakery in this takes a 5 - 7 day steep to come forward  and for the contrasting fruit to  settle in a bit     \r\n\r\nI really love VT jam fruits  they are really a true jam  but will tend to fade a wee bit.   Although for this application  that is fine \r\n\r\npowdersugar  because  well I love powder sugar and more is better for me \r\n\r\nSweetner of choice for that  super sweet - teeth rattling  donut filling sweetness \r\nMade for Mixn in the kitchen  sunday youtube show \r\nhttps://youtu.be/Bq6AhYxbeUs\r\n",

      "text": "such a great and well balanced recipe!  I had yet to find a donut recipe that didn't taste play-do or yeasty from overuse of joy.  I had all but given up when I found this. Its buttery, rich &amp; tastes like sugary calories!  The fruits manage to not overtake but are nestled in there just like they are in the real thing.  This is a difficult profile to nail down but this rises to the challenge.  Will be keeping this in rotation steeped and ready to go.   ps: I did make one sub, VT glazed strawberries as I didn't have strawberry jam, though I doubt that made a massive difference.  much thanks!"
