      "text": "So yeah, that's a lot of Boom, Raspberry sweet, and Ethyl maltol, ( EM is in 3 of the ingredients) but damn if it doesn't taste like a cloud of cotton candy around a  nice artificial blue raspberry, that thankfully isn't too perfumy.   I'm thoroughly impressed.  My first impression on a SNV, I think to nail the profile, its not quite as sweet as I think it should be.  I'll let my sample steep out and revisit it in a few days.   Thanks for posting this!  Its pretty awesome and totally satisfies my longing for blue cotton candy (I'm diabetic).  I will play with the sweeteners on my next iteration and report back if you'd like!  Seriously, great job!&#xD;\n&#xD;\n"
