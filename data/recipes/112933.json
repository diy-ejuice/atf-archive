  "description": "As close to a SNV RY4 custard as I can get. Ham-handed with percentages but it is meant for RTA use (billow 2.5 personally).\r\n\r\nFLV Tatanka is REALLY good SNV, sort of a sweet chewy leathery quality to it along with some honey-ish sweetness. I love this stuff. FLV Connecticut Shade is added to just darken it up a bit, bringing a nice coffee/cocoa note. JF RY4 Double is a solid base to work around for the caramel/molasses notes but it's not as monotone as TFA and IMO works well at accenting other dessert baccos.\r\n\r\nINW Custard because it doesn't require much steeping and a bit of TFA Bavarian Cream to smooth out some edges.\r\n\r\nEDIT: halved RY4D, dropped Tatanka by 0.5%, switched FLV Red Burley for Connecticut Shade and upped to 1.5%. Original mix developed a very strong raisin note after a month steep, presumably from both the tatanka and ry4d (both have a bit of a fruity note to me), which were pretty high strength. In retrospect, I wanted to keep the flavor of Tatanka but just wanted that ry4 there to emulsify everything, so modifications have been made to achieve that.",
