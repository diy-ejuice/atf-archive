  "description": "This is my version of obsidian tweaked by the mastermind diyordie (Wayne). I personally get an off note with the flv cookie that the fa cookie doesn't have. I also use vanilla custard 2 because it's an amazing revamped custard. And last I just turn everything up slightly. This is my ADV and it's absolutely delicious. Thank you Wayne for all the inspiration and amazing recipes you put out. ",
