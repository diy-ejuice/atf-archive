    "description": "FA Metaphor has a creamy vanilla angel food cake flavor, fluffy and light. I decided against Pandoro.\r\nFA Custard premium - some moisture for the cake and it steeps fast. You could use FA custard if you want but I don't have it and don't know what the lemon notes in it will do to everything else already in  here.\r\nFW Lemon Mernigue Pie - I originally had vanilla cupcake but it wasn't behaving too low and its all icing too high and its too much vanilla.\r\nVT Buttercream frosting - you need frosting and this boosts the cupcake icing element.\r\nCAP Butter cream - backs up the buttercream frosting preventing it from being powdery\r\nVT Persian lime - some added tartness\r\nFE Lemon - non-fading and decent in bakeries.  A low amount due to lighter lemon notes from Metaphor already present.\r\nVT Vanilla cream - This stuff is just great so it has to be there.\r\nSweeten to taste\/ Vape Wizard etc you can suit yourself here but I use 0.5\/0.25.\r\nReleasing this primarily for feedback which is rare. Hope it helps someone at least get an idea.",

            "text": "Actually bought vanilla cream, lime and metaphor just to make this recipe and so glad I did.  Mixed up a 10 ml bottle of this and a few other recipes right before I went traveling.  This was the first one I tried (after 2 days even) and I was so disappointed when it was all gone!  Gonna have to make a bigger batch so I can see what it does after a steep.  Its VERY rich; the combo of the buttercreams makes you feel like you're gonna gain weight just from vaping it.  I think I might try bumping the lime up just a tad cuz Id like to see it come though a little bit more...  I know that CAP buttercream i one of those that really needs to have that steep time but I have to say it was pretty dam awesome even without it.  I carried in my pocket and shook it really good every time so that prob helped.  Mix up a big batch of this trust me on this!   Thanks for the great recipe wadeyloops!    update: after playing with it a bit, ive got this more where I like it, I upped the Persian lime to 1.5%, LMP to 2.5% &amp; lemon to 1%.  For me this gives a bit more oomph to break though that wall of heavy creams.  I also added .25% cookie to give the cake a more baked aspect."
