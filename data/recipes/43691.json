  "description": "Find your fruit heaven folks,  this is mine.  Parfait heaven.  The Spanish translation of parfait is perfecto...love it.\r\n\r\nCAP Apricot, TPA raspberry and TPA strawberry ripe have been my combo for this.  There are many others, but this one makes me happy.\r\n\r\nGC Clear  provides just enough of a bridge here to make it a parfait rather than a fruit cream alone.  FA's Butterscotch makes it even better while adding to the sweetness of the mix.\r\n\r\nNY Cheesecake, while not what I typically use, gives the effect I wanted here minus some of the buttery/coconut notes I get from TPAs  CGC.\r\n\r\nCAP Whipped Cream?  What parfait doesn't benefit from a finishing touch?\r\n\r\nRecipe inspired from some of my own work and Wayne Walker's Vanilla Pudding Cookie recipe.  \r\n\r\nAnother dripper juice that certainly needs NO added sweetener ;)  Good as a shake and vape, supreme after a week. Welcome to summer people! \r\n\r\nCuda \r\n\r\n",
