  "name": "Butter Pecan Pudding",
  "description": "I took Deejaymillsnyc's pudding base and threw in Butter Pecan and it turned out great.\r\n\r\nFLV Vanilla Pudding is pretty close to FLV Vanilla Custard just a tad bit sweeter and here it is the base we use to set up the pudding.\r\n\r\nINW Custard is the king of all custards for me now. It's so thick and creamy and best of all is it has that iconic strength we know INW for along with being good right off the shake without weeks of steeping.\r\n\r\nFLV Coconut is spendy but here, and most every where else, you're going to use drops at a time as it's incredibly strong. Here I used 1d/10ml. It just boosts the creamy and thick pudding base we are after.\r\n\r\nFW Butter Pecan rich and buttery. Has only a slight aftertaste of pecan but it is realistic. This is actually my first time using it and I'm impressed by it.\r\n\r\nThe actual pudding base is worthy of a shake and vape but the pecan needs some time to show it's face so give this 5-7 days before basking in it's glory.\r\n\r\nGive anyone of his pudding mixes a shot; you won't be disappointed!\r\n\r\nhttps://alltheflavors.com/recipes/32622#creamy_vanilla_puddin_by_deejay_mills",
