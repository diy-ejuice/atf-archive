    "description": "Jellied sweets from my childhood in New Zealand. They have a hint of a vanilla\/peaches and cream style to half of them and the jellied peach top.\r\n\r\nFA Peach White & INW Peach : The INW Peach is the main note, with the FA White Peach to boost it up.\r\nCAP 27 Bears : Brings the jelly sweet note this is a solid jellied candy flavour\r\nVanilla Swirl : This makes it a thicker mouth fell and a touch of the vanilla in there\r\nVT Fizzy Sherbet : This brightens the peach and brings it forward as well as making it more \"candy\"\r\n\r\nI hope you enjoy its my first public recipe. Its a nice SNV and not harsh for a peach vape. It settles nicely over a couple of days.... feedback good or bad is welcome!",
