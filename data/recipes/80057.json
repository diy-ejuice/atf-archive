  "description": "*Edit: Dropped the sweet cream and reduced the overall flavor percentages.  This has been a solid ADV in our house for awhile now*\r\n\r\nA creamy butterscotch RY4 inspired by the deliciousness of Glas Basix \"Butterscotch Reserve.\" \r\n\r\nEven though I was initially going for the Glas profile, at the end of the journey it turned into something completely different. This recipe ticks all the flavor profile boxes and is a satisfying desert tobacco vape that you can enjoy almost immediately. I always try to keep some on hand, but if I run out...shake and vape, baby! It just gets better over time.\r\n\r\nFlavor profiles:\r\n\r\nFA Butterscotch adds punch to the FA Caramel. Butterscotch Ripple adds a creamy roundness to really bring out the above flavors and enhance the caramel notes in the RY4.\r\n\r\nEnjoy!",
