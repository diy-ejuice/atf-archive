  "description": "Rice Pudding with Cinnamon\r\n\r\n\r\nThis took me a long time and has been my current white whale. I've tried a lot of different flavorings and combinations and have finally settled on what will be my final version of this recipe. I'm not fully convinced its 100% accurate but I think I've come as close as I can to realizing the pudding in rice pudding. Nailing the rice itself would have been very hard as it is very much a texture and not so much a flavor but nonetheless here it finally is. Puddin'\r\n\r\n\r\nCAP Horchata: I tried three different Horchata flavorings in trying to find what works and for me TFA Horchata Smooth was way to overpowering with the cinnamon. CAP Horchata is a good flavor to use since it has the rice milk note that I need to convey rice pudding. This one is more of the milk and less of the rice but it works here in conjunction with FW Horchata\r\n\r\n\r\nFW Horchata: This Horchata flavoring to me has a bit more of that rice itself which I found weird but combining it with CAP Horchata gives me the base to work with for rice pudding.\r\n\r\n\r\nCAP Vanilla Custard v1: I needed something to help make this more of a heavier vape and CAP Vanilla Custard does just that while adding in good creaminess and vanilla that I associate with Rice Pudding\r\n\r\n\r\nINW Shisha Vanilla: By far my favorite Vanilla flavoring and here it helps boost the vanilla in the recipe.\r\n\r\n\r\nJF Bavarian Cream: I wanted some more creaminess and JF Bavarian Cream is a really good flavor to use to help meld all the creams together as well as add just a bit more body\r\n\r\n\r\nFA Meringue: I wanted to try to add some sweetness to this recipe and also add a bit of a light cream on top and this helps with that\r\n\r\n\r\nCAP Vanilla Whipped Cream: Like in Don't Panic, I love the combo of CAP Vanilla Whipped Cream and FA Meringue as they really work well together so this helps add to that light cream.\r\n\r\n\r\nCAP Cinnamon Danish Swirl: I wanted some cinnamon in this recipe and TFA Horchata Smooth was just not doing it for me in adding the cinnamon. I admit I was hesistant to use CDS since the first BB competition but have been using it a bit more lately. This helps give a cinnamon flavor and also helps boost a bit of grain which helps convey the Rice Pudding profile.\r\n\r\n\r\nTFA Toasted Marshmallow: This is here to add some more sweetness and helps meld the creams further together as this is a pretty heavy cream based recipe.\r\n\r\n\r\nTFA Sweetener: I know. I am usually not a fan adding in sweetener into my recipes. Maybe it's pride or maybe its something else. Maybe the hype juice with 5% sweetener has made me weary of sweetener in general but this recipe without it just wasn't sweet enough. It just wasn't giving me that pudding sweetness that I know and love. At first I tried 1% and it was TOO sweet. But at 0.5% it gives the recipe just enough sweetness to emulate pudding without stealing the spotlight from the recipe itself.\r\n\r\n\r\nWith everything in this, I recommend a two week steep. Its pretty tasty after a week though if you are impatient like me :D. I mix mine at 80vg/20pg but feel free to let me know if you mix it at any other ratio and how it comes out. I would love to hear feedback since this has been in the works for at least like four months now which is longer than any other recipe I've worked on. <3 <3 <3",

Took me a few months to get around to making it because I was pretty sure I'd screw up something that needed more than 4 flavors. Mixed it, and put it in the cupboard of infinite patience to steep. After a week (turns out, I don't have infinite, or even very much patience at all...) this is delicious. The cinnamon doesn't overwhelm the ricey, creamy goodness, and the sweetness is perfectly pitched for my palate. I've vaped a tank, and I'm going to let the rest steep for another week to see what it's like after a fortnight.  If it gets even better then, I don't think the 100ml I mixed is going to last me very long. "

      "text": "Added 1 drop of flv rich cinnamon. Never tried horchata but this tastes alot like rice pudding to me, I might try adding some raisin-y flavours just to see if I could get this close to the rice pudding with raisins my grandma used to make me. If I ever get the chance il try this with FLV fig, sweet fig, raisin rum, or oatmeal raisin. Fuji+liquid amber could work well too. Good recipe anyways"
