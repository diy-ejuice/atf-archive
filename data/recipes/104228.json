      "text": "I love the textural component of Cereal 27; it has that wonderful crunchiness that’s second to none. The Butter Pecan emphasizes the cereal texture and bends that corn flavor into the nutty side of AP. Salted Caramel and Creme Brulee combine for a subtle toasted caramel note that goes really well with the nutty cereal. It’s not a very creamy Creme Brulee, instead focusing on the Brulee aspect which makes it stand out from the crowd. It’s different, and I like that. Really tasty stuff, Mark!"
