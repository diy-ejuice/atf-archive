  "description": "One of my favorite Youtubers has a flavor that I really enjoy, but I always had things that I said I would change about it. Once I entered the DIY realm I had my chance. This is a cool vape for after you've eaten a meal or brushed your teeth. I always have this on hand ready to be dripped. No steep necessary, but I like to let it sit for a day or two. Great on a series box. :)",
