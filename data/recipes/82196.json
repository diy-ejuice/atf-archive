    "description": "I didn't find the recipe on ATF and I had a craving.                                                                                  \r\n\r\n\r\nWAYNE, please tell me if you want this down.\r\n\r\n\r\nOriginal Link: https:\/\/diyordievaping.com\/2015\/08\/17\/rhodonite\/\r\n\r\n\r\nA sweet and tart raspberry apple flavor through out with a light crunchy almond cookie on the exhale and a sprinkle of powered sugar at the end. This flavor is wildly complex, and those with well developed palates will really appreciate all the subtleties from it. But you can also just enjoy this vape without much thought as the flavor profiles fit perfectly together. Take your time and enjoy this vape, don't rush it, or you'll miss what it has to offer.",
