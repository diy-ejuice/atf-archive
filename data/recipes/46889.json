  "description": "Using Waynes YEO LAYER (SWEET RICE/SOY MILK BASE) for this recipe. I drink a lot of loose leaf tea's. Genmai Cha is one of my favorites. This is my first time mixing with FE Green Tea.  I have read many places that green tea flavors in general taste like grass clippings. Well that is what my favorite green teas taste like, fresh cut grass. I was worried, but I find FE Green Tea to be spot on. It does taste a little stale or over steeped when compared to a fresh brewed cup.  I will update this recipe after a steep if necessary. \r\n\r\nFE Green Tea - Since this is my first time mixing FE Green Tea I will need to steep it and see if .75 is right. I am guessing it could be used at 1% or .5%. Green tea is the center of this recipe so it should be up front.\r\n\r\nFE Sweet Rice - this has a sticky rice or Jasmine/Thai rice flavor which brings that toasted  rice/nutty flavor to the tea.\r\n\r\nTPA vanilla Swirl/FA Meringue - I wasn't sure if I should leave this in the mix. After all green tea isn't really a tea to add milk to in my opinion. I think it does help round out the Green tea and rice. It may take away from the authenticity of the recipe, but I don't find it distracting.\r\n\r\n\"Genmai Cha is a classic Japanese green tea, blended with toasted, popped rice. Originally created to stretch short supplies of tea, now enjoyed by tea lovers here and abroad. Warm and nutty taste, with a lovely savory quality. A hearty cup of tea that is easy to combine with food. Genmai Cha is a great solution for those seeking a substantial, but less astringent, flavor from their cup.\"",

I think MotherPunker is right with saying it’s missing that toasty flavour, but it is a really good recipe as it is. I’m just going to play around with it to try and make it more authentic. However I went trough a bottle in no time, so it’s really good. "

      "text": "The only thing I noticed is that its missing that toasty flavor. The rice is too fresh &amp; moist.  I wonder if adding popcorn (though I've never used that flavor) to the mix, just a touch, to POP that rice... or something toasted that wouldn't over power the delicacy of the green tea.  By the way have you tried DoMatcha brand genmaicha? try it if you haven't, you'll never drink anything else ;)&#xD;\n&#xD;\nI love the Tea-Lore of this tea about the servant named Genmai who stole a pocketful of rice &amp; dropped a few grains into the the cup of the samauri lord as he served them their morning tea during a war campaign meeting.  He was instantly beheaded for the insult before the lord drank the tea anyways (as it was a luxury not to be wasted) and liked the roasted flavor so much he named it genmaicha to honor of his late servant. &#xD;\n&#xD;\nNice to see other tea fans here, I also adore genmaicha.  Its by far one of my favs. (and I makes teas/tisanes for a living as well as owning an apothecary/clinical practice so that says much!)  "
