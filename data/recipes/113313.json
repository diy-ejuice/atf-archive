  "description": "August MixersClub submission. \r\n\r\nThis is one the few 321 recipes that i threw together in past few months that didn’t turn out like shit. I think it turned out pretty tasty and showcases INW Cheesecake.\r\n\r\nThe FA Forest Fruit it a great berry mixture in my opinion and stands up well in a mix. Yes We Cheesecake quite a ridiculous name, but nonetheless it’s pretty damn tasty. Has crust notes and the “funky” cheesecake note that makes a cheesecake flavoring so good. I just wanted it a little richer and for it to have more body. Which is why I added the FLV Vanilla Pudding. It adds a nice thick body as well as a rich vanilla note in my opinion.\r\n\r\n",
