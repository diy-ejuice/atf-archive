    "description": "The Profile Im going For here is a nice skillet full of Fried Spiced Apples garnished with Pecans, Of course i Chose FLV Apple Filling as My main Flavor because its freaking awesome....I moved away from Eden Apple on this one, due to Down south we tend to mix the apples with red and granny smith tart apples ...the Granny Smiths add that tartness to the mix, along with that i chose Shape up Pear to give the mix that apple  texture. So .....so far we have a pretty easy mix .....\r\nZepolla was used to add that fried note ,,, then i chose Brown Sugar and butter pecan for my sauce and pecan layer. and rounded the whole mix of with a little Sweetner to bring everything together .... it smells divine....allow it to sit for a day to mellow out ... and enjoy  ",
