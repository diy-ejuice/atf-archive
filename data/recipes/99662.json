    "description": "Home made vanilla Ice cream with strawberry swirls is what I'll call this mix. The rose enhances the strawberries in a very nice and sweet way. It brings a certain airiness to the recipe. FA Red Touch combined with TFA Strawberry is one of my favorite strawberry blends when I'm not looking for a candy strawberry. Rose in this recipe is very delicate and not floral. I considered bumping the rose but chose against if because while it may have added additional floral notes it also can add a pungent green stem note if used too high. \r\nI Used almond to enhance my vanilla notes because I tend to be vanilla blind unless I enhance with either coconut or with almond. FA Creme fresh to add the homemade aspect of the recipe, FLV Custard (not to be mistaken with their Vanilla Custard) is a very nice smooth cream the Vanilla swirl adds the vanilla notes I was looking for and the silky ice cream texture. \r\n\r\nadditives : \r\nWS23 - because Ice cream is supposed to be cold or its just cream but feel free to omit it if you don't like cold creams.\r\n\r\nSweetener : Just because I like it a little sweeter than the flavors I chose provide ",
