  "name": "Strawberry Cheesecake Milkshake ",
  "description": "Oops! I put the whole description in the name.\r\nThe vanilla ice cream tastes like vanilla ice cream. \r\nThe cheesecake tastes like cheesecake. \r\nBoth strawberry flavors taste like strawberry. \r\nThe milkshake base is like a milkshake (unless you use too much and create a nightmare abomination).\r\nThe sweetener makes it sweet!\r\n\r\nThere’s a bazillion strawberry whatever’s and probably nobody needs another one. Too bad;)\r\nI got a new squonk setup and realized I didn’t really have an adv to put in it.\r\nMilkshake base was a new flavor but I’d already learned how much is too much (>.75) in previous experiments.\r\nI wanted to use it and I got lucky with this, first try. I keep mixing more. \r\nI’ve only steeped what I haven’t vaped yet so shake and vape. ",
