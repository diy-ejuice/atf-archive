    "description": "Oops! I put the whole description in the name.\r\nThe vanilla ice cream tastes like vanilla ice cream. \r\nThe cheesecake tastes like cheesecake. \r\nBoth strawberry flavors taste like strawberry. \r\nThe milkshake base is like a milkshake (unless you use too much and create a nightmare abomination).\r\nThe sweetener makes it sweet!\r\n\r\nThere\u2019s a bazillion strawberry whatever\u2019s and probably nobody needs another one. Too bad;)\r\nI got a new squonk setup and realized I didn\u2019t really have an adv to put in it.\r\nMilkshake base was a new flavor but I\u2019d already learned how much is too much (>.75) in previous experiments.\r\nI wanted to use it and I got lucky with this, first try. I keep mixing more. \r\nI\u2019ve only steeped what I haven\u2019t vaped yet so shake and vape. ",
