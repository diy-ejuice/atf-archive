  "description": "I felt it was time to give my BBCC Remake some new life so I reevaluated my flavor profile with some different flavors.\r\n\r\nI chose :\r\nTPA BB XTRA and CAP BB/POM w/stevia as my fruitstone I liked how the blueberries and pomegranate played nicely together the POM gave the blueberries that extra brightness I was looking for. \r\n\r\nwww.diymixerscrew.com\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UC1ENB0bSNrG_1KETYwZ154g\r\nDiscord: DIY Mixers Crew \r\n\r\nAlso on that note I placed CAP Cheesecake, DF Custard and TPA Vanilla Swirl in the same layer as my cheesecake base, and it worked wonderfully even has that lemony smooth velvety cheesecake mouthful we all love so much. \r\n\r\nAnd finally finished the whole recipe off with CAP Graham Cracker V2.... \r\n\r\nOnce mixed and shaken and vaped the recipe was very good right off the bat... A week or two should really let those fruit berries and creamy cheesecake filling come out..... ",
