  "description": "It's been a year or probably longer since I've had the original.  What I remember is it was a dry, soft sugar cookie with a very light lemon glaze note.\r\n\r\nI've tried with this with OOO Powdered Sugar in lieu of LA Cream Cheese Icing and a combo of the two and I just can't make Powdered Sugar work.\r\nCAP Sugar Cookie seems a bit high in percentage, but I think it shines at 5% in this recipe.  You get all the texture and softness of a sugar cookie.\r\nCAP Lemon Lime and TFA Lemonade Cookie give a nice light lemon note.  You don't want it to be overpowering, the original was just recognizable enough as not to be cloying.\r\n\r\nEnjoy!",
