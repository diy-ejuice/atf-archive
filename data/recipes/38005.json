  "description": "This is a very simple Blueberry Custard recipe.\r\n\r\nVanilla Custard V2 (CAP) provides the base for a good custard but lacks a bit of depth. By itself it is a good custard with some nice egg notes. The addition of New York Cheesecake V2 (CAP) and Bavarian Cream (FA) combine to add a richness and thick mouth feel that really brings the custard together.\r\n\r\nBlueberry Candy (TPA) mixed with Blueberry Extra (TPA) and Forest Mix (FA) combine to make a sweet blueberry compote that has been loosely stirred into the vanilla custard.\r\n\r\nThis recipe tastes very good right after a good shake but it has a little bit of harshness. Give it a couple weeks and it is much smoother. After four weeks it is a very nice blueberry vanilla custard that will continue to develop over the next few weeks, if it lasts that long.",
