      "text": "I tried this despite having an issue with FLV Candy Roll that not everyone has, so that's on me. The first half dozen or so draws were marred by whatever that weird rubbing alcohol note is that I seem to get from every fresh redrip of anything with FLV Candy Roll in there. After that wears off, it’s a nearly perfect purple pixie, a great grape candy. Just to be a little nitpicky, it doesn’t feel quite as powdery or granulated as a fresh hit of grape pixie stick, though, it gets a little bogged down with syrupy candy, like right after the pixie dust melts in your mouth, assuming you’re not some heathen who swallows it while it’s still sugar.
