Off the shake, it almost tastes identical to me, but I'll wait and see how it develops after a steep.\r\n\r\nThe description on the Majestic website States, \"This decadent banana creme brulee is so good, youâ€™ll find yourself prepared to scale the walls of the nearest skyscraper for just one taste!\"",

Personally, I would like the banana flavour a tad stronger, and I hope to learn how to get an ice cold milk feel to a cream. Great use of LB VIC. You really can S+V this, but it really starts to shine at 4-5 days. Spot on @mightyshill! I may play with this in the future! It's very close to Banana Ice Cream by Sticky Fingers (AU) which I want to clone ðŸ¤“"
