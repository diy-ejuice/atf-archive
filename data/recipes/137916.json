  "description": "You know how they say \"nothing good ever happens after 2am\"? Well thatâ€™s a load of s*!t. Per usual Alfred and myself (eyemakepizza) kept Isuamadog up waaay later than his bedtime, he strapped on a headlamp and we were feeling something tropical so we went to work.\r\n\r\nWe came up with Guava, Pineapple, Lime, and Apple, and some Fizz.\r\n\r\nJoin us in the Discord! https://discord.gg/ufVTyAQ\r\n\r\n\r\nSo normally this is where all the development notes would go. *Normally*. Problem is, there really aren't any. It just worked. **FLV Pink Guava** is the star of the show here and it does it so damn well. **FA Lime Tahity Distilled** and **INW Pineapple** are the background flavors here, they play off the Pink Guava really well. Even though **Cap Double Apple** is the highest % and our original intention was for it to be a dominant flavor, it ended up being very subtle and added a great bit of depth and heartiness to the overall flavor. **VT Fizzy Sherbet** does what we love it to do and adds some fizz into the mix. \r\n\r\nRight on the S&V Pink Guava is very dominant, not to the point of muting out the other flavors, but it's there, it's out front and it wants you to know it. After a day or two, the Pink Guava mellows out a touch and everything balances out but also blends together beautifully. We are left with a super tropical refreshing juice that you're not going to want to put down. \r\n\r\n\r\nJoin the discord and share your ideas!\r\n",
