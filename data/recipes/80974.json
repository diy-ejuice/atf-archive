  "name": "Peach Mango Jello Custard",
  "description": "This was born from the strawberry jello custard I posted. I'm doing the jam monster thing and releasing this with the strawberry jello, let's call it the jello monster, if you will. I was playing around with the custard layer and found that quite a few fruits worked with this layer.  \r\n\r\nFA Custard = FA Custard Premium\r\n\r\nThe Custard:\r\nI wanted more if a dairy custard and TFA Vanilla Swirl was perfect to bring in a milk like quality into the mix with the vanilla notes that I needed. FA Custard Premium is perfect for the buttery quality of custard and INW Custard adds the richness and egginess that I needed.\r\n\r\nThe Peach Mango Jello: \r\nJF honey peach is the king of peaches and works perfectly with FLV the king of mangos to create a really great candied peach and mango. Swedish fish is used low to help create a jello sensation and doesn't add too much to the taste of Swedish fish.\r\n\r\nSuper sweet is optional. What can I say, it tastes commercial now.\r\n",
