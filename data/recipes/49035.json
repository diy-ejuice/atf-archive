  "name": "HBCD - Huckleberry Cream Donut",
  "description": "I was bored today and decided to dig through my box of flavors and see what I could throw together. I had so many different strawberry and banana flavors that I had ordered during sales and tossed in the flavor box but none were sounding appetizing. Once I found the Delosi huckleberry I knew what to do. Surely I couldn't go wrong with some SA Doughnut AKA Beignet, some custard, french vanilla and a fruit. But based on the notes I had read for SA Doughnuts and RF Deep Fried Twinkie I knew the two had to meet. The SA Doughnut and the RF Deep Fried Twinkie give me that greasy doughy sweet dense doughnut flavor and texture I love so much. The TPA Vanilla Custard (my CAP VC1 is still packed away somewhere) and CAP French Vanilla create the creme filling and the Delosi Huckleberry give it a nice sweet huckleberry note that is just delightful. Surprisingly great as a shake and vape and will only improve with at least 5 days of steeping.",
