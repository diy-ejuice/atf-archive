    "description": "SA Vapecon has a DIY comp every year - this year I entered for the first time, the rules of the competition was that it was a total blind test - and also people that attend the trade-show test, no recipe information was given out - or mixer names etc (totally blind). We were also limited to a set amount of concentrates. The final product was also tested in sub ohm tanks, which added another point to consider. This was my entry, I didn't win the compo - but fuck it I love it so here you go. \r\n\r\nINW Cactus To add some wetness, and also boots the citrus notes of Juicy Lemon\r\nLB Pink Lemonade - Just a nice pink base to work from, wont work as a main note\r\nCAP Jelly Candy - Making everything a bit more artificial and soda'like\r\nRF Strawberry - What a lovely strawberry, works well in a lemonade. \r\nWS23 - I used a 20% dilution in this mix, also helps with the fizzyness.\r\n\r\nThis is a sugary soda, and the recipe has a commercial feel to it - you can sweeten, and cool to your liking. But consider its purpose when doing so! Hope you enjoy!",
