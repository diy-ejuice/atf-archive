  "name": "Crepe with Brandied Pear Glaze",
  "description": "Based off a recipe by The Wrench Reviews ( Greg ) This was his and my inspiration for a recipe on the fly while talking together. \r\nThis has been a work in progress for over a month and much help from Shyndo and mlNikon ( Emily ) with tips and tricks.\r\n\r\nBrandied Pear Glaze smothering Crepes with some Vienna Cream..\r\nThis is a very nice pear glaze to where you could switch out the crepe and add a Pound Cake or Angel Cake for a more dense vape.\r\nThe Liquid Amber with Brown Sugar make the Pear pop for flavor. This is not an overly sweet vape and taste is very subjective to where you can change out the sweetener.\r\n\r\nAfter messing around with the Liquid Amber I will put out a warning.. DO NOT USE IT AT HIGH PERCENTAGES .50% max it can destroy the recipe if used to high.",
