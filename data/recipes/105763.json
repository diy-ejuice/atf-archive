  "description": "If you like Head Bangin' Boogie by Charlie's Chalk Dust you might wonna give this one a try.\r\n\r\nIt's a blueberry popsicle with a raspberry note to it.\r\nMost of the time INW Raspberry is a bully in a recipe, not this time.\r\nI tried to mix it a lower percentages but 1% seems to be right to me.\r\nThe INW Raspberry and FLV Boysenberry are just what FW blueberry needed to pop in this mix.\r\nTart and Sour is optional, but IMO it helps CAP Lemon Lime a bit. If you don't use it you might wonna bump up the Lemon Lime a percent.\r\nSuper Sweet is optional.\r\n\r\nI'm mixing for a few years now. Most of my mixes are based on premium juice profiles.\r\nMy recipes are remixes and not clones. In my attempts to remix these juices I'm always trying to make\r\nit as good as, or even better than the commercial juice without the loads of sweetener these companies throw in.\r\n\r\nGive it a try and enjoy ....................................",
