  "description": "I wanted to do a peanut butter pie similar to the one you can get at Outback Steakhouse occasionally. (not sure when it's \"in season\") It's a creamy peanut butter pie that's very rich and uses Nutter Butter in their crust instead of graham. It's not 100% that... but it's very good.\r\n\r\nThis does become richer with a week+ steep but it's pretty good after a day. \r\n\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQ2Yg6tK0k&t=1s",
