  "description": "My adaptation of Shindo's D-Cream, a bangin re-imagined version of Mustard Milk. Basically, Shin came up with the idea to mix up Fuji and VBIC, and I decided to dive in and refine it. So, before anything, shoutsout Shindo for fuckin around and giving me the ideas in this recipe.\r\n\r\nFA Fuji / FA Pear / TPA Pear - if you've been paying attention, the combination of FA Pear and TPA Pear creates one of the most accurate and delicious pear notes in the game right now. By itself, it tastes great, but using these two as the support to FA Fuji is nothing short of heavenly. The pears help soften some of the harsh ends of FA Fuji, while also adding some sweetness and depth to it. You don't inherently taste the pear notes here, but they add something special to the fuji. This is gonna be my new go-to when I want to add FA Fuji to recipe as a base note.\r\n\r\nTPA Vanilla Bean Ice Cream / HS French Vanilla Ice Cream - another winning combination. Usually, in recipes like this, we see TPA VBIC at a much higher percentage because it gives a decent mouthfeel on the shake and vape, but steeps into something magical. However, in this recipe, the use of HS FVIC in tandem with the TPA Marshmallow, I was able to keep TPA VBIC low. While not only helping to cut out some of that inherent pepper note that some people pick up on, using TPA VBIC at 2.25% keeps it from overpowering the mix after a few days of steeping. The HS FVIC picks up the slack by adding a more authentic vanilla note, some incredible maltiness, and a very rich sweetness.\r\n\r\nTPA Marshmallow - I still have an obsession with this concentrate. It can work as an emulsifier, it can be a sweetener, and it can add some real flavour. In this recipe, I'm making it implement all three. The marshmallow is here to help bind the fruits together, act as a boost of sugary sweetness to the creams, and just include a touch of some marshmallow flavour. Not that I'm trying to create any sort of mashmallow flavour profile, but using it as an accent note to the ice cream is just perfect. This flavour can be altered to your own personal liking, but don't push it over 3%, that's where you will start changing this profile into a fruity marshmallow cream. But hey, if that's your thing, go for it.\r\n\r\nSteep time - this shit bangs as a shake and vape. However, it will feel separated, and the Fuji will have a much sharper bite to it. Even just an overnight steep helps mellow things out, but let it sit for about 4 days to get a really rich profile. This is the kind of recipe that just keeps getting better over time. But, you know, don't be fucking stupid and steep it for 6 months and then wonder why it tastes like shit.\r\n\r\nThere we go. Thanks Shindo, you're my prince.",
