  "description": "A bright tropical blend of Cherimoya, Guanabana, Mango, and Cherries in a delicate whipped cream.\r\n\r\nINW Mango: I started originally with FLV Mango but found it to stand out too much and take on a syrupy tone when combined with the others. At 2% the mango is straightforward and present, with a mild \"green\" note freshly mixed. This helps create a strong tropical base for the Guanabana and Cherimoya flavors to work their magic.\r\n\r\nFLV Guanabana: My first attempts used this much higher, but I found it to also take on a sort of syrupy texture when I used it too high, so over a few revisions I dialed it back to 1.5%. At this percentage, in conjunction with Cheriymoya, we get a nice authentic Soursop that's both tangy and bright.\r\n\r\nINW Cherimoya: This stuff is potent as hell, but authentic. Freshly mixed it'll overpower the Guanabana but after a steep they blend well to create a singular Soursop flavor. It has a bit of a peel flavor to it that I feel adds to the authenticity without overtly affecting the final profile.\r\n\r\nINW Cherries: Anything less than 2% and you can't taste them in this mix at all. Initially I feared this would cause some unwanted medicinal flavors, but I found that when combined with other strong bodied flavors they did exactly the opposite. A bright, but not overpowering cherry note to sweeten the final mix. Initially I used a few strawberry variations in the place of this, but found the INW Cherries to do a much better job at sweetening the mix while adding a little more tartness to the final profile.\r\n\r\nCAP Vanilla Whipped Cream: All original versions of this contained FA Whipped Cream, but as it's been discontinued I reformulated to use CAP. This final touch adds a light, but sweet cream base to smooth over some of the green/tart notes while creating a nice sweet finish that doesn't take away from the authenticity of the fruits or add a granulated sugar type flavor. At 2.5% it's perceptibly present, but not overly so.",
