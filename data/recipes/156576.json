  "description": "I just grabbed a handful of flavors that I've observed from all the recipes that have worked well together,  mixed em up and forgot about it for a while.  When I went back to see how bad it was, I was pleasantly suprised at how good it was.  It's a nice bold but blended butterscotch.  It's not artificially bright at all, as  it leans towards the dark side of the spectrum.  Just enough natural sweetness at the end to keep ya drippin'.  I didn't add any sweetener but to each his own.  The longer she steeps the better but I liked it off the shake.\r\n\r\n**If you mix it, I encourage you to leave a review.  Besides having a bunch of recipes to try out, the feedback and sense of community is what makes this site great.    You don't gotta write a book, but any suggestions or critiques are welcome.",
