  "description": "An awesome base layer of sugar cookie enhanced by the cookie butter, layering in some butterscotch cream pie bolstered by fw butterscotch and deepened with bavarian cream. Layering in some fresh slices of apples balanced delicately with apple pie spices. Some crumble topping to finish things off!!\r\n\r\nGive this a week to become balanced and full bodied.\r\n\r\nI always add .3% SS, or 1 drop per 10ml. I am testing this on a .35 fused clapton in a pixie drop at 45-50w",

I really love this recipe, it's well balanced and I like that I can taste all the different elements. Although my tastebuds are tempting me to play around with it and give the apples a boost, it would likely mess up the balance you've got here. Fantastic mixing +1 I've mixed a couple of your recipes this week. You are very talented! Graham toff tarkin... Oh my lord!"
