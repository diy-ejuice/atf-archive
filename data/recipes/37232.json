  "description": "I mixed this at 3 mg nic with nic select nic from nic river\r\ntested on a 528 Custom Goon with one coil and 1-2 air holes open at .26 ohm 50 watts\r\n\r\nthe vape is smooth and flavorful, sweet, but not too sweet and it's tangy.\r\nReminds me of a blue sweet-tart almost, but not quite that tangy, maybe a blue razzberry jolly rancher?\r\nIt could easily be an all day vape, and i'll definitely be mixing up more of this in the future.\r\n\r\nAlthough, it takes a few hours/ 1 day to work the alcohol taste out of the blue razz, but it's still a good vape, just a bit of a throat hit.\r\n\r\nI'll be updating these notes after i finish the first 100ml i mixed up, just in case anything changes, or if a short steep changes any of the flavors.\r\n\r\nbut for now, if anyone is looking for a really low flavor% juice, consider grabbing some RF Blue Razz and giving this a try!\r\n\r\n\r\nEDIT: It's been 3 days, and the throat hit is way down now, much better vape. Though I think the Bilberry is bringing the sweetness down just a tad too much. I would suggest adding a bit of super sweet, just adjust to tastes.",
