  "description": "Past√©is de Nata AKA Portuguese Custard Tarts.\r\n\r\nThis recipe came about after seeing Grimm Green review a juice called 'Taruto', it sounded delicious but being from Australia, I wasn't able to find it without paying exorbitant shipping costs; thus I decided to try and make my own take on the profile.\r\n\r\nNOTES:\r\n\r\nTPA PIE CRUST / CAP FUNNEL CAKE / INW BISCUIT / TPA BUTTER \r\nThis is the base for the butter pastry cup. They all mix together well to create a nice flaky, all butter, decadent pastry for the custard to sit on.\r\n\r\nCAP VAN CUSTARD / CAP CDS  / FW DULCE DE LECHE / FLV COOKIE DOUGH\r\nThis is obviously the custard filling, the vanilla custard, dulce de leche and cookie dough create a nice dense custard with caramel notes, having the vanilla custard at such a high percentage means the eggy notes are pretty obvious and up there which is what I wanted, however adds a lot to the steep time. The Dulce de Leche adds more of a sweetened milkiness to the custard, it adds a brightness and really boosts it into something delicious and unique. The Cinnamon Danish swirl is there to add the cinnamon, is also adds a bit of fluffiness to the pastry base. I would have just gone with FLV Rich Cinnamon instead of CDS, however I don't have it, give it a try?\r\n\r\nTPA BROWN SUGAR / TPA TOASTED MARSHMALLOW\r\nThis works with the cookie dough and toasted marshmallow to create a caramelized and 'burnt sugar' taste to the custard, like it's fresh out of the oven. The toasted marshmallow was also added to fluff everything out and provide the nice mouth feel you get from the recipe. \r\n\r\nGive this bad boy at least a 10 day steep to let the custard really come together.\r\n\r\nAs always, constructive criticism is always welcome.\r\n\r\n",

It's one of those concentrates that I could find in ANY juice... But that's just me I guess... Good job, it still is delicious!"

You could taste the crust and tart, after getting a nice and sweet mouthfull of the custard. I'm not a huge fan of VC1 because its been so overused but it fits perfectly here. Its not TOO overpowering, and is helped by other flavors here to be tame. Overall I enjoyed this very much. "

I've personally not had Taruto but after seeing the flavor profile I was intrigued and saw this suggested in the Taruto Reddit thread in diy_ejuice. This recipe is absolutely delicious. I would highly recommend it to anyone that enjoys a great desert vape."
