  "description": "Was chatting to my dad about the Manchester bombing an said it would be nice to do something for the victims an families, but didnt know what ?.\r\nSo he suggested why not donate some money from a recipe you sell to friends family etc so im gonna donate my profits to the fund \r\nSo maybe some of the  mixing community could do the same if you are able to help what is obviously a worthy cause \r\n\r\nManchester news have a fund on https://www.justgiving.com/crowdfunding/westandtogethermanchester an are 78% towards there total of raising Â£2 million for the families \r\n\r\nThe recipe is one i finished last month an have had really good feed back \r\nFLV Pink Guava  -after reading reviews on the sub i picked this up an i was over the moon with how it vaped ! Tons of flavour as expected with flavorah stuff but as good as i find some of there stuff they do have some shockers !! Its the main note through the whole recipe an it was begging to be paired with a good grapefruit imo \r\nINW  Grapefruit - A very sweet tart grapefruit that marrys well with the pink guava for the recipe ! Super fresh an perfect for this weather ! To high % an i felt some throat hit so 1.5 % was my sweet spot \r\nTPA Dragonfruit/INW Raspberry  - The supporting star in alot of fruit recipes pumps up the other fruits an with a bit of raspberry give the recipe some body an a nice secondary layer with some weight \r\nWS-23 - Never been a Koolada fan but Ws-23 is  good addition to keep that cool tropical flavour on a hot day \r\nTPA Ethyl maltol just tames down the tartness of the grapefruit an smooths the sharper notes together \r\nCAP super sweet - FOR THE WIN :-) \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
