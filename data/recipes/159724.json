  "description": "This is DMC's Version of Vaptasia Killer Kustard. Being that this is only v1 and first attempt,  I feel that this is already spot on.  if you feel that you need more inw marzipan feel free to add another 0.25% to the mix. I was on the fence myself with this flavor but its up to you. Also as mentioned in the video I tried Capella's Vanilla custard v2 but it did not seem to sit right. @Tamvapes said she was getting a heavy butyric taste from the OG killer kustard so I gave it a go. I don't know maybe it me or my v2 is bad granted it is a couple years old.  @Daddykane91 subbed Inw marzipan with FA Marzipan 1:1  giving this a different twist on the original clone. Feedback always welcome. Enjoy!!! More notes and description here https://youtu.be/UatBMwi7qvk",

It's so subtle that it doesn't cross your mind until you think about it .  And when you do it's just chillin in the back of the room, minding its own business.  . That's what sets this clone apart from the others in my book.  Nice job.  It's good to go off the shake!  Looking forward to whats next!!"
