  "description": "Just a delicious Fall recipe fo yo ass... Autumn/Winter is my all time favorite time of year.  It's the time to start putting away all the fruity, light flavors and once again start breaking out the heavy custards, creams and bakeries (my specialty). So, to start it off I decided to share this little number. A tasty almond custard RY4. Very simple recipe and a pretty basic profile. Nonetheless, it's freakin' scrumptious and perfect for that Fall vaping. Throw a hoodie on and walk the leaf invested streets. Give this baby some time, the custard needs it as does the tobacco. 10 days and you're golden Pony Boy..\r\n\r\nFLV Milk & Honey and CAP Graham Cracker really bump up the almond custard flavor here. The graham even brings a bit of cinnamon without even having cinnamon, I love it. But anyways, give it a shot, I promise you won't be disappointed.",

I usually think ry4s are too sweet but the cured and toasted balance out great."
