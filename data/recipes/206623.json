  "description": "Hobbit's snack, the tale of a muffin, a journey through Flavorah Land.\r\nThe base here is lembas bread and popcorn. At 1.3% it's just the right amount to shine and popcorn is here to add a little bit of butter and a tiny bit of texture. I use jammy berry as a dark fruit base(at 0.3% it's not too syrupy) and add a combination of three brighter fruit( peach, persimmon and cranberry) to lighten jammy berry and add a fresh and sweet fruitiness. Sweetness is a little bit high at .8% but I wanted to make a \" fun to eat muffin\" not a diet one....allow 5 to 7 days for lembas bread to show up nicely and to jammy berry to calm down. Enjoy!",
