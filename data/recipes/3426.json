Or maybe not overnight, but at some point since the last time I had some TFA VBIC, which couldn’t have been that long ago. As best I can tell when I try my best to ignore the pepper and not hold it against the recipe, there seems to be a terrific thick, sweet ice cream base here. I don’t taste much chocolate, certainly not enough for chocolate almond ice cream. That is probably not a bad thing because what chocolate is there tastes like tootsie roll and I really don’t want more of that. However, the snap of clear but complex and sweet almond on the end is just absolutely perfect for this. I’d to love to see this one redesigned with a pepper-free ice cream and a more authentic and stronger chocolate, but keeping that same perfect almond finish.  "
