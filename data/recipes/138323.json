  "description": "Old school fizzy sherbet strawberry boiled sweets, fresh (probably a bit sweaty and stuck together) from the sweety shop and served by the squinting fat lady with the huge mole on her nose. \r\n\r\nThis worked out well off the bat, definitely tastes like authentic strawberry sherbet sweets to me. This probably could be tweaked a little but I'm enjoying it as it is for now. \r\n\r\nBenefits from a day or so of steeping to settle in, and for the lemon to sit further back and add the tart note I was looking for. The VT Sherbet works well here, giving a nice little fizz to the profile.  I guess you could substitute the JF Sweet Strawberry for Capella's version, but it's a candy-like strawberry that adds to the fake strawberry in these sweets, I think.  Anyway, hope you enjoy and feedback is always welcome.\r\n\r\nHappy vaping :)",
