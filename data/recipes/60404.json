  "description": "\r\nThe Tobacco Base: FLV Arabian, INW TA Virginia, TFA Red Oak. Arabian tobacco has probably been the trickiest tobacco I've ever tried to use. It was dominating mixes for me at .1%. I never completely gave up on it though because it has something that I really like about it. It's incredibly earthy, musky, and a bit acrid. Very authentic tasting. Just so fucking strong. Perfect here at .12%. The Virginia is also very earthy, but more of a grassy/hay type of thing. Along with the TFA Red Oak, it really blends with the Arabian nicely to complete the base. \r\n\r\nThe Pumpkin Spice: this recipe was a request, and when it was first requested I hit up the googles to see what pumpkin spice was all about. Found an essential oils recipe to make a pumpkin spice scent, so I just went with that. Ginger, cinnamon, clove, Cardamom, and nutmeg. All things I was already playing with for what I had planned to be a Christmas recipe. I wanted to use some other tobacco flavors to make up as much of the pumpkin spice profile as I could. Why? Because why not? Cinnamon I went with FE Hongtashan. It's got a very distinct Cinnamon note to it. It's a warm and dark flavor, which is perfect for the season. INW Falcon Eye is for the ginger. When I first tested this flavor, ginger jumped out at me. Not much tobacco, but that's ok. I just use it as a ginger flavor. NBD. Nutmeg I went with FLV Eggnog. It's got a nice spice taste that isn't too strong on the eggy part, so I think it works well here to give me the nutmeg I needed, and also help the Hongtashan with the cinnamon. It doesn't push it too far in to winter flavor territory (or at least I hope not.) The clove and cardamom kind of speak for themselves i think. I originally picked them both up for an Arrakis clone, and I've been fiddling with them quite a bit the last month. Very easy for them to get a little out of control, so I keep 'em low. \r\n",

As it stands, very well balanced, complex, and the tobacco note is a lot more subtle than you'd think just looking at the ingredients.  I like how nutmeg forward the the eggnog makes this, and the clove an the cardamom are really solid supporting players.  I'm a unfamiliar with all of the tobaccos here except the arabian, but there's a really nice balancing act going on with making all of these aggressive flavors play nicely with each other.  I liked it even more after throwing a drop of FLV Classic Cigarette in, because if anything gets lost in all this layering it's a bit of dirty ashtray.  Great recipe."
