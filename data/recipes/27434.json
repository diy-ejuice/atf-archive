  "description": "This is an adaptation of The Real: Strawberry Cheesecake REMIX by [ENYAWREKLAW]\r\n\r\nThis is a very simple flavor swap that turned out to be my new all day vape. Using TFA Blueberry Extra in place of Strawberry Ripe and TFA Blueberry Candy in place of CAP Sweet Strawberry creates a flavor that tastes like a Blueberry Syrup. I kept them both at the same percentages. The only other substitution is TFA Sweet Cream in place of CAP Sweet Cream. This choice was purely out of convenience as I didnt have the CAP version.\r\n\r\nI tested the first batch that I made at the following intervals.\r\n\r\nS&V - Tastes good. Nice and sweet but lacks any real depth. A bit too strong on the Blueberry.\r\n2 Days - About the same but a bit more body from the Cheesecake and the Blueberry is a little better.\r\n7 Days - Starting to get that baked flavor. The Blueberry has calmed down a bit but is still sweet and flavorful.\r\n14 Days - About the same as 7 but a little smoother.\r\n30 Days - OK, I am in love! The flavors have all come together as a real Cheesecake. Amazing! The Blueberry is perfectly sweet but not overpowering. I am very happy with the results.\r\n\r\nI just opened a bottle that has been steepeng for 8 weeks. I also made a fresh batch 4 weeks ago so that I could compare the two. The difference between them is very subtle. The cheesecake is a tiny bit more pronounced but still not overly cheesy.",
