    "description": "Just threw some FA flavors together and it came out very well for those of you who love a fruity mix throw this together i recommend 1-2 % TFA sweetener . If you like WS-23 add 1-2 % also . also there is A  liquid on the market that is 10% for us for in like three or 4% sweetener . so no 10% is a perfect amount for forest fruits especially as a standalone flavor forest fruit is acting as the foundation of the whole recipe and the pear gives it some more depth , with the papaya giving it a delightful experience. Don\u2019t be afraid to mix this!",
