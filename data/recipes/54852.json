  "name": "Cherry Belonging",
  "description": "It's often said that possession is nine-tenths of the law, but when it comes to... certain things, I still subscribe to the playground rule of ownership: \"I licked it, it's mine.\" This abstract recipe, made of only ingredients found in All The Flavors' June 2017 Awesome Box, was inspired by that philosophy. \r\n\r\nCherry Blossom is an ingredient you generally want to use as an accent at lower than 4%, as it can even be the focal point of a recipe as low as 2%, but here the higher % is needed to make it the star and to make its cherry flavor stand out in the mix. The rich ice cream pulls its floral top notes way down but doesn't extinguish them entirely, which is good, they keep things interesting.. The pink part of LB's Pink Lemonade, which is a delightful powdered-mix pink lemonade flavor on its own, further enhances the red fruity flavor of Cherry Blossom. With a little help from FLV Cream, the lemonade combines with that cherry flavor for something oddly somewhat reminiscent of a Sonic Drive-In \"Cherry Limeade CreamSlush,\" which is just their cherry limeade blended with ice and soft-serve ice cream.
