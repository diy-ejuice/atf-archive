  "description": "I love frilly coffee vapes, especially when it’s not so crazy hot outside. With fall fast approaching I thought I’d break out my favorite coffee flavoring, Purilum Caramel Coffee with Sweet Milk. To me, it’s the perfect balance of medium roasted coffee with a nice caramel cream backbone done right with no burnt tire taste. I used it low because I didn’t want the coffee to be to forward. \r\n\r\nButterscotch Ripple was used accentuate the caramel. Vanilla Cream Extra, Marshmallow Vanilla and Sweet Cream help thicken the cream layer and add a nice vanilla note.\r\n\r\nChocolate Mousse is such wonderful flavor that really works well here IMO. I tried several different strawberries and decided to go with Red Touch because of its brightness, but feel free to experiment. Sweetener is optional if that’s your thing. For me, it’s great without it.\r\n\r\nCreams need a a few days to steep, but very tasty as a shake and vape. \r\n\r\nTested on a Basic RDA with a 0.8 ohm 2.5 ml nano clapton coil at 16 watts on a Neo60 Squonker.\r\n\r\nHope you enjoy and rate it. Would love your feedback too!",
