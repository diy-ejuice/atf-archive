  "description": "Just in time for spring/summertime a non harsh close to fresh watermelon\r\nStill going to have a slight jolly rancher taste at the end of the exhale\r\n\r\nhttps://youtu.be/6uUcFHooU6c\r\n\r\nSuper sweet optional at .5%\r\n\r\nOoo marshmallow vanilla....used here for sweetness but mainly to cut the harshness off the watermelon. Also adds a little creamy texture...as I️ think about eating watermelon the real ripe melons to me do have a slightly creamy texture to them\r\n\r\nOne drop flavors....weaker flavor concentrates so they are going to be used at a higher percentage than we are used to but in this instance since the are weaker it makes it slightly easier to cut or hide the notes we don’t want...ie harsh jolly rancher candy note\r\n\r\nFa pear....this brings some sweetness as well as helping to brighten the fruits while lending a little texture to this mix",

After about 2 weeks, it goes through an interesting transformation. The vanilla notes in the marshmallow come out to play, and you get a vibrant, juicy, borderline candied, yet realistic watermelon. And this is in a pod system i'm tasting this!&#xD;\n&#xD;\nGreat stuff!"
