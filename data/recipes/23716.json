  "name": "The Fig Lebowski",
  "description": "This is purely a concept recipe I happened upon while watching an episode of Bob's Burgers. The burger of the day was \"The Fig Lebowski\", so I thought to myself; \"Self... the Dude likes White Russians... I wonder if figs go with coffee, chocolate and cream.\" Well, according to the Flavor Bible they do, so, off I went.\r\n\r\nThe result is surprisingly delicious. Smooth, creamy, with a subtle, dark fruitiness, it almost reminds me of a pipe tobacco! (a touch of your favorite tobacco wouldn't go amiss here) The INW Mocca is just a hint, but it's there. I bet you could swap the ratios between that and CAP Fig if it's more to your taste, but, though this is a first draft, I'm hesitant to mess with it too much, because it's really quite nice where it is.
