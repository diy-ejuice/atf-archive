  "description": "Building anticipation? \r\n\r\nI wasn't able to talk about these on the show if you were listening, had a little weather event. So let me drop some quick notes for you all.\r\n\r\nMelon rind... Tested it 1.5% didn't get a watermelon rind no more of a dry cantaloupe. Super fucking weird and I'm sure we can think ID10-T for getting this into production. Wasn't really sure what to do with it to a dinner recipe with some cream and was really surprised how well it accents the custard.\r\n\r\nSweet and Smokey tobacco... Just like the name States it's definitely sweet has a nice Smoky flavor, also picking up some cash this is a no-brainer FLV does tobacco use nobody else\r\n\r\nMarshmallow vanilla... Another great vanilla flavoring, the name doesn't really do it justice. It's a sort of ice cream topping marshmallow. I went through buy original tester in less than an hour.\r\n\r\nSmoked butterscotch... It's not one of their new flavorings. great butterscotch flavor I don't personally get a lot of smoke. In this recipe it is more of an accent.\r\n\r\nCustard... I just threw in my favorite,  if you know your shit, you can probably put any custard you would like at your preferred percentage. ",
