    "description": "This is a twist on an traditional Italian peach cookie. The traditional cookie does not have any peach in it but the they are dipped in an Italian liqueur called Alchermes which gives them a peach color and then they are rolled in sugar. Alchermes can be hard to find out side of Italy and it is often substituted with peach liquor in america.   Alhtough it tends to have a light cherry note and can be a little bitter.   On the inhale you get the almond cookie  with \r\n some of the custard and on the  exhale you get the  slight peach note.   \r\n\r\n**WF almond cookie and FA marzipan** create the soft cookie base for the peach cream, WF almond cookie is simply spot on and I try to use whenever i can .\r\n**FA premium custard** I went back and forth on the cream filling here and tried Bavarian creme, catalan cream and Vienna cream and all can work but I just really liked it best with the premium custard\r\n**WF cream peach pie** The peach in WF is just a perfect slightly cooked peach that works here \r\n**FA apricot** adds some depth to the peach and helps add some of the deeper notes\r\n**FA lemon** helps the sweet notes pop and is used in the actual Italian recipe \r\n**sugar orchid** I have been struggling with how to use this flavor and I think I have finally figured it out  -  as it has a lovely light cherry vanilla back note with an almost grainy sugar texture.. It is pretty potent. The traditional liquor that is used in this recipe has some cherry notes and the cookie is rolled in sugar \r\n**shisha Vanilla** is added simple to support the vanilla notes in this mix \r\n\r\nSTEEP  5 - 7 days  min  for  custard to settle in  - this is a subtle flavor profile and may be be for every one but it is unique doe snot assault the palate \r\n\r\n**NOTES: you can sub or add the folowing:** \r\nSUB for FA premium custard: for a lighter cream  with less of a eggy note you can use TPA Bavarian cream, FLV vanilla pudding or JF Bavarian cream for a lighter cream with less of an eggy note. \r\nIf you want to support the lemon top note add FA custard \r\nFeel free to add sweetner to your taste I use FLV  at .30 \r\nFLV basil : these cookies are often eaten with mint or basil , adding a low percentage of basil to this mix gives a unique finish that adds a light savory note to the mix",
