No pounding flavors in here just a really nice mix of the graham cracker with a bit of cream and honey. The mashmallow brings it all together and adds a delicious slighly toasted undertone. Very nice "

I have issues with FLV cream and for some reason Toasted Marshmallow amplifies that tangy off note I get. At first I thought I'd bring the TM down. Next I tried subbing FA Cream Fresh in. Bingo. FLV Tangy Cheese was the culprit! Love it with this 1:1 sub. "

How is something so unfussy this satisfying?! I think you're under-selling this one. There's a lot going on here for a tired palate to see and do. Seriously yummy stuff. Thanks for another banger, CheebaSteeba!"

Definitely a good mix and a good flavoring. The way it tastes I'm sure it will improve even more after additional days in the steep box."
