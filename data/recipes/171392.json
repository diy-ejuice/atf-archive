  "name": "Drizzled Strawberry Cheesecake Cream     (Glazed, Jam, New York, Yes We, Sweet) ",
  "description": "A creamy cheesecake topped with glazed strawberries. I purposely made this recipe without an emphasis on the crust. This strawberries and cream aims to please.\r\n\r\nThe cheesecake is New York Cheesecake PUR which is the main cheesecake note. I mixed in some Yes We Cheesecake INW, which richens it up at this % without adding a crust. Strawberry Cheesecake LB is the bridge.\r\n\r\nGlazed Strawberries VT adds the glaze and Strawberry Jam thickens up the glaze. Strawberry Sweet JF backs up the strawbwerry glaze.\r\n\r\nGive this one a mix. Please don't sub any ingredients to get the true representation of the recipe I spent many iterations on balancing. This includes the sweetener used and by all means, omit it or lower it, if you don't like adding it.\r\n\r\n*Steep for at least 5 days for the flavors to come together but if you want it off the shake, it's a go.\r\n\r\nThis was developed in the Rebirth rda, Jenna rda, and the Intake Dual rta, using various fused clapton N80 coils. Personally, I love this using a larger single coil in the Intake Dual rta using a high resistance coil (0.9 - 1.1 ohm) at 6 volts. \r\n\r\nIf you have the Intake Dual, try a higher resistance larger diameter single coil and push some higher voltage and you'll be surprised how good that rta is when used this way. \r\n\r\nBuild low, build high, this recipe is really good either way.\r\n\r\nIf you do mix this, enjoy and please leave a review and a comment.
