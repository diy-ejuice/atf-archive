  "description": "Made for the Saturday  Fresh 03 show  - simple tasty mixes \r\nOff the shake  this has  a  thick creamy milky caramel  (from   dulce de leche)   note on the inhale that  transitions   to  a full creamy vanilla   cheesecake  with a light toasted coconut note  on the exhale.   Nice off the shake  better at 3 - 5 day s\r\n\r\nSUBS: \r\nI prefer  JF  dulce de leche to TPA   is just a fuller creamier  profile but  TPA can be also be used at the same % \r\nIf you do not want a predominant  coconut  note  you can sub TPA  cheesecake  (graham cracker) for the  PUR toasted coconut cheese cake  as TPA cheese cake has a light coconut note to it as well.  \r\nif you do not have  OOO vanilla custard cheesecake  you can sub INW yes we can cheesecake  they both have a very creamy body with a light vanilla note   to it.  \r\nThis will need a 3 -  5 day steep for the cheesecake to really come forward .  \r\n",
