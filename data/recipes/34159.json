  "description": "Strap-On is like a choose your own adventure recipe, just stick something in there and shake it up, it'll probably be tasty. I've tried many variations of @ID10-T's Strap-On and was surprised to find out that the Mango-Man himself hadn't thought up this one first. Finally releasing it to the world, behold my Manly Strap-On! \r\n\r\n",

I’m not the biggest fan of FLV Mango over 1% so I was a bit worried I’d get pure mango vaping this. I’m glad to say that is not the case here, the apple, strawberry, and watermelon do a fantastic job of keeping that Mango in check and not overpowering everything. The 30ml I mixed isn’t gonna last very long! The only thing that could make this better is if I was with Apexified on a beach vaping this tropical wonder!"

It's like a strap-on in paradise. That sweet, nectary mango juices up the basic and slightly dry strap-on beautifully and gives a tropical twist to the other flavors without obscuring them at 1.5%. The only thing I don't love about it is that I didn't think of it myself. Thanks for this one, Apexified!  "
