  "name": "Smurfenade (Blue Raspberry Lemonade)",
  "description": "This is my take on a simple blue razz lemonade.  LB and OSSDIY are clearly the best Blue Razz flavors, but even combined at a high percentage need a little support, which is why added in the INW Rasp.  I love using INW rasp low to bolster the Blue Razz flavor and make it pop.\r\n\r\nI didn't want to cheat this recipe and build on my puckenade, so I took a shot at using some other lemons.  I really like the VT Lemonade clear its a nice lemonade with a touch of fizz, I don't really get the fizz in this, but that's because I didn't want this to be fizzy.  The vt sour lemon is extremely potent and adds some of that fresh lemon pucker and the FW Lemonade is just a lemonade support.\r\n\r\nI used the TFA Pear as a bit of sweet blender along the cactus to round some of the sharp edges.  For you cactus haters out there I can't taste any cactus since it's used so low.  The WS-23 and Cap SS can be used in whatever quantity you prefer.  For a simple recipe this took 2 additional revisions after I first mixed it, so this was nice little challenge.",
