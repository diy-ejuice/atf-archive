    "description": "Passionfruit? In a custard?\r\nYou\u2019re god damn right...\r\nThis is perfect, it\u2019s thick, buttery and the citrus from the passionfruit cuts through all of that to give a nice tangy but deep, smooth vape. \r\n\r\nThere was something itching my brain whilst vaping this, I couldn\u2019t pin point where I tasted this certain combination before, then it clicked... Solero ice cream! Now this isn\u2019t a solero recipe but it will tickle that part of your brain.\r\n\r\nThis is just a good combination of custard (and sugar cookie \ud83d\ude0f) that will surely satisfy you, wether you\u2019re a fruit fanatic or a custard cunt this will probably scratch that itch for you (ok that\u2018s enough of the itchy scratchy adjectives) \r\n\r\nIf you\u2019re sensitive to CAP V1 then give this 2 weeks, which is where it really excels but I\u2019d be lying to you if I told you I didn\u2019t cain this off the shake, infact I had to make another 30ml just for it to reach that 2 week mark. \r\n\r\nMix it, shake it, vape it.\r\n\r\nSweetener: optional \r\nSugar cookie: not optional\r\n\r\nIf you like this recipe and what I do then rate and review accordingly or I\u2019ll tell you the ending to Netflix\u2019s\/BBC\u2019s \u201cThe fall\u201d",

            "text": "This is a nice custard base with the passionfruit bringing in a little extra something to the mix. I find the passionfruit present but a little subtle in a good way as it doesnt take anything away from the custard. Seems to feel quite saturated, not in a wicking kind of way but in the mouthfeel. Very nice vape, might remix and increase the passionfruit slightly and see how it goes. &#xD;\nThanks Nick \ud83d\udc4a"
