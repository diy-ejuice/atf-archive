      "text": "Very nice almond cookie! As the name suggests, it is straight up a simple almond cookie. I like the way Sugar Cookie and Marzipan give it a dense yet fluffy body and the custard sort of smooths things out and bridges the flavors and textures. I can see why the Acetyl Pyrazine was used (brought in there to give it some texture), but I'm not a big fan of the flavor on acetyl pyrazine and typically use it a little lower, so that's why I knocked it a star (maybe some FA Cookie in it's place?). Other than that, this is an excellent recipe and good vape!"
