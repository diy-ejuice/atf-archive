    "description": "Sitting here in Minnesota during an April snow storm dreaming of summer.  I then single flovor tested Apollo Feljoa and it felt like a fruity summer escape.  That's when a 123 is born.  Add in some punchy strawberry and the wonderful pink guava a wonderful summer getaway comes to life.  The recipie is built off the pink guava.  The strawberry and Apollo accent it perfectly and bring out new notes and fill it out.  Juicy, fruity, bright, and punchy.   Enjoy",

I like the Pink Guava and strawberry pairing but there\u2019s just something too green and unripe about Apollo Feijoa for me, like a banana that\u2019s not ripe enough to be edible yet, and it\u2019s not mitigated here. Still, this makes me want to do a different 1-2-3 with Pink Guava and Strawberry and something else. Maybe a banana that\u2019s not underripe, a coconut, or something fun like FLV Guanabana."

It smells like absolute death I really considered throwing it away it smells so bad, like almost made me barf. So I wondered what in the world would anyone use this for. I mixed this when I saw that was used and was surprised.Its very..... different, but still not sure exactly what it is or why it smells so bad but sweet and bitter mix well so here we are. Thanks for using that flavor and showing me what exactly it could be used for. "
