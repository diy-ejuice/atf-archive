  "description": "I love Irish soda bread and it is a tradition at this time of the  year for me to seek out some  ( because heck no  - I do not bake) \r\n\r\n Anyone that has had Irish soda bread recognizes that  it does not really have a soft bread texture but  a texture that is similar to a scone,  dry and crumbling.     So in order to achieve that  I used  shyndos bread stone  https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/57854#bread_stone_by_shyndo    RF baked bread which  is more of a white fluffy bread  with cap 27 and INW biscuit for the grainy dry back note that works well with the  RF baked bread to leave that dry finish.  \r\n\r\nThere is also a sweetness that raisins or currants add to the bread so using sweet fig and apple cranberry I was able to add that slight top note of sweetness I wanted along with the brown sugar at the back end  of the exhale. \r\n\r\nThe cap yogurt adds that slight sour note that buttermilk would add in a soda bread along with some mouth feel. \r\n\r\nMy favorite thing to put on  warm Irish soda bread  is butter and VT butter base is perfect for that . \r\n\r\nThis is a winner and I am really happy with it  - it is spot on  -  I hope you enjoy ",
