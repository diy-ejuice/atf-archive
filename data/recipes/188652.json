  "description": " A refreshing sparkling champagne with Blood orange and rose petals.\r\n\r\nMOSCATO: This one is one of my all time favorit flavorings. Itâ€™s so damn delicious, and the perfect base for a champagne type vape. At 0.5%  it sits just right, with bright white grape flavor. \r\n\r\nBLOOD ORANGE AND PEACH. Blood orange was the obvious choice. Itâ€™s a bold, crisp and realistic blood orange and pairs excellent with moscato... and the rest of the ingredients of course. Peach is here to add some more body to the orange.\r\n\r\nPINK GUAVA. Is another perfect pair. A perfect pair with Blood orange, and it also adds that characteristic pink guava taste.\r\n\r\n\r\nCITRUS SODA AND WS23 I added citrus soda to bright up the whole mix and it also helps with a bit of FIZZ in hand with the ws23.\r\n\r\nAnd the final touch is a touch of rose petals which in this case is Rose essens. It adds a nice florallike flavor to the whole mix.\r\n\r\nSWEETENES is imo not optional. For this to be a tasty all day Vape, it needs some sweetness.\r\n\r\nI really, really enjoy this one. It has been my all day vape for a couple of days now, and i never have a all day vape!ðŸ˜Š",
