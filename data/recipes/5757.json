  "description": "A tropical eliquid for the summer time. Pear is the main note sitting in a coconut base with pineapple and dragon fruit adding in the tropical notes. Pineapple also makes the vape 'brighter' or juicier, and dragon fruits helps all of the flavors blend together while making the vape a bit sweeter. Great as a shake'n'vape, the pear note is stronger at first and fades just a bit after a few days steep. ",
