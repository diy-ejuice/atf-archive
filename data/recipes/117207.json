  "description": "Wanted to do something with the lemonade cookie by TPA since it reminds  of the lemon girl scout type of cookie.  \r\n I was finding that the lemon in this mix did fade after 2 weeks or so ( as most lemons seem to do ) I did not want to add another lemon  to it so used the pastry zest to enhance that flavor a tad and also add some sugar like texture to the mix \r\nLemon meringue while adding more lemon to the mix also adds some of the body I wanted to fill int he middle of the mix\r\n\r\nit is simple and tasty \r\nLearn more about mixing here:\r\nhttps://www.facebook.com/groups/diydownunder/\r\nhttps://discord.gg/kH4Fqbc\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCTCwb7ULyfJALQlehomZZQA\r\nhttps://www.diydownunder.com/\r\nHave you tried this recipe?!\r\nPlease rate this recipe and comment below!
