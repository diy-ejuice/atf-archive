    "description": "A refreshingly simple take on a classic Strawberry and Pear liquid. The pair of Pears are beautifully subtle, sweet, and have just the right amount of complexity that combine perfectly with the ripe Strawberry sweetness. You get an amazing combo of Pear up front that's reinforced by sweet Strawberry goodness. Basic. Just how I like my women.\r\n\r\nTFA and FA Pear: TFA's version, to me, is earthy, almost gritty, and slightly sweet. While TFA Pear is a decent Pear on it's own, I feel that it lacks a few things that I look for in a Pear. This is where FA's version comes in. FA Pear gives us this juicy, refreshing, crisp, and lingering sweetness that combines with the TFA Pear to create a more complete Pear profile. This 3.5:1 ratio of FA to TFA is my go to when it comes to Pear.  \r\n\r\nTFA Strawberry Ripe: The king of Strawberries. I chose to use this flavor at 4.5% because I wanted my Strawberry to be present, but sit a bit more on the back end while lending loads of sweetness and that \"pink\" flavor. Now, I know this flavor isn't the most realistic Strawberry, but what we want here is a versatile Strawberry that will allow the Pear to be the main star while still having that sugary, complex, and slightly creamy Strawberry taste. It also helps that this flavor has a good amount of maltol that will give us sweetness since this is a shake and vape recipe contest. There was really no other choice here in terms of Strawberry. \r\n\r\nI hope you enjoy my simple take on this classic combination of fruits. Thank you for holding this contest and y'all are fuckin dope!",
