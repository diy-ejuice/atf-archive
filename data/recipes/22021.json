  "description": "Rich Crunchy Pef anut Butter spread on Graham Crackers and topped with Bananas ... while a sweet Tobacco note lingers in the air ... Nutty Nana makes the best treats but she has a bit of a smoking habit.\r\nI'm starting Soho (FA) at 4% because it needs to be there but I wanted it to just sit there so that it is strong and creamy yet won't kill you. Now we get to the fun part Banana and Peanut Butter , Banana Cream (TFA) at 4% creates a decent banana flavor and Peanut Butter (TFA) at 3% adds just the right amount of peanut to go with the banana cream to mesh with the Soho , the Cheesecake (graham crust) (TFA) at 2% adds the Graham cracker flavor and more cream (as if we needed any) it also adds a certain warmth to the overall flavor , Bavarian Cream (JF) adds cream of course but it also adds fullness and body , Cookie (FA) at 2% helps the graham cracker and adds a nice dessert feel. The Super Sweet (CAP) 0.5% IS NEEDED but can be subbed for Sweetener (TFA) at 1.5%.\r\n\r\nThat's it folks ... Tasty after just one nights steep but like NANA she just gets better with age.",
