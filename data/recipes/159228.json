  "name": "Lemon coconut cream cake",
  "description": "I recently had a piece of lemon and coconut cream cake and enjoyed it so much that I decided to try and capture the experience in vape form.\r\n\r\nLemon needs to be at the forefront of the profile as it is the dominant flavour, so I used relatively high percentages of FA lemon Sicily and VT sour lemon. \r\n\r\nI then added some CAP lemon meringue pie as a bridge to the 'cake' part of the profile, rounding it out with a dash of FW yellow cake, INW yes we cheesecake and some LB vanilla ice cream.\r\n\r\nThe VIC bridges nicely; it adds vanilla flavour to the cake and sets up the coconut cream together with some WF coconut custard, which leaves FW sweet coconut to add a more authentic coconut flavour - this is the sprinkle of coconut on top of the cake.\r\n\r\nI found I had to be sparing with the coconut as it has a strange muting effect on the lemon and can easily overwhelm it if too much is used.\r\n\r\nIn order for the cream to come through properly, this recipe needs a 7 day steep, but it is actually pretty nice straight away.\r\n\r\nIn terms of subs, you could swap out the VIC for a cream/cream combo of your choice (may try sweet cream and cream fresh), and you could also swap out the cake for a pastry to turn the cake into a pie.\r\n\r\nPlease mix, enjoy and let me know what you think!
