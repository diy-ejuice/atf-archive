  "description": "A refreshingly juicy, chilled, pear with a hint of vanilla...\r\n\r\nThis is another installment of my Icee range which sets out to pay homage to the splendor of single fruit varieties. My mission is to combine the best individual fruit flavors with a lick of cream and a touch of cooling to highlight their innate beauty, without adding any unnecessary complexity. I want the fruits to speak for themselves without being interrupted...\r\n\r\nThe pear layer is derived from my trusty pear duo, which, when combined, delivers and unbelievably realistic, fresh pear flavor.\r\nFA Pear brings the juicy, run down your chin, pear whilst INW Pear adds the gritty texture, crunch and mouth feel. \r\nOptional = Add 1% INW Pair of Pairs for an additional pear layer. I omitted this layer for the final recipe as the base was strong enough to hold it's own. \r\n\r\nINW Shisha is my all time favorite vanilla & works a treat to add a little body and a touch of sweetness, to compliment the pear duo beautifully. \r\n\r\nThe FA Cream provides some body & creaminess without interfering with the pear flavor.\r\n\r\nWS23 cools everything down without detracting from the stars of show. Feel free to increase the WS23 in increments of 0.25% if you prefer a colder kick. Sub WS23 with Koolada at your preferred % if preferred.\r\n\r\nGive this baby 3 days to settle and enjoy!!",
