  "description": "#####**Description & Setup**\r\nBad Drip's Lab describes Gnarley Sauce as a \"masterpiece of sweet and fruity blend, presenting a balance of sweet and tangy kiwi strawberries mixed with a special bubblegum nectar for an otherworldly mix.\". It was one of my favourite commercial juices before I went to DIY. At first I wanted to accomplish a 1:1 copy, but after a few people have said it tastes quite better. I decided to go ahead and run with that and make it even better.\r\n\r\nShoutout to @Foment_Life for giving the a tip on using CAP, it saved me a bunch of time. \r\n\r\nI've tested this on both DL and MTL and it works surprisingly well for both, tho it is a bit light in MTL devices. \r\n\r\n#####**Notes**\r\n\r\n**CAP Bubblegum** - This is actually one of my favourite bubblegums. I find it really nice in flavour and it does give a nice chalky mouthfeel like a cheap gum would. This does lack a bubblegum mouthfeel in chewiness, but thats not really important in this clone. This isn't really meant to be a main flavour of the recipe, it all more tumbles together into one weird flavour mix.\r\n\r\n**CAP Sweet Strawberry** - This strawberry is the perfect strawberry in this application. It sits on the lower end of the vape and is very light, but adds a nice undescript red sweetness that really just mingles in amazingly with the kiwi and bubblegum. \r\n\r\n**CAP Kiwi** - I personally haven't SFT'd this, but it's a pretty good kiwi for this recipe also, pretty sweet and almost candied kiwi flavour. It doesn't really bring in a natural kiwi at all, especailly with all the other sweetness going on, but it sits right in with CAP Sweet Strawberry and blends very well together as a very sweet strawberry kiwi mixture.\r\n\r\n**CAP Super Sweet** - Completely optional, but it won't *truly* be a commercial juice without a good amount of sweetener. I wouldn't doubt theres even more in the commercial juice. Feel free to use more, less, or none at all depending on your preferences. \r\n\r\nHope you enjoy this remix! Let me know your thoughts if you mix it up :)",
