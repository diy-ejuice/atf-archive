  "description": "**Profile: Jammy Dark Berries and Tobacco**\r\n\r\nPreface: **\"I do not like tobaccos\"**  is what I told myself for the longest time. I'm still not convinced I do like them. But Cabin, even though it's not a true tobacco, changed my mind. It's got me wanting to play with tobaccos a bit more. Finally, after like 3 or 4 separate orders I was able to get my hands on FLV Jammy Berry.  When I got it and smelled it, I was instantly reminded of those Backwoods Berry Cigars. Ya know, those cheap ass gas station ones that come in a pack of like 5 and look like shitty blunts? Yeah those. Thus this idea was born, not exactly a Berry Cigar, but just a quick and simple Berry Tobacco.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n**FLV Jammy Berry** - The star of the show. It's doing all of the leg work here, bringing the blend of dark berries building a main note.\r\n\r\n\r\n**FA Blackcurrant** - Mainly just here to back up the Jammy Berry add a bit more depth and jammyness.\r\n\r\n\r\n**FLV Virginia** - Sweet leafy sorta tobacconess. I pushed this up to 4% because the Jammy Berry and Blackcurrant are a somewhat powerful duo and it worked out wonderfully. Virginia falls blissfully to the tail end of the mix to wrap it all up. \r\n\r\n\r\nI haven't had a bottle last me more than a week, but within that week, nothing silly has happened. Shake it. Vape it. Enjoy it! \r\n\r\n\r\nThere ain't a whole lot of crazy complexity or fancyness going on here. Just a simple and delicious Berry Tobacco for even the tobacco haters.  As the always lovely @mlNikon would say....\" [***ing](https://youtu.be/dv2hiRH4bzM?t=377) mix it up!\"\r\n\r\n",

      "text": "That’s really, really nice. I get the sweet dark berry with a little more sharpness and tartness from the blackcurrant and a back end of some of that sweet but a little spicy, light leafy tobacco.  The blackcurrant is used really well, it can get mediciney if cranked up too high but it seems like it’s doing just want it needed to do here and nothing more. Those berries, even with their juicy, jammy body, have a tendency to trail off at the end and I like the way the tobacco just snips that off and gives it a crisp finish that comes as a surprise after all that berry.  Although, I must say, now that I’ve read the description, I really want to vape an accurate Backwoods Berry, with some darker, dirtier tobacco instead of, or along with, the Virginia. I hadn’t thought of it yet but thanks to this little mix, I’m 100% sure FLV Jammy Berry is the key to making that happen. "

      "text": "As someone who enjoys tobaccos, I love when something new comes my way. This mixes the jam and berry notes very well, making one hell of a lush, juicy tasty vape in its own right. The tobacco  percolates through the mix, adding  bits of earthiness and woodiness that spice things up delightfully, scratching that tobacco itch I get all too frequently while keeping the parts of me that crave sweetness coming back for more. Using a darker (for lack of a better term) tobacco would just...muddle things, so Virginia was totally the right call here."
