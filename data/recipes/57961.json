      "text": "It’s really something how prominent the clove is at just 0.25%. I steeped this two and a half weeks and clove still dominates the mix. Next time, unless it mellows over the next few weeks as I vape it, I think I’ll cut the clove to 0.15% and add a third tobacco. But I don’t say that to put this one down, it’s a great recipe, not like anything else I’ve tried. I’m not interested in the dessert flavored vape oils, so everything I mix has either a tobacco base or a liquor base. This stands out amongst my tobaccos. It’s really something special.&#xD;\n&#xD;\nUpdate: After just three days the clove has become much less prominent. This is a first rate tobacco mix and I won’t change a thing about it."

      "text": "I was worried about the clove/cardamon being too overwhelming. Its very forward, but I was pleasantly surprised that it wasn't the huge punch in the face I was expecting. This was pretty balanced, dry, but slightly sweet, which was a nice addition to the spiced. Red Burley is just such a good tobacco base, and when you add Cured with it, you have an amazing tobacco to play with in any situation. The oak wood was JUST enough to get a nice woody note that hides behind the spiced just long enough for the honey to poke its way through and let you know its there. Overall great job! &#xD;\n&#xD;\nI'm thinking of doing this again with a touch more Oak Wood due to my love of wood notes in my tobaccos, I just want more!"

      "text": "This is great. It's a take on a oriental-ish tobacco that doesn't hammer the spice note too hard, conveys dry and woody without getting weird and astringent, and overall is pretty awesome. The clove and cardamom is really well balanced, and the woody tobacco base is incredibly satisfying.  Incredibly solid stuff, overall.  I maybe get a couple of errant flashes of cocoa out of the burley that doesn't quite jibe with spice, but it's very occasional and even when it happens it doesn't detract from the experience nearly enough to worry about. I'd knife-fight Sting for this juice."

      "text": "For something pretty far outside of my usual interest (Clove &amp; Tobacco?) I found this hugely enjoyable. That's quite an accomplishment. Everything here seems to be fine-turned to just the right levels to work together. Burley and Cured is tobacco cheat code but I can imagine combining them with Oak Wood and it seems like no easy thing to get that to come out as woodsy tobacco and not wood + tobacco, if that makes sense. Clove is generally one of my least favorite flavors to vape but it doesn't feel out of place or overdone. Finally, that bit o' honey on the end there. Very satisfying, it really is a nice little touch of honey and not some floral nonsense. I don't have any suggestions for improving this. There doesn't seem to be any room for improvement. I think we have a winner here. "
