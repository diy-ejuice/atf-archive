  "name": "HIGH SOCIETY ( butter almond custard tobacco)",
  "description": "Two of my Favorites rolled up into one heavenly place this one is inspired by \"KRUTIALS\" butter almond custard and \"Fears\" Cardinal taking the best of both worlds....I have a few versions of this but this is just a simple basic outline you can substitute tweak anything you like the power of DIY... I did however up the percentage of the Flavorah tobacco's for a long steep but you can bring them down to the original version. Add some Graham cracker or yellow cake if you like for more dimension..",
