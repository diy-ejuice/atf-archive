  "name": "Apple Graham Crumble",
  "description": "Apple crumble! The apple is not subtle, the cinnamon is not overwhelming, and the crumbly graham is on point :) Hope you enjoy it!\r\n\r\nApple Fuji FA + Pair of Pears INW make a nice melty apple, Two Apples INW is added as a fruity apple sweetener. Two Apples INW can work on many fruit mixes as a sweetener, if you keep below 0.5 the apple taste won't be overwhelming (give it a go in pineapple mixes!). The apple in this recipe is not \"baked\", but sweet and melty.\r\n\r\nCheesecake (GC) TPA + Biscuit Base VTA + Graham Cracker FW create a crumbly, slightly buttery graham cracker base. \r\n\r\nBavarian Cream TPA + Vanilla Bean Gelato TPA are added for mouthfeel, fluffiness, and to blend everything together.\r\n\r\nCinnamon Ceylon FA is a bakery cinnamon, not spicy at low percentages. Can be omitted if you don't want the cinnamon in here. I wouldn't replace it with a hot and spicy cinnamon in this mix.\r\n\r\nLet it steep a bit, the crackers used here need some time to develop the full flavor and mouthfeel.",
