  "name": "Little D's Apple Fruit Pie ",
  "description": "So i  really wanted to nail down a  little debbie  fruit pie - with that  fried dough, sugary glaze and gooey sweet filling that lingers.  \r\n The use of deep fried dough,  butter and pie crust  gets me that type  of  little debbie fruit pie crust I was after   \r\n\r\nThe filling  I used is  FA apple filling at a higher percent then I have ever used ( thanks to DaddyKane91 for that tip)  and  was able to get  that true apple pie filling  with cinnamon,  and cooked apple.  The country apple  was added for a more prominent cooked apple filling.  \r\n\r\nThe  frosting provides that sweet coating on the pie shell.\r\n\r\nThe Quince jelly was added  for some tart bright  fruit  top notes notes along with the VTA golden  syrup, for a   owwie Gooyey  texture that coats your mouth and lingers  which is exactly what I wanted \r\n\r\nThe cinnamon tends to settle  down after a 3 - 5 days and the apple pops up more -",
