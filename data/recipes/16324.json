I  decreased the sweetener to 0.8%, That helps against the Lemon muting, because there is Etyl Malthol in the TPA Sweetener.. If that is not sweet enough, its better to use CAPs Super Sweet, because there is no EM inside.&#xD;\n&#xD;\nThanks for this great recipe."

I've been looking for a good sweet lemon cream for a while and never seem to get what I'm looking for.  I dropped the sweetener down just out of personal preference. Definitely be making more of this in the future.  Good adaptation. "
