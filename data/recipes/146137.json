    "description": "This is my take on a blood orange sherbet. Not a fancy smancy sorbet like I was originally going to go for. Its bright and tart and creamy. Everything you want in an orange sherbert. I used vt yoghurt drink for the ice cream because along with the lemon which helps in the brightness category, it has a delicious rich creaminess to it. Then I used cap lemon lime for its bright candy like tartness that just works so well in shertbets. My orange was a combo  of fa blood orange for its deepness and fa orange. I used FA Orange because it is a very bright tangy sort of orange flavor. I then used WF Sour Ball Candy for some tart creamy sweetness to just push this sherbet over the top. Hope you enjoy!",
