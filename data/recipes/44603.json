    "description": "\"Blue balls\" was obviously taken so here we have \"Lack-a-nookie\".\r\n\r\nAfter vaping Smurf Soup for so long I decided to revisit the blueberry profile....\r\n\r\nFW Blueberry\r\nSmurf  Soup was formulated with TFA Blueberry Wild, Also a weaker flavor, But it had a very bright and slightly tangy vibe to it. I wanted something deeper and more syrupy.\r\n\r\nFLV Blueberry Muffin\r\nNo muffin notes with this one, Inaccurate name. Used for deeper ripe notes but it also provides a level of salivation when you vape it. Quite strange, But very pleasant.\r\n\r\nFA Bilberry\r\nDeep dark berry. Yum. 'Nuff said.\r\n\r\nTFA Dulce De Leche\r\nSweet milk with berries? Yes please!\r\n\r\nTFA Marshmallow\r\nSweetness, Mouthfeel, Fills the gap between cream and fruits.\r\n\r\nFA Vienna Cream\r\nRichness, Creaminess, A nice hint of vanilla to contrast the blueberry.",
