Alright, now on to the recipe and it's breakdown. \r\n\r\n1. LB Blue Raspberry @ 6%\r\n2. TFA Cherry Blossom @ 2%\r\n3. FA Florida Key Lime @ .25% - Not in here for taste, but just to make the LB Blue Raspberry pop more in the recipe. \r\n4. TFA Gummy Candy (pg) @ 1 % - Candy base for the rest of the recipe\r\n5. CAP Super Sweet @ .5% - Come on y'all, it wouldn't be a candy without some sugar, am I right?\r\n",
