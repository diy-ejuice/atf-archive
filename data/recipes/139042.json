  "description": "Milk, milk, lemonade, round the corner fudge is made!\r\n\r\nI love Chef's choice flavours, and so I thought I would use some of my favourite ones to make a fudge liquid.\r\n\r\nFudge in the UK is a soft, chewy sweet/candy made mainly with butter and sugar (I think 'fudge' may be different in other countries), a little like a very soft toffee.\r\n\r\nFor this recipe, I combined both CC Clotted Cream Fudge and Vanilla Fudge in order to provide the main flavour profile; the two go together to make a nice rich foreground, but lacked the creaminess I wanted in the recipe. \r\n\r\nThis was achieved by adding CC Devon Cream (which is probably my favourite concentrate) in combination with CC Cookie Dough Ice Cream. CC CDIC is another of my favourites as it is hugely versatile in recipes and adds a lovely creamy, sweet depth of flavour and mouthfeel without being overpowering (it is also very nice as a standalone). \r\n\r\nTo add more to the caramel tones without detracting from the subtlety and creaminess, I added WF Hazelnuts and Cream and VT Love, both of which give a richness and added flavour to round everything out. I finished off by adding some Ethyl Maltol to ensure that it was nice and sweet!\r\n\r\nTo give a bit of info about my steeping/testing: I made a 120ml batch in a glass beaker, standing in a warm water bath. The water is just from the hot tap (don't want it too warm) and is not intended as a speed steeper, but purely to reduce the viscosity of the VG/PG so that it mixes and homogenizes more easily. \r\n\r\nI then mix very thoroughly with 2 milk frothers until the liquid is slightly milky/aerated and cover the beaker with a foam earphone cover and let it sit until it is clear again. \r\n\r\nAfter this I bottle it, label & date the bottles and keep them at room temperature in a storage box, typically using 1 bottle per week until the flavour seems just right. \r\n\r\nFor this one, 2 weeks has been enough for the creams to have settled in and the liquid to have a lovely flavour. I imagine that a couple more weeks will improve it further, but I am vaping it right now and REALLY enjoying it! \r\n\r\nPlease mix and let me know what you think! ",
