    "description": "Ooey Gooey White Chocolate Macadamia Nut Cookies\r\n\r\nWF Mac Nut is the STAR here. It\u2019s a very nutty Mac nut. Single flavor, you can even even get the slight oil as if you just ate the Mac nut fresh. The hazelnut plays a nice supporting role here just amplifying the Mac nut. The white chocolates here layer perfectly for a good rounded chocolate, that neither of them nail on their own. The butter is added to give it a slight more weight and help fight off any remaining dry texture. \r\n\r\nThis is very good shake and vape, won\u2019t lie. All the flavors come out great. at least a week for the sugar cookie to settle a little and allow the other flavors to bloom even more though. This is one of those, the longer it sits, the better it gets!",

            "text": "Hell yes, happiness is waking up to this recipe alongside my morning coffee. It\u2019s kind of boringly obvious use of a macadamia nut flavor but mmmm so rich and buttery. Slasha did a terrific job counteracting that WF Macadamia dryness with butter to make an ooey gooey cookie where you can taste the hint of nuttiness, the buttery bakery, and sweet white chocolate. I might play around with subbing things like FA Nut Mix or FLV Beer Nuts for the FW Hazelnut and just see what happens, or  WF Cookie Butter for the TFA Butter, but there\u2019s nothing I would definitely change about this. If someone likes a drier, crispier cookie they could always use a little less butter or add something like FA or JF cookie or one of the biscuit flavors, but I don\u2019t have any interest in doing that, I like my cookies gooey like this.
