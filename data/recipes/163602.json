  "description": "This has been a very fun recipe to work on, trying to nail down which flavors that would make this authentic, but also translate well in to a vape recipe.\r\n\r\nThe first thing that had to be done was get the crepe/pancake right. WF Crepe SC was a given choice here, as it has that light and soft dough note, everything you want from a pancake/crepe flavor. By itself it is a bit too light though, especially when you’re throwing a lot of other powerful flavors on top.\r\nI know that @foment_life used CAP Cinnamon Danish Swirl in combination with WF SC Crepe in his Breakfast of the Gods recipe, something which is perfect here – as the Crepe needs a bit more dough to stand out, and we also need that cinnamon spice for the filling.\r\nI did experiment a bit with other combinations such as LB Belgian Waffle (which also has a slight cinnamon note), and FLV Rich Cinnamon, but I found none of them to be as good as the WF Crepe/CAP CDS combo, as the cinnamon note should be “just there” to make it as authentic as possible. CAP Cinnamon Danish Swirl v2 can be used as sub for the v1, I have tried with both and I honestly don't taste any significant difference.\r\n\r\nNext up was trying to find a good flavor to replicate the palm sugar syrup, which is used both for the filling and garnish. WF SC Molasses turned out to be the best choice here, I’m not 100% convinced it’s the most authentic, but it is however by far the most yummy, as it has that brown sugar note that plays great with the coconut. The other flavor I experimented with was VT Golden Syrup, but the caramel note in there makes the recipe way too sweet to enjoy for longer periods of time. I wouldn't recommend trying to sub the molasses, it's very unique, especially how it interacts with the sweet coconut notes.\r\n\r\nThird, the coconut BOMB. Look at the picture and you’ll see how coconut heavy this recipe is. The whole filling is just heaps and heaps of grated coconut, so the coconut needs to be a very good tasting main note, and also have a great body to it. This has been by far the toughest part of the recipe, as the very flaky texture is hard to achieve, so you just have to settle for how yummy they are.\r\n\r\nMy conclusion of this is that you can actually use 2 different combinations, but there is 1 flavor that has to be in there no matter what – FLV Coconut. It’s the only flavor that really has that thick (almost) grated coconut feel to it. It’s extremely potent, so use it with caution. DO NOT KNUCKLE TEST THIS FLAVOR!!!!\r\nThe second flavor that I landed on is FA Coconut, I think it also has some of the same qualities as FLV Coconut, it’s a bit flakey but also brings some of a milky note. Together they make a great thick and very yummy coconut flavor.\r\nThe third flavor that can be used as a sub for FA Coconut is FLV Sweet Coconut. This is by no means a bad sub at all, and I think some people might even prefer it. I don’t though, because I don’t think it has the same body, so not as authentic. I’d recommend using FLV Sweet Coconut at 1.5% if you plan on subbing.\r\nVT Dessicated Coconut could maybe also be an option for the cocobomb, I'm not sure it would taste better, but maybe more authentic. It is was out of stock on Chefs so no way for me to get it just yet.\r\n\r\nLast, I’d say the lime could be left out, but I feel it does precisely the same job as the lime in the real dish – by adding a strong contrasting note it elevates the other flavors. I also think it makes for a much more pleasant vape, as the other flavors can become a bit boring in the longer run. VT Shisha Lime was the best choice as it doesn’t water down the other flavors as much as other limes.\r\n\r\nI did also experiment a lot with different dragon fruits, as it’s a common topping to use. I did however realize that I had to scrap that idea, as there was just no way to make this possible as it’s such a “weak” flavor.",
