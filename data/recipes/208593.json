    "description": "Today we bring you an all Flavorah recipe, and when we're talking about Flavorah, how can we not mention their tobaccos? These have short steep times and are very pleasant to vape on from day one.\r\n\r\nAlright, here's what we wanted to tackle for this recipe: we wanted to play around with the idea of having a soft and consistent gradient between the different shades of the leaves, starting with caramel darkness transitioning all the way into a bright citric green. Without further ado, let's get to the notes of this complex yet light recipe.\r\n\r\n**FLV Cavendish**\r\nThis is a dark tobacco and it has a sort of caramel-like texture, it's an amazing flavor. It sits at the base of our mix and it delivers the darker shades of our gradient.\r\n\r\n**FLV Oriental Tobacco**\r\nThis is our yellow shade of tobacco, contributing to a little beat of dryness and mildly ashy, sitting right in the middle of our gradient.\r\n\r\n**FLV Yakima Hops, FLV Tangerine**\r\nThe Yakima fit very well into the initial idea, it has that greenness that we wanted while also being a bit citric, pairing really well with the Tangerine which is the top note of the mix. This combo delivers an incredible aroma of bergamot leaves!\r\n\r\n**FLV Ginger**\r\nThe choice of this flavor might be odd when you first see in the recipe but it is primordial and it actually fills in all the missing colors to make our gradient as smooth as we wanted. It has that darker flavor while also contributing with the brighter notes of the mix, it also delightfully sweetens our tobaccos!\r\n\r\nThis is a collaborative creation by Le DIY BR & Madmixer\r\nOur live streams are happening here: https:\/\/twitch.tv\/lediybr.\r\nFollow us on Instagram: https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/lediybr & https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/madmixer.diy\r\nCheck out our YouTube: https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/c\/VMLabs",
