    "description": "For all those sitting outside on one of those hot summer nights and craving a more natural and refreshing vape, dont look any further.\r\nThis is a delicious blueberry frozen yoghurt recipe, which for me hits this spot exactly. \r\nI wanted to really nail a more natural taste experience instead of a candied overly sweet one and this recipe truely did this for me.\r\n\r\nAlso my first recipe release so if you try this please consider leaving a review on how you liked it or what you might change. \r\nRoad to perfection is a hard one as you know.\r\n\r\nFlavor description\r\n\r\nBlueberry: \r\nI used the blueberry trinity (FW, TPA & FA) as a base here because it brought a lot of the blueberry aspects i wanted already. The billberry is upped a bit in percentage to pull the blueberry a bit more to the natural side. \r\nFW blackberry is added here for a bit more depth and help the blueberry flavor not to get lost in the yoghurt and the WS-23.\r\n\r\nYoghurt: \r\nFW yoghurt is great as a base cream here for the thicker mouthfeel and creamyness. FLV greek yoghurt adds that little zingy slightly sour undertone of a natural yoghurt, which i wanted in this recipe. At last the little bit of VTA milkshake base added really well to that natural yoghurt taste to make the cream consistent even when adding WS-23 (Ran into muting issues with cooling agents and creams in the past a lot)\r\n\r\nAdditives:\r\nFE Lemon is not really noticable as a lemon flavor in the recipe more there to boost and help seperate the blueberry from the yoghurt to make it taste like whole blueberrys in a yoghurt more than blueberries blended into a yoghurt. \r\nWS-23 for cooling obviously can also be taken higher or left out completely. Tweak to your likings ;) \r\nSuper Sweet, \"only\" 0.25% because i dont like my recipes overly sweet and the prominent blueberry already brings a good bit of natural sweetness by itself",
