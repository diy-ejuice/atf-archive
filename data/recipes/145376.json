Instead of taking the custard route we took the cheesecake route. We took Alfred’s Cheesecake Trinity and the main components of Lime Ar Why Fore and stuck them together and it turned out fantastic!",

It's nicely balanced recipe and oddly, that VT Shisha Lime pairs perfectly with HHGv1. The cheesecake trinity does what it does and just fits. This is one dirty lime cheesecake and I love it. A good solid old school eyemakepizza recipe, before he turned into a self-loathing baby-making ice cream lunatic."
