  "description": "This is an UNFINISHED remix of Milk by the Pound. The original is extremely sweet, but I do enjoy the \"milk cake\" aspect of it. So I want to try and recreate it without the pounds of sucralose loaded into it. \r\n\r\nI'm not really sure if CAP Glazed is the main note. It's some kinda doughnut. Maybe. Idk, still working on it.

      "text": "Milk by the Pound was my all time favorite commercial juice, so I just had to try this remix. It's so sweet and creamy, way creamier than the original. I do taste a hint of play-doh from the Glazed Donut, but it's not unbearable. Excellent balance, 4 stars. To cover the play-doh, I added a little FW Cake Batter Dip. Yes, I know that flavor contains fructose, and I really don't care. I know that flavor was in the original, and probably was the reason the juice was discontinued. Now it's a 5 star juice and brings back some memories."

I'm gonna skip the SS next time tho, always makes me feel a bit sick from the sweetness left on the tongue. Thanks for a good recipe!"

My favourite revision of this involved 2% CAP Funnel Cake, knocking down Glazed by the same amount, and some extra sweetener. Works straight off the mix for me. Nice work, Wayne. "
