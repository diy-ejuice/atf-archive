  "description": "Definitely a Yummy Classic!! Here is my 3,2,1 creme brulee recipe with a little twist. I stuck with all inawera flavors still. This is for those people that have been saving there inawera waffle. I too have been pointlessly holding on to my last 20 ml of inawera waffle when i decided what is the point of having something so delicious and not using it because i am afraid of running out?? And then i decided it was stupid and i started making recipes using inawera waffle again here is one of those creations. If you got into mixing after inawera waffle was already off the market or just dont own it dont worry just boost the coconut cookies to 1.5% and call it good. Well dont just call it good it is good lol. What you end up with is a creamy coconut creme brulee with a buttery feel and a toasted feel from the waffle. All that changes without the waffle is those toasted bakery notes are not there and its more of a creamy buttery coconut creme brulee. Which ever way you make it its delicious in my opinion. This is one of the times that this version of my 3,2,1 creme brulee is actually better than the original 3,2,1 creme brulee. I am finding my 3,2,1 creme brulee recipe to be more of a creme brulee base because no matter what i throw at it for a top note it just seems to work. So be expecting more delicious creme brulee recipes to come using my 3,2,1 creme brulee as a base and i challenge you to use it to create one of your own. Its the strap on of creme brulee's just strap on a top note of your choosing and run with it. We can always use more great creme brulee recipes lol. Creamy buttery coconut  goodness what more do you want?? Me i want to be able to purchase more inawera waffle but we cant so i guess i will enjoy the remaining 19ml i have and when its gone its truly gone forever but hey at least  i get the chance to enjoy it. If i just sit on it and dont use it i run the risk of it going bad and or fading or changing this way i am at least using it while its still delicious.\r\n\r\nSweeten to taste with your preferred sweetener at your preferred percentage.",
