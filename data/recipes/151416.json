  "description": "A subtlety spiced full crust apple pie.\r\n\r\nAn apple pie recipe has been a hit & miss experience for me for quite some time in an eLiquid as I found it's difficult to enjoy often due to my palette being left feeling dry from pastry flavors that seemingly linger. Thankfully in 2019 there are a lot more flavors that are available that can help avoid this. \r\n\r\nWhat I have developed here is a full home baked crusted & delicately spiced apple pie recipe with a lovely splash of thick delicious custard.\r\n\r\nHowever patience is the key to success here, for best results a 2 week steep is a necessity. It vapeable before hand but the spice notes from the FW Dutch apple pie are little to forward and need this time to meld properly with the other flavours. It's worth the wait. This is not a quick over the counter or supermarket apple pie, this is \"Home Baked\".\r\n\r\nFLV Apple Filling - is the awesome cooked apple in this pie with some lovely rich cinnamon notes. This is rare for a Flavorah concentrate to be pushed this high but this one loves to be pushed a little higher in bakeries I find.\r\n\r\nFW Dutch Apple PIe - Is an underrated concentrate in my opinion. It offers some rich bakery & cooked apple notes and when used low as I have here it really can give a rich fruity recipe a solid centre to help bridge a profile.\r\n\r\nFA Apple Pie - Has slight yet brighter apple notes than the others but it's crust which is dominant is mainly why this is used here. It is a very stable and enjoyable pastry crust to use in most fruity bakery profiles.\r\n\r\nWF Croissant - Assists with some flakiness of the crust and adds some lovely contrast to the pastry.\r\n\r\nFLV Smoked Butterscotch - for that fresh baked straight from the oven accent to this profile really does well here.\r\n\r\nFA Custard Premium - This thick authentic silky custard is the best going around right now in my opinion. It really helps to balance the whole profile here as it covers the pie but doesn't drown those nuances of flavour either. This is the savior to an apple pie recipe profile because it helps to not only make the vape not dry over time but helps fill out the mouthfeel of this very enjoyable vape. \r\n\r\nVariation of Sweetness - If you feel this isn't sweet enough DO NOT reach for the supersweet ! Rather go for 0.5% of VTA Golden Syrup. I tried this when testing and it gives the right amount of dark sweetness here if you're a sweet tooth. \r\n\r\nHow do you like it?\r\nGive this a try or share your thoughts/comments below and let me know if you enjoyed this version or created another.\r\n\r\nEither way, enjoy mixing & \"Together, Let's Discover! \"\r\n\r\nCheers for reading this far, now go and get mixing!\r\n\r\nFacebook - https://www.facebook.com/groups/diydownunder/\r\nDiscord - https://discord.gg/kH4Fqbc\r\nYoutube - https://www.youtube.com/c/diydownunder\r\nWebsite - https://www.diydownunder.com/\r\nInstagram IGTV : @diydownunder\r\n\r\nIMO this is a very pleasant and enjoyable vape on a single coil RDA at 60W with a SST single coil at 0.2 ohm",
