This is one of those ... was nice at the 14 day steep, but it is even better at the 30 day mark - just gets deeper and richer and thicker. This is a great vanilla / cake / mild ADV flavor you can rock all the time. The yellow cake and sugar cookie do the heavy lifting here and provide a soft cake layer backed by that vanilla cream pudding coming from a great layer of FA CP and FLV pudding. Easily one of the best pudding vapes I have mixed. Will be making this on the regular."
