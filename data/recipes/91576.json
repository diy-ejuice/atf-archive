  "description": "Recipe also works well with flavor West root beer but you have to bring the percentage way down between .75 and .5%. \r\n\r\nTried this with super sweet and just wasn't getting the right sweetness... that said super sweet would be a bad substitution at .5%\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you'd like to participate in the Year of Mixing find the Flavor-Pro group and join us for our weekly challenge - all mixers welcome - and there will be some prizes.
