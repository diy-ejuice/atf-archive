  "description": "This is a mashup between two different mixes of the same profile idea. @lediybr and @madmixer came together to create this delicious, decadent beauty!\r\n\r\n**FA Apple Pie, WF Deep Fried Pastry Dough**\r\nThick, fried, and dense dough.\r\n\r\n**JF Yellow Cake, CAP Vanilla Custard v1**\r\nThe inside part of the dough, the yellow cake brings the fluffiness into play while the VC v1 contributes with the wetness making it feel creamy inside.\r\n\r\n**FLV Butterscotch, FW Butterscotch Ripple**\r\nThis is the filling, we chose both of these butterscotch flavors because they complement each other. FLV on the top not while FW on the base, bringing in that stickiness that we love so much!\r\n\r\n**CAP Cinnamon Sugar, FW Sweetener**\r\nThe typical mixture of cinnamon powder and sugar where we roll that fried goodie right after coming out of the oil. FW Sweetener brings that sugary, lingering after taste just like when you bite into a churro or our own Brazilian version of a donut, called \"Sonho\" which translates to \"dream\".\r\n\r\nMix this up and let us know what you think by commenting!
