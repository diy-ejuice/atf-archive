      "text": "This is delicious juice, free of the scary cherry off  notes, that hits the spot for something bright and refreshing. I'm going to go ahead and give it all five stars because it's a cherry lemonade that tastes amazing, though I have a little bit of beef with description. WIth the juice itself, zero beef whatsoever. But the relatively high amount of INW Dragon Fruit here that \"takes it in a unique direction\" seems to take it outside the realm of a beverage. That Pitaya has a lot of base body to it that comes across thicker and chewer than something that could come up through a straw. The end result here is like eating a frozen white gummy bear and frozen cherry lemonade gummy bear at the same time. Sounds strange. IS strange. But I'm digging the hell out of it. "
