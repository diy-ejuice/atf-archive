  "description": "STRAWBERRY FLUFF PIE = FLUFFED PIE\r\n\r\nSo this was just a recipe I made to test three new ingredients to see how they worked in a mix. Overall I really enjoy this recipe it was ment to just be a test recipe but turned into a deliciously simple recipe. So from what I hear I may be a bit high on the juicy strawberry but I have been developing a muteness towards strawberry concentrates as of late so it tastes good to me where its at now but you might like it down around 2%.  Just a good simple recipe. This recipe needs a 7 day steep for the whipped marshmallow and butter cream frosting to fully develop. ",
