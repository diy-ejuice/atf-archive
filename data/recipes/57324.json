OoO golden sponge is a wonderful cake concentrate IMO. Its is a moist and very dense plain cake that has no off notes and very easy persuaded in any direction you so please. Great mouthfeel but maybe even a lil too plain thats why i added some Cap sugar cookie and flv frosting to kinda sweeten it up.\r\nFrosting  \r\nHashsling on the discord was talking about how he ran out of holy vanilla and was tryna figire out what flavors were in there. I believe he is onto something with it being mostly bourbon vanilla and cream cheese icing, amongst other things. This ingredient was already in this recipe but this kinda made me understand why holy vanilla alongside flv frosting would create such a delicious vanilla frosting.  \r\nVanilla Ice Cream  \r\nMy favorite ice cream tfa vbic, but that would have been too easy no?. Been loving the combo of milky cream and condensed milk in any milk based cream im trying to create.  \r\nAdded some Polar blast for that cold ice cream feel.  \r\nIm really diggin this recipe and i hope you guys do as well. Their is definetly complexity but still straight forward enough that it doesnt distract from the profile. Its simply cake and ice cream :)\r\n\r\n\r\n",
