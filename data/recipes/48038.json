  "description": "This is tied to the Watermelon homework assignment.  I've been working on a version of this for a bit, and just got it like I wanted it.  The homework timing was a happy convenience.  This is not the traditional coconut-heavy snow cone tiger blood, I actually wanted the watermelon up front.\r\n\r\nTPA Coconut:  I used this instead of coconut extra because I wanted the watermelon to be the star of the show.  This lends just enough coconut flavor to know it's there.\r\nTPA Dragonfruit:  Accents the strawberry and adds a touch of juiciness to the mix\r\nTPA Strawberry:  I didn't actually try any other strawberry flavors for this.  My worry was that any other would either be too sweet, too strong, or too pink for this.  I may do a version of this with Straw Ripe just to see what happens.\r\nPUR Watermelon:  This is the watermelon I've been looking for.  Sweet and candylike without the qualities that annoy the hell out of me in TFA watermelon.  I did a batch of this with CAP double watermelon as well and it was okay, but this tastes better and more well-rounded to me.",
