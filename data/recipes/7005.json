It definitely does need at least that long to come together; I tasted it as a S&amp;V and it was way off compared to now.  NotCharlesManson is a fantastic mixer!&#xD;\n&#xD;\nUPDATE: Figured I would update my review, as I just finished mixing my fourth 100ml bottle of this.  I don't mix big bottles for myself often, except for the two recipes I consider ADV status-- this is definitely one of them.   This time I have made a separate 30ml bottle to try the 1% VC1 addition recommended in the notes.  Hard to imagine this being any tastier, though!  I am also going to try spiking a separate bottle of this recipe as written + 1% FW Tres Leches.  "
