    "description": "Final version.\r\n\r\n\r\nCap Crunchy Frosted Cookie - If you do not have this extract it will ruin the recipe. this is the base flavor everything is going to sit on.\r\n\r\nINW Shortbread Cookie(or INW Biscuit)- I wanted to use this because it is new and there are a lot of rhubarb tarts that use a shortbread base. This extract is not as dark as INW biscuit but if you go to high with shortbread it appears to take on a popcorn like quality. The initial smell of this smells almost like FLV popcorn. You can replace this with inw biscuit at the same percentage and achieve similar results.\r\n\r\nFLV Rhubarb- This is the only realistic rhubarb in my opinion. WF is basically raspberry, VT is basically sour mush, INW is way too green and vegetale. I have never used this higher than .4 and I do not recommend you go any higher. Even after a 14 day steep the rhubarb still has that sour root flavor right on top where you want it.\r\n\r\nFA Red Touch- I removed the sweet strawberry because I felt like it took away from the main rhubarb profile I had going before so I'm reverting this back to the original state at 2%.\r\n\r\nFlapper Pie WF- Flapper pie is pretty much a perfect blend of custard and meringue. I didn't go above 3% because I do not want any of the graham cracker notes to poke through.",
