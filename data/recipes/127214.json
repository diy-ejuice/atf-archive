    "description": "Rich cinnamon is one drop per 60ml of completed liquid if 20 drops equals 1ml. The math equates to 0.0333333333333...%\r\n\r\nThe mango itself is a bit flat without the white peach to bolster, sweeten, and moisturize the overall fruit flavor.\r\n\r\nLiquid Barn Vanilla Ice Cream is LB VIC, it's awesome and doesn't require any backup. \r\n\r\nThe super sweet helps round off the rough edges of the mix.\r\n\r\nShake and vapes is tasty enough with the rich cinnamon trending towards Red Hots candy. \r\n\r\nThe mix will definitely benefit from 3 days of steeping out",
