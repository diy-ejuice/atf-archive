  "description": "Now this turned into something completely different than what you would expect from these 4 ingredients. I was watching mixing vixens on you tube and they were doing all flavorah recipes and i happen to love making all flavorah recipes. SO i set out to use some flavors i either hadnt used ever like flv apricot and flavors i dont use very often.  I was aiming for a sour peach gummy and what i got was more of a realistic juicy peach!! I mean it may have a slightly artificial taste but for me its more of a juicy peach in a sugary syrup absolutely delicious if you ask me. I haven't done it yet but i feel like this delicious peach would work great in a peach ice cream or frozen yogurt or just plain yogurt  or peaches and cream. I am sharing this because i dislike almost every peach other than a select few but  i cant seem to put this peach down. It is a dripping juicy peach with a sugary sweetness. Sweeten to taste with your preferred sweetener or dont sweeten at all your call. Enjoy!! \r\n\r\nIts a dam good peach!!!!",
