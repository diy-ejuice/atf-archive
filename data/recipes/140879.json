    "name": "Spice It Up! (Eggnog Peach Pie & Cream)",
    "description": "\"Just a simple recipe a lot of my friends love. I've been meaning to throw this up for a while. Feel free to go all the way up to 10 or so percent on the wf peach pie and cream and as low as .75 on the eggnog. Have fun toying with it and seeing how you prefer the balance.\"\r\n\r\n@Shyndo said \"Have fun toying with it\", and so I did. I love FLV Eggnog at 1.5%. I always feel that WF Peach Pie & Cream needs a little pick me up in the body of the vape and that's what TPA Juicy Peach is for. \r\n\r\nI can't stop vaping this recipe. I always have a 120ml lying around.\r\n\r\nEnjoy, be queer and vape on!\r\n\r\n[Photo Credits: www.sallysbakingaddiction.com ]",

The balance between the spices, creams, and peaches is good as it is but I might make a derivation with a bolder more defined cream base - maybe LB VIC?&#xD;\n1 month edit: Found the rest of my 30ml and put it in the tank. It's SO good. Not changing a thing and making a larger batch to store away ASAP."
