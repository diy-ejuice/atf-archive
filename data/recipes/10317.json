Give it a couple weeks to get all the creamy goodness. I mix it at 70VG/30PG and the LA banana cream I use is the clear version. \r\n* update- for a creamy banana Pudding add 1% Vape Wizard-yummy\r\n",

Not vaping it this very moment, so I donâ€™t want to lie to you about the specific flavor notes. But I wanted to be sure to add a rating right now before I forget again. May come back and edit with more details later. Phenomenal flavor profile and very well balanced. Flavor only intensifies over time. Unbelievably creamy as well. "

The taste is very close to The Sauce LA's Banana Cream, which was one of my favorite premiums. This, however, doesnt have all the added sweetener and is a much better flavor. Kuddos to you, sir/madam.  "

I always mix recipes exactly as the author prescribes and i did the same here. In my opinion it is spot on for a banana milk. I can only imagine what it tastes like after a few weeks steep. I think i'll make another 60-90mls of this to let steep for a few weeks and come back with my opinion on it then. Thanks for the great vape!"
