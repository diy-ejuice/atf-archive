    "description": "When I got my first batch of tobacco in the mail for doing NETs, I was very excited with the way the Dunhill Early Morning Pipe smelled. I really didn't feel like waiting for a month to taste that beautiful tobacco, so I decided I would try to create it with some of the flavors I had on hand. \r\n\r\nGaruda- fresh tobacco leaves. What kind, exactly, I'm not sure. I emailed Inawera (or what I thought at the time was them, I'm not so sure now, but I digress) to see if they'd tell me what kind of tobacco they use for this tobacco absolute, but got no answer. Either way, I'm using it here to represent the sweet Turkish leaves that's found in Early Morning Pipe. \r\n\r\nVirginia- a bit grassy, but pretty good. I find it to be a tad weak, so I use it a little higher than you would use something like the ECX Tobacco Absolute. Obviously, this plays the role of the Virginias in the Dunhill. \r\n\r\nDNB, Black for Pipe, Black Fire- While EMP may not be very heavy on the Latakia, there's still going to be a little something missing without these three. The Black Fire will need plenty of time to settle down, or else it's going to completely overshadow the Tobacco Absolutes. \r\n",
