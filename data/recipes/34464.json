  "description": "To me, Manly Strap-On by @Apexified was the best strap-on to date (Strap-On plus mango) (until this one, of course), but Suckle my Strap-On by @Havohej was awesome, too (Strap-On plus Honeysuckle). ¿Porqué no los dos, señoritas? Putting the two together gives the best of both recipes. What you get is a sweet, syrupy, tropical fruit cup with a variety of fruit notes that play with your palate in different ways as you vape it. You can shake and vape it, but if you give it a couple of days, the TFA Honeysuckle changes the mouthfeel a bit so it feels almost like there's a drop of cream in your fruit cup. \r\n\r\nGot another idea for adding a little thing or two to the original **Str**awberry-**Ap**ple-Watermel**on**? (https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/6487). Or a different combination of strawberry, apple, and watermelon flavors? Go for it! Show me your Strap-On. My body is ready.  ",
