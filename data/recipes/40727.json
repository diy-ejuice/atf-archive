    "description": "Blueberry cake donut recipe. I've been working on this for a few months now. It is a work in progress. Idk if I'll ever perfect it, but it is dang close. \r\n\r\nFA Zeppola, FW Cake(Yellow), and TFA Acetyl Pyrazine make up the cakey donut base of this recipe. Zeppola is by far the best doughnut flavor I have found. But I believe it needs help to create the profile I was going for. That's where the Cake(Yellow) came in. It added some more fullness and weight to this recipe. Which added depth to doughnut base. Acetyl gave it just a bit more of grainy essence. \r\n\r\nFA Bilberry and TFA Blueberry(Wild). After testing a few different blueberry variations I decided to stick with the bilberry and blueberry wild combo. Bilberry is an darker and a little more bitter blueberry. It's very stout and definitely couldn't be the leading role is this recipe. But I felt it would be a great supporting blueberry. It seems to round out the blueberry wild just perfectly. FA Lemon Sicily is there in a small percentage to just brighten up the blueberries and it does a good job at it. \r\n\r\nFA Torrone and TFA Sweetener\r\nThese two create the sugar glaze coating you find on the outside of the doughnut. Now the torrone isn't necessary. I actually subbed it out for FA meringue at the same percentage in a different variation of this recipe. Although you could taste a small difference in the batches it wasn't significant. Both versions were great. \r\n\r\nI hope you enjoy this recipe as much as I have. ",

The second time I mixed this I added 1% Cream Cheese Icing, 3% FW Blueberry and 0.5% FA Joy and I think it has improved this recipe."
