  "description": "Alternate Title: Audrey\r\n\r\nFuck it, I’ll jump in on the 1-2-3 thing. Probably not a whole lot of people have INW Parlament or Royal Club because I’ve never seen them on any of my regular sites. But if you’re anything like me and want to track down all the INW tobaccos just because, then maybe you’ve got ‘em. \r\n\r\nIf you want to do this as an all INW recipe, replace FLV Sweet Cigarette with INW US Light Mix. It’ll be a little dirtier, but similar. \r\n\r\nINW Royal Club is a pretty smooth tobacco flavor that has a hint of vanilla to it. INW Parlament actually does remind me a bit of Parliament cigarettes. It’s light and sort of airy and mostly tastes like a clean smoke more than a robust tobacco. FLV Sweet Cigarette is like a Light Cigarette with some vanilla notes to me. Put ‘em all together and you’ll feel like your shitcoins mooned over night and your smoking a fancy cigarette in your new lambo. \r\n\r\nPretty good off the shake, but give it about 5 days to start mellowing out a bit. If you’re a “tobaccos take a month” evangelist, then wait a month. I’m too impatient for all that :)",
