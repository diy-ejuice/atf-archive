  "description": "I'm sure everyone at some point in life has made a \"Suicide\" drink. If not, it's made by mixing all of the flavors available in a fountain drink machine. I took that concept and mixed together all of the Strawberry Concentrates I had available. This recipe turned out sooo good! Considering it tastes exactly like Fresh Strawberries dipped in Sugar, I can't help but to go back to it time and time again... It's truly one of the easiest and most delicious Strawberry flavors I've ever vaped. It blows shelf juices out of the water! If you are a Strawberry fanatic like I am you definitely need a little \"Strawberry Suicide\" in your life!   Thanks, CloudyMotherChucker",
