  "description": "A milkshake made from Masala Chai ice cream.\r\n\r\nRF (SC) Masala Chai\r\nEverything you could ask for in a Chai concentrate.\r\n\r\nTFA VBIC/ TFA Malted Milk/ FA Vienna Cream/ FA Fresh Cream\r\nThis is the milkshake. The body is provided by the VBIC all the wholesome goodness you need in a milkshake. Malted Milk gives us a solid maltiness where we need it, and fresh cream lends a great dairy booster. Vienna Cream really brings the whole thing together like magic.\r\n\r\nYou can sub FW Hazelnut for the TFA Malted Milk in a pinch at 0.75%. Feel free to add a bit of FLV Rich Cinnamon and/or Koolada if that is your kinda thing.",
