    "description": "42nd parallel south divides the provinces of Rio Negro and Chubut to the south of Argentina. This area is known for its cold and windy climate, where the main production is red apples and the mountainous landscape, similar to Switzerland, invites to drink a good bourbon at every sunset.\r\n\r\nThe idea behind this recipe was to achieve a sweet bourbon infusion with apple and cinnamon notes. A cozy and spicy drink to enjoy at night on the sofa a few days before Christmas.\r\n\r\nEnglish is not my mother tongue; please excuse any errors on my part and enjoy this recipe!",

            "text": "So the bottle I made of this came of age yesterday. Still being to much torrone flavor I waited on it. Gave it another shot today and the Torrone has fully melded with the ry4 (weird how one day can make a difference). This is the first recipe with torrone that I have liked so far. I'm tasting the bourbon and the tobacco and it's delicious. It's reminding me of this cocktail I had a few weeks ago that I can't get out of my head. I am getting a bit of the cinnamon but not any apple in this. I'm curious what a little bit a fuji could do to this and possibly bring that out. It will probably brighten the mix up a bit and and another dynamic that might escape from what you're trying to achieve just throwing it out there. Another thought would be cap double apple but I'd be worried that would dull it out. I'm going to let this sit a little bit and make a batch with fuji. I'll keep you posted on my fuji experiment and if the apple comes out in a couple weeks in the original I'll come back and give you the five. Great job though I'll be using this recipe when winter comes back around."
