  "description": "IMPORTANT - RY4 is from Molinberry and not (MPV)\r\n\r\nNot sure if this is for the tobacco-heads or the sweet-tooth vaper but it's a very sweet tobacco. The idea behind the profile was to put Coconut and Native Tobacco up against each other since I find Native to be delicious, but strong. The result was unexpectedly pleasing.\r\n\r\nA very sweet cinnamon thump with a dark tobacco back note.\r\n\r\nUpdate: I have found this to work best as an MTL recipe. I have switched to Molinberry RY4 (Please note that this is marked as MPV flavour house) and included Vanilla Classic (FA) and Butter Cream (CAP).",
