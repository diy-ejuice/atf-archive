      "text": "I had some doubts about whether the Fizzy Sherb would punch through the kinda waxy orange and the more syrupy Sweet Tangerine, but it does turn those into an orange soda. Not an exact match for orange crush, but super solid for a quick and simple orange soda. It vapes a little warm though, as oranges tend to do. I want to try it again with some cooling and with following the creator’s suggestion of using a tiny bit of CAP Super Sweet to bridge that very slight separation between the orange essence top note and a little tangerine poking through underneath. There’s also some throat hit that coolant might help with, but none more than would be expected from a citrus soda vape.  "
