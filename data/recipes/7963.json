  "name": "Creamy Greek Yogurt Base",
  "description": "Simple, thick and creamy Greek yogurt base to add fruits to, or vape alone. I made this base to be accepting to any fruit and still hold up in the recipe, with no needed tweaks. I've added strawberry, lime, banana, blueberry, and even honey with great results. \r\n\r\n(Recipe developed with a little help from SkiddlzNinja a while back.)",
