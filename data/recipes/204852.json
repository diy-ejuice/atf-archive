  "description": "The Floradora is a classic cocktail that you might not know, but you should know because it is a truly fabulous (and rather sexy) gin drink. It is semi-sweet, tall, refreshing, and beautifully pink. One might even call the Floradora the \"original girly drink.\"\r\n\r\nThe cocktail was named after the first Broadway musical hit comedy of the same name in the early 1900s. The name was originally â€‹spelled \"Florodora\" following the show name and the cocktail was a hit among New York's high society up through the 1950s. \r\n\r\nOriginally, the drink was made with raspberry syrup, but now uses framboise liqueur (raspberry-flavored) almost exclusively. There are a number of raspberry liqueurs available with Chambord (black raspberry) being the most common poured into today's Floradora cocktails.\r\n\r\nFA Gin is an uber realistic gin which perfectly encapsulates that familiar and distinct juniper flavor. This is the main flavor note of the cocktail and pulls through beautifully without overpowering.\r\n\r\nThe raspberry combo has been my go-to for years and just works so well here. Authentic, slightly tart and semi sweet raspberry goodness.\r\n\r\nTPA Ginger ale can be a bitch but used low, it provides just the right amount of a ginger ale vibe without annihilating the rest of the ingredients. \r\n\r\nA wedge of lemon and handful of ice tops of our cocktail perfectly. \r\n\r\n\r\n",

      "text": "Oh, this is nice! And that raspberry combo is delicious. Everything about this is actually delicious. You have for a long time been my favorite mixer. I love the way you mix. Simple but always picking the right ingredients for the job, and that is also the case here. I get everything. On the Nose is I quite heavy on the gin, but when you Vape it is just very balanced. Light gin with a spot on raspberry syrup but yet authentic flavor. The lemon lime does a excellent job providing some citrus to really pop the Overall flavor and on the finish I get that little bit of ginger. I could definitely Vape this all day and it will definitely be in my rotation for a while. Thatâ€™s for sure! Great recipe man!ðŸ’ª"
