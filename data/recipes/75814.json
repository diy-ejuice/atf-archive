  "description": "Matcha Glazed Cinnamon Rolls \r\n\r\nAfter becoming obsessed with watching YouTube baking instructional videos (Looking at YOU, Cupcake Jemma (My newest YouTube crush)) I stumbled on one for Matcha Glazed Cinnamon Rolls. Having tried Exclusivegirls Green Tea Kit Kat (https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/17404) and loving the hell out of the earthiness that it had (but only getting the pepper that comes with TPA white chocolate), I decided to whip this up. Straight away I loved it, but with a bit of a steep the Green Tea really finds it's place, it mixes really well with the bakery notes and just finds an interesting and nice common ground with an earthiness that for some reason mixed extraordinarily well with all that cinnamon.\r\n\r\nNOTES:\r\n\r\nFA Joy / CAP Cinnamon Danish Swirl / FA Zeppola / FA Nonna's Cake /  TPA Brown Sugar / FLV Rich Cinnamon / TPA Caramel\r\nThis combo makes up a fantastic Cinnamon roll. CDS forms the base and is propped up by the Zeppola to give it a bit more of a fresh baked and cakey mouth feel. The Nonna's Cake adds a nice denseness and richness to the mix, it also helped tone down a bit of the bakery notes to a bit more of a brownie type texture which helps with the dense middle part of the roll and stops the recipe drying out. The Brown Sugar and Rich Cinnamon are there to bolster up the cinnamon note in CDS and bring it more towards a more authentic flavour. The Caramel helps bring a more caramelized flavour to the Brown Sugar and gives it a delightful gooeyness. FA Joy is there to bring a bit of yeast to the table, as Cinnamon Rolls are made using a yeast activated dough, I felt I could add a smidge to the mix and was pleasantly surprised.\r\n\r\n\r\nFE Green Tea / WF Butter Cream Frosting SC / CAP French Vanilla / CAP Super Sweet\r\nWonder Flavours has pulled some sort of miracle with their Butter Cream Frosting SC, it's just such a nice, decedent frosting base, nothing really needs to be added, but I decided I wanted a bit more of a vanilla back note, hence the French Vanilla. FE Green tea is just good, it tastes like a legit Matcha powder, and as well as the earthiness it brings, Green Tea packs a good smooth mouth feel to boot. The acidity from the lemon notes in FA Zeppola and Nonna's Cake helps bring forward the Matcha in the buttercream frosting, they just really help give it a brightness .Cap Super Sweet there because who doesn't want their butter cream frosting to be sweet??\r\n\r\nMy initial 30ml bottle lasted about 2 days, I didn't even put a label on it. I'm not usually one to bother with steeping, I don't think it really does THAT much the majority of the time; However, after taking my time with the second batch and seeing how it tasted over the course of a week, this recipe definitely benefits from a bit of a steep in some way. I'd say give it a vape after a shake, but remember it ages pretty well.\r\n\r\nLet me know what you think! I always welcome constructive criticism",
