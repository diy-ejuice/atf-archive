    "description": "Jen Jarvis asked if I would like to make a fantasy based mix for her show. This is part of a multi show series she is doing. It sounded like so much fun, I was happy to take part. I decided to base a flavor off of Sephiroth from FF7. He is dressed in black and grey, reminding me of a black tea. What goes well with black tea, but some honey. I enjoy floral teas as well; enjoying rose, I decided to add that. Most of all, I enjoy ice cream. So how about an amalgamation of all this! I decided to make a rose water, black tea ice cream with honey. ",
