    "description": "This is just another strawberry cheesecake, I love making cheesecakes it's the first profile i ever made and i like to come back to it regularly and try make one better then the last. I think this one is worthy of sharing and wont disappoint. It' s a true baked cheesecake with lots of sweetness.\r\n\r\nFA Apple pie and INW biscuit offer up a baked cheesecake crust that is very present\r\n\r\nCAP Butter Cream creates a delicious waxy icing sweetness that gives this recipes it's standout taste.\r\n\r\nCAP NY Cheesecake & Vanilla Whipped Cream is a reliable standard  for a thick Cream cheese filling and mouth-feel for days.\r\n\r\nINW Shisha Strawberry is a great artificial candy strawberry, but not like those others you know.\r\nFA Red Touch has a green rindy freshness that offers some realness but not in a bad way. It still has that sweetness we all crave from strawberries and these two strawberries mixed together make a Strawberry that blows the classic TFA strawberry cap Sweet strawberry combo out the water. \r\n\r\nGood as a shake & vape, even better after 2-3 days.",
