    "description": "I saw this picture displayed for an Australian Christmas Dessert and was totally inspired to turn this into a vape recipe. Their description is: Meet the new stack-and serve pavlova: Our speedy Easiest-ever Berry-Cherry Pavlova has crisp layers of Meringue Discs, a jammy filling and fresh fruity toppings. With that description I have headed for my flavor stash to see if I can get this to work. With all the layers in this recipe I predict a good 5-8 day steep will be needed. None the less I will go in Berry Deep as my journey progresses with this recipe and see if the Jammy notes in the INW Strawberry play well with the depth of berry goodness that TFA Acai berry should bring while I use what IMO is the only Meringue concentrate worth using while I fluff it out with the gorgeous vienna cream and attempt to get those fresh strawberries defined in this profile around all the rest going on in this recipe. The sugar cookie I hope to help bring out some texture to this recipe while also being helped along with that gorgeous biscuit from Inawera. And the Cherry on top is the Cherry that I hope will bring that complex depth of berry deep goodness to this profile. Here goes it! I shall report back and let you peeps know this goes :) All I want for Christmas.....is.........yoooooooouuu!  (I sing loudly and off key lol)\r\nAnd YES straight of the shake it's beautiful! (better with 5-7days I recommend) So much depth and texture. See it being made here: https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=qHplp6Wx0BU",
