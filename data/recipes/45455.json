    "description": "**sub Cap Vanilla custard for FLV same %, it's just as good if not better**\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is straight up honey and milk. Super duper nice when you need something different. A nice milky base with a sweet touch of honey. This one is a steeper, 3 weeks minimum, a month is best! \r\n\r\nFull notes on reddit:  https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/DIY_eJuice\/comments\/6hft40\/recipe_time_a_steeper_but_a_keeper_the_real_milk\/",

For some reason this baby wasn't silky smooth for me as I experienced a bit of throat harshness but otherwise, a great recipe. I would probably bump up the honey a bit next time and drop the fresh cream as I can't stand it in most situations."

This is a perfect summer time vape. It's creamy and milky with just enough sweetness. It doesn't get cloying or sickeningly sweet if you toss it in a tank and spend your day in the summer heat like a lot of heavy cream recipes can get. The honey is just enough to sweeten everything without taking away from the smooth dairy and vanilla. &#xD;\n&#xD;\nTotally worth the steep time and ordering flavors just to mix this up, way to go man!"
