    "description": "I don\u2019t know about you guys but I\u2019m getting a little tired of the heavy custard\/desert profiles and have had a real hankering for something light,bright and a little on the fruity side. I designed this recipe with the intentions of it being a S&V and free of any extra sweetener however I did give in to temptation and add 0.25% CAP Super Sweet and found it absolutely delicious so if you do like that added sweetness then I would recommend as above,it doesn\u2019t need it though IMO. The profile to this recipe is a banana and blueberries blending with a light coconut cream. If you enjoy this recipe and my work please be so kind to leave a short review and rating on said recipe so that other mixers can see. Happy mixing guys and gals and stay hazey \ud83d\ude09\ud83d\udc99",
