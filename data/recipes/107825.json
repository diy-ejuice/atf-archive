  "description": "A refreshing passion fruit and lemonade cocktail.\r\n\r\nPassion fruit and lemonade is a very popular drink in my neck of the woods, especially amongst the ladies...It's a refreshing all-year-round drink and goes from good to great with a generous splash of vodka! The traditional drink involves a double shot of passion fruit concentrate into a glass filled with ice and lemonade.\r\n\r\nFA and FLV Passion fruit combined creates an authentic, sweet, tart and exotic passion fruit flavour second to none and is the main protagonist in this fantastic medley. \r\n\r\nLA Lemonade is the main lemonade profile and is boosted by VT Fizzy Sherbet to create the slight fizziness which characterises a true lemonade. VT Fizzy Sherbet can be subbed with FW Rainbow Sherbet but it does not do as good a job as the Fizzy Sherbet.\r\n\r\n Let the passion fruit settle for a day or so and enjoy!!\r\n\r\n ",
