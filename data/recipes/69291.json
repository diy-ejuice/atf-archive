  "description": "I found this base recipe on ELR, modified it only a small bit, so no credit goes to me on this.  After a 2 day steep it is really good.\r\n\r\nFuji Apple-  The main note in this juice, has a wet apple juice taste on the inhale\r\nKoolada-  Might be too strong for some, but I like it, gives it the ice sensation.\r\nPeach Juicy-  Reminds me of a fresh peach on the exhale.\r\nPeach White- Balances the peach flavor.\r\nStrawberry Ripe-  To be honest I can't taste it, I think it is helping with the sweetness or assisting in joining the apple and peach, either it works.",
