            "text": "Well done guys, this is really nice even after 1h steep. This could be a great base for pastries, pies, you could mix it up with other fruits in place of apple too. I think it could be quite versatile. The Caramel Rice Crispy Treats has such a nice caramel note (also mixes well with banana) and the Molasses has a beautiful dark sweet note @ 1%. Great use of Custard Premium, bringin' tha butta. Apple Filling does a great job at giving the impression of apple with it's spiced and Country Apple holds up quite well against all of these. I'd been playing with apple pie filling and using a few apple flavours but this recipe again goes to show how simple is best and is a great reminder. Keep up the great work, the recipes I've mixed have been great so far."
