    "description": "My rendition of a Watermelon and Strawberry bubblegum- less is more.\r\n\r\nFLV Bubble gum: versatile and non-intrusive pink bubblegum that won't bully the watermelon and strawberry. it's slightly chalky and so we use this relatively low.\r\nFLV Watermelon: Perfect balance of authentic and candied watermelon with watery undertones that will help combat some of the chalkiness in the bubblegum and give that mouth-watering experience\r\nFLV Strawberry: this is a versatile  with a good balance of the authentic fruit with light candy syrup tones. slightly floral but this serves this particular recipe well as it gives that just-opened-a-packet-of-gum smell which is perfect for this recipe - we going for a candy profile after all\r\nFLV Sweetness: Its a candy and although the watermelon and strawberry is relatively  sweet already we are just going to bump it a tad, for me FLV sweetness gets stronger on the steep, so we will use it in moderation\r\nFLV Lemon: just to sharpen the profile a bit and mask some of the artificial tones in the sweetner\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
