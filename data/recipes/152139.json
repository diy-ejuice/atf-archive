    "description": "An uber creamy panna cotta drenched in a vibrant forrest fruit coulis.\r\n\r\nThis is a delectable Panna cotta, with added zing, demonstrating the simplicity of creating an simple, yet complex tasting juice using 3 or 4 quality ingredients. The yoghurt isn\u2019t entirely necessary but it adds an additional layer of complexity to take the base from good to magnificent...\r\n\r\nMB Panna Cotta is described as a \u201cCreamy and soft panna cotta dessert with soft cream and hint of raspberry and a touch of vanilla\u201d which perfectly surmises this gem. I picked up an unexpected nutty\/malty note which keeps this from being flat but may take some by surprise. Although the malty note is not unpleasant, it may not fit into delicate recipes where a true, plain panna cotta is the desired profile. In this recipe however, it adds depth and marries beautifully with the dark & earthy berry layer. \r\n\r\nI added a smidgen of FW Yoghurt to cut through the creaminess and add a bit of \u2018zing\u2019 to the Panna cotta base. This can be omitted if you prefer a fuller, creamier vape but I  believe the two compliments one another perfectly.  \r\n\r\nThe fruit layer is not a new revelation, but this combo just works so stunningly, that it was the obvious choice as the crowning jewel to adorn our lionheart. \r\nThe hint of raspberry in the panna cotta is just enough to compliment the fruit combo and sits nicely in the background. \r\n\r\nWS23 optional at 0.25% to emulate a cold version, and works a treat here.\r\n\r\nThe cream needs at least 7 days to find its happy place. 2 weeks is better...\r\n\r\nRecipe development video here: https:\/\/youtu.be\/VmDya_URceM\r\n",

Thanks!"
