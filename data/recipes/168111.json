  "description": "MUST READ DESCRIPTION! I AM NOT USING PINK BURST , I AM USING RED BURST BY (NORTH WEST VG FLAVORS) witch you can buy over at eciggexpress that’s the only place i have found it . This is a clone of a Cherry starburst (The red ones) i used the same kind of lay out that wayne walker did with his PINK BURST  recipe . it’s good as a shake and vape . give it like 5 mins to mellow out and it’s good to go . Please give a rating weather it’s a good one or a bad one but this  recipe is amazing . ",
