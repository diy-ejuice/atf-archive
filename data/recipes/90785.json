  "description": "Trying out some new flavors.\r\n\r\nWhat more can I say . . . three rices and two puddings (with a little bit of Caramel Butter for a bit more buttery richness).  This works great as a SNV . . . the rices come together to make an extremely accurate rice flavor.  Mixed with a buttery, caramel pudding, I find this to be a smooth, sweet, and savory vape.  Mixed at 60vg/40pg . . . it will be interesting to see if the VT Rice Base can hold the FE Sweet Rice flavor together (instead of it devolving into a generic stacrch).  The WF Caramel Rice Crispy adds a touch of rice but is an important element of the caramel note paired with WF Caramel Butter.  ",

Steeped 12 days while it traveled in the mail from recipe creator. The carmel butter floats around with a perfectly balanced flavor adding obvious butter to the base and a bright authentic well caramelized top layer tone. Throat hit is smooth considering how well toasted to top layer is. Just beautiful.&#xD;\n&#xD;\nThis is one very authentic rice pudding. Alternatively I am also getting a \"French Toast\" vibe from it as well. Which means you could pick at the mid layer and get somewhere with a French Toast.&#xD;\n&#xD;\nBrought this around to a local vape shop and the most common two descriptors were \"On-point\" and \"Authentic\"&#xD;\n&#xD;\n&#xD;\n&#xD;\n"
