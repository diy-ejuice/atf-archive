    "description": "Oh \"You Turkey!\" why? Why would I take on one of the most difficult and often subjective recipes to try and create in the art of eLiquid creation?\r\nBecause I enjoy the challenge! \r\nTo me this is almost the Mount Everest of eLiquid recipes to try and create. I've made many, many attempts of this over the years and I have tried some commercial attempts that are out there on the market as well. All of them lacked body and cut the throat. This is why this profile is often unsuccessful IMO. \r\nIt's a really difficult profile to balance. \r\nThe Turkish Delight (also known as Lokum) is no doubts as subjective as standing up for your Nan's best version of this, as it's a love or hate flavor and has many wide and varied versions.\r\nThis version is stripped back to being a base. You can add a little pistachio, almond or even some chocolate to this base recipe and it has held very well. \r\nFlv Pistachio, FA Almond or a combo at low %'s are good or 3% MB Glamour Choc+1 % Cap Double V2 was successful for a 'Fryers' style when I tested this worked well. \r\nSome may want a powdered sugar, I tried the obvious choice of \"One on One\" PS but it gets kinda lost in this IMO. \r\n\r\nThe difficultly in making this recipe decent is the harshness from a \"Rose\" flavoured concentrate and working out how to tame that turkey! lol\r\n\r\nThen BOOM! Flavorah releases a \"Rose Essence\" concentrate, just when I thought this recipe couldn't get any better. After SFT the FLV Rose Essence & getting excited,  it soon became apparent that it just wasn't going to find a way to balance here.  It's lovely but better served with creams IMHO.\r\n\r\nRose Stone - I discovered the wonderful flavour pairing of INW Plum & Wild Rose and fell in love. It was a balancing act on a tightrope to get the depth of flavour without harshness but I finally got there. \r\n\r\nThe other challenge for me was to try and a create jelly like flavor that carries throughout the vape, in a way that really complements the effort that went into the \"Rose Stone\". Marshmallow really assists in the texture, sweetness and body of this vape. However to get that sticky jelly effect proved more difficult. NO other jelly candies would seemingly work here for me and I tried Swedish this & 27 that. Purilum Jelly candy is ok but it is an essential assistant here. The flavour works really well with FA Jack (Pazzo) and the FA Jammy Candy Wizard is just the magic to tie these flavours together to assist the right balance of texture on my pallet. \r\nThis is a labor of love, it is my version based on my experience of a lovely Turkish delight.\r\n \r\nI hope you enjoy this as much as I have enjoyed the challenge of creating this !\r\n\r\nDon't be a Turkey though! Mix it, try it and let me know if this is the best dam Turkish Delight eLiquid you have tasted just as much as I think it is!\r\n\r\nI enjoyed creating and testing this recipe on a SST Fused Clapton 0.2 ohm at 60W on a Wotofo Recurve RDA \r\n\r\nSeriously if you wanna a solid recipe that works give it a go!\r\n\r\nCheers for reading this far, now go and get mixing!\r\n\r\n\"Together, Let's Discover!!!\"\r\n\r\nFacebook - https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/groups\/diydownunder\/\r\nDiscord - https:\/\/discord.gg\/kH4Fqbc\r\nYoutube - https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/c\/diydownunder\r\nWebsite - https:\/\/www.diydownunder.com\/\r\nInstagram IGTV : @diydownunder",

I think I will try adding some pistachio next time since that is my \"normal\" lokum and I don't get much powdered sugar. But this is so different and so solid. I'm beyond impressed with the mixers skills."
