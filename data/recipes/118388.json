  "name": "eJuice Fairy - Autumn Pipe Tobacco",
  "description": "This is the craft beer of Pipe tobacco. The essence of this picture inspired me to work with earth notes and the different colors on the leaves inspired me to use FA 7Leaves and I also was inspired to used FA Glory because of it's strong nutty tobacco notes. and Native Tobacco from FLV to intensify the tobacco note. To me the fall represents a lot of fragrances and aromas that are rich and deep and earthy. In the fall we also have the harvest of pumpkins, gourds, yams, Taro and other roots.  In a sense i wanted to present to you a very nice aromatic fall fragranced tobacco. \r\nGlory and 7Leaves are my tobaccos of choice I used a small amount of FLV pumpkin bread to incorporate a tiny bit of anise and a little bit of a spice note accented the pumpkin with a little bit of Taro for its aromatic and semi dry properties. Toasted Almond is in this mix to tone down a little bit of the peanut notes in Glory and accent some of the other nuts in the tobacco. finally I added cheesecake from FA for the smooth finish and a bit of mouth feel that rounds out all the edges in the mix. This mix will surprise you. Its aromatic, Its pumpkin and its definitely a very smooth silky tobacco. Strong enough for a POd yet smooth enough for a dripper. ",
