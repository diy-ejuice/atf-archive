  "description": "I started with this recipe a few weeks ago when someone I knew returned from Hawaii with Guava White Grape Wine\r\n ( https://volcanowinery.com/product/hawaiian-guava-grape/ )  this inspired me to try to get a white guava mix i ended up going the fizzy boozy drink route I originally tried it with FE Golden Grape which just came off as too dark of a grape for this , second grape i tried was PUR White Grape which I thought was decent but using the VT after U/ID10-T talked about it on Noted Grape \r\n(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxyXqTYvMAk) I feel like the VT White Grape was a better fit for this recipe.Adjust Sweetener & Coolant to liking (I used 1 drop FW Sweetener/15 ml). Feedback and Suggestions Welcome \r\n\r\nVT White Grape (2%)-Spot On Sweet White Grape has a chemical aftertaste that I tried to cover up.\r\nFLV Pink Guava (2%)-I love the Hoppy-ness this bring the recipe and how the white grape accentuates it.\r\nFW Pink Champagne (1.5%)- The \"Champagne\" in this works with the hoppy-ness of the Pink Guava, The fizzy-ness works with my soda base and it has white grape notes which help out the White Grape.\r\nVT Fizzy Sherbet (1%)  & FLV Citrus Soda (0.5%)- This is what I used as my soda accent, you could probably push the citrus soda higher in this soda base but for me when I push it over 0.75% I get headaches feel to bump that up.
