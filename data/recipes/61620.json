(This is the one that works for me) I believe this version may have came from Reddit... \ud83e\udd14 It's been so long since I came across it that I forget... I've went and subbed TPA RY4D instead of FA RY4... I ran out of FA and I think that TPA overall fits the (dessert\/bakery\/tobacco) profile better anyhow... Its a tried and true version of Deadly Sin, I've mixed it for my wife many, many, many times! Hope you will enjoy it as well! \ud83d\udc4a\ud83d\ude01",
