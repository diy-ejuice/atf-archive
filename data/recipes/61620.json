  "description": "(Nik's Deadly Sin) This recipe isn't mine by any means it can be found around the interwebs somewhere in different variations. (This is the one that works for me) I believe this version may have came from Reddit... ü§î It's been so long since I came across it that I forget... I've went and subbed TPA RY4D instead of FA RY4... I ran out of FA and I think that TPA overall fits the (dessert/bakery/tobacco) profile better anyhow... Its a tried and true version of Deadly Sin, I've mixed it for my wife many, many, many times! Hope you will enjoy it as well! üëäüòÅ",
