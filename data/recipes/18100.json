    "description": "Strapple cinnamon cookie- I need to use fa red touch to add a realistic strawberry and plays better with jf fuji then with tfa strawberry ripe by itself. I then added fa fuji to add some wetness to the cookie instead of using up one of my ingredients up. The strawberry ripe plays very well with fa strawberry and now those together play very well with the fuji apples. Adding cinnamon was just second nature at that percentage along with the cookie at that percentage as well. End result- I wanted a perfect strapple cinnamon cookie and after 3 other profiles did not work out, I feel I really rocked it with this recipe.    How does it vape? Inhale=apple and stawberry Exhale=  a nice cookie but not too robust at all with a cinnamon backnote that is way more enjoyable then being in the front.  Almost feels as if it hits all the places on the tounge that perceive taste, hope you enjoy!",
