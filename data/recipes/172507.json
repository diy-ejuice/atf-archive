  "description": "A thick & rich delectable cheesecake marbled with sticky caramel. \r\n\r\nThis is a simple 3,2,1 cheesecake celebrating the magnificence of power ingredients. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINW Yes, we cheesecake has been my go-to since it’s release and it continues to surprise me for it pure simplicity. This , European style cheesecake, perfectly encapsulates all that is cheesecake with ease. The rich, creamy & velvety smooth filling sits lovingly atop an unassuming base, given a delicate boost in the form of INW Coconut cookies, which is beyond superb in itself. A light & crisp coconut cookie with a touch of vanilla is the perfect beau for our paladin. \r\n\r\nHS caramel toffee adds a deep, sticky  and slightly sweet layer to enhance the threesome without distracting from the main profile. \r\n\r\nGive this baby 3 to 5 days to settle and enjoy!",
