    "description": "Simple 1-2-3 Sour Blue Razz Candy, ready for spring and summer!\r\n\r\nAfter hearing AlfredPudding rave about WF Sour Ball Candy on Noted, I had to pick it up. It brings a sour note as well as rounding out the other ingredients to make it a single entity.\r\n\r\nI'll be honest, I've never even used TPA Raspberry. It was sitting in my drawer, I was brainstorming flavorings for this profile, tasted it on the back of my hand, and threw it in here. I feel it compliments the WF Sour Blue Raspberry Candy well, and adds more sweet depth to the raspberry flavor.\r\n\r\nWF Sour Blue Raspberry is such a good Blue Razz. Sour, sweet, and syrupy. As soon as I exhale, I want to pick it up again. Lick a drop of this flavor off the back of your hand and you'll know all you need to know.\r\n\r\nIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII\r\n\r\nBest vaped from drippers or flavor forward RTA's. This recipe tastes like slightly sweet air out of most pods and sub-ohm tanks in my experience, even with percentage's doubled.\r\n\r\n\r\nUpdate: 9\/10\/2020- Almost a year and a half later, but adding WS-23 at your desired percentage is great with this as well",
