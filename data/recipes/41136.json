  "description": "Do you like apple pie filling so much that you could scoop it out of the crust and eat it by itself? then this is for you! \r\n\r\nFA Fuji and FA Pear make a soft apple flavor complimented by the TFA KY Bourbon and FLV Rich Cinnamon to provide the baked and seasoned aspect.\r\n\r\nJF Yellow Cake and FA Zeppola give this a bakery tone that feels like the taste of the crust the filling was baked in.\r\n\r\nThis was a submission to the mixers club and after trying a few versions to bring this to full-on pie, i decided that i liked this version best.\r\n\r\nTwo weeks steeping brings this to perfection.",
