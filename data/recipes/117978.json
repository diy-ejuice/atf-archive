    "description": "Hi all! Here is my recipe for **Bluebery Chocolate Glazed Muffin**!\r\n\r\n**Background**\r\nOne of my top ADVs, along with Strawberry Shortcake I will share when I'm satisfied with it.\r\n\r\nThe recipe is good straight after it's mixed, although with longer steeping some of the harsh notes, especially some of those TFA \"sparkly\" chemical notes disappear after about a week. A month later this mix is just right and tastes very round with no notes peaking or shadowing the rest of the mix. Although after a month, some of the fresh pastry notes may go a little muted, especially the CAP Graham Cracker cinnamony note I love about this mix gets a little weaker. But the mix was very good two months after mixing, too, so it lasts for quite a while.\r\n\r\nI have been working on this recipe for quite a while tweaking percentages and playing with different brands, especially the chocolate was very hard to get right. I finally settled with FA for chocolate, because it induced minimal, almost none of that synthetic gasolineish offnote.\r\n\r\nThis mix, although it may seem complex, is constituted mainly of minor notes that I wanted to introduce to replicate the taste of freshly baked muffin. Down in the post you will find why I used the flavors I used. The percentages are fairly weak to avoid ending up with a overpowering mix. I also wanted to avoid oversaturating the sense of smell.\r\n\r\n**Flavors**\r\n\r\nFA Chocolate, FA Cocoa and TFA Acetylpyrazine - A friend of mine suggested this combination and I can't get enough of it in my recipes. I have pre-mixed 20mils of 1:1:1 and marked it Belgian Chocolate, because that's exactly what it reminds me of. I don't get pastry notes from AP at all! AP for me is more like a thickening agent for the flavors. Cocoa and Chocolate by themselves are great, too, but feel too thin on the palate - introducing AP sort makes the flavor much thicker, almost sort of a melting chocolate taste and it also eliminates the gasoline chemical offnote I get from it.\r\n\r\nFA Cookie - This one was the choice for this mix simply because it is plain and on spot. I tried Cookie Dough flavors, I tried biscuits flavors, but they all had that \"doughy\" raw feeling to me. Almost as if there was no \"baked\"-ness in it. FA Cookie is loveable for it's simplicity. It just adds the baked flour and sugar with no other notes and that's what I need to be able to put more flavors in the mix later.\r\n\r\nFA Meringue - This one I added just because I add it everywhere where I add FA Cookie. It lifts the bakery notes even more and promotes the freshly baked flavor. It really helps to build a solid bakery foundation in a lot of my recipes.\r\n\r\nFA Joy - Joy for me is the yeast in the recipe. The flavor that fills in the fluffy bakery foundation and makes sort of a bridge between the rest of the flavors. Without Joy it tastes more like a cake than a soft bread muffin. When added at 2%, the mix then is more like a donut or a bun. \r\n\r\nTFA Butter - This was actually the last one I experimented with in this recipe and took me a while to get it right. I feel like it promotes the chocolate in the mix even more, but in the melty soft way. It also rounded the recipe beautifuly. When I tried it at my usual 2%, the mix was too soft and .. well.. buttery. When I tried less than 1%, some of the other flavors started peaking a little.\r\n\r\nTFA Cotton Candy - This one adds the sugar to the recipe. I don't know, without it the mix just wasn't sweet enough. With Sucralose based sweeteners the mix was too sweet, almost unvapable - felt too juicy, too muted.\r\n\r\nCAP Graham Cracker - This one was very hard to discover actually. I tried several muffin\/dough\/cake flavors, but when I added this one, with it's soft cinnamony notes, it hit me. This was it. And I loved it. Just for the curious ones, I tried FA Nonna's Cake - it tasted more like a shortcake. I tried CAP Biscuits - too doughy.\r\n\r\nand finally\r\n\r\nFA Bilberry - FA Bilberry just hits the sweet spot between candy blueberry and slightly floral blueberry. It is subtle, but still fills out the space with that beautiful european mountain goodness. It brings freshness, rounded fruit notes and soft calming aroma of blueberries. I have tried 2% in the beginning and I was alright with it, but I found out over the many trials, that it sort of mutes the bakery notes, so I lowered the percentage to 1%. 1% was on the other side of the thing. The blueberry flavor was there, but was lacking the juicy. It just didn't have the Berry in it. 1.5% was a go then and I'm sticking with this percentage since then.\r\n\r\nI really hope you like this recipe as much as I do and also any tips, ideas or improvements are very welcome.\r\n",
