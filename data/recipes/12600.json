  "description": "The name: a random name generated by ATF on android.  Didn't even bother changing it.\r\n\r\nFruit Loops.  Pretty simple.. \r\nFW Fruit Rings:  The fruit loops base.  The lemon taste is better in FW version than the lemon pledge of TFA.\r\nFA Cream Fresh + FA Almond + TFA Bavarian Cream:  The milk.  Cream Fresh provides a nice milk tone without being overly sweet.  The bavarian cream builds a little sweetness and the almond provides an extra flavor to the milk.  Without the almond, the milk flavor tastes a bit flat.\r\nTFA Brown Sugar: Just added at such a small amount to accent the Fruit Rings.  Adding a small piece of complexity to the Fruit Rings.",
