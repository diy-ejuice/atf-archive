Here is my breakdown of what I used and why.\r\n\r\nInw Biscuit: I really love the baked to golden perfect tone biscuit brings. It really helps sell my cookie , and fill in well with FA Cookie.\r\n\r\nFA Cookie: Cookie is the other half of my cookie. I love the baked texture and flavor it adds. It really is a nicely done cookie. \r\n\r\nTPA Peanut Butter: of course this would be in a pbj mix it\u2019s the king if peanut butter. It isn\u2019t super dry , and really does have a nice authentic taste. Never tastes greasy to me either.\r\n\r\nFlv Peanut Butter: this is a added layer to tpa pb. This brings in that slight earthy note I tend to pick up from pb. It really sells it and steeps very well.\r\n\r\nTPA Grape candy\/ TPA grape juice\/ INW grapes : I layered these grapes quiet a few times using them. They gave me a really bright and candied grape. I was close to hitting what I wanted, but none of them sold me on jam. \r\n\r\nCap Blueberry jam: that\u2019s where the bb jam came in. I used it at such a tiny % that it didn\u2019t add any blueberry notes, but it did step up my jam game. It played off the grapes so nice, and gave me such a nice jammy note. \r\n\r\nLastly I added some super sweet. I used 30 drops. I tried this mix without it, and it just needs the sweetener to bring it all together. Jam is sweet that\u2019s why it\u2019s so good. \r\n\r\nI\u2019m always working on my recipes, and trying to improve if you try this please drop a review and let me know what you think.",
