  "description": "Strabismus = cross-eyed. Abysmal = the potential result of carelessly mixing Strawberry Ripe and CDS. Snake = Bavarian Cream + Coconut. \r\n\r\nBaked cinnamon apple topped with strawberry-coconut cream. \r\n\r\nThis silly serpent is the derpy little offspring of two previous recipes, Snake Bite (apples and coconut cream) and Snake Eyes Remix (cinnamon-banana coconut cream), both of which are not clones, but improvements on commercial juices by Seduce Juice. Strawberry Ripe works here as a berry-tinted soft camera filter, turning everything a lovely shade of sweet pink and blurring the otherwise too-sharp line between baked cinnamon apples and rich coconut cream. CDS + JF Fuji gives the impression of apple that's been peeled, halved, cored, liberally sprinkled with cinnamon, baked, and served warm; there's also a brown, mapely tint to Bavarian Cream that contributes to the impression of baked fruit. The two coconuts work in tandem to turn that cream into coconut cream, one imparting a realistic coconut taste while the other ties that flavor to the cream. The coconuts and cream seem like separate entities when shaken-and-vaped, but after a week alone together in the dark, they make a coconut cream-flavored beast with two backs that's ready to be blended with just enough mushy once-frozen, now-thawed strawberries to turn it pink, and then served piled high in the cored center of half of a cinnamon-spiced baked Fuji apple.
