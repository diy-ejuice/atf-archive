  "description": "So i made this mix about a year ago decided to share it .(If you would like to make it slightly creamier use maybe some [FA] meringue at 0.5% or Vapetrains cheesecake at 0.5% I personally used Vapewilds say, cheesecake at 0.5% and it’s surprisingly good ) It’s Blueberry Waffles STUFFED with creamy cream cheese , And some blueberry syrup to top it off. My girl loves this  recipe . I know most people probably don’t have vape wild concentrates so if you don’t i  suggest you go pick up there say cheesecake it’s pretty good like i said . also there kiwi is lit . I bought them like the first time i started mixing . ",
