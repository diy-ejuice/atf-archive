    "description": "A golden Turkish tobacco, with undertones of classic Eurasian spice and subtle dried fruits\r\n\r\nINW Gold For Pipe - Using this as the primary base, nice light blend of tobaccos with slight sweetness. Some notes from ELR mentioned citrus notes but it's pretty indiscernible for me personally, just adds to the slight fruity undertones here. \r\n\r\nINW Gold Ducat (reformulated version) - Mellower than the old one IMO, but still a moderately dense body that adds some dimension to the vape, brings some smokiness and spice with nondescript fruit notes.\r\n\r\nINW Tobacco Oriental & TA Oriental - Looking at these two as one unit. Using them pretty conservatively, but they bring some legit turkish tobacco flavor into the fold and really round out the sweet & spicy tobacco I'm aiming for.\r\n\r\nDry with a pretty hefty throat hit off the shake, but if you really like spice they're strongest the first week after mixing. Really mellows out after a week and becomes much more enjoyable, but give it a few more days to really mature.",

            "text": "T\u00fct\u00fcn&#xD;\n&#xD;\nRight from the start I knew it would be impossible for this to be a bad recipe. I have two rules in life: never wear black without the Blue, and never mix Gold (Ducat) without the Gold (for Pipe.) You had mentioned that after a couple weeks the flavors started to lose their kick, but I\u2019m still tasting the Golds pretty well. I do, however, agree that maybe some tweaks to percentages could be beneficial. The INW Oriental I don\u2019t think is quite strong enough to use at .75% and still come through the Gold combo. I also wouldn\u2019t be too shy with the Tobacco Absolute Oriental. I think those two INW Orientals are pretty similar in flavor, so maybe just using one, and then maybe some FLV Turkish might help break through the Golden Gate. Naturally, I would choose to keep the Tobacco Absolute in there because I like a good kick of authentic tobacco in my recipes, but I\u2019d maybe even be bold enough to try out 1.5%, and then add maybe .75% FLV Turkish to get some of those spice notes in there. &#xD;\n&#xD;\nBut as it is, it\u2019s still very good. After about 10-15 ml I started to taste some more of the spice, or at least get a little more action on the end of the exhale. I found myself wondering if it was the Orientals coming through, or just a bit of kick from the Gold Ducat. I\u2019m still not 100% sure where I land on that, but I\u2019m confident that a bit more Oriental wouldn\u2019t be a bad thing. FLV Turkish might not be the answer either, but I think it would be good for at least a 10 ml test just to rule it out. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever experimented with FLV Turkish with Gold Ducat, but it doesn\u2019t seem like a horrible idea in my head. &#xD;\n&#xD;\nEither way, as it was mixed, I did not struggle finishing off the 30 ml. I\u2019ll probably wait to mix up more to see if you decide to tweak anything, but if you decide that the way it is now is the way it should be, I\u2019d definitely give it another mix. "
