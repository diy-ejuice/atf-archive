    "description": "I went with FA Strawberry and FA Kiwi as the combo of fruits as FA Strawberry is both soft and flavorful yet reminds me of freshly picked ripened strawberries, while FA Kiwi is bold and flavorful with a nice undertone of rind\/skin that complements its strawberry pairing really well imo. \r\n\r\nDragonfruit is here because it\u2019s just fucking amazing at giving that juicy quality to other fruits. It really helps amp up the flavor profiles of the FA\u2019s. I can\u2019t live without using TFA Dragonfruit. \r\n\r\nFA Marshallow, TFA Whipped Cream and TFA Vanilla swirl are a common trio i like to use with fruits as they add a great base to the fruit by making the vape dense in the mouth while lending their individual creaminess and sweetness to further accentuate the overall feel and flavor. \r\n\r\nCAP SS is totally optional depending on your view towards the inclusion of sweetener in a mix. I used it here because to me it presented an almost \u201csugar covered\u201d feel to the overall recipe. Sugar coated strawberries and kiwi. It helped blend the fruits and smooth over any potential harshness from the rind flavor of FA Kiwi. I never go above .25% as that seems to be the sweet spot.",
