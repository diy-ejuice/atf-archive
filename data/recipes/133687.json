  "description": "A simple 3 flavor recipe that I enjoy in MTL tanks. Basically a strong licorice vape with a candy like strawberry undertone wafting through. I get the strawberry flavors on the initial exhale with the licorice filling in at the end of the vape and lingering on. \r\n\r\nI tested several Licorice flavors before selecting TFA Absinthe. FlavorArt Black Touch was too light in flavor and when you increased the percentage it went floral. FlavorArt Anise had a nice Licorice flavor but too creamy and did not increase in flavor linearly. Jungle Flavors Aniseed also had a good Licorice note, but when increased I got hints of Play-Doh which was too distracting. Flavor West Black Licorice was very good, but too soft for what I was looking for. TFA Absinthe really hit the mark with a strong Licorice forward flavor. Flavor West Black Licorice would probably be a good substitute if you are looking for a softer Licorice note.\r\n\r\nThe Strawberry blend was my attempt at getting a candy like strawberry with a tad bit of realism added to it. I know TFA Strawberry is a polarizing flavor, but adding the FA Red Touch tended to round it out a bit, and I find it pretty enjoyable.\r\n\r\nI usually vape this in either the Vandy Vape Berserker or Berserker Mini MTL tanks at a 12 mg Nic level for a nice experience. This might work in pod systems, but I don't have any to try it out with.\r\n\r\n[update 2/9/2019] I was perusing through ELR and noticed a very similar recipe to this one called Absinthe Strawberry by thedescolada. It is 4% TFA Absinthe and 7% TFA Strawberry. I did not even know it existed when I formulate this recipe. I'm not sure I would have liked Absinthe Strawberry as I think there is just too much TFA Strawberry, but as always YMMV. Might have saved me some time and money testing Licorice flavors if I would have found it beforehand though LOL.\r\n\r\n[update 5/15/2019] Been playing around with some different Strawberry blends. Not sure how I want to introduce them to this recipe (v2?), but my original testing has been with FA Juicy Strawberry at 2.5%, FA Red Touch at 2.0%, and INW Shisha Strawberry at 0.5%. Before I commit to any delta I want to get my hands on some JF Strawberry Sweet and play with it in the mix. Even still if you replace the recipe Strawberries with the above it is pretty tasty with a different vibe (the steep time for sure is a bit longer - like 5 days).",
