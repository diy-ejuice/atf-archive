  "description": "One year while working lakeside at a really epic tattoo studio, I made my second home at this really stellar Mexican restaurant.  Aside from their mexi-dip that would have me getting outta bed for midnight cravings,  they served this in-house made Sangria that led to me sleeping in their booths more than once.  You'd get these massive jugs for 20$, they'd put citrus slices & cherries In there that would sink to the bottom & be the most delish booze soaked treat to fish out the bottom after you polished off a jug.  This sangria was so fresh & fruity that you barely tasted the alcohol, so couple that with the price, ergo; booth bed!  \r\nThis place has since closed the franchise taking their recipes to the grave :'(    \r\n\r\nI was attempting to make a sweet & slightly boozy sangria without the chill factor because the way I was taught to drink sangria by my ex GF's mom who grew up in spain is at room temp (something about the smoothness of the wine and brandy?) but in the heat sometimes with chilled perrier & cold fruit.   \r\n\r\nI am finally finished with this recipe which initially started out as just 8% RF sangria and 2% champagne which, simple as it is, is UHmazing!  But since I started out with this intending a more complex recipe I kept tweaking & playing with it & have come up with something juicy, boozy, bubbly, fruity...and in perfect time for our stupidly late warm weather.  \r\n**(if you have the non SC version of sangria, it should be increased to 8%)**\r\n\r\nChampagne gives it a touch of bubbly booziness which is enhanced by the soda base (you can almost feel it fizz on your tongue on the exhale) & liquid amber.  The combo gives such a contradictory but unique mouth feel.\r\n\r\nMexican cactus gives it some juiciness (really an awesome flavor from Molin Berry, if you haven't tried it, do it NoW!)\r\n\r\nThe fruits; Royal Orange juice, Lemon, cherries/black cherry, shisha lime are for the fruits added to the sangria\r\n\r\nAdd sweetener &/or cooling to your liking.\r\nSNVapable!\r\n\r\nPlease rate and review if you mix it.  Its not just appreciated, its good etiquette!\r\n\r\nDo not post elsewhere or use for commercial gain.\r\n\r\nHappy mixing! :)",
