  "description": "This is my attempt at mixing a sour apple candy.\r\n\r\nUsing the Fuji for that strong, in your face apple profile\r\nINW pear is there for the juicyness and kind of helps carry the sourness to the tongue.\r\nthe INW sisha apple and CAP double apple  have a bit of that sour apple profile which makes this mix work better.\r\nFA sour for that bit of extra kick\r\n\r\n0.5% of sweetner might make this better, but I didn't use any myself as I find it to be sweet enough\r\n\r\nWARNING: Might be a bit harsher than most people would like\r\nBest at 70vg/30pg 3mg to not make it too harsh :)\r\n\r\nCan be SNV but gets a bit less harsh after 3 days",
