  "description": "I wanted to create a funky tropical summer mix and use some of my new flavors. \r\n \r\nSHISHA MANGO+ISLAND MANGO-\r\nI have been really digging this combo, shisha mango is pretty ripe, and island mango is a bit under-ripe. Combined I think they make a great balanced mango. \r\n\r\nTPA PAPAYA+WF PAPAYA-\r\nI really enjoy the tropical muskiness of tpa papaya and like using it @ 2%. Wf papaya is excellent, and it has a nice tropical sweetness. I didnt want too much of it to be present, I'm mainly using it for its sweetness and letting the tpa papaya shine. \r\n\r\nVT YELLOW PASSION+WF PASSIONFRUIT-\r\nVT yellow passion is great and pretty much the best passionfruit around, I want it to be very present, so I am maxing it out @ 2%. I am using WF passionfruit mainly for its citrus notes @ 1%. I was going to drop it completely and add a lemon or orange flavor, but I felt this was best utilized in this mix, instead of adding other erroneous flavors that would be distracting and get in the way.  \r\n\r\nThink of this as a sort of tropical diharrea,  Hard to spell but easy to get. I like to use .4% FW sweetener or.25% SS, the mix is pretty sweet already, so its not essential.",
