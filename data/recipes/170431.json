    "description": "...From Parts Unknown.\r\n\r\n*This is just my Green Bastard recipe scaled up x2 for Pods\/MTL. It does lose just a bit of it's more nuanced flavors but it is still very solid. I really just wanted to enjoy the bastard on the go :P*\r\n\r\nSo I just got Guanabana (FLV) to try out the All Day recipe (highly recommend BTW) and wow this flavor is amazingly complex. I love it! Anyway I was just messing around and wanted to create my own recipe with it. After a bit of picking I decided on Kiwi (FA) & Sweet Guava (CAP). I found that these flavors are similar, but have enough character to stand out on their own. Mixed this up and wow. It's perfect as is. Very sweet & juicy tropical fruit profile. Reminds me most of a Starfruit. Mix and enjoy!\r\n\r\nFlavor Comments\r\nGuanabana (FLV): Originally wanted this to be the star of the recipe, but after mixing and trying it I found it's most present on the finish.\r\n\r\nKiwi (FA): This flavor is actually the most present in this recipe. Meshes very well with the Guanabana & Guava.\r\n\r\nSweet Guava (CAP): This is meant really just to pair with the Guanabana but it actually adds quite a bit of character by itself. I believe it is also the main source of sweetness ",
