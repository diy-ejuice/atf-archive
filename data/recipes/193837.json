    "description": "This profile was created by a company by the name of Cloud Nine Vapors. It is a very unique Flavor. When i found this flavor it ended up being my ADV for a year. Then the company that made it stopped selling juices so i decided to try and clone it. I think this is 99% cloned. The only reason i don't say 100% is because I don't have the original to test against. This is a Max VG mix because the original is a 90\/10 so I make it that way. It is very good after 3 days so mix it up and enjoy.\r\n\r\nPrickly Victory:\r\nDo you like simple recipes? 2 ingredients provide mountains of flavor.\r\n\r\nInspired by slumberland pink hedgehog. Instead of grapefruit I did guava.\r\n\r\nI've been really diggin this guava flavor its super delicious. at 5% total this recipe has flavor for days, my 10ml sampler was gone in an hour and I just made a 50ml batch which will get me through these last few cold days before spring hits.\r\n\r\nthis shit is sweet enough I wouldn't dare put sweetener but go ahead if you please.\r\n\r\nShake and vape certified.\r\n\r\nRecipes inspired by this one: Tickly Victory by amouthforwar |\r\n\r\nThanks to Hashlingingslashur and Antjuice for  recipes that made this mashup possible.",
