  "description": "So I absolutely love Cuprian, but I can only ever vape it on RTAs/RDAs because it clogs up coils so badly. Here is my coil friendly alternative.\r\n\r\n\r\nTPA VBIC + HS FVIC is a match made in heaven. Really rounds out the VBIC giving it a more authentic, dense icecream flavour with a hint more dairy.\r\n\r\nThe chocolate could possibly be upped to 1.25% or 1.5% I reckon. If anyone tries it at 1.5% let me know. Oh and also MF flavours tend to get stronger and better after steeping, so if you find the chocolate a bit weak after a shake and vape just give it some time. Pretty good shake and vape anyhow.\r\n\r\nThe FLV creme de menthe is a bit icier than the FW and TPA versions, and has an inherantly chocolatey flavour so subbing it with FW creme de menthe is possible but not recommended. I much prefer Cuprian with FLV creme de menthe, and if you havnt tried the original with FLV creme de menthe then I highly recommend it. I probably prefer my version to the original, although im not sure if I prefer it to the original +FLV creme de menthe, il have to try them side by side.\r\n\r\nFA meringue can be subbed for TPA, it doesnt really matter too much which one you use. And im sure the cap marshmallow could be subbed for FA or TPA versions. The CAP marshmallow I used in this was the OG version. If you only have the newest cap marshmallow, then sub for FA/TPA.\r\n\r\nAs the original called for sweetener I used 2% erythritol, as it doesnt gunk up coils. Im sure it would be dandy without it though, so dont stop yourself from trying this if youre missing the Erythritol.\r\n\r\n",
