    "description": "Inspired by the beautiful sunsets we have in California. Once the sun starts to go down the sky is painted with vibrant reds, yellows, and oranges. These colors inspired the fruits of this mix. The tough part was finding a harmonious balance between sweet and tart. The foundation is built upon the sweet and full notes of peach and strawberry, while some more sharp tart notes come from the pineapple and orange. INW cherries really was the cherry on top for this recipe. It brings everything together and adds a nice forward note. After trying a few different sweeteners, FLV sweetness really gave the recipe what it needed. FLV sweetness manages to bring out the sweetness of the fruits and make them pop without adding unnecessary sweetness. I tried the recipe without sweetener, but the FLV sweetness brings this recipe to the next level.",
