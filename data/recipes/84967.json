    "description": "Looper by ANML clone\/remix. This is how ANML describes this profile, \"Looper by ANML is the newest addition to ANML's growing e-liquid collection, perfected and made by hand in small batches by Phillip Rocke. Looper carries a remarkably accurate flavor of fruity cereal over creamy milk; it has a complex-yet-immediately-familiar taste that flawlessly balances the crispness of a newly-opened box of fruity cereal with the rich, indulgent flavor of fresh milk.\"\r\nAs \"Premium\" juices go, I'm not too impressed with this. However, I know it's very popular and I wanted to tackle this for a much cheaper option while staying true to the original and possibly making it better. ANML says this is supposed to be a fruity cereal with fresh milk, but this is what I get from this vape. It's very lemony on top with a slight cereal note and a hint of cream. I also get a slight cactus after taste, which sounds weird, but I think it adds to the \"fruity cereal\" aspect. Here's how I deconstructed it.\r\nThe cereal:\r\nI'm not a big fan of cereal flavorings so instead of using those, I chose to use CAP Sugar Cookie. At 3% it adds the slight cereal note I was tasting when combined with the lemon, lemon lime, and cactus, and CAP Sugar Cookie adds the texture I was looking for.\r\nThe Fruity note:\r\nI've noticed a lot of recipes I've created using FE Lemon with a textured bakery, like CAP Sugar Cookie, resembles a \"fruit Loops\" like note. However, I was also getting a slight lime note as well. Using FE Lemon at .25% and just a touch of TPA Lemon Lime at .1% seemed to be spot on. But as I mentioned before I was also getting a slight cactus note on the end. With the addition of INW Cactus at .25% it made everything come together as it should, a \"fruit Loops\" cereal.\r\nThe Milk:\r\nI don't get much milk from the original but it is there. CAP Sweet Cream at .5% was just what was needed. I also added a touch of CAP Super Sweet to brighten things up a bit.\r\nIf you've followed some of my recipes you will notice I use very low flavor percentages. The Boss Reserve clone is a good example at only 4.25% total flavorings. This is another example of low flavor percentages coming out to only 4.35%. But it's packed with flavor. If you enjoy the original Looper, this one is pretty damn close and a hell of a lot cheaper!\r\n\r\nCan be a shake and vape but is best after a 3 day steep.\r\nVisit Freedom To Mix on Discord https:\/\/discord.gg\/SmSc8Ef\r\nVisit Freedom To Mix on FaceBook https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/groups\/415341418920740\/ \r\n\r\nPlease comment, mix, and or rate,....it makes us all better mixers.

            "text": "Awesome stuff folkart!  I have a bottle of Pandoro(FA) that I'm always looking for,or developing recipes into which I can incorporate it. Adding it to this mix at 1% worked well for me. I don't have Lemon\/Lime and used Lime Tahiti(Cold Pressed) in it's place as well as doubling the Lemon(FE), Sweet Cream(CAP) and Super Sweet(CAP) percentages. This personalized it for my tastes while still leaving total flavor low at 7.5% I really appreciate what all of you talented mixers share online. I'm about two and a half years into DIY and have a respectable number of originals,but, honestly my good recipes came to life with more luck than having a knack for it. I still have not tested single flavors and rely more on my experience baking in my kitchen to guide my flavor pairings. Anyway, thanks again!"

            "text": "WOW!!! This is great right off the bat, SNV not a problem. I did not have the Lemon(FE) or Lemon Lime(TPA), so sub'd with Lemon(INW) same % and also used Lemon Lime (CAP) same %. I don't know if the flavors you chose were absolute, but I have had Loopers and I can say this is 100% spot on. LOVE this!!! Thanks for the recipe."

            "text": "This is well done. I've never tried the original, so I can't attest to accuracy, but on it's own this is solid. Not an overpowering recipe. Light and sweet.&#xD;\n&#xD;\nIt has a real tasty cereal\/grain\/bakery base with just a touch of a nice lemon\/citrus overtone. It doesn't spot-on evoke Froot Loops, but it does evoke fruity cereal. Definitely it's own thing. A worthy addition to anyone's recipe rolodex. Easily a commercial-grade offering. &#xD;\n&#xD;\nI might kick up the lemon, and drop the Cactus. Not sure what it's adding, but a touch of FA Meringue and maybe some CAP Cereal 27 might be at home in a v2? FE Lemon is definitely a great choice for the citrus.&#xD;\n&#xD;\nClearly a worthwhile recipe by a talented mixer and flavor artist. Cheers!"
