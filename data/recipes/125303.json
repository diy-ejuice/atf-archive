    "description": "Based on Stark's Custard Cream, I'm trying to get to something approximating the eponymous biscuit we have here in the UK, but not too faithfully. \r\n\r\nI'm really liking the touch of Bavarian Cream I added in the last couple of experiments, the first batch of those is nicely steeped now after a week and tasting gorgeous to me, and will hopefully be even better in another week or three; it's become my firm ADV so I thought I'd share it. \r\n\r\nNext batch I'll try a bit more biscuit, I've not had any steeping long enough to see how it all balances out but it might need a bit more. I just made 200ml of this so am sorted for a supply of this for now, time to make some 10ml experiments !\r\n\r\nI've been playing with adding some chocolate direct into a nearly empty tank of this to get a Bourbon Cream (similar biscuit but with cocoa), hasn't worked yet, I only have two choc flavours (TFA double chocolate & Chef's Vapours chocolate concentrate) and neither is even close, if anyone has any suggestions for a good choc\/cocoa to use, I'll buy it and try it.\r\n\r\nVaping it on a Radar RDA dual alien .22 ohm setup, mixed at 50\/50 with 3mg of Nic, though I make 50\/50 with pretty much every recipe so it's not a specific recommendation for this recipe.",
