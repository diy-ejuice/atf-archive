    "description": "This Mix was done for Our 1st live episode using. We talked about FLV Berry Blend in a live show - https:\/\/youtu.be\/BYKq4D3Fh6o\r\n\r\nI wanted to see if I could mix Berry Blend as the main profile into something familiar that Ive done before.\r\nMy Idea here was to Use a Jelly Candy Base that I know well to test how the Berry Blend would stand up in a Mix and it did Surprisingly well!\r\n\r\nThe combination of the Black current adds adds some wetness to the Berry Blend giving you one Juicy Berry main Profile. I also added Candy roll to boost the berries some more, you end up with a visible and balanced mix of the the red and purple gummy bears together.\r\n\r\nFuji @ 1.5 adds a Candy syrup that pushes that 'natural' sweetness of the other fruits.\r\n\r\nI added a bit of sour here to mimic the juicy mouth sensation with a chewed gummy candy, I find the sour changes the way you taste some fruits and here it works well to do that.\r\n\r\nSweetner:\r\nAdd if you like sweet stuff, Dont if you dont :-)\r\n\r\nTHIS RECIPE IS NOT DONE! THERE WILL BE SOME CHANGES.",
