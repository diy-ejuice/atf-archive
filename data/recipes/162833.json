  "description": "How does only 1 percent of flavor concentrate deliver this much flavor? \r\nWow! \r\n\r\nThis is \"The Chosen One\"\r\n\r\nOver the years I have been mixing I have come to undertsand that there isn't a percentage rule as such when it comes to DIY eLiquid creation. \r\nAfter seeing a peer release a \"1 percenter\" recipe recently I was inspired to try my luck at one my self. \r\n\r\nI began with the thought of trying to chase a basic Strawberries and cream and as usual got side tracked as a picture went past my eyes of a toffee dipped strawberry lol. So I \"extra\" challenged myself to bring that into this recipe as well.\r\n\r\nThis is how the micro evolution of how \"The Chosen One\" was created. \r\n\r\nThere is only one strawberry I know of that will work at this low %.\r\nFlavorah Alpine Strawberry - IMO a maximum point is 0.2% and after a couple of days you get a nice wild strawberry flavor but past that point of 0.2% I get green dirt, but it works here well.\r\n\r\nThat Toffee is more like a toffee you would experience on a toffee apple. (no apple notes though).\r\nVape Train Hard Crack Toffee - is excellent in giving that glossy toffee mouthfeel & sweetness but it's temperamental and IMO only works this low for this application and does well. \r\n\r\nThe Cream\r\nThe combination of Flavorah Sweet Coconut and Flavorah Sweet Cream not only helps this profile with a lovely creaminess but also helps with the body and textual mouthfeel of this overall vape. This is not coconut heavy at all rather it contrasts the texture of the strawberry and helps the creaminess here very well. \r\n\r\nYou could add sweetener if you like but I enjoy the sweet authenticity of the strawberry in this and don't want to risk muting out the cream. \r\n\r\nA lovely efficient recipe, so simple yet so complex in flavor at only just a total of 1% of flavoring. \r\n\r\nSteep time 3 days (ok off the shake) \r\n\r\nTested on a Wotofo Recurve RDA 0.2ohm Alien Single SST coil at 60w\r\n\r\nEnjoy! \r\nI hope you enjoy this just as much as I enjoyed creating this recipe, but let me know what you thought in the comments below.\r\n\r\nSeriously if you like a solid recipe that works give it a go!\r\n\r\nCheers for reading this far, now go and get mixing!\r\n\r\n\"Together, Let's Discover!!!\"\r\n\r\nFacebook - https://www.facebook.com/groups/diydownunder/\r\nDiscord - https://discord.gg/kH4Fqbc\r\nYoutube - https://www.youtube.com/c/diydownunder\r\nWebsite - https://www.diydownunder.com/\r\nInstagram IGTV : @diydownunder\r\n",
