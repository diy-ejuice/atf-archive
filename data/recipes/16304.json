    "description": "STRAWBERRY COOKIE CREAM\r\nThis recipe started as mustard milk which evolved within a span of 3 - 4 months. It ended up becoming a Strawberry Cookie cream. One of my favorites right now.\r\n\r\nEdit: Feel free to sub Sugar Cookie v2 with Sugar Cookie v1. I didnt have it on hand when I created this recipe. Got my hands on v1 a week ago and it tastes pretty much the same as v2 (in this recipe at least). Maybe a liitle bit more creamy and buttery - but hey, that's a good thing!",

I added CAP Vanilla Bean Ice Cream instead of TPA (all I had) and Instead of TPA Bavarian Cream I used FW, but recipe is Dead on...I also added 1.5% Sweetner because I am dieting and I NEED the sweetness. Thanks so much to the creater, I will mix this over and over.  (Copied what I wrote in the Discussion section)&#xD;\n"

Good as a SNV, probably better with a steep as I find the FA Cookie giving me a bit of a bread note (personally though, I don't vape a ton of cookie flavours so I may adjust), i'll maybe try dropping that down to 1% if I make it again. All round though, pretty tasty."
