  "description": "I have seen Golden Oreo recipes, so i am gonna try to emulate it to the best of my abilities,, what I got was a nice vanilla sugar cookie with a sweet, but not coil killing sweet\r\nI get the cookie on the inhale and when rolled on the tongue the cookie and sweetness sits on the tongue and on exhale the sweetness continues with a slight vanilla cookie note... It's pretty damn good... But I still feel it's missing a little something maybe it could be a bit thicker, Well After 2 weeks i revisited this Profile, and it worked fine the way it was , however i still wanted to tinker with it just a bit to get some more thickness. so lets talk about why i chose the flavors i chose:\r\n\r\nMy Cookie Stone - INW Biscuit Has a Flaky /buttery crust and feels light and airy with a small amount of texture i felt 1% was all that was needed for this stone. paired with CAP sugar cookie and WF Graham cracker crust SC , the  CAP Sugar cookie is a must IMHO in any cookie type profile it carry's a flaky and buttery note as well and was the highest % used in this profile @ 4% ...the WF GCC sc on the other hand was a little different than what  i expected , it had sweetness, texture and a waxiness that fit right into this mix and bridged my cookie with the filling, it gave the filling that Oreo like waxy sugar filling. i used it @ .44% and it slide right in there......\r\nOn to the Creamy filling , I Paired TPA Meringue, TPA Bav Cream and TPA Van Swirl , the meringue was used for its sweetness and grittiness and its slight vanilla taste,Van Swirl was used for that creamy Vanilla and Bav Cream was used for a darker vanilla note and thickness... i am really happy with \r\nthis recipe ... its very satisfying \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
