    "description": "My goal is to create something like SVRF\u2019s satisfying.\r\n\r\nI\u2019m going to do my best to describe this the way I was dissecting it in my head.\r\n\r\nTea Base - TFA sweet tea and FE green tea. I like the sweet tea as the main flavor with a small amount of green tea to give it some more body. Koolada is added because , this is after all a cold beverage. I want to keep it as authentic as possible in that realm.\r\n\r\n\u201cTea Syrup\u201d - INW and FLV Raspberry with FA White Peach. I\u2019ve used either of these raspberry\u2019s separately in the past, I wanted something that tasted both real and candy-like. I put in a small amount of FA white peach to give the raspberry something to pop off of. I also like the harshness of white peach and feel like it gives me a nice bit of TH.\r\n\r\nFinally, I\u2019m using stevia in this mix for now. I haven\u2019t tried it but will often reach for CAP super sweet when I need sweetener. \r\n",
