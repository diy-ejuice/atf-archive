  "description": "a mix made for Alex Mcanally, known for being in the army and liking green stuff and having a crush on all his vape mates.\r\n\r\nAlex Mixanally - a rich vanilla custard pummelled with bourbon whisky and salted caramel  then finished off with hazelnut and coconut.\r\n\r\n3 different custard-esque concentrates combine to make the base (LB VIC, CAP VC, WF Tahitian) using LB and WF means it is going to steep out a bit quicker although some people may need to give this a few days due to the CAP V1.\r\n\r\nVTA salted caramel has been chosen as i find it the least \"burnt\" of all the salted caramels, well, all the ones that matter anyway... VTA golden syrup helps make that salted caramel a soft set caramel and also plays beautifully with the bourbon. \r\n\r\nVTA bourbon used at 2% avoided any smokiness but wasn't as strong as i'd like so i topped up with a smidge of FLV bourbon just to make it present enough but not to overtake everything else.\r\n\r\nFA coconut, Self Explanatory... used at 1.5% just to sit behind everything and not be overbearing.\r\n\r\nIf you like this recipe and what i do then please rate and review accordingly :) \r\n",
