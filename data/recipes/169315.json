    "description": "so this is basically spot on clone to me tell me what you guys think in the comments i tried Shakenvape007\u2019s although i thought it was a very close remix\/clone i deff thought there was something missing and the maple syrup he used was just to harsh to of had been in country clouds corn bread pudding so i did my own clone and took his maple syrup out and used FA maple syrup witch is much smoother and taste much better and i also wasnt getting the same thickness i get from the original corn bread pudding so i used vanilla pudding and it worked very well . The cheesecake graham crust and vanilla custard and vanilla pudding all combined create a very nice think mouth feel , i added in kettle corn by TPA to give a more \u201csweet corn\u201d taste because without it it kinda just feels like it\u2019s missing something it really makes a huge difference if you wanted less sweetness use kettle corn at 0.75%.  i\u2019m using 0.75 super sweet because the original is sweet AF . feel free to go up to 1 % or go down to 0.5% or even no % still works just not as  vibrant with out it .

            "text": "I was fortunate enough to have a sample sent to me by a friend with the cap SS at 0.25% I sat on this for about 10ml and it didnt really stand out to me. After a bit of a steep (and running out of juice on hand) I kept nipping at this until there was some aha moment where i just looked over at the bottle to assess (in fear) just how much of this I had left. This is the most telling sign of how good a mix is to me: How strong is the separation anxiety near the end? As for taste, I tried this blind only knowing it as Cornbread pudding. I swear I thought this was a butterscotch vape, tasting it. But better. BS can leave a cloying sweet trail that lingers in my throat long after it should have been gone, but that's the vibe here I get. Mid-inhale (im guessing, literally) that maple\/corn\/custard mix packs a warm smooth rich golden sweet with good body that doesnt come across as bakery, just a very nice mouthfeel, into something i can only describe as it's soft and warm and cozy. perfectly sweet, distinctive and yet familiar.&#xD;\n&#xD;\nthis is a 5\/5 mix, perfect also for fall time. if you are curious at all, dont hesitate to try this. well done!"

I never imagined  Cornbread and Kettle Corn in a vape with Maple syrup and custard. the original recipe maker  was ingenious selecting this combination for a vape. I have no idea what their stuff tasted like, but knowing what I have made will get even better over the next few weeks, I  gotta make a 60ml to tuck away, cause that 17 ml I made yesterday  wont last a day.   Unsure what it would have tasted like with v1 custard, but I cant see any reason now to check. This is a 5 star recipe. Blueberry version may be later today. Thanks BigRed! Following"

The profile just sounded good to me as I am a cereal\/AP fan.&#xD;\nThis is hands down the closest recipe yet to the original and IMO much better than the 20.00 bottle of liquid I just paid for...save your $$$, mix this one up!"

It's finally finished and steeped today and I'm vaping it and it taste AWESOME!

I mixed it and forgot about it for two months put it in a UWellTank and it is so good and so much like the Original in fact I know lots of people say this but I mean it , I think this mix is better.  Wish I had mixed a bigger batch then forgot about it for two months but it was only 20 ml...oh  well going to make a big one this time....Thanks so much for this..Love to all...Kim  OK made that big one and  it's about gone and making a bigger one today probably around 300 ml...for real this is one of two ADV's for me it is so delicious.  Bought the new Vaporesso Target 80MP and with those coils it really brings out the Maple sweetness with the cornbread...wow yum"

Only thing I changed after original tester was TFA maple syrup 1%in place of the fa maple. I swear that even though FA is less harsh, that cyclotene in the TFA is the magic ingredient. Beautiful mix. Iay bring the ccgc down to 2.75% next round. Cornbread pudding was my adv for a long time. It got me off the stinkies. You have no idea what it means to be able to have it back! Thanks Big Red for a wonderful mix!"

To me this is the best of the bunch as it hits the profile on the head and it didn't use cereal 27.  Not that i have anything against 27, but it can musk things up a bit. Well rounded and if the 30ml sample is empty after a few days some one did something right.. Nice work! "
