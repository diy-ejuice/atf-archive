    "description": "The French started it, Australia perfected it - The Vanilla Slice\r\n\r\nWhat is a Vanilla Slice?\r\nA snack similar to a mille-feuille, consisting of a layer of vanilla custard or cream between two layers of pastry with a thin layer of frosting on top & fresh out of the paper bag!  \"Bon Appetit-O\"\r\n\r\nIf you haven't had a dogs eye with dead horse while holding a coldie you are simply, un-Australian. \r\nThe kiwis invented the Pavlova, we perfected it, the French created champagne we perfected the bubbly, they also created a custard snack you couldn't pronounce called  \"mille-feuille\" which sounds like a drunken indecent proposition. We perfected that to. We put frosting on top that ties this delight together with class. We even sometimes  add a little passion fruit in the frosting if you wanted the \"High end\" fancy version.  I've kept this real though. A real, fair-dinkum, working-class  suburban bakery vanilla slice made to perfection (pronounced ah la pure-fekt). So if you don't mind froggies or as you may say \r\n\"exkoozim wah, ohhh o hoh hohhh\" I have now perfected this beauty in a vape!\r\n\r\nBe a bit patient with this one as 2 weeks really helps this become something that the frogs would get off their hind legs for and would make any Aussie weak at the knees.\r\n\r\nThe Cuz-tard Filling: \r\nI don't claim to be a custard virtuoso but this little combo of INW Custard, WF Flan,  Cap NYC & FLV Vanilla Pudding I came up with may just make me one. This combo stands up \"perfecto\" in this lovely multi cultural delight. Firm but fair, texture and the way it sits in ya gob is bang on I reckon! It's a fuller mouthfeel than a bad date at the back of a movie theater. The \"nilla\"  through this is bloody lovely!\r\n\r\nThe Pastry: \r\nOK OK you frogs, settle down, you guys nail pastry so you can have that one ! That's why I used the best in WF Croissant in this and it works well ! \r\n\r\nThe Frosting:\r\nNot to thick, not to thin, a little slight lemony note with a sweet edge is what this trio will give you and its bloody bootiful! If ya wanna get really schmancy and high end you can add *1% WF Passionfruit to this recipe as well if your into that sorta thing. This little \"Frosting trilogy\" will have ya lick'n ya lips ! (*or pashing them)\r\n\r\nSo get real, get fair dinkum about a decent DIY vape recipe and get gobsmacked with a mouthful of deliciousness !\r\nIf ya reckon it could be better let me know smart arse! lol\r\n\r\nSeriously if you wanna a solid recipe that works give it a go! \r\n\r\nCheers for reading this far, now go and get mixing! \r\n\r\n\"Together, Let's Discover!!!\"\r\n\r\nFacebook - https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/groups\/diydownunder\/\r\nDiscord - https:\/\/discord.gg\/kH4Fqbc\r\nYoutube - https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/c\/diydownunder\r\nWebsite - https:\/\/www.diydownunder.com\/\r\nInstagram IGTV : @diydownunder\r\n\r\nI enjoyed this at 65W on a WOTOFO Recurve RDA\r\n\r\nSteep - vapable off the shake but have some patience! Give it good couple of weeks and reap the rewards! \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
