  "description": "Well folks the Holidays are upon us and I have been working on this profile for over a month. This is my best representation of Gingerbread Cookies. The combination of Cap Sugar Cookie, FW Graham Cracker, and TFA Butter create that cookie base with a hint of cinnamon. The Cap Gingerbread is a great flavoring that plays with the hint of cinnamon very well and is in here for obvious reasons. Cap Toasted Almond I feel brings authenticity to the flavor profile and TFA Sucralose sweetens the recipe as a whole. This vape would pair very well with many holiday beverages such as egg nog, boiled custard & spiced rum, or a cider. I really hope you all enjoy this recipe, if so comment and rate it. Thanks!!!!",
