    "description": "Ginger Lemongrass Honey Tea for y'alls.\r\n\r\nSo I wanted to try recreate this \"health tea\" in vape form, and I think it's pretty spot on. Ginger and lemongrass are said to have many health benefits, feel free to read up on it and try it if you already haven't.\r\n\r\nFlavor notes:\r\n**FLV Eisai Tea** brings the green tea flavor, it's slightly fruity, earhty and dry which is a perfect base for this beverage.\r\n**FLV Ginger** is a relatively sweet ginger syrup, which is much needed here to get the balance right as some of the other flavors can be a bit dry.\r\n**FLV Lemon Grass** is slightly sharp but a spot on lemon grass flavor. The bitterness helps the tea get an even more authentic feeling and pairs beautifully with the ginger to give a very fresh and unique taste.\r\n**FLV Honey Bee** is known to have a floral note, but I think that gets completely buried here. It gives the tea a very very pleasant honey mothfeel and almost nectar type sweetness. Highly recommend this flavor if you need a honey for teas.\r\n\r\nThis can be shake and vaped, but a day or two will make it better.\r\n\r\nShout out to @nowar for all the support <3",
