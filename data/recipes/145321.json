    "description": "One of my favorite commercial juices is Stormy by Hometown Heroes. , a lime and cucumber soda.  It was the inspiration for this recipe.\r\n\r\nThe base is RF Soda Base, sweetened and cooled with Rick's  Sugar Daddy and WS-23.\r\nThe cucumber is not a dominate flavor, and it could be bumped up a little if desired.\r\nThe INW Cactus-Lime and FA Florida Key Lime are the main note, but it is not harsh, and can be vaped right away.\r\n\r\nI mixed this at 50\/50 to vape in my Digiflavor Siren 2 at high ohm 1.0 SS316, and it was exactly what I was looking for, although it is nothing like Stormy.",
