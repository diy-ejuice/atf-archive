  "name": "The Fall  Waits For No One (fried sweet pumpkin donuts) ",
  "description": "This mix is based on the Picarones ‚Äì Peruvian doughnuts, bunuelos, or beignets. It is a fried doughnut that is made from boiled pumpkin and sweet potato, mixed with flour and yeast and then fried. There is no egg or milk added. it is served with a sugar cane syrup of fruit and spices. \r\n\r\nYou get the sweet dough on the front  with the pumpkin and spice at the back end.  The buttter pecan  brings the two together     - really enjoyable fall vape \r\n\r\n**WF Picarones and OOO Vanilla Marshmallow** now I have never had a Picarones, but this flavor does seem to mimic what I think the actual desert would be like . You get a sweet dough in the front followed by the pumpkin and fried mouth feel along with a powdery type finish almost. I cant say I picked out any sweet potato here . The marshmallow is simply added for some volume and sweetness \r\n\r\n**FW Butter Pecan** was added for a bit of texture caramel and buttery mouth feel . While the authentic recipes does not call for any nuts I just could not pass up the opportunity here \r\n\r\n**VT golden syrup,  VT orange marmalade, FLV pumpkins spice** combine to create the dipping syrup that this is served with picarones.   VT golden syrup is pretty useful for creating the base here along with the slight sweet citrus note of the orange marmalade . The pumpkin spice is  ideal for the spice blend that is added to the syrup. \r\n\r\n**FLV Apple Cranberry** was added for some top notes here, it needed some brightness to contract the deeper sweet notes of this mix \r\n\r\n**NOTES and SUBS**    you can sub FLV milk and honey for the golden syrup for a deeper darker sweetness, the  cranberry apple is not needed but i  just like the  the slight bit of  brightness it provides ;  it is pretty sweet but if you want more  feel free to add  sweetner of choice \r\nave you tried this recipe?!\r\nPlease rate this recipe and comment below! I would LOVE to hear your experience.\"\t\t\t\t\r\n",

      "text": "WOW. Right off the bat, there's a sweet, juicy brightness that just shocks you into awareness (apple/cranberry), that's immediately followed by a fried, sugary pumpkin dough. Very tasty stuff. In the moments between inhale and exhale, you start to get this sweet syrup coating your throat just in time before pumpkin spice and vanilla bathe your tongue on the exhale, leaving a texture almost like your tongue is covered in powdered sugar, and If you can keep from hitting it again immediately(and you'll want to), swear to god, it's almost like there's little bits of orange marmalade nestled against the roof of your mouth. Caught myself licking at it, going \"what the?!?\". This one works absolutely all your taste buds save for salty, so it's a very engaging vape, and an absolute must try. Can easily be an adv, and is just a monster in all the right ways with that morning cuppa.&#xD;\n&#xD;\nBrilliant!"
