  "description": "**Coconut Honeysuckle Ice Cream**\r\n\r\nMIxers' Club January Entry \r\n\r\nThis months assignment was to broaden our horizons, chose a profile you have not previously done and develop a recipe. The only profile I haven't touched on, or at least made a concentrated effort towards was Florals. \r\n\r\nMy original idea was Coconut and Honeysuckle Rice.  I was excited by the prospect because it was an outside of the box recipe and rice was another profile I didn't get to mess with.  However, this fell flat on it's face. I just could not get it to work together the way I was intending too.  My original intention was a dry cooked rice, but FE Sweet Rice just can't do that on its own, it was leaving me with almost Coconut Rice Krispies in cream. I didn't have the flavors to get it to where it needed to be but if I was to revisit that concept, I think VT Rice Base or FLV Starch Base would be a solid step.  \r\n\r\nAt an earlier point in time I was chatting with @isuamadog and he told me about Macapuno Ice Cream. Something I have never heard of. Immediately after the rice fell flat on its face that was the first thing I had thought of.  Apothecary Elixirs (RIP) used to make a really damn good Coconut Honeysuckle Ice Cream and after closing up shop there is obviously no way to get it anymore so I decided to attempt my own version. While we were supposed to be outside of our comfort zone and Ice Cream is clearly my comfort zone it felt a little cheaty . However, I wanted to make coconut and honeysuckle happen.  And thus Midnight was born. \r\n\r\n\r\n**Flavor Notes:**\r\n\r\n**LB VIC + HS VIC + TFA VS -** The obvious. A super creamy slightly malty ice cream base. I was actually extremely surprised at how well the coconut paired up with the ice cream and brought this to a whole new level. \r\n\r\n**FLV Sweet Coconut and FA Coco'-** This is my go to Coconut blend right here. If I'm doing a coconut recipe it will involve these two flavors. I usually start off at a 2:1 ratio and adjust the individual percentages according to the recipe. The combo brings a nice bold coconut flavor with next to no \"sunscreen\" off note.\r\n\r\n**FLV Coconut-** Like most FLV stuff this one is a powerful flavor. Just a touch of this into the pairing of coconut brings a little bit of a coconut butter to add a bit of thickness to the coconut. \r\n \r\n**TFA Honeysuckle-** Brings a little juicy sweetness in with a subtle floral note to wrap up the mix. \r\n\r\n\r\nI've made a few minor adjustments to the recipe since the start. Playing with the coconut percentages as well as the honeysuckle. I have not yet, but I want to try and lower the Ice Cream Trinity to see how everything else plays with that. While I don't think lowering the ICT is exactly necessary as the mix is at a pretty good point where it is, I want to try that out just to see what happens.  I did try and add some WS23 into it to see how it is cold, and 2 drops to a 15ml absolutely ruined the mix. It mutes basically everything but a bit of Coconut and Cream so that's a no go.",

      "text": "Midnight&#xD;\n&#xD;\nI'm really enjoying this. It's very much coconut and honeysuckle forward, the vanilla ice cream business is really acting as a base much moreso than it is acting as its own fully defined element. It really is to the benefit of the recipe though, there's very little need for a more defined cream or vanilla note to make this work. I know you were taking aim at Apothecary's spin on this profile to an extent, and I honestly think you've bested it having tried that one back when it came to market. I rather enjoy what's happened here with all of the sweet and floral elements in a very nice harmony.&#xD;\n&#xD;\nFor a \"new beginning\" this is a more than commendable effort. Taking a little of what you are familiar with, the trinity ice cream, to allow you to build something wholly new is a brilliant starting block for this recipe, the 3 piece coconut mixture is in a nice balance to avoid dominating the mix outright but is potent enough to take center stage. The honeysuckle is really doing a very nice job cutting through the mix as well. I might like to see the creaminess of the whole recipe elevated just slightly, though I don't know quite how I'd accomplish such between adjusting the ice cream trio up by a small amount or adjusting the coconut trifecta to allow the sweet coconut's creaminess to push it a bit further. This is a really solid recipe. Thank you for sharing"

      "text": "This is better than Longing by a lot. The ice cream here is perfect &amp; coconut pairs beautifully with it. The honeysuckle adds a very light but present and very pleasant floral note that I think is necessary for it to not be tasty yet boring. Honeysuckle gives it something special right on top. Iâ€™d like to take this coconut ice cream and use it to create a whole series of floral coconut-vanilla ice creams.  Honeysuckle works so well, how about Hibiscus? Cherry Blossom? Violet? Rose? Lavender? Jasmine? Elderflower? Pretty much in that order, which I think would go from easiest to hardest . "

Definitely and ADV for me, simple but interesting enough to not get tired of. Very full body and mouthfeel. Good work!"
