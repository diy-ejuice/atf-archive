  "name": "Blueberry Custard",
  "description": "This is one of my favorite custard recipes I've been making for a while now. I've made a few changes and figured I'd put it out there. The FW Blueberry, FLV Blueberry Muffin, FA Blilberry, and INW raspberry combo make a very sweet, and almost realistic blueberry. I sometimes use FA Fuji in place of the INW Raspberry, but I like my blueberrys a little darker with a custard. Speaking of custard I use the good ol Cap V1 VC as my go to custard, along with TFA cheesecake graham crust to provide that depth. And of couse I had to add in the combo of FLV Cream and INW Shisha Vanilla, made famous from the recipe \"Longing\" to finish of the cream base. Being the custard fan I am, I could vape this and Coop34's Raspberry Custard forever and probably not get sick of it. Let sit for a good 7 days, as with any custard it gets better with time. Hope you all enjoy!",
