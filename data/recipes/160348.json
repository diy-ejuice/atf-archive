    "description": "After walking around a fair,I bought a bar of Nougat and thought I must make a mix that tasted like this,full of nuts and fruit and lovely and sweet.\r\nI bought both FA Torrone and INW Nougat but never tried the INW as the mix cam out well with the Torrone.\r\nIt's kind of an open recipe and nuts and fruit are your choice,I went with FW Hazelnut and FA Almond as I use these two a lot anyway and I only used Raspberry sweet as again like the torrone it seemed to work well without messing around anymore.\r\nI like to vape with RTA's at around 45 watts and this seemed to work well there with twin Clapton coils @ 0.20 in a Dead Rabbit RTA\r\nI also like to use all VG except whats in the flavorings,so as VG is sweet I felt no need and rarely use sweeteners.\r\nYou can shake and vape,but better after around 3-5 days",
