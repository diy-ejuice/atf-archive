  "description": "***FA Custard is FA Premium Custard\r\n\r\nUpdated- added 1% more Corn Bread, and added 1% Premium Custard for some texture/thicker vape. Creamy Cornbread Pudding. Inspired by Country Clouds Cornbread Pudding. Iâ€™ve over thought this recipe many times. I kept it as simple as possible and stuck to the profile with this. Definitely not a clone but it is darn tasty. ",
