    "description": "EDIT: Looks like FE Oatmeal N Milk might be discontinued. It was custom for Jungleflavors and they might not get anymore. I will update this if I learn more (or find a sub). Sorry, I didn\u2019t know when I posted the recipe. \r\n\r\n\r\nEmpty the packet, add water, microwave, splash of milk. That\u2019s what I\u2019m trying to recreate. \r\n\r\nFE Oatmeal N Milk\u2022 The core of the recipe, has the weird fine texture of oatmeal and some milk but leaves room to play. \r\nFLV Apple Filling\u2022 Apple and spice but also some thickness from the apple and a little texture\/dry from the spice. \r\nCAP Sweet Cream\u2022 Fills out the milk and adds a little sweet.\r\nTFA Sweetener\u2022 Because the real thing isn\u2019t too sweet and TFA is only sucralose at 5%. \r\nVT Butter Base\u2022 I think this is one of the keys to making this work. At .5% it doesn\u2019t stand out but adds some creaminess while suggesting salt that\u2019s in butter but is missing from the Oatmeal N Milk. Those little packets are full of salt so hopefully you think this works, too. \r\nCAP Double Apple\u2022 Gives a bit of a boost to the apple, without making it too juicy and spoiling the fun of recreating rehydrated dehydrated apples. \r\nFLV Caramel\u2022 For that brown sugar flavor.\r\nFA MTS Vape Wizard\u2022 (.02=1drop\/50ml) The idea is to thicken it up and blend it, just a touch. Take the edges off and make the dairy cooperate. You\u2019ll probably survive without this if it\u2019s all you\u2019re missing. \r\n\r\nI\u2019ve tried this a few different ways and this is what I\u2019ve settled on. I think it\u2019s pretty accurate but, like the packets it\u2019s based on, it\u2019s not a loud flavor. Too much Oatmeal N Milk gets weird but I didn\u2019t want to drown it, either. If you need it louder I\u2019d start by bumping up the sweetener and Double Apple because that won\u2019t mess with anything too much. The way I\u2019ve got it hits me like comfort food so I\u2019m done searching for perfection. ",
