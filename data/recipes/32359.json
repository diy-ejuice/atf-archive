  "name": "Crazberry Crack",
  "description": "\r\n\r\nThis was an idea I have to give [ID10-T](https://alltheflavors.com/users/ID10-T) credit for. Back in November, he mentioned his brother bringing a dessert to Christmas every year. Which consisted of raw cranberries covered in molten hot white chocolate and then cooled. This is appropriately called Cranberry Crack. Well, while ID10-T was busy mowing down some competition in the mixer contests, I was still salivating at the thought of this. So I decided to build a recipe around that concept. It was only after a couple versions that I realized that I wanted to take a little different approach.\r\nWhile I never have tried this Cranberry Crack, I knew raspberries and white chocolate are amazing together. So why not add them to the mix. I thought this was going to be pretty easy and straight forward. But quickly discovered that balancing the white chocolate with the fruits, would prove to be challenging.\r\n\r\n**FLV/FW White Chocolate** - *MF White Chocolate I still feel is one the best. But, for the life of me, couldn't get it to work in this. I probably could've made a dilution and maybe make it work, but I moved on. I'm not that big of a fan of TFA's offering, so knew that was out. That left me with the only other one I had, which was FW. I really like their version. It's creamy, buttery and has a nice little vanilla note to it. I originally had this at 3% and was going to be the only WC in this recipe. Then, with a big shout out to Brendon, in came a big box of flavors from Flavorah. Well, white chocolate was the first one I reached for. This did not disappoint. Very rich with a heavy cream. Not sure I was picking up as much vanilla as FW, but this was delicious. I had to have this under 1%, to keep it from bogging down the other flavors. I kept FW in this but just dialed it back a little.*\r\n\r\n**INW Shisha Vanilla** - *By far, one of the best and most versatile vanillas in my arsenal. This is pulling double duty here. It brings just a touch more vanilla and adds bit of creaminess to the white chocolate.*\r\n\r\n**FLV Cranberry/FA Pom** - *This got a little tricky. FLV's version is very much like OceanSpray Cranberry juice. Not as tart as you would expect for a cranberry. But, imo, is the best authentic (as apposed to candy-like) offering. Not one of their stronger flavors. I found I had to keep raising the % to hold up to the creams. My goal was to try to bend this into a regular cranberry, instead of a juice. TFA's version wasn't bad but just seemed like a unsweetened juice. CAP's Cranberry was just not that good. But FA Pomegranate had that tartness and has a thickness, I was looking for. It gave the cranberry a sort of cooked feel to it. I just needed to keep it low enough that none of those floral notes would shine through.*\r\n\r\n**FA Raspberry/INW Shisha Raspberry** - *While I knew I wanted FA all along, Shisha worked surprisingly well with it. I find FA to be one of the best. It's realistic but doesn't carry much tartness. Almost like a cooked raspberry with some sugar. Has some floral and maybe earthy undertones. INW Shisha almost has the same notes. With some earthiness and kind of floral accents, but in a completely different way (if that makes any sense at all). INW has a bit more of the tartness that you would expect from a raspberry.*\r\n\r\n**Steep Time :**  7- 10 days\r\n",

I have to point out that this has the best white chocolate flavor I've had in a mix. Anything I make that has white in it, this is now my go-to combo. Awesome job!!"

      "text": "UPDATE: This doesn't need anything changed to have a thicker, fuller mouthfeel. Revisiting it, I found it just needs a longer steep than the recommended 10 days. Have patience with this one and it will reward you for it. Previous review: I love this stuff! The cran/raz mixture is perfect, tart/sweet and for real feels more like berries than juice. They pop. That's a neat trick with the pom and if I had to guess, I think without it that I wouldn't be nearly as inclined to vape this all day. But it stays interesting enough to do just that. I'm so happy my kid brother's lazy but highly addictive contribution to holiday feasts inspired a juice worthy of having crack in the name.  I do wish it had a bit more of a thicker, fuller, more satisfying mouthfeel but only, ONLY!!!, if that could be achieved without messing up this cran/raz magic. "
