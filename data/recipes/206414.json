    "description": "My rendition of a Watermelon and Strawberry bubblegum- this time using all concentrates and not just FLV\r\n\r\nFLV Bubble gum: versatile and non-intrusive pink bubblegum that won't bully the watermelon and strawberry. it's slightly chalky and so we use this relatively low.\r\nFA Blenderize: This just fills out the bubblegum to create a fuller, fruitier backdrop to overlay the watermelon and strawberry with\r\nFLV Watermelon: Perfect balance of authentic and candied watermelon with watery undertones that will help combat some of the chalkiness in the bubblegum and give that mouth-watering experience\r\nOOO WatermelonBright, weet and canied this watermelon adds vibrant top notes to the FLV Watemelon and push this into candy territory\r\nMB Strawberry: this is a versatile an quite authentic but used at this level is wont knock the profile off the candy cart. it fills the spaces around the watermelon and bubblegum to weave the strawberry into the profile without shining too much light on it. the intention is to blend the watermelon and the strawberry - the need to compliment the profile and not fight each other for territory.\r\nCAP super Sweet - its a candy, thats how this works :)\r\nMalic Acid:: when we used flv sweetness we we dealing with some off flavours that may surface due to the use of stevia and erythritol contained therein and we used FLV Lemon to offset that. when we use Super Sweet we dont have to mitigate this anymore but without the lemon we lose definition, a very low amount of Malic bring back the sharpness we are looking for that we lose excluding the FLV Lemon. \r\n\r\n\r\n",
