  "description": "This is a Graham Cracker Cereal and Milk.\r\nFor the cereal/graham layer i went with a combination of FW graham cracker at 2% for a nice amount of body from the cracker and backed it up with CAP graham cracker for a little bit of the cinnamon cracker note and just to round out the \"graham\". With CAP Cereal 27 to bend it towards a cereal and some FLV toffee to add some nuance at .5% really helps the graham cracker out.\r\n\r\nI used a layer for the milk as suggested to me by Jennifer Winstead and since i trust her x1000 i used her suggestions for a good \"cereal milk\" and added my graham cereal layer to it.",
