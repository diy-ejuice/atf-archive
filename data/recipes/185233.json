  "description": "A while back someone asked me about my thoughts on cloning this. At the time I had not tried it though. This is two months later and I got my hand on some of it. I tried it and instantly knew that tfa honeydew and tfa watermelon candy were the crux of this one. I couldnt in good conscious not use the better ingredients we have available. So I guess this is technically a remix but either way enjoy. Sweetener is not optional here. Made a couple adjustments, lowered the big watermelon to 5% and upped the tfa hd2 to 3%.",
