  "description": "Great Shake and vape, the cream cheese icing comes thro in the beginning but settels down after steeping, and then the bread comes tho with a bite of cheese on exhale.\r\n\r\nCream Cheese Icing (LA): its light and adds sweetness to the recipe as a whole, it also adds depbt and a light cheese flavor, it gives it a custard feeling without adding vanilla to it.\r\n\r\nCream Cheese (RF): it gives a deeper cheese flavor with a heavyness soo used in small amount, as it can easily overpower a recipe.\r\n\r\nzeppola (FA): Brings out the toast more and seperates the bread from the cheese.\r\n\r\nBaked Bread (RF): The bread combined with pyrazine gives a toast flavor.\r\n\r\nAcetyl Pyrazine 5%: Adds a nutty flavor that brings out the toasty notes from the bread.",
