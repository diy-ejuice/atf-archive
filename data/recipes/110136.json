  "description": "the FM cinnamon is actually VapeWild Cinnamon but AlltheFlavors doesn't give you the ability to label your own so I had to randomly pick one...it pulls out the cinnamon a little in the recipe...this isn't spot on but it's pretty great..I will keep working on it but I went through 10 ml very quick..I know most people on here don't use vapewild so try to replace the cinnamon if you don't have it..",
