  "description": "This one started as a want for orange soda and I just kept pushing the lemon higher and higher to get some zip. I may rethink the lemon used to see if something else might work a little better. The fizz pop seems to add something nice to any fruit I have tried it with so far. The wife says it tastes like tang..so I might need to try to juice it up a bit. I made several soda recipes in the batch this came from, and this was the only one I wanted to play with more. \r\nAdd sweetener if desired ",
