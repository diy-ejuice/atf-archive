  "description": "A simple, fresh, cucumber yogourt recipe. Inspired from the famous Tzatziki. Its meant to be a summer vape.\r\nCap Cucumber is the best cucumber hands down. It might not be really authentic, but its the tastiest.\r\nFlv Spearmint is a very good mint, no gummy note, not peppery. It has that green/vegetable note that adds complexity. I like that.\r\nCap Creamy Yogurt is awesome, its really soft, not sour like a real fresh yogourt, it adds thickness and a great mouthfeel.\r\nGood as a SNV better after few days.",
