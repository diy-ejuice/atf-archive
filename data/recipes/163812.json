  "description": "I want to preface this by saying I have never been to Japan, and I have never had a Macha ice cream, so the probability of this being authentic is probably pretty low. It is however very yummy! What I could read about macha ice cream, it's supposed to be bitter due to the macha flavor, but as always with vaping, there is no \"ice cream\" flavor, so you kind of have to use a thick vanilla cream in order to make an \"ice cream\". The vanilla note you get here is probably more prominent than you need, but it's just so damn good.\r\n\r\nWhen I planned this recipe, I also made a few other versions with other ice cream bases, one was with LB Vanilla Ice Cream + TFA Vanilla Swirl, and one was with FW Vanilla Bean Ice Cream + TFA Vanilla Swirl. My thought going in to this was that FW VBIC was going to be the best one, as it's not as eggy and a little bit sweeter than the other versions I made. I was very wrong though, and I'm glad I made this final version, as it's by far the one that blends best with the floral macha notes.",
