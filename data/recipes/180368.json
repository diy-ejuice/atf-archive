  "description": "**Lemon Cream Puff**  Can it get better than this?  \r\nThe Health Cabin Egg roll provides the perfect texture for this Cream Puff. The Lemon Note is delicious. This is fluffy and airy, with a nice crisp edge. Beautifully sweetened with One on One Powdered Sugar.\r\nThis is a recipe I did back in May last year, but when **Wonder Flavors** released the new Lemon Custard, an awesome mixer, and someone who I call a friend, suggested I try adding the new **WF Lemon Custard**.  This person is **The Leader of The Band**, Luke Loop, @wadeyloops .  He is an inspiration and someone we should all try to aspire be like.  Everyone's friend, and finds the good in situations.  Thank you Luke for all you do.  \r\nhttps://youtu.be/qsocZrEcp0Y",

As soon as I got my hands on a missing ingredient I just had to mix this up. What a great surprise to even be mentioned in the notes. Tam's amazing prolific contribution to the DIY community is the reason I always spy on her recipes whenever I get a new concentrate. She is one of the first I look at to take note of how things are done well and this is no exception. This is not an in your face recipe, as per the photo and description it is a light, delicate and tasty as heck recipe which is vapable for extended periods of time. Just look at it, it is gold. Thanks so much for all you do."
