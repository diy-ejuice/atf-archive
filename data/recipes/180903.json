    "description": "This is a thick, creamy homemade style rice pudding with a touch of cinnamon. \r\n\r\nThe VT Rice Base adds to the depth of the flavour of the FE Sweet Rice as well as helping it not to fade nearly as badly (thanks to NordicFlavours for his appearance on Noted and that tip). \r\n\r\nCould probably sub the MB coconut for FLV Sweet Coconut- maybe at 0.5-0.75%? Although I haven\u2019t tried that myself yet. I was originally going to use FLV but I\u2019d just got the MB and wanted to play around with it as it\u2019s such a great coconut. It\u2019s not massively coconutty in this recipe, more like rice pudding that\u2019s been made with a little coconut milk. I was originally trying to make a tropical rice pudding so it\u2019s a hangover from that. I found it adds another layer to the cream and brings richness, so I left it in.\r\n\r\nI used JF Bavarian Cream as it has a really nice vanilla note. But it\u2019s not the thick, rich cream I wanted on it\u2019s own so I paired it with FLV Cream and TFA Vanilla Swirl. \r\n\r\nRich Cinnamon is by far my favourite cinnamon- I get a metallic taste from a lot of others. I\u2019ve made a 10% dilution of FLV Rich Cinnamon in a 10ml tester bottle so it\u2019s easier to add tiny % of it to a mix. \r\n\r\nI use 0.5% of CAP Super Sweet in most things, but do whatever you usually do with sweetener. I don\u2019t think it would be bad without it.\r\n \r\nThis is a SNV recipe, but let it sit for an hour or two before vaping. It\u2019s even better with an overnight steep. ",
