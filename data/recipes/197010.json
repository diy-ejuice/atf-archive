  "description": "I’ve been chasing that Biscoff Cookie Butter profile for a long time and I’m still so far off... BUT, I stumbled across a very good 321 that I thought I would share. This really comes together after 5 days or so and continues to get better. Let me know what you think and if you are chasing the cookie butter profile, let me know what’s been working for you... thanks!",
