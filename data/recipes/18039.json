  "description": "One of my favourite recipes. From sadpandavape on reddit/ELR\r\n\r\nRecipe breakdown:\r\n\r\nButterscotch ripple - This flavor is awesome. Light butterscotch flavor that feels like a mix of VBIC and Butterscotch regular. blends perfect in this recipe and gives it the fullness it needs.\r\n\r\nDouble Ry4 - Fantastic staple of tobacco flavors. At this % it gives the perfect hint of tobacco and the caramel aspect of double ry4 melds fantastic with the other creams.\r\n\r\nFuji Apple - Do I need to explain this gem of a flavor?\r\n\r\nVanilla Custard - Gives the missing vanilla twinge we felt it was missing. CAP Custard has this intangible fullness and vanilla/caramel punch that puts this recipe over the top.\r\n\r\nEthyl Maltol - Helps the Tobacco and apple not be too dry. Can be made without easily.\r\n\r\n\r\nhttp://e-liquid-recipes.com/recipe/690844/Apple-bacco%20%28Sad%20Panda%20Vape%29\r\n\r\nhttps://m.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/4n7ahw/recipe_dont_post_alot_decided_to_contribute_with/?ref=search_posts\r\n\r\n",

Some feedback now that I've finished a fair amount of it: I find the ripple too high for me. I'd keep it lower. Ripple can be funky to me and I think 2% is a much better level. I feel the fuji gets lost after a fade and maybe some more tobaccos that hold up to the heavier flavors."

Although I prefer vaping this fresh due to the Fuji being more upfront, it's still great after a steep. If you love Fuji I would bump it up to 2-2.5%. Will be trying this with some ACTUAL tobacco flavorings as I'm sure it would turn this recipe from awesome to stellar"

Not too creamy not too sweet and smooth as butter, this one really hits the spot for me. This is extremely well balanced as is but If I had too change anything I would boost the caramel notes slightly with a wee touch of caramel or brown sugar."
