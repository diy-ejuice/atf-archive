  "description": "I know, I know another cookies and cream recipe, but damn this shit is tasty. The sugar cookie, cookie, and biscuit create an amazing cookie base. The remaining ingredients create this fantastic vanilla, creamy, buttery almost frosting like texture that coats your mouth. If you like your cookie to have some cinnamon in it, add no more than a drop of Flavorah Rich Cinnamon per 30mL. I strictly make this recipe 60mL at a time and I only add one drop of rich cinnamon to that so if you can somehow get half a drop in a 30mL, go for it. If not, it will be just fine without the Rich Cinnamon. Steep time: after 1 week it's pretty much good to go. If you can let this sit for more than a week, you'll love it even more. Enjoy, Compadres!

Smells wonderful from the get go...its been steeping since then and I really like what it has turned into for sure.  If your a cookie vape lover you will love this...i recomend a three week steep personally..i drive a truck so i end up using a tank and at three weeks the flavors comes shinning thru.  Thanks John for sharing this recipe...it's now in my rotation!!!...BTW...I only gave four stars because i am reserving the 5 star for APPLE BUTTAH!!!"

If you happen to like cookie vapes this will be a new favorite. ADV 4sure!!! BTW I only aged this for 6 and 1/2 days and that's all I think it needs."
