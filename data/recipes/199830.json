  "description": "Trying to get a Almond Joy kind of feel even if I don't have an almond concentrate at the moment ü§ûü§û\r\n\r\nDay 1 steep: Wow!!! Holy hell! Just like thick chocolate and burnt sugar to the point that I thought I was vaping a gritty dank pipe tobacco! Seriously, unless you're after that sort of flavor don't do it LoL! Oof.....\r\n\r\nDay 4: So, after trying to power through what was in the RDA from the day 1 steep I realized that the horrible taste i was getting was from left over juice from a previous recipe. I tried a few times over the last couple days and it was still bad at first, but now with all the old liquid gone and a few days steep it's been pretty nice. If you're looking for a nice milk chocolate it's on point right now. I still want to see if that coconut comes out a bit more with subsequent steeping, but like I said it's good now üëç",
