  "description": "Been trying to get this recipe right since September, At first I tried making it waay to complex and it was not working out through a steep. Then I sat down and thought all this profile is really is a dry vanilla cake that is thick with some strawberry vanilla frosting...thats it!\r\n\r\n   Fa Pandoro= A thick vanilla cake that's is very in your face with a ton of mouthfeel and daap\r\n   Flv Frosting= A sweet vanilla frosting that normally has a slight throat hit but not n this recipe at all\r\n   Fa Red Touch= Freeze dried/ frozen strawberry that you would use in a fruit blended shake... my all time favorite btw\r\n   Inw shisha strawberry= I believe this flavor to be a somewhat authentic strawberry that sits on top of a watermelon base.\r\n\r\n     How does it vape?  On inhale you get the strawberry vanilla frosting But on exhale at first you get that thick rich cake and then the frosting. Leaving that strawberry vanilla frosting sugar lips that stays in your mouth. If you vape this in public don't be surprised if people around you know the exact profile your vaping... It's happened a few times already.  \r\n     This recipe was so difficult  to nail down and a steep time of 10-14 days is needed THIS IS NOT A SAV!!!  So make as much as you possibly can i'd say at lest 180-300 mls you will thank me in the long run. So... If you like cake pops from Starbucks this recipe is most certainly for you. Enjoy!",

This time i will wait a little longer, to see what happen, if the taste change in a good way.! But its really nice after 3 weeks. All flavours blends together well.&#xD;\nI get a little dry cake texture , but in a good way. Followed of a creamy, delish Strawberry frosting. The lemon from the pandorra is gone. The mix has the right amount of flavour, to be a Allday. Great work Thadentman!&#xD;\nUPDATE: Also after 5 weeks the flavours hold. All flavours are blends together even better. Harmonie between the Strawberry, cake and frosting!"

No lemon coming from FA Pandoro or cake notes but from what I was getting, I deeply enjoyed and vaped the all bottle in 2 days. About that cream confectioner note I was getting was truly beautiful! The texture and mouthfeel was so real. Don't know if it was your attempt on doing that but that's what I tasted and for that I must say thank you and thank you once again for sharing this."

You definitely made the most out of FA Pandoro while the frosting works sublimely with it. I might make it again without the FA Pandoro though; that lemon off-taste is too off-putting at times, even after steeping the mix for 2 months. "

Then I tasted after 2 weeks and it was ok but great. Then I picked the bottle back up last night after 19 days. The flavor was absolutely phenomenal. This flavor definetely needs a good steep. I mixed a 60 ml bottle and have vaped about 15 ml since last night great job. For those that like a nice delicate bakery recipe. This is for you. Just make sure to let it steep to get its yummy goodness. "

They both pair very nicely with the flv frosting to create this slightly tart, sweet, and artificial strawberry frosting that you'd imagine a cake pop having. However, while I do enjoy the Fa Pandoro in this and I think it works really well, I would personally add just a bit of CAP VCV1 for more thickness since I'm almost positive FA flavors are DAAP free. Overall, I think you did a wonderful job on this recipe and it sure is very tasty. Bravo!"

      "text": "I had a cake pop over the weekend this last week as the steep timer on this was coming due.. Then I vaped this and holy shit, this is a cake pop. The profile is basic and would seem simple but cake pops are not fresh yummy moist cake. They are made to sit for a week or two until sold. The cake texture while not dry is not overly moist. The icing is not thick and creamy it is more subdued and the flavorings are subtle. None of this is to say the treats are not delicious, they are, they just are not a slice of moist cake with thick creamy icing. Over all a 10/10 on accuracy and a delicious vape. I will be mixing this again, glad I mixed a 100mL for a tester :) I will say that the steep time is definitely needed. I did not drip this before the steep but I did taste it on the back of the hand everyday while steeping and the changes are noticeable. "
