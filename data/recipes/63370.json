  "description": "So I have been having nightmares for the last few months from the release of my Sicily Cheesecake from the Y U No meme dude. He decides to show up right at the last minute screaming Y U No... Y U No... running and  staring  at me violently with those beady eyes. Once he catchs up to me he stops, pauses and holds those crooked fingers to my face. As I look down on him in fear,  I ask what's up my little dude? He is in a frozen state as I jump out of bed from this nightmare screaming Y U No.... Y U no.....  Night after night he comes back terrifying me to no end. Then last night it finally came to pass I finally got to hear\r\nthe question that has been haunting me for months. Again as I look down on him in fear of what comes next with those beady eyes and crooked fingers he tilts his head up with a deformed smile, begins to say softly Y U No put  lime in the Cheese cake as he vanishes back into the darkness. \r\n\r\nThis tribute recipe was developed from my Sicily Cheesecake  that I had released a few months ago. Adapted from Wayne Walkers Cheesecake stones when its right its right dude.... Taking out the lemon and adding the FA Florida key lime puts a twist on this dilcious Cheesecake vape. For that matter you can experiment and add you own fruit or fruit stone to your liking. Enjoy!!!!\r\n\r\nVisit DIY MIXERS CREW on Discord https://discord.gg/kUJGkHt\r\nVisit DIY MIXERS CREW on FaceBook https://www.facebook.com/groups/456512471380574/\r\nWatch DIY MIXERS CREW LIVE on YouTube every Sunday at 4:30 pm EST https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC1ENB0bSNrG_1KETYwZ154g\r\nPlease comment, mix, and or rate,....it makes us all better mixers.",
