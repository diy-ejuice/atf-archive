  "name": "Killberry Yogurt remix",
  "description": "Adapted from MikeC's killberry yogurt:\r\n\r\nhttp://e-liquid-recipes.com/recipe/373457/Killberry%20Yogurt\r\n\r\nThis adaptation was done because I didnt have FA yogurt, and didnt like creamy yogurt, so I stuck with flv greek yogurt. After I had made this recipe several times I started to make some minor improvements, and tinkered with it a little bit. Swapped out cap sweet strawberry with JF and RF(SC), added erythritol, and added HS FVIC to accentuate the tpa VBIC. The flv greek yogurt might seem a little high but trust me, it works, and it doesnt bring any off/sour notes.\r\n\r\nI havnt tried the original, but this is my favourite recipe of all time and so I had to post it.\r\n\r\n- If you dont have RF SC strawberry just omit it. If you want it to be strawberry forward, instead of a mixed berry note, then up the RF SC strawberry 1%. One of the amazing things about this recipe though is that all the fruits mix together to make something altogether new, so too much strawberry can make it lose what makes it unique.\r\n\r\n- The original uses cap sweet strawberry (and you can too) but I started out using 3% JF strawberry and it was amazing so I didnt bother trying it with cap.\r\n- HS FVIC isnt essential, definitely try it without if you dont have it.\r\n\r\nHeres the original description:\r\n\r\nDIY'r mix. I have been trying for months to clone Kilo Kiberry Yogurt. I have come to the conclusion that some of the flavorings may not be available to consumers. I have tried different manufacturers FA,FW,CAP,FLV,TPA etc, to no avail. \r\n\r\nI have come to this recipe, which I believe beats Kilo Kiberry Yogurt, and believe me at 120 tries I gave up on Kilo Kiberry Clone. I did come up with this recipe and let me tell you, I believe it is WAY better than Kilo Kiberry Yogurt. This is a very sweet creamy yogurt that you have come to love with Kilo flavors.\r\n\r\nFlavor Profiles:\r\n\r\nYogurt (FA) and Creamy Yogurt (CAP) blend so wonderfully together, many people (including myself) do not like CAP creamy yogurt as a standalone, but with FA Yogurt mixed in, they are Amazing together.\r\n\r\nDairy Milk (TFA) - This really takes away any pungent taste to the yogurts and gives them a creamy milky smooth taste, this is a must for these Yogurts to play nice together.\r\n\r\nBilberry (FA) and Boysenberry (FLV) - These two flavors at low percentage (Bilberry a bit higher) gives such a nice sweet flavor, and with the Sweet Strawberry (CAP) following behind it, the flavors help each other so much, blending all the berry flavors just right.\r\n\r\nCotton Candy Circus (TPA) and Marshmallow (FA) - Cotton Candy Circus standalone tends to have a chemical taste with it, but with the marshmallow really brings out the sweet sugar flavor and removes that chemical after taste. With the berry notes, the flavor gives a sweet but mild tart flavor, and the yogurts blended with it give a candy creamy flavor. This is what Kilo kinda has in it, and this actually taste even better. Trust me!\r\n\r\nKiwi (FA) - The Kiwi just helps to kick the berrys up a notch, as you notice in Kilo Kiberry there is not much Kiwi, I believe it is in their flavor to help kick the tart flavour up a notch.\r\n\r\nVanilla Bean Ice Cream (TPA) and Butter Cream (CAP) -This was the hidden ingredient that helped to give a smooth creamy butter flavor not buttery, but creamy. This really tied a lot of the flavors together and helps to keep things smooth.\r\n\r\nEM (TFA) - This is just to mellow the flavors down, do not use more than 1%, this also is important because it keeps the after taste of the PG/VG from being a pasty type flavor in your mixes.\r\n\r\nGuys! I worked hard and bought tons of flavors to work out the Kilo Kibery, but I just could not get the exact flavour, but I ended up with this and it by FAR kicks Kilo Kiberry butt. I love this MORE than theirs. I wanted to share since I spent sooo much money on Kilo Kiberry and wanted something I could enjoy as much.\r\n\r\nPlease Make sure you let this steep a couple weeks. You can shake and vape and it is VERY good, but I promise it doesn't come close to as good as it gets after a week. ENJOY!",
