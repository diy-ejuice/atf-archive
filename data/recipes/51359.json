Sometimes I can SnV CAP Sugar Cookie, sometimes not.\r\n\r\nSo, recipe is pretty straight forward and does not need a ton of explanation. \r\n\r\nLB WCP Super good you should have it if you enjoy that profile, it is good.\r\nCAP Sugar Cookie, yeah, cookie\r\nJF Biscuit, wanted to crisp up the cookie without adding AP, this worked well for me.\r\nINW Shisha Vanilla, used for both the cookie and to prop up the white chocolate against the bakery.\r\nCAP SS, it's a cookie, put sugar in it. You can sub this, or leave this out. Your juice, your choice. The mix is not as good without it and I have no idea how TFA Sweetener will effect it with it's maltol.",

The peppermint/white chocolate is just an amazing flavor, and its sooooo good. The cookie base here just works to give a nice, simple, and tasty base for this to lay on. Let it set for a bit, and I fell in love. My wife loves it as well. Have already made her several batches, and she keeps asking for more. "

      "text": "Excellent stuff! Subtle delicious creamy peppermint with a pleasant texture to keep you going. I really enjoy the use of the butter, biscuit, and sugar cookie to make a well balanced cookie base for the peppermint to lay with. Great as S&amp;V But certainly does develop more over time -- the cookie comes out a bit more and the creaminess seems to get a little creamier. If you have the ingredients, definitely mix this up. &#xD;\n&#xD;\nThanks for the delicious mix and inspiration!"
