  "description": "Fuck a PMTA or Flavor Ban \r\n\r\nThis is a Mixed Berry Lemonade w/ Hibiscus, Inspiration drawn from the Starbucks drink  \r\n\r\nRevisiting some of my older recipes because I feel like I now have some flavors that would just work better and because I learned a great deal more from when I first started mixing which was around the time I made this recipe. Also Mainly because TPA Blackberry is a bitch to work with and get out of your tank & LA Lemonade with it fading.\r\n\r\nHope you Enjoy this summer drink Be safe & Vape on \r\n\r\nVT-Bilberry Ripe-(1%)-The minute I smelled this one I knew this was it!! I used this to boost the \"blueness\" in the recipe.\r\n\r\nFLV-Boysenberry-(1.5%)-This is doing the job as being my main blueberry (this was TPA Blackberry [0.15%] which is really potent and sticks to whatever you use it in)\r\n\r\nTPA-Hibiscus-(1.5%)-Big Shout out to Edible Malfunction for pointing me toward this hibiscus and away from FLV, compared to how the FLV was making this mix taste like i was eating the stem with everything this work a lot better but can be perfumery at high %(Not Saying the FLV  Hibiscus is bad but for this mix for me it just didn't work)\r\n\r\n\r\nFLV Lemonade-(2%)- As a replacement for the LA Lemonade [2.25%] I kept having fading issues with it ,this acts as my base \r\n\r\nFA-Lemon Zest-(0.5%)- helps accentuate the FLV Lemonade \r\n\r\nCAP-Hibiscus-(1%)-Serves dual functions as an accent to the TPA Hibiscus and an emulsifier to help everything blend.\r\n\r\nTPA-Strawberry Ripe-(1%)-helps make everything pop and bring some sweetness to the party.\r\n\r\nVT Yellow  Passion Fruit-(0.35%)- to give it more of a tropical body [I did experiment with FA Passion Fruit , VT Passion Fruit and FLV Passion fruit]  Felt like this one fit the best and works with the florality of the mix.\r\n\r\nThere is a original version of this recipe as well if you have tried it please do LMK what you think is better \r\n\r\nI used  1 drop cap super sweet per 30 ml you can add WS-23 to your liking hope you enjoy as much as I did working on it then finally getting it the way i wanted\r\n\r\nStarbucks Drink Inspiration- https://www.starbucks.com/menu/drinks/refreshers/very-berry-hibiscus-lemonade-starbucks-refreshers-beverage",
