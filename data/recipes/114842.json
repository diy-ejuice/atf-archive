  "description": "Imagine if you mixed Brandy, Triple Sec, Blackcurrant syrup and then threw in a splash of Bourbon for good measure. This is what it would taste like. Take a walk on the darker side of life and give this a try. This gives you a delicious stiff drink without that pesky hangover the next day.\r\n\r\nI used the Bergamot and Blood Orange to create a Triple Sec profile. It may not be exact but it was the ratio that I was happy with. If you do not like the taste of orange zest you may want to notch the Bergamot back a bit. The Dulce De Leche adds depth and sweetness to the fruits as well as mouth feel which is also why I added a splash of Sweet Cream. IMO a good hard liquor coats your mouth and lingers on the tongue. I am trying to recreate that texture. The Oak Wood is simply to add that \"top shelf\" cask aged taste to the Bourbon. If you do not have the Oak Wood you could get by without it but it really does pair well with the other flavors that I have used here.  This tastes best after 24 hours and its optimal window is 1-2 weeks.  After that the warm boozy notes tend to fade and the creamy caramels start to take over too much.  So if you want to let it steep try cutting the Sweet Cream and Dulce De Leche in half.\r\n\r\n**This does not really need extra sweetener but I did try it with some Sugar Daddy Vanilla at 0.4% and it worked nicely.
