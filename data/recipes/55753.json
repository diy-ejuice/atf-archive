  "description": "INW Gipsy King tastes a lot like I remember these cigars tasting like. Everything else is there to give it a bit more depth and make it feel like you're really smoking one. It's been probably close to 10 years since I've smoked one of these, so my memory may be a bit foggy on it. If you used to enjoy these and decide to mix it up for nostalgia, let me know how close it is!",
