Probably won't be my final version but this is worth posting here\r\nI was going for a blueberry funnel crumble \r\nI added lemon after I tasted it (without) just for the hell of adding lemon to it. Tunred out to really interact with the  blueberry very well \r\n\r\nCap funnel cake \r\nJust a good well balanced/rounded base at 4% imo\r\n\r\nInw bis \r\nI added this at 1% for the (crumble) \r\n\r\nFa cookie./tpa marsh\r\nThis her give us the the center of the cake/doe the part thats not crumbly  and overall gives the profile a good mouth feel \r\n \r\nTpa bbx just a good blueberry \r\nAnd 1%\r\nFa bilberry will help it stay in the mix\r\n\r\nFa lemon sis\r\nLike i said earlier I added the last minute.
