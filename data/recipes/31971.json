  "description": "Up in Vienna is a simple creamy coffee with Cinnamon accents. \r\nUp was an interesting coffee flavoring i liked from the beginning. \r\n\r\nI chose to layer some Booster on top of UP to give it a tad bit of a darker coffee feel.\r\n Also with the cereal grainy notes in UP i thought some Cinnamon Crunch by FLV would do well with Cinnamon and cereal. \r\n\r\nIf i had FA condensed milk or had an idea of what it tasted like i probably would have chosen it over Purilum condensed milk. \r\nI wanted to start off with a sweetened base so i layered with some PUR Condensed milk  and Vienna cream to add a rich, thick slight vanilla cream with some fresh cream to fill it out. \r\nPlease let me know what you think. i'm happy where it stands =)\r\nEnjoy!
