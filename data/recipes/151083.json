    "description": "**Jewish Apple Cake**\r\n  \r\n*DESCRIPTION:*\r\nA dense\/moist brown sugar cinnamon apple cake.\r\n  \r\n*NOTES:*\r\n  \r\nEven though I came from a Christian family, this cake is something my mother made at least once a month. Sadly, since my youth I haven't found a recipe that comes close to matching her expertise with this marvelous dessert. I was fortunate enough to not only have a mother who was a great cook, but also an expert baker!\r\n  \r\nFor my base, **RF COFFEE CAKE** was the obvious choice. This flavoring is not the most potent(probably because it is VG-based), so a high percentage was needed. Within this flavoring, you will taste cooked apple, cinnamon, and brown sugar \"crumblies\". It still needs help though, to become *full flavored*.\r\n  \r\n**FLV APPLE FILLING & FLV APPLE** filled out the cooked fruit\/cinnamon layer quite nicely here. I tried FLV Apple Pop before this combination but found it didn't quite do what I wanted it to do. This doesn't mean it would not be a perfect additive in any other baked apple dessert. I just found that it didn't quite work *here* as I wanted.\r\n \r\n**JF YELLOW CAKE & JF BISCUIT** complete the *cakey* base of this recipe. This is a very good combination at these percentages.\r\n\r\n  \r\nIf you want, you can crank up the **CAP SUPER SWEET** to about 0.5%. I can't stand this flavoring too high...which is why I kept it relatively low here. Too much sucralose smothers little nuances afaic.\r\n  \r\nOf course, this is a potent enough mix to be vaped fresh. But I prefer it from 5-7 days plus.\r\n  \r\n**STEEP: 5-7 DAYS**\r\n  \r\n**VG: 70%**\r\n  \r\n*Please don't use this recipe for commercial, as it was shared in good faith*\r\n",
