  "description": "So this Is one of those flavors where you just go hmmm this sounds good with this and this and lets try these percentages and it turns out really good. Any other revision just isn't as good. I Always mix Peach with White Peach i just really like the nice strong peach that it delivers. The two watermelons are pretty straight forward i added some of TFA's to get a bit more sweetness in the mix and have the watermelon show a bit through the peach. Lychee is a great addition here it adds a nice juicyness and has that almost sweet taste on the end of your tongue after a hit. Im sure you could add in many other flavors to make this better it could be used as a base. And i havent tried any other PG percentage other than the 8.5 the flavors come in. ",
