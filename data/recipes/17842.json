  "description": "[Heads up! This recipe is available as a flavor pack on Bull City Flavors!](http://www.bullcityflavors.com/grab-apple-by-the-melons-by-exclusive-girl-pick-choose/)\r\n\r\n**Grab apple by the Melons** aka **Melon Hi-Chew**  \r\n\r\nThis blend starts off as a refreshing realistic melon with a hint of mixed apples. As it steeps, both the Apples and the LA Watermelon come out more adding a mouth watering candy affect similar to eating a melon and apple hi-chew. This is a refreshing ADV that I can't stop coming back to. \r\n \r\n**Flavor/Development Notes:**\r\nMy initial goal was to create a realistic perfectly ripe melon salad with some chopped up apples mixed in. A flavor that felt juicy and refreshing with a touch of crispness from the apple blend. Well I over did it a little on the LA Watermelon and it candied it. I ended up liking it so much it turned into my ADV. It takes about 4 days steep for the LA Watermelon to really blend in and add that mouthwatering candy feel.\r\n\r\n**Sweet Watermelon (CAP) 2% / Wild Melon (FLV) 1%:**\r\nThe sweet watermelon felt lacking in fullness/roundness. Its almost like a watermelon that's just starting to pass its prime and needs to be eaten before the flies make a meal of it. Its still good, just on the sweeter side. Adding the wild melon rounded out the flavors nicely. Wild melon is a mixture of watermelon, cantaloupe, and honeydew melon. The combo of the melons in wild melon are very tasty and I recommend this flavor on its own or mixed with other melons.  \r\n\r\n**Watermelon (LA) 2%:**\r\nInitially was to just add a mouth watering affect. It did that successfully then candied it to the point that its more of a hi-chew (the more realistic version of a mamba for those who haven't had it before). I would drop it down to maybe 0.75% if I want to go back to achieving a realistic watermelon but I really like where the 2% took this.  \r\n\r\n**Anton Apple (INW) 0.75% / Fuji Apple (FA) 3%:**\r\nAnton Apple is more of a granny smith style apple; acidic, crisp, and my favorite type of apple. The Fuji Apple helps balance out the acidity by adding a refreshing sweet bite. It also helped bring the watermelon sweetness out of that too sweet zone and back to the sweetness I was looking for.  \r\n\r\n**Cactus (INW) 0.25%:**\r\nAdds the juicy, wet mouthfeel that that every watermelon flavor needs. Not much more to say about this since it doesn't affect the taste at such a low %.  ",

I can't really taste the cantaloupe, but that's just as well, really. Not truly a fan of that flavor by itself, so that it melds into the rest just speaks well as to how good this recipe is. &#xD;\n&#xD;\nAs it also tastes pretty bang on to the Hi-Chew candy, so points for accuracy. As this is a profile I hit up pretty much because it was on the Bull City Community packs, and I plan on vaping all of those, I wasn't surprised as to how good it is. I am surprised as to how much I like it. Very much ADV worthy.&#xD;\n&#xD;\nThis bad boy is for those who like watermelon and apple, simple profiles that are just cracking (and crack-like), fruit fans, and candy fans."

Watermelon and cantaloupe is mostly what I am getting from this but it's a very full and balanced vape with the apples lightening up and adding some flesh. Not a very complex vape but extreme flavor bending is what makes this so unique, It's difficult to put this recipe down and for a guy that vapes 1 or less fruit vape per month going through 7 in 2 months says a lot. Great job!"

I havent tried this as a shake and vape so I cannot speak to that, but using the 7day steep it was fabulous. Thanks for sharing, keep up the great work!"
