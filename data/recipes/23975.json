  "description": "I made a candle with these 3 flavors and it smelled so delicious, I had to put a quick recipe together. The butterscotch pudding is in the background for the first few days but starts to come out after about a week. It adds this creamy caramelization to the sugar cookies and strawberries. I havent tested it, but it may be better with some other strawberries, like JF strawberry sweet.\r\n\r\nUpdate: After about a month of steeping, its eerie how close this has started to smell like unicorn milk. It of course is missing the major cream notes in the flavor to taste close to unicorn, but the smell is definitely not far off. It's steeped into something I am really enjoying and isn't really something I can describe by comparing to a real food item. Best description I have right now is its smooth and creamy. The strawberry ripe has blended into the cookie and the pudding has added this lush creamy caramelization that rounds the whole thing out. I have officially run out of the 50ml I made on a whim and will be mixing up 120ml of this for further \"testing\"...\r\n\r\nUpdate 2: I have decided to share out this recipe cause its yummy and simple. It isn't perfect but it is a solid change up from the usual strawberry recipes out there. I hope you enjoy it!",

After steeping for week, it reminds me of those thick and soft Lofthouse Cookies piled high with icing, if you can imagine the icing infused with ripe strawberries instead of just being a big pile of sugar. A couple more weeks and it becomes something different but even tastier, something buttery rich, darkly sweet, and super-smooth. "
