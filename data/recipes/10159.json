As a person who has a hard time tasting strawberry, I quickly learned that this wasn't just another strawberry recipe. This is the best cheesecake base I've ever tried! Pound Cake, Pie Crust and Nut mix all do a glorious job of making an authentic rich, buttery crust. The 2 cheesecakes with the addition of the Catalan Cream and Bavarian Cream, makes this such a rich, creamy and smooth vape.  I was a little skeptical of the amount of flavors but everything is so well balanced. I really can't say enough about it. Love it! Great job Thadentman!"
