  "description": "Overdone profile? *Maybe.*\r\nImprovable profile? **Duh.**\r\n\r\nUpon returning from the treatment center I found this bottle that had been steeping for two weeks. Couldn't think of anything to improve upon it, Decided to share it. It's sweet, creamy and enjoyable.\r\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n**LB Vanilla Ice Cream:**\r\nA wonderful ice cream offering. No pepper notes present. May appear high but it's worth mentioning I've found that the ice cream flavor lacks presence at lower percentages.\r\n\r\n**INW Shisha Strawberry, TFA Strawberry Ripe:**\r\nThese two shoulder the bulk of the strawberry note.\r\n\r\n**FA Strawberry Red Touch:**\r\n\"Jams up\" the strawberries into a velvety jelly perfect for ice cream.\r\n\r\n**TFA Dragonfruit:**\r\nReally pushes that strawberry in there.\r\n\r\n**INW Shisha Vanilla:**\r\nA lovely vanilla offering that keeps the vanilla note from LB VIC from being too rudimentary.\r\n\r\n**FLV Cream:**\r\nProvides a little lift in terms of density to LB's VIC, but also emulsifies the vanilla's and rounds out the cream. Can substitute with FA Vienna Cream or FA Cream Fresh, although of course, it won't be the same effect.\r\n\r\n**TFA Sweetener**\r\nWell, obv's.",

Didnâ€™t notice any issues with fading which has always been my problem with SB Ripe. In a world full of SB&amp;creams this one quickly rose to the top of my list to mix again. Excellent job keep up the good work "

The combo of FLV Cream, Shisha Vanilla, and LB VIC is thick and velvety. The LB VIC is amazing stuff! I know it's an overdone profile, but IMO this is the best one I've had. I vape this everyday now. Thanks for sharing it Steam! "
