  "description": "I needed a break from all the dessert/bakery vapes so decided on a berry fruit salad. So after a quite a few versions I came up with this delicious berry vape that really tilts towards the purple side.\r\n\r\nThe Purple - INW Plum is a new concentrate for me and it is surprisingly great, It seems to get bullied by HS Blueberry so I really had to take down the blueberry. TFA Blackberry is my favourite blackberries and at this %, it adds just a touch of bitterness that works well here.\r\n\r\nThe Red - Somewhat hidden in the background are the tasty FA Juicy Strawberry & INW Raspberry. They seem to add a bit of brightness to the dark berries and gives it a bit more body with some subtle tasty accents.\r\n\r\nINW Pineapple is there just to add brightness and tame some of the bitterness from the Plum & Blackberry.\r\n\r\nFLV Milk & Honey is used to give a hint of cream while also sweetening the mix.\r\n\r\nVery good off the shake. Give it a mix and I'm sure you'll enjoy!",
