      "text": "I think I like TPA VB gelato a lot more than TPA VB ice cream. The ice cream is smooth and not overpowering at all which I love. The almond brings a sweetness I didn't expect, especially with the shisha vanilla, they complement each other really well. The thing that is not working for me in this juice is the pistachio. I don't know if it's because I love salty pistachios, although I do love pistachio ice cream, but this pistachio is too sweet, it lacks depth, and we fall back to an almond/nutty ice cream a lot more than a strong pistachio one. I will keep the ice cream base in mind, but I don't think pistachio shines here."
