  "description": "A delectable, rich and creamy creme brulee infused with fresh mango.\r\n\r\nThe 3-2-1 Creme Brulee has been my creamy custard stone for over a year now and it keeps on surprising me with its magnitude of uses. Here, I paired it with the 'in vogue' Mango by FE. This is nothing revolutionary, just the coming together of 2 things of beauty...\r\n\r\nFE Mango continues to impress & I keep finding new uses for it. Here, it sits  perfectly atop a luscious brulee, which allows it to shine by enhancing the inherent fruity creaminess of the mango. Feel free to drop the Creme Brulee to 1% for a less pronounced brulee  \r\n\r\nThis is good to ago after 3 days, best after 6. ",
