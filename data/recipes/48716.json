  "description": "So, in light of DiyOrDie Remix month, I figured I could release one that I came up with. This is the first tobacco that I really enjoyed. It got me started on my huge love for tobacco's, especially FLV tobaccos.\r\n\r\nI was given this by a shop owner and she enjoyed it as well, she wanted me to try and work with it and see if I could come up with something similar.\r\n\r\n\"Harking back to lush lowlands mellowed by the mists of the Appalachian mountains, Golden Tennessee delivers a taste of light air-cured burley tobacco, with sweet maple and deep oak notes.\"\r\n\r\nSo, I looked around and tried several burleys, including a canadian burley. I wanted to see if the maple in it worked. None of these came close to me, except INW. I wanted FLV, but after a few months I realized it just wasn't it. Oak wood was a pretty easy one to go with. The oak blends with the tobacco very well, gives a great oak taste. Maple was a little tougher. I went through a few maples, and when I opened FA Maple Syrup, i knew it was the right one. I played around with mixing it and this is where I came. The maple seems high, but it falls into a bottom note after steep. The smell of the mix, when you open the bottle, and the vapor after pull is heavier maple aroma. The taste is a smooth burley, with a maple undertone, and oak. This is a very simple recipe to me, but I enjoy this and figured I would throw it out there for others.",

This is a good simple tobacco that brings me back to some of the retro tobacco juices that got me hooked on vaping years ago "
