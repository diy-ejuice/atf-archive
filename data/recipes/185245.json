  "description": "I watch noted the other day @Alfredpudding mentioned that VTA Boysenberry was a straight on blue raspberry i had to try it out and F*ck man that was the missing link. \r\n\r\nLb Blue Raspberry is great but feels  thin even at 8% but by adding 1.5-3% VTA Boysenberry you add more syrup without adding more water. \r\nWf Sour blue raspberry candy adds more blue raspberry flavour with candy texture while its a bit darker than LB's  its really good.\r\n1% Flv Berry blend is mainly to reinforce that berry background.\r\n\r\nAdd sweetener as desired i think it does better with 0.5% SS and 1% sweet candy, but it also goes really well with 0.75% Ss and no Sweet candy.\r\n\r\nWs-23 is optional i usually use it on my fruity mixes.",
