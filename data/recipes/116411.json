  "description": "No profile hunt here just a bunch of flavors that i felt belong together. They all compliment each other beautifully. Mix this one up and thank me later. Just so its known in no way would i consider this a tobacco recipe.  Its more of a buttery  dark creamy goodness. Whatever it is i can't put it down. I love it so maybe just maybe you will too. I am willing to bet this will become absolutely amazing with a long steep but as is i love it after a 2 day steep but i feel after 5 days its definitely better. Enjoy!\r\n\r\n\r\nSweetener: I used .50% flavor west sweetener but feel free to use more or less of your sweetener of choice.",
