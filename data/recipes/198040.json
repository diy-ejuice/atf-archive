This is currently my favorite ADV and am very pleased with how it came out,  hope you all like it as much as I do!\r\n\r\nNote: Increased wf banana custard to 2% and added a 2nd strawberry allowing this to be a Strawberry blind friendly recipe.",

I get a vanilla and banana malted shake instead of fresh banana in vanilla ice cream which is what we wanted. I pick up the tartness from the strawberries which I\u2019m not upset about. I like this being banana and vanilla forward with the tart on the end. This one is strawberry blind friendly."
