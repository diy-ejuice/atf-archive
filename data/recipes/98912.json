    "description": "i mixed the vt banana and sour lemon with the green apple and noticed that the vt banana has some custard notes to it and when mixed with the sour lemon they really came out when i mixed this and tasted it it reminded me of yogurt. I guess yogurt is a sour cream. i would love it if some more mixers made this and and gave me their opinion. Does it taste like yogurt to you?",
