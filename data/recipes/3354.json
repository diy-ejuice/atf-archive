Sweet but not overly so, good level of pistachio, sugar cookie not that apparent but does it's background thing.  Very, very ADV'able.  Only needs a five day or so steep for me - I don't see much improvement from five days to two weeks, bottles are never around long enough to have been tasted at three weeks though!"

I have also mixed the original version (recipe on e-liquid-recipes), and this one is far better.  If you want a good Pistachio-tobacco recipe with slightly more of a tobacco element, I also highly recommend Pistachio Brûlée by TheJuiceFairy on ELR.   You can also use FA Soho instead of RY4 Double in this recipe nicely, but it will be a little different and leafy.  Start at 5% and increase  by 1% increments until you love it.  IMO this profile, Pistachio-Caramel-Tobacco, is a classic for e-juice, much like strawberries &amp; cream. "

It REALLY needs the long 2-3 week steep to become what it is. Delicious darker flavor.  I haven't had Charlie Nobles juice you used as inspiration but I don't care, this flavor is so good.  If you haven't tried this, definitely give it a mix and let it steep...especially since autumn is coming. Great for that season."
