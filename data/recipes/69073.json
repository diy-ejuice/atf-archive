It's not one of those juices you wanna hit every once in awhile, you'll knock your mother over reaching for this stuff.  Had to buy red licorice and sour apple, it's worth getting to mix this up folks. 6 star. Thanks for sharing! "

      "text": "This is super addictive, but imo the sour apple takes over a bit at 1% and turns it into something else.  Something really good, but I mixed this twice, one with the apple at just 0.5% and one at 1% and the half a percent made a big difference in how much twizzler/red vines I was getting compared to the strong sour note.  This is a keeper though, I'll be mixing this often "

If strawberry Twizzlers is your candy Achilles heel and you've ever wished you could have it in a vape and not have to take the calories and sugar of eating the things, you need to try this. I can't imagine better recipe for that profile ever existing. Just perfect."
