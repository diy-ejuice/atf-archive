  "description": "This is part 1 of a 3 part recipe dump regarding the main flavor Cap Golden Pineapple. I will post the other two over the next few days and link them all together as I go.\r\nPART 2: Stupid Simple Pineapple Cookie https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/139363#stupid_simple_pineapple_cookie_pineapple_dump_2_3_by_rockyharlow\r\nAh shit this recipe has more than three flavors, it's probably trash.\r\nPART 3: Stupid Simple Pineapple Ice Cream https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/140190#stupid_simple_pineapple_ice_cream_pineapple_dump_3_3_by_rockyharlow\r\n\r\nWe stray away from our usual cheesecake base here, instead creating one from the ground up. It suffices for plug and play with many other fruits as well, and I often throw in FW Butter Pecan at 6% in place of the Pineapple to make a pecan pie cheesecake hybrid abomination. \r\n\r\nOur cheesecake tone is set with a ubiquitous 4% CAP New York Cheesecake. I say ubiquitous as most of my cheesecake needs are generally met with this 4% of NYC. At this level we get a saturated, velvety layer of thick cheesecake filling. To keep this recipe simple, we don't really need anything else to support this layer.\r\n \r\nWe develop our graham cracker crust simply, yet effectively with 3% FW Graham Cracker. This stuff is so delicious and easily one of my most reached for bottles when mixing a dessert. In my humble opinion it shits on TPA Graham Cracker Clear in a way that I can't even begin to express with words. \r\n\r\nIt can't be a pineapple cheesecake without the pineapple aspect, so we chop up some fresh chunks of CAP Golden Pineapple. Adding 5% is sufficient to satisfy the chunked pineapple vibe without getting too overpowering. We want it strong but not coil nuking levels of citrus. If you do notice the pineapple to be a bit overpowering, try knocking it down to 3.5%, maybe 4%, but no lower or I noticed that it really tends to get lost despite being a fairly potent flavor.\r\n\r\nThe final addition to the mix is FA Meringue at 2%. I am absolutely biased in saying so, but 2% FA Meringue is a welcome addition to nearly any bakery or dessert for me. Here it serves to connect the graham cracker crust to the layer of cheesecake. Without it, the layers tend to stack instead of blend like we want. \r\n\r\nPersonally, I would skip the sweetener here, as nearly every one of these flavors serve to sweeten on their own accord. The addition of sweetener only serves to muddle, or gray out, the whole recipe.\r\n\r\nAs cheesecakes tend to go, give this one a nice shake and forget it for an absolute minimum of three business days. The mix would prefer to have you wait a full week to bust into it's deliciousness, but it will forgive you if you cave a little earlier than anticipated.",
