    "description": "Ok, before you flip the fuck out, I\u2019m not that guy who uses 10%+ of any flavoring. The new flavors from nicotine river are kinda fantastic, but you really need to start around 7-8% and work your way up. \r\n\r\nThe blackberry from NR is really really good, but it needs some definition. It\u2019s all body with very little top note. It\u2019s also not sweet. \r\n\r\nA touch of hangsen blueberry, tpa grape juice and inw blackcurrant do the work in filling out the high notes while super sweet serves to brighten the whole mix up. It may look like a lot going on here, but it\u2019s very cohesive and purposeful. \r\n\r\nI add some 30% ws-23 from bull city to give it a nice cool exhale, but that\u2019s on you. ",
