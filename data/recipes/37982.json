  "description": "This is a moist maccoorn cookie with a slight hint of chocolate. This is my first attempt at making this. Flavor off the bat is good. I will let it steep a week to see how this recipe develops. What i am expecting is the sugar cookie to give off that nice cookie taste. The cookies and cream and a nice balance to the cookie to give it some cream with slight notes of chocolate. The Vanilla cupcake is there to give that nice moistness needed to make that it a true macaroon flavor. I added the Shisha Vanilla as it adds the vanilla that you would find in a macaroon cookie and at 1% it does not overpower the recipe but adds a great vanilla flavor with some nice sweetness. The meringue gives it just enough of the eggy flavor you need to have in a cookie. Many Macoroons have a Almond element to them so I used .5% of RF Almond, this was mainly to taste this Almond flavor against its competition. The Paradiso is the star of the show to add that slight coconut flavor of the cookie without being to overpowering on the coconut. The biscuit is thier to give the nuttiness or crunch to the cookie, I thought about using toasted marshmallow in its place, but after a steep will see how these flavors blend together. For now as a Shake and Vape it's not bad. Taste really good but the cookie is not there yet it needs at least three days to stand out and do it job in the recipe. I will update once this recipe has steeped. ",
