    "description": "Was thinking about what would be a delicious Summer time vape , and as all of you who know me i love Blueberries, So i went to testing tried Mb Blueberry  but it was missing a little something,, so i tried the WF BB Smoothie as i had not used it in a recipe yet , and i have to say it was pretty tasty... so everything else is pretty basic as far as an IC base....nothing real special other than i used MB Milkshake due to its homemade ice creamy undertones, and Ooo CMU to smooth out the rest , and as an xtra tacked on some TFA VS.... as for the coolness i still haven't tried the WS 23 so i was stuck with koolada so i used it at a very low % to give it some cold..... as for the NDY lol (Not Dead Yet ) I am Not Dead yet ,, had to step back and get myself together,,, missed the community ...hope yall Enjoy this ",
