  "description": "This is a remix of my grapple recipe. Grapple was the recipe I submitted for round one  of diy or dies round one of the world mixing championship. All I changed in this remix is the apple used. In the original I used 3% Fuji apple by flavor art and in this version I used sour apple by flavorah which makes it a sour grapple lol. This is totally vapable after a shake but I find it best after an overnight steep it calms down quite a bit and has enough time to blend perfectly in about 12 hours. Enjoy this sour grapple!!!!\r\n",

I thought about changing my cotton, but was too lazy and took another hit, and then another and another.. every hit I fell a little more in love with the way that cactus that seemed overbearing at first, blended into the grape pairing perfectly for a splendid sour grapple delight! I couldn't believe how smooth this became, it was almost like drinking a sour grape pop without the fizz, thanks for the great recipe!"
