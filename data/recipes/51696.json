    "description": "When will we all get tired of strawberry and cream? Or better yet when will someone make the ultimate strawberry and cream? The answer to both questions is probably never! But it's fun to keep playing with such an easy going and delicious flavor profile. Both strawberries and the dragonfruit deliver a bright, rich strawberry that leave even the ones who can't taste strawberry wanting more. Flv Cream and FA meringue make a thick delicious cream and the cheesecake graham crust is here to lend a helping hand by blending in all the lines for one delicious strawberry and cream.
