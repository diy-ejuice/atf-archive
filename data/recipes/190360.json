    "description": "Really tasty recipe with some unusual flavors, all Inawera!\r\n\r\nDoing a recipe with aloe flavoring was on my bucket list for quite a long time since I've tasted some great commercial ones including it on a vaping expo. The only problem: It's really hard to find in my vicinity. So I bit the bullet and made an order directly from Inawera after finding out they have it. The next question I had to answer: What flavors does one combine with aloe? This is what I came up with, and I'm really excited to share this fine recipe with you all! I'm pretty much stunned how well it all fits together and I really advise you to try it if you can get your hands on all the ingredients.\r\n\r\nINW Aloe: The main ingredient, obviously. 4.5% is an ideal fit here, has a lot of presence but does not drone out the other flavors.\r\n\r\nINW Prickly Pear: Just a perfect companion flavor for the aloe. It's like these two were made for another. 3% is enough to get the flavor across, I would not increase it.\r\n\r\nINW Pitaya: Can easily be subbed with CAP Dragon Fruit or TPA Dragon Fruit, but I was curious how Inawera's offering fairs against these two, and, just in my humble opinion, I think it's superior to both.\r\n\r\nINW Cactus: It's a well known fact that a little bit of this can give most fruit recipes that special something, but in this mix it's also a nice boost to the taste of the Prickly Pear.\r\n\r\nI like to add 1% WS-23 (10% dilution in PG). You can decrease the amount or leave it out completely, you call.\r\n\r\nThis can be SNV, but the WS-23 fully kicks in after a 3 day steep.\r\n\r\nIt was a lot of fun coming up with this recipe. Hope you enjoy and have a nice vape!",
