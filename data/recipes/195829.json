  "description": "I wouldn't really call this a \"recipe\" just figure I would share this because of how simple it is. The rainbow berry candy from one on one flavors smelled almost identical to it, and mixing it at 10% yields something extremely close to Nerd Alert. I personally think it is a little better because it doesn't have that slight \"waxy\" mouth feel texture to it.\r\n\r\nIf you are unfamiliar with this eliquid, it is supposed to taste like nerds candy, I personally don't get that from it. I get more of a tropical starburst candy from it. So if you are into this type of flavor profile you will enjoy this super simple mix.",
