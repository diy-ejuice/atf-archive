  "description": "Finally got around to mixing some TFA Peanut Butter up. First impressions was it tasted like the peanut butter in a nutty bar. From my mixing experience I knew INW Biscuit would work well for the wafer. I also like the way INW Milk Chocolate and FW Hazelnut work together. It might need minor tweaking, but after 3 days steep I think it really close. Any feed back is more than welcome.\r\n\r\nFULL DISCLOSURE. This is an old bottle of INW Milk Chocolate. It may or may not be the old formula. I ordered it in late Nov early Dec 2016. So substituting INW Milk Chocolate for something else might be in order. I know wayne subbed it out for JF Milk Chocolate in his recipes.",
