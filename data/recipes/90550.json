  "description": "[ChrisDVR](https://alltheflavors.com/users/Chrisdvr1) told me this would get more views if I used a nice pair of boobies for the picture. \r\n\r\n*It's a Bourbon-flavored cigar, of sorts.*\r\n\r\nThis started out as an attempt at a bourbon-flavored cigar for /r/MixersClub. It's still a bourbon-flavored cigar, but at some point it became more about celebrating the pairing of the two Kentucky concentrates than about producing an authentic cigar. **TFA Kentucky Bourbon** is a bit boozy, yet sweet, with that unique corny sweetness of sour mash whiskey. **FLV Kentucky Blend** is a bright yet ashy, slightly spicy tobacco. They make beautiful bluegrass music together. \r\n\r\n**FLV Bourbon** supports the TFA version with richness and an authentic charred oak barrel flavor, which the tobaccos also enjoy. **FLV Red Burley** fills out the Kentucky Blend and makes it richer, darker, and more satisfying. **FW Salted Caramel** enhances both the tobaccos and bourbons and builds a dark, sweet but not too sweet bridge between them.  **FA Cuban Supreme** isn't necessary for a satisfying bourbon-bacco vape, but without it, the result is rather soggy. A touch of it here wraps all this up in a somewhat green but dry cigar wrapper and brings it back within the realm of a bourbon-flavored cigar.\r\n\r\n**Steep Time** is truly just a best after recommendation, not a requirement here. This is great at 3 days, just enough time for the bourbon to relax a little and everything to come together. A few days longer, and the tobaccos will fade a bit. This is a good time to vape it if you want more of a sweet bourbon vape with just a little tobacco kick. But at two weeks, they're back and everything works together as intended.  ",
