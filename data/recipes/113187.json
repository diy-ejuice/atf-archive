  "description": "**Profile - Juicy and authentic watermelon mixed with a combination of red berries**\r\n\r\n\r\n**FLV Watermelon / FLV Wild Melon** - I find FLW Watermelon a very forgiving flavour. It can be used at low percentages as an additive role or as the main role. At 4%, stays right at the front note without messing the overall balance of the profile. It's the only watermelon I enjoy because it's authentic, juicy and doesn't fade so much especially at this percentage. Next, FLV Wild Melon to give a little more body to the Watermelon itself.\r\n\r\n**TPA Dragonfruit / TPA Honeydew** - Both flavours make this profile even juicier and TPA Dragonfruit helps a lot here creating a bond between the watermelon and the berries.\r\n\r\n**FA Forest Mix / CAP Harvest Berry** - Both percentages for my taste are just enough to be present in this profile. If I go higher, I start to get plastic off-notes especially with CAP Harvest Berry. Combined, the blackcurrant and the raspberry are present while the blueberry and the strawberry note stays right at the back being slightly present aswell.\r\n\r\n**CAP Super Sweet** - Optional here but in this case, creates a more full mouthfeel.",
