  "description": "Week 5\r\n\r\nFlavor Pro Challenge:\r\n\r\nAll I could see in this weeks picture was Delicious soft whipped cream, so this is a whipped cream recipe.\r\n\r\nWhipped cream is... the whipped cream.\r\n\r\nCream cheese icing gives some depth to the cream.\r\n\r\nSweet coconut adds creamynezz and a slight accent of sweet coconut to the cream\r\nWhich make this recipe not that boring to vape üôÑüòÅ\r\n\r\nButter Adds some needed grease, that i get when eating whipped cream out of a bowl. The fat that coads your mouth and lips üòã\r\n\r\nThis is probably not a all day vape, but could be used as a whipped cream base.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
