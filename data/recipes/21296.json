Was really hard to find a nice light &amp; fruity recipe that used rhubarb, everyone always says how hard it is to work with and yet, here, its seems philosaphucker has made light work out of it, making it seem so effortless to work with.  I love it when mixers can do that with a flavor!  Tested this after the recommended 3 days &amp; then again after 3 months since I stashed it away and forgot about it &amp; is bright &amp; enjoyable still."

INW shisha is the only strawberry I can reliably taste but unfortunately I usually get some plastic tasting off flavours from it, but I am happy to say I can detect none in this recipe."

I personally don't get a lot of strawberry, but it does a good job adding sweetness and backing up the raspberry.  If you like INW Rhubarb, mix this."
