  "description": "Shisha tobacco is complex by itself.Combined with miss cream adds sweetness and a slight chocolate taste to the mix,since both of them seem to contain a little chocolate.miss cream also adds a mild caramel and vanilla taste.Tobacco syphony is used mostly because it is a nutty tobacco,but not salty,i would say it is more on the sweet nuttiness side.Cigar absolute makes the mix drier and also adds the necessary ash note",
