  "description": "I was just playing around with my new FLV mango flavor... I'm absolutely in love... I haven't ever mixed a 120ml for myself until now....\r\n\r\nI don't think that the FA Papaya is necessary here, but I haven't tried this without it.\r\n\r\nI mix it for myself with .8% Super Sweet, but most people think that's crazy.. Please sweeten to your liking. ",
