  "description": "A clone of one of my favorite vendor juices from before my DIY days. From the long defunct Cloud Pusher Labs comes Lateralus. This was a very straightforward papaya, orange, menthol mix. I went with one of my preferred Orange combos here, FW Blood Orange and CAP Sweet Tangerine. There's not much I can explain in detail about this one, its a simple, yet refreshing mix.\r\n\r\nThere's an easter egg in the recipe, try and find it!",
