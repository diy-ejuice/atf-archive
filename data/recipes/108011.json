  "description": "*A Bourbon-infused Peanut Butter*\r\n\r\n**Inspiration** for this recipe came from two places. First, reading a news article about the EU striking back against the Trump Trade War with targeted tariffs on US peanut butter and Bourbon (as well as OJ and motorcycles). It was already a work in progress that had sort of been back-burnered but got a second wind when I watched Wayne Walker try to turn his [Blackout recipe](http://diyordievaping.com/2015/08/18/blackout/) into a [milkshake](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2ek90szkJA&t=4816s). You can see the influence of Blackout on this final version, with the **TFA Bavarian Cream and FW Hazelnut** used to support the Peanut Butter. Blackout also used FA Caramel and TFA Brown Sugar, and here you see them consolidated in one concentrate, **FLV Caramel.** This stuff ties the recipe together in a way that other ingredients in previous attempts didn't. One thing both Bourbon and peanut butter flavors have in common is that they pair exceptionally well with caramel and brown sugar-type flavorings. \r\n\r\n**TFA DX Peanut Butter.** You might be wondering about the DX Peanut Butter. Sure, you could sub TFA Peanut Butter. But here is why you shouldn't: It's fucking better. Like, every PB recipe ever made with TFA Peanut Butter should probably be reformulated to be made with the DX version instead. That much better. Apparently others have come before her and I should have paid attention to them, but the DX version wasn't on my radar until @RinVapes used it in her [Cereal Bar](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/104018#cereal_bar_by_rinvapes) recipe and talked about it on [Mixin Vixens](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PMlxG81YszI). Had Rin lost her mind? TFA DX flavors are disgusting. They've taken out the delicious diketones and replaced them with vomit flavor! The couple of DX flavors I'd tried in past made me dry heave. But my curiosity was sparked so I checked TFA's [spec sheets](https://shop.perfumersapprentice.com/specsheetlist.aspx) and guess what? There's no barfy butyric acid in TFA DX Peanut Butter, just pyraziny goodness and some vanillin. So naturally, I had to try this. WOW! TFA Peanut Butter, you're dead to me. It's like comparing past-the-sell-by-date dollar store peanut butter to Smucker's Natural. Still seems to have some of the problems of TFA Peanut Butter (weak, dries out and gets muddy with a steep, probably needs a good shake before using because it separates but that's good practice anyway) but the flavor and authenticity is top notch in my opinion, far batter than any other PB flavor I've tried and there have been a lot of them.  \r\n\r\n**Sweetener:** Always optional, and you might want to add some. I've left it out because I think FLV Caramel adds a plenty of sweetness to this and gives it a lingering, brown sugary finish. \r\n\r\n**Steeping:** Overnight, and while I've not tried this exact recipe with long steep, earlier versions suggest that I probably don't want to. PB just doesn't seem to be built for long steeping. \r\n\r\n**You're crazy, PB and Bourbon don't go together.** Yes, they do. Peanut Butter Infused Bourbon is a very real and beautiful thing and [you can make it yourself at home if you don't believe me](https://www.saveur.com/peanut-butter-bourbon-cocktail-recipe). Now, this is not that, this is Bourbon-infused peanut butter, simply because that's what I wanted to vape. But, if you wanted to make a peanut butter infused Bourbon vape I think that would be easy enough using this recipe as a starting place but turning the PB down by half, roughly doubling the bourbon flavors, and probably adding some VT Bourbon for more of a boozy bite (TFA, FLV, and VT are the Holy Trinity of bourbon flavors - one for sweetness, one for charred oak, and one to booze it up). \r\n",

I've tried TFA regular, FLV, and LA's PB and they were all decent in their own way, but I think TFA's Dx Peanut Butter might be my new favorite. If you're into slightly boozy vapes this is definitely worth a try."

This is the first PB vape I could actually taste (beyond Apothecary's Elixir 08) and it's fantastic. Creamy, sweet, with a slight graininess to remind you its peanut butter. That bourbon note was a nice touch and adds a neat nuance to the flavor and some enjoyable warmth. Still not a huge fan of PBs overall, but I've had this loaded up in my billow for the past week and keep coming back to it. Nice job!"
