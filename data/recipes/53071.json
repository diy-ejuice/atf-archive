  "description": "These three flavors play beautifully together to create a delicately complex, incredibly refreshing shake & vape.\r\n\r\nInhale is juicy, full and sweet, exhale is like spinning a color wheel until it all blurs into some pleasing, blue-green, undiscovered hue.\r\n\r\nA little grapefruit zing, some voluptuous lychee sweetness, something vaguely papaya-'nana, whipped up in a blender with a light touch of coconut milk and garnished with an island flower. \r\n\r\nFeel free to add a bit of WS-23 to taste for a frosty summer refresher. Enjoy!\r\n\r\nMixed this up last August and realized I forgot to post it here when I went to re-mix it.",

      "text": "Wow, I have a hard time describing this. It's fantastic. Usually INW Cactus will be a bully, esp at 1%, but here it just blends in perfectly with the sweetness of the guanabana and zesty citrusy notes from pink guava to end up in a very fresh summertime vape. I tried it without any coolant, but I'll definitley be mixing more of this, feels like a given in this kind of mix. Well done!"

      "text": "It took me way too long to get around to mixing this up. I love the way these ingredients work together, the mouthwatering citrusy pink guava and cactus with that weird but wonderful sort of tart strawberry-pineapple from the Guanabana on top and then the rich, creamy, funky banana-coconut base of the Guanabana with added depth and juiciness from the cactus. Just three ingredients, but so complex and full of flavor.  "

I was looking for a recipe to try Guanabana for the first time cause I did not feel like single flavor testing it.&#xD;\nThis was a perfect fit.&#xD;\nWith guanabana being the star of the show, the supporting flavors of pink guava and Inw cactus to make it interesting.&#xD;\nThis mix went excellent with a Corona in the sun.&#xD;\nThank you for sharing, its coming to Florida with me next week. Cant wait to see what else I can do with Guanabana.. So tasty"

I love it! Tried both with and without the ice; both are great but ice wears on my lungs a bit so I've got it mixed up again without and am thoroughly enjoying it. Thanks Runt! An easy new ADV for me. Glad you posted it up!"
