  "description": "This is the first of 3 recipes that I will be releasing soon. I was watching Food Network and was inspired by a place in Louisiana named the Creole Creamery. They are known for putting very interesting flavor profiles into ice cream. I went on a search for a few different flavor profiles and I think I have found them. \r\n\r\nEach recipe will be based on Indian flavor profiles, and for the most part, also incorporate some florals. I wanted to jump outside my comfort zone here.\r\n\r\nThis first one is Krishna. This is a Vanilla Ice Cream with toasted almond and fig, with slight honey swirl. This profile is a very common profile in India (from what I have read, and heard while speaking to a few friends that have visited/immigrated from that region) and is a great dessert. Not a very dense dessert, but heavy with flavors and some complexity even with the basic ingredients.\r\n\r\nTPA - VBIC/CAP - VC: This is the ice cream base. Gives a creamy ice cream, with a slight thickeness from the vc, which adds a little more vanilla here.\r\n\r\nTPA - Toasted Almond: I tried FA - Almond first, and then adding some sort of \"toasted\" feel to it, including a little pie crust and such (wanted to create the toasted feel on my own) and after a few tries, realized I should just see what Toasted Almond did. I started around 1.5% but it was very muted, especiallly with the Honey Bee in the mix. Started to shine around 2.4% and then I landed with the % I'm at now. Great toasted almond flavor here\r\n\r\nFA - Fresh Fig: I enjoyed the flavor of this. I got a slight skin, but a slightly sweet fruit taste here. I think it works well in the ice cream by not being OVERLY sweet, adding a slight tart to balance it out. It's not really tasted in the mix, but I feel if it wasn't there, this could be an overly sweet mix. Again, I started low here, and slowly worked my way up to a place where the honey didn't over power this and it meshed well with the toasted almond.\r\n\r\nFLV - Honey Bee: This one gave me some problems. My first mix I had at 1%, way too high and it was like that due to me just putting too much. But I went with it and wanted to see how it would go. This is a very strong flavor, very floral to me as well. It was overpowering upon shake, and after a 1 AND 2 week steep, gave me an almost \"urinesque\" odor to the mix, which was odd. I knew it was this, as I did another mix without the honey, and a different one with a different honey and this was it. I then slowly dropped it down. It is sitting very low now, but the honey/florals come through very nicely. It is still dominant, but tasty, and allows the other flavors to come through.\r\n\r\nI suggest at least 5-7 days steep due to the Honey Bee. It needs time to die down a little, and find it's place in the mix. I recently tried it after a 3 week steep and all flavors are still there, and is an enjoyable mix. I mix at a 35/65 PG/VG, but of course you can mix as you like. I dont know how well this will do at max vg to be honest, but it's worth a try.",
