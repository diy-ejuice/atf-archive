  "description": "Check out the Mixin Vixens, Sunday 6PM EST. This request was submitted by one of our viewers. In reality, it's just vanilla ice cream with food coloring. Since a plain vanilla ice cream would be rather boring to vape, I took liberty to add flavors based on the colors. Blue Raspberry for the blue, red raspberry for pink and a little lime for the green color. I would recommend a couple of days steep for the lime to meld into the other flavors and smooth out a bit.
