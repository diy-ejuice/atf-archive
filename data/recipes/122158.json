  "description": "These were all flavors that just belonged together naturally IMO.  They practically screamed at me to combine them.  This recipe ends up a sweet, creamy, dark vanilla, dessert tobacco with warm bourbon intermingled.  Although you can vape this within a few days it would be better to let it steep longer if possible.  If you do not have the WF-Vanilla Ruyan Custard you can sub it with DIYFS Holy Holy Grail RY4 3% and CAP-Vanilla Custard v1 2% and it will still get you pretty close.   If you are a fan of oak flavorings you could easily add a drop to this as well.  I was just trying to keep the recipe list a bit shorter for a change. \r\n\r\n***Photo credit: The Electric Tobacconist <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/138172111@N04/35676004783\">Brunette girl vaping Smok G80 E-Cigarette creating cloud of vapor (monochrome)</a> via <a href=\"http://photopin.com\">photopin</a> <a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/\">(license)</a>***",

      "text": "I was missing the VRC for this one, so on Demented76's recommendation I subbed it out with 3% Holy Holy Grail RY4 and 2% CAP Vanilla Custard. Kentucky Bourbon sticks out a tiny bit without letting it steep, but overall it's really awesome stuff with the HHG and VC combo. Really interesting choice to use the CAP Cake Batter and it works perfectly for smoothing everything out and bringing in the vanilla. This is my first use of Honeycomb in a recipe and I love what it's doing to the caramel notes.You should absolutely mix this up if you're into scrumptious tobacco cream recipes."
