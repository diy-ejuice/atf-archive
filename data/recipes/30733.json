    "name": "Apple Strawberry Jam",
    "description": "The name speaks for itself: This is a simple recipe for an \"Apple Strawberry Jam\"-vape, inspired by Goldfish's famous \"Apple Buttah\", a recipe I like very much. I came up with this recipe during the first round of Beginner Blending's Mixxed Competition. In my opinion it was a bit too close to \"Apple Buttah\" so I decided not to submit it in the comp, but it is definitely very tasty and worth mixing it! Nevertheless it helped me to find the right balance between FA Fuji and TPA Strawberry Ripe for my actual recipe for round one, \"Apple Strawberry Roll\".\r\n\r\nFA Fuji Apple\r\nFuji apple is the most authentic fresh apple flavoring I know. 2% turned out to be enough to be recognized without overpowering the strawberry. \r\n\r\nTFA Strawberry Ripe\r\nAgain, IMO the most authentic strawberry out there and my favorite strawberry flavoring. 2.5% turned out to be the right amount to blend in with FA Fuji.\r\n\r\nFA Liquid Amber and CAP Butter Cream\r\nBoth are used to turn the strawberry and the apple to a jam, blend them together and add some sweetness.\r\n\r\nTFA Cinnamon Danish Swirl\r\nCDS is used mainly for the small touch of cinnamon. CAP CDS was one of the basket ingredients for the 1st round of Mixxed Competition and works as well, but I prefer TPA's version in this recipe.\r\n\r\nCAP Vanilla Custard (v1)\r\nVC again found its way into one of my recipes. Its purpose is to add the vanilla note to mix and also thickening up the whole vape.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nMixed at 70\/30 (VG\/PG). Steep: can be \"shaked&vaped\" but best after 2-3 days.\r\n",
