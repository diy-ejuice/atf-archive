  "description": "The cinnamon is pretty light, probably needs a drop of Rich Cinnamon in there to really bring it to life. This is still a huge WIP. It's supposed to be a cream cheese filled Churro. The TPA Butter was to add a bit of grease to the Churro, brown sugar to smooth out rough edges and add some sweetness along with the meringue. The French vanilla to add some creaminess to the cream cheese icing, and of course funnel cake and CDS are the churro. I would rather not bump up CDS, but I like where it's at for now, but will still adjust it to taste. It's pretty tasty but nowhere near completed. I still need a deep friedness to it and it's been hard to find it.",
