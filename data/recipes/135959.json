  "description": " love the contrast of light during sunset as the last light of day begins to be shrouded by the darkness of night. For me it is the most magical and romantic time of day. I wanted to create a mix that provided a contrast such as this \r\n\r\nOn the inhale you get the slightly sweet **peach nectar** and **oba oba** which is contrasted against the tart grapefruit note of the **pink guava on he exhale.**\r\n\r\nThe **sparkling wine and blood orange** sit in the middle of this mix bridging the peach nectar to the pink guava \r\n\r\nThe **golden syrup** create a slightly darker base not in this mix\r\n\r\nTh is a pleasant citrus ADV    if this is a flavor profile in your  wheel house  give it a go\r\nI added a touch of  super sweet   to this mix at  0.30 %    to get the bright notes to pop even more ",
