  "description": "Here's my attempt at a Boosted remix. This is a recipe I've been chasing for atleast 3 years now and while it's still not exact, I do feel this is the closest recipe out to the original. After going out and getting a few bottles I actually feel they may have changed the formula, I remember the original being really buttery and creamy. But non the less it's still a great recipe. ",
