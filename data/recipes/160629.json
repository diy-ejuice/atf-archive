  "description": "This summer time recipe was formulated for one of my best friend‚Äôs wife‚Äôs, she was craving a PIMM‚Äôs type recipe without the alcoholic hit so I got to work on this for her.\r\nAccording to her it‚Äôs the best ejuice she‚Äôs ever had and if this was the only juice she could ever vape again she would be a happy girl! It‚Äôs comments like this that keep myself and many other mixers longing to help people on their journey with quitting the stinkys. Feel free to add your sweetener of choice, I personally enjoy this the most with 0.50% CAP SUPER SWEET and I must also say this recipe works great with WS-23 @0.50%. Please mix it up and leave me your feedback good or bad (S&V APPROVED) peaks @ 3 days. P.S *** if you prefer an alcoholic tinge, remove the CAP sweet guava and add FLV Brut bubble wine @ 2% üëåüèª",
