  "description": "Week 9 -- This is my first inspirational mix, for Lifa Vapes.  Keeping a recipe simple is sometimes hard as a DIYer, and while this doesn't have a ton of ingredients in it the layering on this recipe is lovely.  You don't get a straight out apple or strawberry but a delightful blend of the two with a hint of a caramely apple dancing in the background and a smooth layer of sweet cream. Light sweetener level makes this easily an all day vape.  Yes, it's shake and vape for me, might not be for you, so try it fresh and if it's a bit harsh for you let it steep for 3 days minimum.  ",

For me off the shake this is beautiful and succulent. The Apples blend so well with the strawberries and the cream is perfect not to heavy. Absolutely delicious. 5/5 mixed at 65/35"
