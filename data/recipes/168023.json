  "description": "FLV Boysenberry, PUR Boysenberry Preserves, and FLV Jammy Berry form the \"berry trinity\" of this recipe. RF (SC) Lemon and FLV Lemonade bring an authentic lemon flavor that is also somewhat sweet. Finally, VT Fizzy Sherbert and CAP Super Sweet back up the Lemonade and Jammy Berry respectively.\r\n\r\nI get a sweet, light berry from the inhale and lemon on the exhale.",

      "text": "That’s delightful AF. It’s like mixing a big spoonful of boysenberry jam with a smaller spoonful of lemon marmalade but not really stirring it up very well, so you get more of the berry jam at first and more of the lemon marmalade later, but some of both throughout. I suppose the lemon could be a little more natural and less sugar-coated lollipopish if I wanted to get nitpicky (have you tried INW Lemon Mix, that might do it if you’re really interested in authentic lemon). But I don’t really want to do that because it’s so enjoyable just the way it is, and manages to be remarkably refreshing for something so sweet. "

      "text": "The berry selection you picked works really well with the lemon. I’m actually not getting a super distinct lemon taste, but It’s there just enough to boost those berries. Lemon is known for brightening blueberry, so I think using it to brighten your berry base was a really smart choice. I really enjoy the FLV lemonade and VT fizzy sherbet combo as well. The fizzy sherb kind of gives the lemonade a “sparkling vibe.”&#xD;\n&#xD;\nOverall, I really enjoyed this mix and will definitely be adding this to my refreshing summer vapes rotation.  "

      "text": "I definitely understand why you've named it as such, though I don't quite get the separation you claim. &#xD;\n&#xD;\nThe berry is jammy up front, but it has a means of carrying through the entire vape, and the lemon sharpness comes in right at the fore though the flavor itself doesn't exactly appear until the back end. It's sort of like a slightly sharp berry jam that reveals that there's a nice little bit of sharp citrus underneath as you exhale, This is right up my alley in the way it plays off its own weirdness and manages to stay interesting the whole time. I really dig what you've done here."
