  "description": "I just love Lemon Meringue Pie, eating it and vaping it so always have a version knocking around, this is my best version thus far.... not dissimilar to that well known \"premium\" brand after a couple of days, it's actually pretty good of the shake but from 3 days it really starts to shine, my mix is only 4 days old so can't comment how it steep out but imo it's v v good for my tastes... very sweet so if that makes your teeth hurt perhaps leave out the ss and add if need be.... \r\nAll ingredients are needed, no subs possible, well obviously you can sub anything but it won't taste like this version ðŸ˜‰\r\nMix it and try it... don't think you will be disappointed, \r\nBig'O âœŒ\r\n",

It does tone down a bit, I'm vaping a 3 wk old mix and have checked it periodically.... I may try it again lowering that, I prefer my LMP heavy on the sticky lemon and meringue :p"
