    "description": "This recipe came about by having someone i make juice for wanting a bottle of dragon lady. The only problem is he isnt the only person i make juice for that loves dragon lady and i had run out of flavor art kiwi. So i decided to add a different third fruit. I wanted it to be a bright fruit so it could lift the other flavors up. I landed on 1% of flavorah blood orange. I am in love with this blood orange flavor. At 1% it makes this a very orange prominent recipe. Maybe not necessarily orange prominent but its own fruit. It doesnt taste distinctly like any of the three fruits in this recipe but more of a perfect concoction of all of these fruits in one if that makes any sense at all. Its juicy! Its wet! Its fruity! Its delicious! Great for a summertime vape. Give it a whirl you wont be disappointed... \r\n\r\n\r\nSweeten to taste!!!! I used .35% Flavorah sweetness. You use What ever your preferred sweetener is.\r\n",
