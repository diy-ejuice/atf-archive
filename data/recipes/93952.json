    "name": "MBs Italian Rum Cake",
    "description": "Italian rum cake is a cake that is traditionally made around the holidays. it is a dense yellow cake with vanilla  patisserie filling. and   chocolate  ganache filling Very often the base of the cake is wet from the cup ( or more if my family is making it ) of rum. \r\n\r\nCake base - I used fluffy white cake, nonna's cake and some Custard. This combination of fluffy white and custard creates a thick dense cake with a slight citrus note from the nonna's cake\r\n\r\nRum - There is a about a cup of rum in these cakes it is very prominent... so i need a rum that would stand up in this mix - VTA light rum is more like a golden medium bodied boozie rum that is probably the best rum I have tried \r\n\r\nThe patisserie filling - . I used the Bavarian cream - which is a vanilla egg based pastry cream, and lava cake and hangsen which will create the chocolate ganache layer . The custard will also help out here with some eggy notes \r\n\r\nThe frosting - is an Italian whipped butter cream which is traditional for this cake not a thick sugary butter cream - so vanilla whipped cream was perfect and the cake is covered by almonds\r\n\r\nvanilla is a very prominent flavor profile in this cake so wanted to enhance that a bit with shisha vanilla ",
