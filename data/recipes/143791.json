  "description": "Mixed on Fresh03 SaturDYI'ing with Friends on March 23rd 2019. I love passion fruit, it's not a mystery so as we were doing tropical ice creams I had to do a passion fruit sherbet.\r\n\r\nVT Fizzy Sherbet + WF Frozen Yogurt = This is the sherbet base. The yogurt acts like the cream that gives this lush and generous feeling to the sherbet.\r\n\r\nVT Passion Fruit + FA Passion Fruit + VT Yellow Passion + CAP Grapefruit = The passion fruit full force. VT and FA Passion fruit are a strong fruit base. VT yellow passion makes the passion fruit more authentic and a touch floral. CAP Grapefruit is here to give it a little tartness and redness.\r\n\r\nCap Super Sweet = rounds up the vape very well and makes the passion fruit pop.\r\n\r\nI hope you enjoy this as much as I do ! \r\n\r\nBe queer & vape on !\r\n\r\n\r\n[Photo Credit: Sam Linsell - https://drizzleanddip.com/2011/11/11/fridays-food-porn-granadilla-sorbet/]",
