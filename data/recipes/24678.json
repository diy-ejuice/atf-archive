    "description": "This is a recipe that friend of mine wanted me to create for him about 6 months ago. After working on it for about 1 month this was the final result. This was one of the few recipes created early in my DIY journey and it was a major motivater for me because it tastes exactly like you would expect Apple Pie with Ice Cream to taste like. (\ud83d\ude22sorry about the TFA VBIC manson \ud83d\ude22)  If you like apple and you don't taste pepper when you vape TFA Vanilla Bean Ice Cream I know you will love this. That being said it can be subbed with FW Vanilla Bean Ice Cream and work just as well. I recommend it mixed at Max VG and steep for 8 days. So mix it up, enjoy, comment, and rate it. Happy New Year everyone!!!!!!! ",
