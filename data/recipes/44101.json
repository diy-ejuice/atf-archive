Opulent and smooth caramel tobacco. The cookie dough comes and goes for me, sometimes i have to really look for it otherwise i don't notice it, but that's fine because this is delicious anyway"

Dark and complex."

The flv cookie dough just sets this off. Recipe of the fucking year so far 10\/10 &#xD;\n&#xD;\nJust wanted to update my review by adding this recipe with a 8 month steep is fucking fantastic! Make a big batch and forget about it"

Get a sort of maple syrup and ice cream type thing from it as well - especially in the aroma from the bottle.  Found it a little heavy on sweetener for my tastes, and the flavour level was a little overwhelming with in an RDA.  Currently steeping another batch with lower VG, halved sweetener and will vape it as MTL - I think this batch will hit the spot perfectly."

This one...this is great. the awesome notes from ry4d come through and just accentuate the cookie dough so well. everything else brings this together and makes for a great mix. I'm thinking of playing with some raspberry and white chocolate. see how that goes. "

But with the additions wayne put in here it all blends so well together!! I personally like it with 5% tfa banana nut bread layered on top the best, as Wayne suggested. But this is a great recipe without it. Cookie Dough is a hard flavor to nail and I'm glad he once again worked his magic on this. Make sure to give it a week and it turns into a thick well balanced recipe! Anyone discouraged to try an RY4 recipe, don't be, I promise you will not be dissapointed!"
