During the Reagan Administration the CIA was involved in trafficking cocaine. Government contracted Prisons to major corporation with a promise of 90% occupancy making profit from prisoners. War on drugs, Minimum sentencing, stop and frisk and Turning marijuana into a felony all had a major role in this issue, all for profit, segregation and oppression.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n- Flavor Notes\r\n\r\n\r\nHazelnut fits well with Dbl Chocolate Clear, but just a hint. really brings out the chocolate IMO.... added Cream Fresh for a more milk chocolate boost\r\n\r\nFor fluff and that creamy smores taste, I went with TPA Toasted Marsh.\r\n\r\nButterscotch for the cookie is probably my new fave, I dislike intense cookie vapes but these settle well together.\r\n\r\nWent with Vanilla Classic aka Madagascar as a chance, only because Madagascar fits well with the concept and it worked out bomb!

It's vapeable at that point, but IMO some more steeping time helps, maybe a week minimum. Other than that, I've made this recipe as a way to use my Double Chocolate (Clear), and it's a fine use for it. But I would certainly not recommend the flavor, so if you don't have it, don't go out of your way to buy this flavor, it's mediocre at best."
