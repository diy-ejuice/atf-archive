  "name": "Pineapple Lassi with Ginger & Honey v2",
  "description": "I love Lassi drinks and the one that sticks out the most to me is a Pineapple Lassi with ginger I had.  This is my attempt to create that and to use MB's Pineapple Lassi.  \r\n\r\nSo obviously I started with MB's Pineapple Lassi as I've been wanting to build something around that flavor.  I kept it at 1.5% mostly because I want all these flavors to blend without one being too dominant. \r\n\r\nI wanted to back up that pineapple with some fresh pineapple used in the drink, so I went with INW Pineapple for that purpose.  After some trial and error I went with 3% to keep it above the ginger.\r\n\r\nI added a fair amount of VT Yoghurt Drink to fill in the drink aspect and to lighten things a little with that lemon note.\r\n\r\nTo further push the creamy drink I added a dab of FA Cream Fresh just to add some nondescript creaminess.\r\n\r\nThe Ginger was hard.  I honestly just went with Cap Gingerbread as that's the only ginger I have.  I think it works.  It does bring a bready note, but I kind of like it and makes the flavor a little more dense and layered.\r\n\r\nThe drink I had was sweetened with Honey, so I wanted to add a bit of that without getting a strong honey taste.  I really wanted just a little of that honey depth and slight sweetness, so I went with a modest amount of FLV Milk & Honey.  I think it blends well with the Cap Gingerbread as well.\r\n\r\nFinally, this is a sweet drink so I added a tad of Cap Super Sweet to raise things.\r\n\r\nSuggestions would be appreciated if another ginger would give me a mild sweet ginger note I could use.\r\n\r\nThis has to steep.  The taste changes dramatically within the first 24 hours.",
