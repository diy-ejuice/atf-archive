Update after 8 months:  still have it, still don't like it."

According to wikipedia: The flavour of the fruit has been described as a combination of lettuce and tomatoes, with sour citrus flavour notes contrasting with an underlying creamy texture reminiscent of coconut or banana.&#xD;\n&#xD;\nOkay, seriously, if lettuce and tomato taste like that to you, QUIT SHOPPING AT THAT MARKET.&#xD;\n&#xD;\nAnywho, this is a damned tasty vape. That creamy goodness of milkshake, the hint of sour\/tart that brings to mind either slightly off but still good coconut milk or mebbe pineapple and the barest hint of banana in there just really jells together. This is totally ADV worthy, and a milkshake I'd fight Daniel Day Lewis if he tried to drink it.&#xD;\n&#xD;\nThis one's for fans of tropical drinks, milkshakes, banana haters (YO!), banana lovers (just the right amount in there to set it off), or those who want to try something that looks outside your wheelhouse but is tasty as hell.

It just hits all the right spots, with a tartness that works like a tart fresh strawberry or a bit of pineapple and makes an excellent counterweight to the sweet, creamy milkshake base. That tartness kept me coming back and never getting bored. I try to give some constructive criticism on every critique but I'm mostly drawing blanks here, as this is a 5-star, ADV quality vape and I can't think of anything that might make it better than it already is... balance, mouthfeel, originality (in the sense that I've never had anything quite like this before, I know the milkshake base was borrowed but that was a great decision to make), everything about this is just gets it done. 10ml left me wanting more without any thoughts on how I might try tweaking it, and that is rare. Great recipe!!!"

That guanabana is a really exciting break from the usual strawberry-cream profile, but hits all those tart\/sweet\/creamy notes in much the same way. I love it! Thanks for sharing this recipe!"
