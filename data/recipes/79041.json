  "description": "You know it it's good when straight after the shake you smile and say to yourself, \"I think I have my new all day vape\". FIGJAM !! This recipe on the surface may seem like a simple recipe yet to get the balance right and achieve a gorgeous jammy feel was a bit more difficult to master. First I began with the \"Fig  Stone - The FLV Fig gives the center of the fig experience while the FA Fresh Fig offers more of the notes from the skin of the fruit while the TFA Acai balances the two and begins to help begin the jam feel to this vape. A few drops of FA liquid amber and FA Blackcurrant help complete the jam feel of this recipe while a few drops of INW Shisha Vanilla help smooth this whole recipe right through the middle. The brown sugar completes this recipe bringing the home made style of deep sweetness that this recipe deserves. This recipe offers you a beautiful authentic FIGJAM experience.  While it is complex with textures it is also silky and offers a moorish and well rounded flavor experience. Turn on some deep chiil music, grab a lovely bottle of fine Merlot and bring it all together and you will have a symphonic experience worth savoring! Enjoy! \r\nPS> There are no subs in this recipe.\r\nRecommended Music to vape this to: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdRd3DuBupk",
