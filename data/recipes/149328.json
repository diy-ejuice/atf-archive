First it has none of that under-ripe banana runts flavor that normally comes with a banana vape. This is my first time using Banana Custard (won't be the last). Next was the best surprise, the bakery. This bakery note is spot on fried banana bread - super clean and very prominent in the flavor. The maple syrup finish with a touch of cinnamon is divine. Seriously one of the best Developed recipes to date. Mix this - you will not regret it."

This is 5 star for what it is, well balanced and great separation.  Each component builds this fantastic juice.  We've been vaping it after a 10 day steep, its awesome in the morning with our coffee.  Great Job Guys!!!! "
