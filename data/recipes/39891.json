    "description": "This was a very complex development. Finding the right balance for an explosion of flavor and smoothness was not easy. This is a very original and complex mix.\r\n\r\nIf I had to sum up this profile I would say it is an original candy mix extremely close to the Modus Eliquid \"Pablo\".. Which is odd being that there's no lemon in this mix. I chalk that up to the interaction between the fruits.\r\n\r\nThis recipe was developed and derived from my Warrmel Ohm recipe. Adding Pink Guava, Super Sweet and Cantaloupe completely transformed it into this beautiful complexity.\r\n\r\n10\/10 would certainly recommend you mix this up and give it a go. Perfect ADV for me, Great from shake and vape.",
