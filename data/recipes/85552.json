  "description": "Blueberry bread pudding!!!! You may want to boost the blueberry but for me it hits all the check points and is delicious!!! Hopefully you enjoy it as much as I do. There's a touch of cinnamon and a slight butterscotchy  note as well. The vanilla custard is used for the egg aspect along with a touch of vanilla. This is totally vapable on day 3 but it really holds its own after 5 days of steeping. Enjoy!!!",
