  "description": "I started trying this one out January of 2016, a recent forum post reminded me to go back to a bottle that's been steeping a few months.\r\nIt's not 100% \"duchess reserve\" yet but it's on it's way & really damn close.\r\n\r\nI added the butter pecan & meringue after a suggestion from Mike Peifer (MrColdOne), so he deserves some of the credit for bringing this recipe even closer to completion.\r\n\r\nTFA Vanilla Custard also works well here at 4% instead of the cappella.\r\nThis is optional, since people are enjoying the current version, any further changes will be published as a new recipe.\r\n\r\nThis one really needs a good steep to come together.\r\n\r\nDevelopment notes on my blog post here:\r\n\r\nhttp://hardwicks.co.za/blogs/mr-hardwicks-blog/92145987-cloning-duchess-reserve",

Haven't tried the original, but after I dripped this a couple of times to test it out it went straight into a squonker. A touch high on the sweetener at first glance but it works great in this recipe with just a slightly noticeable amount of gunking. 60mL's gone in just a few days coming off the steep, definitely keeping this in my rotation."

The tres leches, butterscotch and hazelnut and balanced very well, that sort of reminds me of the toppings on an ice cream sunday, without the ice cream. Very good work Joel!"

I can only imagine how much better it will get with time.  I've never tasted DR and don't plan on buying any for comparison. Why do that when this is so delicious. Reason number 318 why I LOVE DIY....brilliant!"

I love how rich and decadent it is. This is exactly the mix I have been looking for! I can't wait to see how this develops as it steeps. I am going to do my best to forget about this for the full 21 days."
