  "description": "So I always hear people say I can't taste the strawberry in this vape. Well now you can. This straightforward Strawberry Custard has that Authentic sour Strawberry flavor you get from real Strawberries.  RF Strawberry combined with  FA strawberry which adds almost a candy like strawberry and  TFA Strawberry Ripe makes an outstanding combination for those looking for the perfect Ripened Strawberry Custard. TFA Dragronfruit we all know that rally helps to make a Strawberry Custard shine and brings in some much needed flavor. For me when I make a custard it must include some cheesecake and some crust. I chose FW Cheescake as I think this is the most underrated Cheescake flavor and to me is absolutely the best. Add in FW Graham cracker to get that more authentic graham cracker taste without to much hint of cinnamon. I add .5% Supersweet to most of my mixes and this is why it's here. Just to livin it up. It's (Optional if you use it). I used TFA vanilla custard as I feel this is a lighter version than Capellas and still gives off a great Custard flavor. And to me this reduces the steep time as Capellas is much more rich. Good after 1 day steep. 5 days for perfect Custard.",
