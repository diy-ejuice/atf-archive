    "description": "As many of you know Dazcole's Lemon Tart (Remix) is fantastic! If your like me you have probably tried it and haven't tried the original. So I want to give a big shout out to Dazcole for opening my eyes to this stuff! \r\n\r\nLast week I was at a B&M who carried Dinner Lady and thought, what the heck lets give this stuff a try. The first thing that caught my attention when I unscrewed the dropper was the color. It was very light in color, almost clear, and when going through the cloning process this helped me narrow down my choices a lot. I knew immediately that FA Custard was out because that stuff will turn a bottle brown at 1%. So my obvious choice to get that sweet eggy note was FA Meringue. At 2% it isn't overbearing and adds body to the recipe. \r\n\r\nNext step was the crust.  This was the tricky part. Since the OG is so light in color it ruled out many of my options for crust. I was going through my stash and stumbled across FA Apple Pie. It does not impart much of the apple but more of a store bought pie crust taste. At 2% we get the right amount of texture for the crust. \r\n\r\nLast, but not least, the lemon. If anyone has had Dinner Lady, you know that there is lemon meringue pie in it. Why? Fruit Loops. You taste fruit loops through out the entire vape, but in a good way. So i knew that LMP had to be in there. After playing with CAP's and FW's version i decided to use both. FW's is a much sweeter (sugar) fruit loops and less meringue, where CAP's has more of a creamy fruit loop taste. I landed on 4% CAP and 2.5% FW which seems to work perfectly. FA Lemon Sicily accent's the LMP and helps keep it from being a straight up cereal vape. \r\n\r\nThe OG probably has 1-2% sweetener, but since DIY, I have become super sensitive to sweetener and can only take a few vapes of most premium juice. Fell free to leave it out or sweeten to your liking. My first attempts were without sweetener, but felt that the vape really benefits from using it at 0.5% \r\n\r\nAll in all I feel that this is pretty much spot on to the OG. If I had to put a number on it, I would say it is 90% there. But hey that's not just for me to say, so let me know what you think and enjoy. ",
