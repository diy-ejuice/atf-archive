            "text": "I like the berries in your mix, they work well together with a definite accent on blue and darker berries which fits your forest theme. The TPA Graham Crackers gives body I suppose? I do not get granola or biscuit in any way. But what I'm missing here is the yogurt. You can go much higher on TPA Greek Yogurt before it becomes a main note and before its tang comes through. You do advise that peopke can bump it up to 5%, why not do that right away? Also I would bump it to 8% without hesitation. I definitely did not use 1% of Super Sweet, that would be way too sweet for me. I did 0.5% of FW Sweetener.  All in all a nice mix, I like it, but I think you could push this mix further by adding more TPA yogurt and working on a real granola base. Your berries are really spot on and pleasant. Good job!"

            "text": "I'm really surprised this doesn't have any reviews yet, because this recipe really showcases how much potential there is in the low-key-popular FA Forest Fruit. I used less sweetener than the recipe calls for (probably around .6%), and at that level the vape gives a satisfying, sharp\/sour note on the inhale before resolving into a rich and creamy ripe\/sweet berry that preserves just the right amount of the initial tang. To me, that tang is mostly berry, and I feel as if the sour yogurt notes are expressed as part of (rather than alongside) the berry. But I actually consider that a positive, because it's as if the dairy profile is a sweet cream that's absorbed flavor from a handful of berries. You just want to drink it, and in every gulp you get a fresh, sharp berry or two to balance out the sweetness. &#xD;\n&#xD;\nOne way or another, if you like FA Forest Fruit, absolutely mix this up. It's excellent work. "
