  "description": "Needs a week steep to properly shape up and smooth out. The idea here was to have cantaloupe inform mango with some creaminess among a simply delicious KB/TM combo. Add a bit of FLV cream or FA Fresh Cream if you want more of a creamy texture. Some TFA Vanilla Swirl would be pretty good here as well.",

      "text": "This is a bit too weird for me. Even knowing looking at the ingredients, and knowing who made it so I was coming into it expecting weird, it's too weird. If all the cantaloupe did was fold into to the mango up top and lend some of it's creaminess to the mango it would probably work better, but I'm getting too much melon flavor coming through and the toasted part of toasted marshmallow is just too odd following behind that. It gives the impression of a toasted cantaloupe which is just... no. No, thank you. Leave the cantaloupe raw please. Add to that the warmth from the KB, and it's just not for me. Points for creativity and yes, if I force myself to mentally separate the top notes (Mango, Cantaloupe) from the bottom (sexy KM/TB) the components are individually delicious, but I don't want to even vape them back to back in different RDAs, much less in the same bottle of juice.
