Wonder Flavours is a Canadian flavor company that is currently killing the game. If you haven't yet ordered some I recommend you do",

            "text": "Delicious. I love the custard base. Vienna Cream adds some depth and an ice cream twist while Butter Cream gives it a waxiness that I find appealing. The triple threat of FW Butter Pecan, WF Pecan Pie, and WF Roasted Pecan create a robust nutty note that stands up to the hefty custard base. It\u2019s roasted, buttery, and crunchy. Very authentic butter pecan in a thick, rich custard.. Perfect time of year for this kind of recipe."
