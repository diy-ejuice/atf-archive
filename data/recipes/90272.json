    "description": "A hopped apple cider pudding.\r\n\r\nThis started out as a riff on Mill's \"Soursop Pudding.\"  I loved that recipe.  The pudding base was on point, and I dug how he used hops as an accent to soursop.  I took the basic idea and ran with it.\r\n\r\nFLV Vanilla Pudding is the base of the recipe, bringing a smooth texture and some body to the table.  The FLV Coconut is in here mostly to accentuate the richness of that pudding base.  The errant bits of coconut flavor actually work pretty well, but I'm mostly after the buttery richness of that flavor.\r\n\r\nI really wanted an excuse to try to make apple and hops work together.  For some reason, I had never tryed it out, but I really dig how the hops plays with the boozy notes of FLV Apple Cider and the Apple Pop is there to really punch in the apple profile.\r\n\r\nThe cinnamon was the final addition to temper some of the clash between the boozy notes of the cider and the rich pudding.  Plus, the warm spice makes this feel even more comforting and like a vaguely macho dessert you'd get at some boutique hunter's lodge.  Shoutout to LimeDrive for testing an earlier version of this via Mixer's Club and suggesting cinnamon.  Turns out, it ties the whole thing together.\r\n\r\nThe city light is too bright to save me or be seen.  Welcome to Deer Lodge.",

Spring is off to a beautiful start, and ConcreteRiver drops one of the most autumnal recipes I've ever tried. Makes sense. Although it couldn't be more out-of-season, it's a deliciously warm apple cider with rich, creamy pudding, as promised, and I think it's one of the more interesting and unusual-yet-addictive recipes to be shared by anyone in too long. The hops just completes that cider and while the pudding looks like it might clash badly, instead it just makes for fascinating contrast and satisfying vape. I'll have to mix another bottle after the first frost.  "
