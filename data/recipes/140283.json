  "description": "This is my take on the quite old Rocket Man e-juice from The Man.\r\nMy version is creamier and not so much in your face like the original.\r\nBefore you say anything.Yes,i know that 7% of TPA's Greek Yogurt seems high but i've worked my way up there starting from just 1%.\r\nHonestly i haven't used this flavour before so that's why i started very low.I bumped it up several times to get some zing out of the yogurt but it's not overpowering at all.it could be even more but i don't really think that using it any higher brings out really better results.\r\nThe FLV Yogurt and the FA Fresh Cream makes it just thicker and gives a nice mouthfeel.\r\nTPA CGC help out as well in the cream department and you get just a hint of graham crust there.\r\nVT Blueberry Jam is a wonderful sweet blueberry base.I added FW Blueberry in there to get some bite and a bit more authenticity out of the Blueberry.\r\nThat's it.shake,vape and enjoy!",
