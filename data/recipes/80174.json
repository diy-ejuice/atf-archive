    "description": "This was inspired from the monthly clone challenge,  Taruto by Yami Vapor put on by ID10-T over on reddit.  This is not a clone but it inspired me to mix a Portuguese Custard Tart. A traditional Portuguese custard pastry that consists of a cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e-like custard caramelized in a crust. The INW Creme Brulee has a  caramelized  sugar, slight egginess, thick, fresh, creamy texture. I couldn't imagine a custard tart without CAP Vanilla Custard in the mix. The FA Catalan cream brings the filling together with its dulce de leche like flavor (caramel and hint of cinnamon). The Biscuit and Pie Crust combines for a nice crust.",

Tastes \"brown\" if that makes sense. Could go nicely with a tobacco like soho. Recommended if you wanna vape a nice rich custard with an interesting spice twist. "
