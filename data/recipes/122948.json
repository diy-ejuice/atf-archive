    "description": "The WF-Glazed Donut combined with the WF-Fluffy White Cake form the foundation of this cake doughnut.  The FLV-Pumpkin Bread was added to darken the cake and add some more spice.  The FLV-Eggnog was thrown in for the spice as well as to add moisture and a bit more egg to the cake mix.  The FLV-Apple Filling brings just a hint of that apple cider taste on the exhale.  The FLV-Rich Cinnamon along with the OOO-Powdered Sugar make up my outer coating.  I felt that it needed a touch more vanilla and sweetness so I threw in the DFS-Holy Vanilla and CAP-Super Sweet for good measure.  You can add whatever sweetener you prefer though.  I also need to thank Alfred Pudding for helping me get through my basket of possible flavor combinations at the last minute.  I was sick and my brain needed some guidance.  He helped me tremendously by letting me bounce my ideas off of him. ",
