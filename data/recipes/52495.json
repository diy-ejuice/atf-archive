  "description": "What does Blue taste like? Not an easy question to answer. In fact, impossible to answer. We live in a sensory world that limits us to only see color. However, just because our gustation and olfaction can not sense color doesn't mean it don't exist. For instance, color has wavelengths, just as sound has wavelengths. We have auditory sensors (ears)to pick up these wavelengths. Our brain processes these signals and tells us that it is music, or what ever. Different colors could also give off a certain sound. If we had a receptor to pick up these \"color sounds\" what would they sound like?  What if we had sensory organs to taste the wavelengths of color? What would color taste like? Well, we will probably never know but, we can imagine. \r\n\r\nBlue Ice. My take on what the color BLUE tastes like. I imagine blue has a frosty feel(FA Polar Blast). Like a clear blue sky on a chilly Fall morning. Blue, I imagine, would be linear in taste as it's a primary color, which means, you can't take 2 or more colors to make blue. Blue is just blue! It would not be sour or bitter like green, but mildly sweet(TPA Raspberry) and dense in texture(FLV Grape). \r\n\r\nWith all of this conjecture of \"What Blue Tastes Like\", everyone will have their own opinion. But, it is an interesting experiment that will challenge all mixers. Enjoy. :) ",
