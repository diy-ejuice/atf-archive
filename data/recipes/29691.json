    "description": "This is my banana cream pie  I made this  flavor  by request from my wife it turned out great. I used banana cream pie and quince for my main profile of my banana flavor. I made the pie crust with fa apple  pie and fa cookie. I made my  creaminess  with a combination I use quite a lot it's 1% of fa meringue and fa Vienna cream and cream freshh or just works. Then I added shisha vanilla because it helps out all the aspects of this recipe. Give it a try we enjoy this in my household.",
