  "description": "Get ready to pour out a mug of bittersweet cocoa for all your fallen Bronies, because now you can have it in vape form! \r\n\r\nA lot of the ingredients in the recipes are used to balance each other out, not for the their specified flavor.\r\n\r\nMain Profile :\r\n\r\nThe Ry4 Double(TPA) is a good counterweight to the Cocoa(FA) to a more well rounded cocoa drink flavor, the Ry4 tobacco flavor adds a slight grainy bite, like cocoa powder in your cup.\r\n\r\nSub flavor profile:\r\nThe Bavarian Cream(TFA) and Catalan Cream(FA) are used together to create a heavy whipping cream taste without over sweetening the mix. \r\n\r\nSweeteners:\r\nThe main and sub flavor make for a very heavy vape, allowing the Cookie(FA) to add a little bite without giving a cookie flavor, and paired with Honeysuckle(TPA) gives a nice light sweetness.\r\n\r\nSteep Time: Pretty dark shake and vape but still decent. Recommend atleast 4-7 days steep.\r\n\r\nIf you like a sweeter lighter cocoa, raise the Bavarian cream by .5% and sucralose(or sweetener of your choice) to taste. \r\n\r\nEnjoy!\r\n\r\n\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nYou are free to\r\nShare — copy and redistribute the material in any medium or format\r\nAdapt — remix, transform, and build upon the material\r\n\r\n(The licensor cannot revoke these freedoms as long as you follow the license terms.)\r\n\r\nUnder the following terms:\r\n\r\nAttribution — You must give appropriate credit, provide a link to the license, and indicate if changes were made.
