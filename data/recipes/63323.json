    "description": "Updated: Version 5, I'm calling this finished.\r\nIn Glendale, CA there is a Cuban Bakery called Porto\u2019s. They serve literally hundreds of different baked goods but among them is a favorite of my Fianc\u00e9 and I, their fruit tart. The crust isn\u2019t your traditional pie crust\u2014it\u2019s more like cake. The cream tastes rich like custard but isn\u2019t too sweet. On top they put blackberries, blueberries, strawberries, kiwi, and dragon fruit. They top the whole thing with a very light apricot glaze. It\u2019s amazing.\r\nI used FA Kiwi as it was more of a real Kiwi flavor as opposed to a booster. At 1% it is present without being overbearing.\r\nCAP Dragon Fruit was a bit different from my normal use of TFA Dragon Fruit but once again I\u2019m looking for candied pieces of fruit and not flavor boosters so this worked well at 1%\r\nFA Forest Fruit is just wonderful and covers the whole range of berries I was looking for. FA Fuji Apple complements all the fruits and brightens them up.\r\nFor the crust I used a mixture of TFA Pie Crust which is what you would normally expect from a fruit tart and mixed with the classic FW Yellow Cake. It represents the unique crust of Porto\u2019s fruit tart perfectly.\r\nAnd that cream--- not just any cream would do. I\u2019ve fallen in love with OOO Cream (Milky Undertones) because it can be used in just about any recipe that needs a cream note without added vanilla tones or sweetness. I took this almost as high as one should possibly use it and it works great. Combined with a light use of everyone\u2019s favorite VC, CAP Vanilla Custard v1, this made the cream rich but not too sweet just like the real deal. The vanilla notes of CAP VC fortunately get lost in the mix and is just barely detectable.\r\nFinally to top it all off, a very light usage of FA Apricot for the glaze. \r\nBest after two weeks. This one benefits from a steep but if you insist on S&V, microwave it for 5 seconds.",
