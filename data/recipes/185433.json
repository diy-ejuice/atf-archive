    "description": "This isn't really meant to mimic anything, it's just supposed to be delicious. If you must give it a \"profile,\" I suppose we could call it a spiced pear torte with butterscotch cream sauce. \r\n\r\nThis recipe is a mash-up between my [Titanic](https:\/\/alltheflavors.com\/recipes\/48608#titanic_by_id10_t) recipe and Foment_life's [DAAPled Pears](https:\/\/alltheflavors.com\/recipes\/164335#daapled_pears_by_foment_life). \r\n\r\nAs soon as I tried his pear trinity I knew I wanted to try transplanting it to a different base, not that DAAPled Pears wasn't already perfect, but just to see how it might work as a plug-and-play. I took out Foment's cream base, which I hear is also super portable, and replaced it with the pair of CAP bakeries I used for Titanic.  However, after steeping and trying it, it seemed to have a hole in it. I stared at that hole until right shape to fill it came to mind, and that shape was FW Butt Rip.  ",
