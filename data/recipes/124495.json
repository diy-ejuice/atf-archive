  "description": "To me this is a balanced, sweet, slightly lemony Torrone Nougat. \r\n\r\nTorrone @ 1.5: I wanted to push the flavor for as much as I could get from it while keeping the whole recipe sweet and smooth.\r\n\r\nAlmond(FA): the Torrone nougat has almonds in it and the chewy candy is actually a candied almond paste.\r\n\r\nMarzipan(INW):  I use Marzipan because of how it enhances the Almond flavor.\r\n\r\nCream Fresh (FA) and Meringue (TPA): when used at same percentages they infuse a \"Wetness\" to the overall flavor, in addition to their creaminess. Additionally, I wanted TPA Meringue for the sweet powdered sugar properties that it would bring to this candy nougat.\r\n\r\nLemon Meringue Pie V2 (CAP): This was just a stroke of genius, a hunch, whatever you call it, but I was toying with this recipe using Toffees and had an \"AHA\" moment , â€¦ so I tried it and I liked it.... \r\n\r\nVienna Cream (FA) :  Vienna cream adds to that creamy punch needed to balance the nuttiness of Torrone\r\n\r\nVanilla Swirl (TPA): Again to add dimension to the creaminess and hopefully, at 2 %, add some chewiness to the recipe.\r\n\r\n\r\nI hope you enjoy this as much as I do. You comments are welcome and appreciated. \r\n\r\n",
