  "description": "Instead of pouring cinnamon powder on my cornflakes, I chopped up some sugar-coated strawberries and tossed them in the bowl.\r\n\r\nToasted Redux #1. I replaced Rich Cinnamon with a couple strawberries. I also bumped Cereal 27 from 3% to 5% so it will stand up to the strawberries enough. Really simple adaptation, yet it radically changes the profile. See Toasted for the cereal notes if you're interested.\r\n\r\nFlavor Notes:\r\n\r\nCAP Sweet Strawberry is a bright, sugary, candied flavor. It's exactly the kind of Strawberry you want in your cornflakes. At 4%, it‚Äôs present without totally overtaking everything.\r\n\r\nTPA Strawberry Ripe brings a touch of that authentic, fresh strawberry flavor to the mix. 2% isn't very apparent, but it fleshes out the CAP Sweet Strawberry. There's not much else to say about it.\r\n\r\nThis is a good shake and vape. Let it sit for 1-3 days first and you will be rewarded.\r\n\r\nHappy mixing. üëΩ",

But i think i might enjoy it with the AP instead of the gcc more and a little dairy/milk maybe.&#xD;\nIn the end still a good mix and im puffing through a tank right now well done."
