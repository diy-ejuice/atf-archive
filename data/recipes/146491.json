    "description": "It's a shamrock shake... except wintergreen. \r\n\r\nDon't be scared by the high percentage of ws-23, the heavy dose of cream really seems to beat the cooling effect down quite a bit.\r\n\r\nThis is a recipe that will continually get better as it ages(though it will become alarmingly dark), but is very tasty day one.",

I've made a bunch of your recipes and they are all delicious, so I trusted you and I'm glad I did. It's quite tasty and the cold isn't really all that much, just perfectly accentuates the creams, vanilla's and wintergreen. I'm tasting this just off the shake and it's damn good, looking forward to seeing what this turns into. Thank you !"
