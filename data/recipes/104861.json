    "description": "As the summer slowly arrives I've been craving for a fruity refreshing recipe. For some reason that got me back to my summers as a kid in the countryside. I used to love my honeydews with some lemon juice over them to combine their sweet taste with a sharp citric note.\r\nFor some other reason I also recalled my times in Istanbul. There you often find people selling in the streets freshly pressed pomegranate juice. I used to dig its refreshing yet sour and slightly floral taste.\r\nSo this recipe is my take on combining both experiences. I'm going for a fruity floral vape with sweet, sour and citric notes to it.\r\nTFA Honeydew II is pretty accurate but fairly thin and weak. So I'm helping it with some FLV Wild Melon, which is mainly a honeydew but with more potency and other melons going on.\r\nCAP Pomegranate brings out a pretty realistic floral juicy sour note. \r\nFA Lemon Sicily adds the citric note I'm looking for. INW Cactus the usual juiciness and a bit more sourness.\r\nCAP Supersweet brightens it all up a smidge.\r\n\r\nAll in all a refreshing summer vape!\r\n\r\nP.S. This is my first public recipe. So all comments\/critics welcome.",
