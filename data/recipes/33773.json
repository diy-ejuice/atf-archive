  "description": "This is my take on creating a blueberry glazed doughnut. As a shake and vape this felt like a lucky accident to me (being pretty new to mixing) but it tasted exactly like I had hoped for - a slightly greasy cake type blueberry doughnut with sweet glaze. After sucking down about 4ml of this pretty quickly though, I started to feel a little queasy so I let it sit for a few days. Going back to it every couple of days I noticed some changes... less blueberry one day, more egg another, still enjoyable to vape a half tank of, but after 19 days it was back to tasting just like I remember from the  first day - minus the queasiness. Not an ADV type of flavor for me, but it hits that craving for donuts in the morning :)\r\n\r\nZeppola is the base of the doughnut, with just the right amount of greasy feel to percieve the powdered sugar as being a glaze\r\nCAP Yellow Cake because this is a cake type doughnut, not the fluffy fried type of doughnut\r\nMeringue to add a hint of egginess and to help accentuate the sweetness\r\nJoy at low percentage for that barely there yeasty dough / glaze\r\nBlueberry Extra / Wild - I just love this combo of blueberries\r\n",
