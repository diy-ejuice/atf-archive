  "name": "Berry Me FroYo!",
  "description": "This seems like a really complex recipe but in all honesty, if you don't have some of the berries in here you could likely just omit them or sub and you'd still get something really tasty.  That being said, I feel the juicy lemon is pretty crucial as it adds a touch of tart undertone that gives the frozen yogurt a more authentic taste as well as giving a slight tart edge to the fruit notes, though Im sure almost any realistic lemon would suffice.  Using this FroYo base, Ive made some pretty eclectic combinations, some of which I'll post at some point.  \r\n\r\nI kinda suck at writing detailed notes and don't much have the time to do so which is why to date, I've got so many recipes but so little posted lol.\r\n\r\n\r\nI used a combo of raspberries to get an authentic berry taste, strawberry shisha to round up the top notes and a touch of cactus & pear to give it some juiciness.  To me, boysenberry has that kinda fresh squished berry taste that I was looking for and is an awesome flavor with so much use.  You wouldn't regret buying it.  \r\n\r\nSaskatoon berry is another really interesting flavor that I like very much, its rather reminiscent of dewberry.  I know this is a flavor that some really don't like,  Its really not essential to the mix so leave it out if you don't have/like it, it wont make it or break it.  However, if you're looking for an interesting deviation from your typical boring stone fruit recipes, I suggest trying this.\r\n\r\nAdd whichever sweetener you like, in this mix, I prefer FLV sweetness @ 2% which gives it a more \"sweet from within\" taste & doesn't mess up coils.\r\n\r\nChill!  You can add whichever cooling if you like, IF you like it frosty.  WS23 @ .50% did it just right for me in this mix.\r\n\r\nDoesn't really need a steep but I do find the yogurt comes in nicer after the 2nd or 3rd day.\r\n\r\nAlso, have tested this with 1.5 mg Nic Salts (as well as regular Nic) &, while noticeably toned down with salts, it still holds up well.\r\n\r\n*Please comment & rate if you do mix it up, not enough people do this here and its important for mixers to get feedback as a way of saying thank you for their hard work! :)  In exchange for an honest review, I will do the same for one of your recipes after I mix it up.   ENJOY!*\r\n\r\n**Please DO NOT repost this to any other sites in any format, I have my reasons for only posting on ATF**",
