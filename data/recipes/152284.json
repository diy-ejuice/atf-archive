  "description": "Why bother spending 2 bucks for 10 skimpy fuckin 'lozenges' when you can vape it for the exact same effect (and flavour mind you). The most iconic Aussie cough drop known to man. Get in ya jarmies, grab a box of tissues, chuck on a movie, get this recipe india and you'll be feelin top notch.\r\n\r\nThe eucalyptus & mint dies off pretty quick, just add a few drops to your bottle when this happens.",

The eucalyptus with mint is always a winner, but never used it like that before and it works so well with the vanillas . I don't know how the real thing is but this recipe is growing on me, and I think I love it. Good job!!!!&#xD;\n[EDIT] So after constantly vaping it for a month (18.5W on a 0.8ohm coil on open MTL) I love it, it is a allday, never tired of it. &#xD;\n"
