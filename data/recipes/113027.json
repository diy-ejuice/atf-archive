I have blended together what I think is the best 3 possible ingredients to form an amazingly close replica of this limited edition drink. Sour lemon with a hint of sweet on the inhale with a soft raspberry note, then a strong almost sherbert like exhale with a trailing raspberry lemon aftertaste.\r\n\r\nIf you have not tasted the New V - Tortured Orchard, Go and get yourself a can and try it then mix this up and tell me what you think. If I could add a fourth ingredient it would definitely be that Guarana Aspect but only in a small amount and in the form of maybe (VapeTrain - Mother Energy) or (Pure Flavour - Guarana) I personally have not tried these but it is where I would start my investigation.\r\n\r\n#DIYDOWNUNDERAUGUSTCHALLENGE\r\nhttps:\/\/www.facebook.com\/groups\/diydownunder interested in participating in the challenge then join DIY down under and check it out.\r\n\r\nAll product names, trademarks and registered trademarks are property of their respective owners.
