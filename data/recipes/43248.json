  "description": "A Ginger Lemon Cream Biscuit/Cookie (Depending which side of the pond you're on). So basically, 2 ginger biscuits sandwiched together with some lemon cream.\r\n\r\nTFA Gingerbread Cookie / CAP Sugar Cookie / FA Caramel - this makes up the biscuit part of it. The ginger cookie can be quite prominent at first so you can vape it straight away if you don't mind it, but it does settle down after a 2-3 day steep. It's also quite an \"in your face\" flavour if you're not accustomed to it, but you soon get used to it. Sugar Cookie is the Don when it comes to cookies so I've filled it out with that and the FA Caramel just help caramelize the sugar in it and give it a slightly richer taste.\r\n\r\nFA Custard Pi / FA Lemon Sicily / CAP Vanilla Custard / Cap Vanilla Whipped Cream - These all make up the filling. Custard Pi is a Lemon Custard so seemed fitting and I find it works pretty well, Lemon Sicily is the main lemon note, I contacted the King of Lemons (Darren Cole) for advice and he suggested a few worth trying as I only really had FA Sicily but after a few test batches with INW Lemon Mix and JF Juicy Lemon I decided to stick with it, I thought I wanted something sharper and they were, but it didn't work so I upped the Sicily. The Vanilla Custard and Whipped Cream give it some fluffy volume. If you don't have custard Pi, you can swap for FA Custard.\r\n\r\nAnyway, give it a shot and please rate/review if you do mix it.",
