  "description": "This is basically a Tobacco remix of Castle Long. I took out anything vanilla, and added some tobaccos. It's rich and complex. It needs a couple weeks to mix, but I could tell right off the bat that it was a keeper. After an over night steep, I mixed up 60 ml to let it sit for at least a month because I'm thinking that's where it's really going to shine. ",

It's definitely a sweeter profile, but danm this was good!&#xD;\n&#xD;\nI gave the two week steep a try and decided to leave it for the full month. It definitely mellowed out with the longer steep. "
