  "name": "Blackberry Cheesecake (The Trinity edition)",
  "description": "There's a reason I chose not to put this as an original recipe. At the heart of this recipe can be found the tireless work of AlfredPudding and EdibleMalfunction. First you have Alfred's Cheesecake Trinity and then together they came up with the Blackberry Trinity. My only part in this process was to mash them together and add some Vanilla Swirl to bind. Then, I mean, lets be real here, what is a piece of cheesecake without some whipped cream on top? I chose to move that flavor along with a combination I really like of CAP Vanilla Whipped Cream and FLV Whipped cream. I'm still looking for the right addition to them to create a Whipped Cream trinity. \r\n\r\nIf you haven't yet deemed us with your presence over on the DIY_Ejuice discord server there is no better time than now. The knowledge available to new and old mixers alike is astounding. Come on by and say hi. You won't want to leave.  \r\n\r\nThis is still a work in progress but I will be updating this in the coming weeks. Stay tuned. ",
