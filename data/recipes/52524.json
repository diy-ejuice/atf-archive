  "description": "A respectful remix  to give homage and respect to The Vaping Bogan from Australia. His juice line \"Bogan Brews\" is world famous for addicting flavor. His most intriguing to date is his \"Six and Out\" recipe which is a term used in backyard cricket commonly played at family gatherings here in the summer. His recipe is a balanced yet complex delight of blackcurrant and lychee.  Cloning this was difficult to nail down the back notes and I am still somewhat battling that as this is quite an amazingly balanced juice. This is close but not quite as mellow IMO. Hat's off to the original because I could only get around 80-85% there but none the less a yummy complex juice well worth a 30ml trial before you go and buy the real thing and appreciate it! #BogansMixBest ",
