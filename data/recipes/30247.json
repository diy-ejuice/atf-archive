    "description": "Been fiddling with mixing for a little while, low key. Got inspired by hearing about Vurves Watermelon crack. Gotta be honest, i never mixed it up, but started messing about trying things, and landed on this. Typical noob. Decided on cap sweet watermelon and JF watermelon together to give me the sweet candied watermelon i was after, reminiscent of sour patch kids watermelon gummies. Added the cap supersweet to that to round it up and give it the sugar lips. I used the cap vanilla swirl to add a bit of body and add a lil creamy mouth feel, and the FLV sweet coconut to aid to the sweetness and cream, and add a bit of the coconut candy flavor. I guess the best description i can give of this is a watermelon candy smoothie made with coconut water. I added the koolada to make it seem cold, and cause i had heard so much good stuff about the WMCrack. I dig it, you can play with the koolada\/sweetner to taste, i wanted a candy-ish profile myself. I know the koolada is at a high level, but i wanted it icy af. ATF gave me the random title of Plastic Furniture, which reminded me of a modest mouse song called classy plastic lumber. these things are unrelated. Open to all criticism,  thanx, rab1dg0d.",
