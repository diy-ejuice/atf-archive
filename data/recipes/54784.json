  "name": "Blue Frost Revisited",
  "description": "Revised, reformulated, and remixed. It's been almost 2 years since I made the original\r\nand in the last year it hasn't changed. But I'd kind of always wanted to go back and simplify\r\nthe mix. When I got my hands on some WS-23 one of the first things I thought after trying it \r\nwas that it was the \"Frost\" I needed in Blue Frost. \r\n\r\nWith new found inspiration I decided to strip Blue Frost down to the essentials.\r\nI dropped the FLV Raspberry, FW Razzleberry and TFA Sweetener; the first two because they\r\nare superfluous and the last because I never really used sweetener when I mixed it for myself\r\n(and when I do Cap/PUR Super Sweet are the way to go.)\r\nWayne was right about the Razzleberry watering down the mix and the candied raspberry \r\neffect it brought to the table was already covered by the combination of Raspberry Sweet and\r\nBlue Raspberry Cotton Candy. \r\n\r\nCap Hibiscus: I'd seen it mentioned several times that this flavor works well in slushee mixes and\r\nin ConcreteRiver's review he describes a \"Lingering sticky sweet mouthfeel, again more pronounced with \r\nhigher wattages. Almost like the way the syrup in a slurpee sticks to your mouth long after you take\r\na sip.\" \r\n\r\nAnd, of course, he's right. It works well to bridge the gaps and enhance the syrupy aspect of Blue Slush. \r\n\r\nWS-23: This stuff is the best coolant I've tried, hands down. I worked my way up from .25% and it kept getting\r\ncolder and colder with no perceptible off notes or funky muskiness like I get from Koolada (as low as .5%)\r\nAt %1 it's a perfect frost, adding all the cold without affecting any of the flavor. This stuff is amazing and\r\nquite addicting, I kind of want to put it in everything now. \r\n\r\nThe original Blue Frost was 90% where I wanted it and after working on it so long, I was\r\nsatisfied with where it was at. Now it's 100% to my palate and officially done. So if you've \r\ntried Blue Frost, please mix this up and let me know what you think :)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

OSDIY Blue Raspberry Slush really shines in this recipe - and I didn't think it would actually work, but CAP Hibiscus definitely does something to make this mix more syrupy and sticky. The TPA Strawberry and FW Pink Champagne helps balance the Raspberries, so it doesn't become too sweet.&#xD;\nI did leave out the WS-23 as I'm not a fan of cooling - but all in all great recipe. Good job Apex!"

Right off the shake I dripped it on my RDA and fell in love. The texture, taste, and cooling all come together to make one pretty damn amazing blue raz slush. If you are a lover of this profile check it out. I'm almost convinced to try and make a pod variant because I need something like this for my Pasito."

      "text": "On initial mixes I really wasn’t wild about this. It had a nice fresh flavor, but was rather muted. I kept going back but was left wanting more. I looked at the previous version and decided to add the 1% sweetener to this finished version.  Imo it really benefits from a little sweetener. I may try a tad less next time and see how little I can use. It also really needs a higher wattage/temp to shine on profile RDA I’m at 60W temp control at 390 degrees. Perfect. Now I want to see if I can somehow introduce just a touch of citrus to this mix for a little “pop”. Thinking maybe blood orange"

      "text": "It's a perfect, vapeable blue raspberry Slurpee, an improvement on the already awesome Blue Frost recipe. If you like OSDIY Blue Raspberry Slush or blue raspberry anything at all, I think you'll love this; it takes everything about that flavor, levels it up, and freezes it cold. FW Pink Champagne and CAP Hibiscus hit that textural component of syrup mix and fine ice excellently. But the main difference between this and the previous version is that instead of having to imagine the cold, it's really there, without any off-notes. WS-23 truly is amazing, I think I might be getting hooked on it as well. "
