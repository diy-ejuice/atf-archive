  "description": "We were doing a moving theme on the SaturDIY'ing with Fresh03 & Friends in honor of Fresh moving and being a lesbian, I couldn't pass up on the U-Hauling inside joke that is legendary in the community. @AlfredPudding was in chat and he worked on this treat with me and this thing is killer! Thank you, Alfred!\r\n\r\nFA Zeppola/WF Angel Cake/LB Belgian Waffle = This is a delicious doughnut stone and you can be certain I'm keeping it in my notes. I feel it would work just as well for a waffle, a french toast, or anything else fried, sauteed, etc., give or take some tweaking.\r\n\r\nOOO Vanilla Custard Cheesecake/OOO Powdered Sugar = this is for the glaze and it's yummy.\r\n\r\nFLV Rich cinnamon = I love adding it to my fried goods, it gives that little extra touch of sweet and baked and lovely fresh out of the oven smell and taste.\r\n\r\nFA Butterscotch = Remember when they told you it was a sweet honey glazed doughnut bun? They lied. It's not honey, it's syrup and with our glaze, a touch of FA Butterscotch will do the trick. You can add a 0.5% of TPA brown sugar, maybe 0.5% of VT golden syrup or a little FA Maple if you want to change the profile a tiny bit. I like it as is.\r\n\r\nThis thing is lovely on the shake, even better 7 days later if you can stay out of it.\r\n\r\nEnjoy, be queer & vape on!\r\n\r\n[Photo Credit = www.biscuitville.com ]",
