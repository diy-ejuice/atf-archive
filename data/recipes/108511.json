    "description": "Blood Orange Champange - VTA Along with the Tangerine SC - WF adds a perfect effervescences feeling in the vape.\r\nIsland Mango - WF with Sweet Coconut - FLV and Passion Fruit - FA Gives off a nice body and slight sweetness to the mix.\r\nJamaican Rum - TPA gives off a slight rum base.\r\nSoursop SC - WF will tie it all up with hints of Pineapple, Banana and Tartness to give it a fine tropical feeling.\r\n\r\nThis is a very interesting mix of flavors and each bring something so different yet so right to the mix.. I tested this mix on various products including as follows and not in any order.. MTL @40w, Dripper with dual coils @Mechanical Device, Dripper with single coil @75W using RDA ( Recurve ) with single coils and restricted air holes @Squonk Device.\r\nThis could make a very warm summer day feel like you are on a sandy beach with your toes in the water...\r\n\r\nThe flavors will pop in all the configuration I mentioned and I do think it will pop in a tank as well..",
