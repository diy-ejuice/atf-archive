Still good but flavor seems to have been quieted. Could be my taste buds have grown used to it.   I still have some left and I have zero self control.  If the 2nd bottle goes just as fast as the first then I'd give it the 5 stars.***UPDATE*** This is one of if not THE BEST custard recipe on this site.  Don't know what I was thinking earlier.  Easy 5 stars"

I'm having quite a few ideas on how to utilise this as a base for tobaccos and other fruits - it's really good. And if you've been disappointed with other custards as a DIYer, this one won't. Does leave a little gunk - after about going through 50mL of this stuff - but still worth it. Will definitely remix."
