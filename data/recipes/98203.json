  "name": "Reset (Frozen Lemonade) ",
  "description": "This is a super simple DIY mix for a frozen lemonade because sometimes we just need a break from the ADV and the Heavier flavors. Sometimes we just need to reset the taste buds. I made this for my son since he only vapes menthol but ended up vaping it all myself. Works well on AIO pod systems. Works well in MTL tanks and smooth enough for DLH tanks.\r\nI prefer to steep this at least a week to let the mint note in the menthol settle in and the sharp notes from the lemon smooth out a bit but it can be S&V I just prefer to steep.\r\nThe menthol can be bumped to 2% or you can add a little WS-23. \r\nIf you mix for MTL or Pods adjust the VG PG Ratio to 50/50 ",

      "text": "Just mixed this up and am plesantly surprised, I thought the lemonade would be lost and unoticed in the mix since it's used so low but I was wrong. I'm not a big LA Lemonade fan but this is nice to have in a rotation when you have mixed endlessly for the past week or just get burnt out trying to perfect that one recipe. Nice light vape, I subbed the menthol out with a quarter % of WS-23 since I am not a fan of menthol and it's really like and icy not overly chilled. I did use a little more sweetener than called for but all in all 1% FW sweetener even works with this mix. "
