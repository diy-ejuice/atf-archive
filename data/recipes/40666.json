    "description": "This delectable recipe was inspired by wanting to create a nice delicious strawberry bundt cake loaded with cream cheese all over it. \r\n\r\nThe strawberries Fused together gives the recipe a subtle but nice light strawberry flavor while still allowing the other flavors to shine though in the recipe. The Vanilla Cupcake mixed with Cap yellow cake give it that great cake flavor and add a touch of FA cookie to give it more of that cake texture. Lorans cream cheese Icing combined with the  Cap NY Cheescake are the stars of the show that give the cake a perfect balance of flavor to make it cheesy and add a nice tang to it. The butter adds to make the recipe just a little more moist to like you would expect from a good cake recipe. FLV cream adds a nice dairy note and some added sweetness to the recipe to make this a great all day vape. \r\n\r\nSteep 3 days for great flavor a full 7 day to have all the flavors meld together to make this cake recipe into perfection. \r\n",
