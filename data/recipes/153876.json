  "description": "That Game of Scones show was so much fun everyone ! Mine turned out soft and sweet and I love it !\r\n\r\nFA Cookies/Cap Sugar Cookie = they make a nice scone, buttery yet still a little dry. Let it steep a week for it to really come out.\r\n\r\nFLV Milk & Honey/FA Honey = a really nice and sweet honey for drizzled on my scone.\r\n\r\nCAP Horchata = for that little roughness you get on the back of your teeth when you eat a scone and that lovely milky cinnamony goodness in my scone.\r\n\r\nEnjoy, be Queer and vape on !\r\n\r\n[Photo Credit : peegorevapes ]",
