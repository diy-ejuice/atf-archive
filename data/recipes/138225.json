  "description": "The most fruitful, delectable authentic fruit profile that I've not only tasted but also created. From the level of juiciness of the fruits to the balance of the sweetness ? the mouthfeel of the Popsicle, this has been a profile that I have delicately crafted with a passion down to the last lick to the stick.\r\n\r\nFE Mango - is the most delicious base mango flavor that has helped to deliver a genuine punch of flavor from the very start of the vape here. \r\n\r\nFA Juicy Strawberry Has delivered the nearest to perfect pairing with this mango and really dances beautifully in this.\r\n\r\nVTA - Pear Halves is used lightly as a delicate touch to offer a syrupyness that assists really well with the texture of the fruits and adds that syrupy coating on the Popsicle as it melts in your mouth. \r\n\r\nVTA Sugar Cane assists with the balance of authentic fruit sweetness. \r\n\r\nINW Mint Mix - This was a difficult little one to tame. It was necessary though as this is what gives this profile the freshness and slight cool yet amazing real feel of this. \r\n\r\nA lot of care to find the right yogurt was taken and for those creamy smooth notes of the Capella I couldn't go past it when paired with the WF Frozen Yogurt the balance is on point. \r\n\r\nThe magic here is \"The LICK\", from the fresh amazing mouthfeel of the fruits down to that lick of the stick this is a recipe I am proud to suggest to you to \"Lick This !\" \r\n\r\nI enjoy this at 65w on My Hellvape Rebirth RDA with a SST Fused clapton reading at 0.15 3mm 6 wraps \r\n\r\nLet' me know what you thought of this, I'm sure this will be one to enjoy for a long time :) \r\n\r\nLearn more about mixing here:\r\n\r\nfacebook - https://www.facebook.com/groups/diydownunder/\r\nDiscord - https://discord.gg/kH4Fqbc\r\nYoutube - https://www.youtube.com/c/diydownunder\r\nWebsite - https://www.diydownunder.com/\r\nInstagram ?

      "text": "A Wonderful mango vape for the summer days. So refreshing and full of flavour. I get a very forward mango taste, with a light juicyness of the strawberry. And I does actual taste like when you lick a popsicle from the bottom to the top ü§§ I don‚Äôt get any seperation of the mango and the strawberry. The mix mint does a perfect job both making it cool but also giving it a refresher minty vibe, like if there where a tiny bit of Crushed mint leaves in here. I don‚Äôt get much cream, but I get a lot of mouthfeel. This is a great Vape if you are into mango Vape‚Äôs and need something refreshing in the hot days. Definitely gonna mix a bigger batch of this!üëèüåûüëç"
