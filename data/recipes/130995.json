  "name": "Irish Cream Soda",
  "description": "This is my recipe for Daytime Frank's holiday special.  This was modeled after a specialty soda that I found in the grocery store for the holidays.  As soon as I drank it, I knew that I wanted to try and recreate it into a vape while it was still fresh on my taste buds.  It tasted like mixing a good cream soda with a shot of Irish cream, even though it was not alcoholic.  I was picking up hints of rum in the soda, which is why I added a tiny bit of LA-Butter Rum.  It intermingles beautifully with the FW-Cream Soda and TPA-Irish Cream.  The DFS-Holy Vanilla helps round out the vanilla notes in the FW-Cream Soda.  Even better, it is a fairly simple recipe by my standards.  I created this as a SNV, so I cannot say how well it will hold up to a long steep just yet.  It is not really fizzy but the soda itself was not either, so it works for this.  \r\n\r\n**The DFS Holy Vanilla is a must have if you want it to taste authentic IMO.  You can try to sub it out if you would like but it is the vanilla that most closely resembled the actual beverage.**",
