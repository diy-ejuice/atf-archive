            "text": "It's what she said it is, \u201cLight chocolate coffee (imagine chocolate milk with a hint of coffee) with hints of graham, vanilla, and marshmallow.\" I have to say I\u2019m also getting a touch of caramel that isn\u2019t in the description and should be for as prominent as it is, but I\u2019m not really going to complain about that. Just a hint of coffee, and no yucky coffee off notes. A little light in flavor - I mix Rin\u2019s recipes as written and despite the low-doses of ingredients I almost always find them plenty flavorful. But this one is a little light. Notes say she likes chocolate on the lighter side and suggests bumping that up if you want more, so that\u2019s forgiven. Next time I\u2019ll do that, hopefully it will still be balanced enough that it doesn\u2019t drown out the graham, marshmallow, vanilla, and coffee because those are nice little accents. But if it does a little, I\u2019m sure it will still taste good. VT Chocolate Mousse is a really nice flavor.  &#xD;\n"
