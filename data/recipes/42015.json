  "description": "https://youtu.be/ihv1nqSKAAQ Check out my video where I go into depth about my journey well chasing this flavor I am very close still tweaking each week but this is the best so far you will not be let down with this one IMO. Please comment if you mix it also feel free to check out my work on elr whatever I make a video on is what I consider close to finished and worth mixing.  My name on elr is convenient vaping as well. CAPS V2 can be subbed for the lemon meringue pie as well. Also I like JF lemon juicy instead of CAP but the majority I let try it liked CAP better so that's what I went with either one works I just use 2% instead of 3% with JF. This recipe was adapted from the original remix of dinner lady on ELR",

I didn't have Vanella whipped cream by CAP, so I replaced it with Vanilla ice cream by CAP. It worked out very well. I've mixed a couple of Lemon tart recipes and all of them couldn't bring out the lemon. This one is excellent. Great job pierceshawn! "
