  "description": "Toasted Coconut, Mixed Nuts, Sweet Brown Sugar, Toffee Undertones\r\n\r\nA remix, with tobacco added.\r\n\r\nThis is the basic description of the commercial juice this is inspired by. I went on a business trip and did not take enough juice for the entire week. I wound up checking for a B&M but the only things near the hotel in that part of upstate NY sold their own house juices so I picked the one that looked more professional. This juice of theirs was the only one that resonated with me so I did their special for the day of 3x30 for 30$ From the minute I tasted it to the end of the third bottle all I could think was DAMMIT THIS NEEDS TOBACCO.\r\n\r\nI went about this a bit different from my normal approach which is to get my tobacco profile and build on it. I went with an established profile, got as close to it as I wanted to adjusting for my tastes and added the tobacco. This is a darker rich profile, I wanted to keep in that vain keeping it rich and dark. I do not know that this is ADV material. But it is really good for me, I have been vaping this in the evenings. \r\n\r\n",

The flavor is great, and I will be mixing it again. The nutty flavors play well with the toffee and caramel, especially when layered over the tobacco notes given by cured and native. Definitely try it out!"
