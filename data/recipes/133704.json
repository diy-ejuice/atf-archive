  "description": "CAP 27 Bears - Been really enjoying this flavor in different gummy flavors. Brings a bright gummy that isn't plastic tasting like some gummy flavors I've tried. Believe it tastes fully authentic.\r\n\r\nCAP 27 Fish - Bringing more gummy to the table while bolstering the red flavor of the juice. Also another gummy I think tastes completely realistic to the title.\r\n\r\nRF Strawberry - Is the power house of the two strawberries used in the recipe. brings a jammy/candy strawberry flavor.\r\n\r\nCAP Sweet Strawberry - Rounds out the strawberry jam/candy portion of the recipe.\r\n\r\nCAP Super Sweet - Felt it was needed to hype the flavors and bring on the brightness needed to do the original juice justice. Tried CAP SS all the way up to 3%, didn't add anything special that I was looking for, so just used to bring out the strawberry candy and hype the gummy.\r\n\r\nPreferred Shake and Vape. Tested in the Falcon Mesh Tank.",
