  "description": "It's a Cigar, with vanilla and a hint of Mango.\r\n\r\nThe goal here was to make a vanilla mango cigar that did not smack of \"bottom of the display blunts\" I wanted a solid mid-grade Caribbean type tobacco note. I think I did well, let me know your thoughts :)\r\n\r\nFlavorah has done a superb job with their tobacco concentrates. IMO they raised the bar for tobacco concentrates and blurred the lines between NETs and imitations bringing a level of realism to the ersatz that boggles the mind.\r\n\r\nFLV Cured - I have many times mentioned that this flavor is a \"Generic cigarish tobacco\" It is a really good base that is easy to bend into cigar or pipe. It does not lend well to cigarette outside of some fringe ROY bulks. Anyways here it is used as a base to build a cigar from.\r\n\r\nFLV Connecticut Shade - If you have heard me talk about FLV much you have heard me say that this is a really good cigar wrapper leaf flavor. It has some really cool \"offnotes\" hints of coffee, chocolate, maybe a little spice(anise). It is a great building block for a cigar. Used here to lend a little more complexity to the profile. But mainly to bring hints of Caribbean tobacco to the table.\r\n\r\nFLV Kentucky Blend - An interesting one. Another generic tobacco with hint of ash and a hint of smoke. Great for a cigarette type and also to lend a \"smoking\" to any tobacco blend.\r\n\r\nFLV Virginia - A specific sweet virginia feel concentrate with the spicy \"tongue bite\" notes that accompany many Virginias. Used here to boost sweet and cut some of the dark from Kentucky Blend. But also for it's spicy notes to blend with the \"mid-grade cigar\" profile.\r\n\r\nFLV Mango - Because Mango all the things, all the time. Used low here in relation to the strength of the profile. I just want a mango note to pop out here and there. This will change according to your airflow and power.\r\n\r\nINW Sisha Vanilla - Because Vanilla all the things all the time. And also because FLV does not have a straight vanilla. I am using this specific vanilla for it's three characteristics and it's ability to stay present against a strong profile. It brings of course vanilla, a cream note to help lend a little more body and finally adds some more sweet without being cloying.\r\n\r\nI shake and vape this, to be perfectly honest I have not had a bottle last over two weeks. It does change a little bit, tobacco gets more nuanced, vanilla comes forward a little more and the mango keeps playing in the background.\r\n\r\nEdit: I have since mixed multiple large batches of this to experience it on the long steep. IS GOOD! It stays a mid-grade cigarish tobacco with hints of vanilla and mango. :) This mix is also really good without the Mango! If you are a deep steeper or sensitive to the way INW Shisha Vanilla keeps getting stronKer, cut it by 25% to 50%. I personally dont have an issue with it but some people do.",

I had to wait for about a month for everything to arrive and when they did I was a little bit lazy to mix it up because i had already 10 different freshly mixed new liquids. I decided to mix it though and actually SNV literally. \"Oh-my-god!\" This is simply amazing and probably my new addiction - goes straight to the top of best DIY recipes/liquids! Cigar (a very nice one), little bit of ash (seriously, just enough to remind of an actual smoke), little bit of fruit for sweetness and juiciness and the vanilla totally in the background blending all the flavours together. Totally worth buying the flavours required even if it is just for this (even though Shisha Vanilla and Mango are pretty awesome flavours anyway).&#xD;\n&#xD;\nLove you fear!"

From here I started mixing my own tobaccos to try and find that strong dark tobacco profile that I like. This is a very smooth and balanced Tobacco! Its perfect for my 'In-between' vapes when I need a break from my fruit mixes. The mango does throw me off a little, but its still one of my 5 favorite Tobaccos."

Abuela's just so incredibly balanced in all aspects, it's an insanely smooth and flavorful vape. But something is clashing between the mango and tobaccos. It's sort of a musty soapy note that I can't quite shake and it ruins the ADV ability of the juice for me. First few drips/first tankful? delicious. 2nd or 3rd? straight must for me."

Tried a few RY4 recipes and enjoyed them, and after hearing ID10-T gush over this on Noted, I decided to nut up and buy the concentrates for this.  And I'm damn glad I did.  I used to enjoy a good cigar now and then, and this takes me back to that place...back when I was younger and didn't give a shit that buying a $20 stick might mean I had to skip a lunch or two at the end of the week.  I don't get a lot of mango, but I don't think that was the intention.  It's perfectly balanced to me, with the vanilla lending just enough creaminess.  Thanks for this recipe, you've made me want to see what I can do with these tobaccos now."
