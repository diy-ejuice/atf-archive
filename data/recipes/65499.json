  "description": "This to me is a nice light dessert type tobacco Flavor. The Ry4 can be harsh but when used in lower percentages work well here. The red burley gives off that well balanced tobacco flavor. The White Peach and Apricot works well with the Burly to make a nice hint of peach while not overpowering the tobacco. The vanilla swirl just adds a nice touch of creaminess to the recipe. Steep 3-10 days for best results.",

Straight off the bat i get a nice peach up front followed by the burley/tobacco but then for me it becomes too creamy and over powers it some what. Nice recipe but im going to tweek swirl down to 2% and burley to 1 % and see where it lands . Good recipe and well worth a try ."
