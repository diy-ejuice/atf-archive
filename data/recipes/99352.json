    "description": "So, I got in the mood fairly recently for a savory vape, nothing too sweet. It's odd, I know. I love the taste of WF Croissant so I decided to take it and see where it went. This is a fresh baked Croissant with a little complexity of almond and honey. \r\n\r\nWF Croissant: This is the base of course. This is a great Croissant, that's all there is to it. You get a slightly dry, flaky pastry of this. I get a slight toasted note to it as well. \r\n\r\nTPA Butter: What is a croissant without folds and folds of butter in the dough. This also adds a hint of moisture to the croissant, keep it less dry. \r\n\r\nFA Almond: The nuttiness plays very well with the dough. Its nots sweet, adds to the savoriness of the vape while adding a hint of complexity.\r\n\r\nFA Honey: Adds a HINT of of an inclination of sweetness. This is more of a light glazed, layered on just as the croissant leaves the oven. \r\n\r\nJF Biscuit: Added this down the road, I wanted to add more texture to the croissant, as well as add a tad more butter as well.

            "text": "A really nice and subtle vape this is, not quite like a real croissant yet though, it lacks a bit of the toasty flakiness in my opinion. I suggest you try adding about 0.25% of Breakfast (SA). I did also add 0.1% Super Sweet (PUR) for the glazing to reach its full potential for my taste buds. &#xD;\nChapeau to you SlashaLO, this is not an easy profile to pursue."
