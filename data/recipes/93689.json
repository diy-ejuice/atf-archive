    "description": "Le petit-d\u00e9jeuner, french for the breakfast, is what I made for my darling wife when she asked me for something different, although it had to be another strawberry vape. \r\nThe profile is a piece of toast, slightly brown and crisp with a tiny bit of butter and a delightful layer of sweet strawberry jam. \r\nAs Breakfast from Solub Arome can be a bit too burnt tasting on it's own, it is tempered here by the yogurt, that's the secret in this recipe.\r\nMy wifie is a sweetie, so I added a ton of sweetener, that's how she likes it. \r\nOf course you can lower the Super Sweet or use CAP Super Sweet instead. \r\nYou can shake and vape this one, but a few days of rest practically always improves the overall flavor and the combination's potential can be attained. \r\n\r\nLet me know if you like it, I know she does... ;)\r\nHave yourselves a good morning, don't forget the coffee and enjoy,\r\nScrewdriver\r\n\r\nP.S.: If you like Jam Monster Strawberry, you might like this one too...",
