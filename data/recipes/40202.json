  "description": "I have been searching...and searching...for a ADV that can be equivalent to my YouGotEJuice's Sugar Cookie.  It has not been easy, I have mixed so many \"Sugar \r\nCookie\" recipes from others and recipes of my own and finally I think I may have started on to something that is similar if not better than.  (well...maybe not better than....we will see after steeping)  But I am vaping it 24 hours later and I'm going to mix some more so I can keep vaping and steep at the same time.  It is good, I would love to get your opinion.  I totally welcome constructive criticism, I am new to this and want to improve.  I know it takes much time to become masterful and I am willing and wanting to put in my time but to get something vapeable is so exciting.  I hate when people walk into something get a descent product and think they are all knowing......that is not me, I assure you, I am feeling hopeful though, that I have stumbled on something I can work with.  Love to all...Kitten",
