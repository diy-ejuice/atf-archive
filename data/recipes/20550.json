    "description": "TFA's peppermint is very strong-hence the low percentage. This needs to age at LEAST a week and It will blend in nicely with the VBIC. The Dbl Choc was added as an afterthought...... just because it seemed like it would work. And it works well!",

One of those recipes that you find weird at first, but appreciate more and more as you vape it. A chocolate peppermint milk with a slight hint of strawberries. Milk and vanilla flavors provide a rich base, chocolate is upfront, peppermint gives it a fun twist, and strawberries give it a friendly pink note. This already feels like something i would miss if not vaped for a while."
