  "description": "A deliciously creamy vanilla rice milk.\r\n\r\nI picked up OOO Rice milk on sale recently and, as all sales items usually end up, had zero hopes of it being any good. I went with my gut and mixed some complimentary pairings with it and OMG, did this turn to be a sublime, dare I say, ADV for my fickle palate. \r\n\r\nOOO Rice milk is described as sweet and creamy rice milk flavor and that is exactly what it is. An exceedingly creamy base with a fabulous mouth feel laced with a touch of light, cooked rice. The creaminess here is astounding = it is on par with the best creams out there and will be a perfect all rounder where cream is the base layer.\r\n\r\nI added a splash of cinnamon sugar and opted for CAP Cinnamon sugar as I wanted a delicate sweet cinnamon note and stayed clear of the other contenders. At 1% It lingers beautifully in the background and just adds a sprinkling of cinnamon. Feel free to up it a tad if you want more of a cinnamon forward note.\r\n\r\nFA Bourbon is the perfect vanilla here and adds a wonderful, bold, deep, rich & clean vanilla flavour to round this trio off to perfection.\r\n\r\nAfter 3 days this baby is ready to please and after 5, it will please you even more!\r\n\r\n ",

      "text": "I gave two stars because while I did not enjoy this mix it’s not horrible either. It is creamy and the cinnamon back note is nice. I also do not get rice at all from this. I believe the addition of  a small amount of something like FE sweet rice would cover the off note and add the rice note that’s missing. There is an off note for me that I suspect is the OOO rice milk. Thanks for sharing this recipe.  Here is a link to my review in which I failed to mention the possibility of fixing the off note that I am getting. &#xD;\nhttps://youtu.be/_u2UH1g_l48&#xD;\n"
