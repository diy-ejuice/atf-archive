    "description": "So, my favorite local donut shop has these little delights. Problem is I swear I'm cursed, and only get them once a month if I'm lucky. So, needed a stopgap measure. While it may need tweaking, this is pretty good, so why not.\r\n\r\nThought process here:\r\nZeppola and Glazed Donut: The donut in question here is a maple bar that is somewhere between a light and fluffy glazed donut and a more doughy donut, so splitting the difference. The WF Glazed Donut is exactly what it says on the tin, no Play-Doh taste.\r\nTorrone and sweetner: add some crunchy flaky sugar glaze, cos it literally falls off the damned donut while you eat it.\r\nMaple Bar: Lil more donut, and adds my frosting. I'd add syrup to get more maple, buuut...\r\nOoO Bacon: The other star of the show here. I originally wanted 3%, but it kinda needs a starring role. The maple flavoring in this should add nicely to the maple bar and punch that up.\r\nOnly other thing I might add in is like .5-1% cap buttercream frosting to punch that aspect up, but hell, i don't notice the frosting aspect when I eat these. just sweet, fluffy, sugary, maple BACON donut.",

            "text": "This is nowhere near as bad as I was afraid it could be. Most of these savory flavors are disgusting. This is a little bit McCormick's Bac'n Bits, like halfway between real bacon and fake bacon, but not anything grosser than that. It's nice and smokey and that goes really well with the maple frosting that it shares the top notes with. Donut base is solid. But something is missing. SALT. What makes those maple bacon donuts so great is that contrast between the salty bacon and sweet frosting. Brain can kind of fill in the salt with that smokey business, but this still makes me wish we had a straight-up salt flavor.  I got an idea from this, though. FLV Beer Nuts is quite salty, but not salty enough to get salt without getting nuts. OoO Bacon tastes like bacon without being gross but needs salt. Put them together.... add some more peanut butter, some bread, some banana... An Elvis sandwich vape is possible, even more possible than a perfect maple bacon donut."
