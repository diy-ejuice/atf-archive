    "description": "A deliciously delicious orange glazed cookie for the cookie lovers who crave a little departure from the plethora of stock standard cookies out 'there'... \r\n\r\nThis is a wonderfully rich orange glaze, generously spooned over a hot, oven baked cookie.\r\n\r\nThe Duck Sauce \r\nINW Shisha Orange has a fabulous sweet Valencia orange syrup profile and gets the nice bittery rind from the goodness of FW Blood orange, forming the base of this thick orange marmalade-type sauce. \r\nINW Marzipan provides the cushion for the glaze with it's unique and natural (bitter) almond profile counterbalanced by the morish sweetness typically found in Marzipan.\r\nLA CCI provides just the right amount tartness and stickyness to bring all the elements together to form a well balanced orange sauce.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe cookie\r\nI went for a tried and tested classic combo - CAP sugar cookie and INW Biscuit - the undisputed Kings of cookies. Period. This is the bed to receive lashings of warm duck sauce and does not detract from the star of the show.\r\n\r\nThe meringue acts as a bit of a springboard for the glaze and adds a touch of sweetness to the cookie - playing on both sides of the fence in this recipe.\r\n\r\nMix her up and dip her in your tea - you'll be back for more!\r\n\r\n7 to 10 day steep for the CCI is play nicely...\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
