  "description": "I made a couple of tweaks to my last iteration of this recipe, and this new version is much better.  First, I lowered the CAP Juicy Lemon and raised the INW Lemon.  INW Lemon is really my favorite straight lemon flavor, but the INW Juicy Lemon adds some juiciness.  Next, I dropped TPA Berry Mix in favor of INW Raspberry.  I was just recently smelled INW Raspberry and I really wanting to use it in a recipe.  I think it works really well alongside the Forest Fruit.  The last change I made was to add some TPA Sweet Cream on the suggestion of a redditor.  which added some sweetness to the cheesecake base.\r\n\r\nOverall I think the lemon pairs up with the sweet berries very well, adding a nice tartness, while the cheesecake is more distinct than the last iteration.  I'm really enjoying it after a 7 day steep.",
