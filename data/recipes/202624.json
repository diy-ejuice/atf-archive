    "description": "tl;dr - strawberry cream bakery profile.\r\n\r\nAdding #Developed Summer to this to get some public attention . . . check up on your friends and family who are in education (all the way from the administrators to the maintenance workers).  We're struggling to keep the bar raised educating the youth and trying to make sure everybody gets home healthy.\r\n\r\nNeed something to wash the bitter taste of wearing a mask for 8 hours teaching these little ones and the disgust at how their lives are being monetized out of my mouth.  I thought about going for a Lysol wipe flavor profile (because chemical lemon is definitely easy with DIY . . . and I'm wistfully looking at the bottom of my last canister of wipes after cleaning between classes for a week, knowing that the school system isn't supplying them, and the local stores are all sold out).  So, here's a strawberry cream bakery profile to distract me from the despair and gloom of modern teaching.  I'd like to see these \"in-person school during a pandemic\" decision makers come into my 4th grade class and teach a room full of kids (trying to be socially distant) with 12 others simultaneously on virtual (grappling with the technology learning curve), all while trying to monitor cleanliness and sanitation.  Heck, I'd like to see one of them come into a normal classroom setting and try to teach at all. ",
