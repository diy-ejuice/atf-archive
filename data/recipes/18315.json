Mix a bottle, thank yourself and ID10-T later!&#xD;\n&#xD;\n(2)Just had a buddy trade me a 30mL of this mix out of his personal batch, and wanted to say again how awesome this is!  The apple/cinnamon taste/texture combo here is addictive as heck, and this is definitely my favorite FA Fuji recipe."

The image chosen to represent this juice makes it look like it might be a bit dry but don't be fooled. It does have a nice apple filling that keeps you coming back for more. &#xD;\n"

Just enough punch without crossing into something distractingly strong. I've got to throw a bunch of heat at this to get over the sour note I get from CDS, but I'm inclined to think that is more my damage than a fault in the recipe."

      "text": "This is some good stuff! I love the fact that you were able to adapt my recipe into your own. You did an amazing job of adjusting certain flavors in Apple Buttah to allow this recipe to taste like a cookie that has apple butter mixed into the dough rather than a cookie with apple flavoring drizzled on top, if that makes sense. It's very buttery and soft just like advertised and the fuji plays well with the cookie element. There's just something about CAP Sugar Cookie that when added to bakery or dessert recipes just makes them that much better. Great job! Things I plan on trying with this recipe: increasing fuji since I really enjoy it and adding another cookie flavoring to see if I can get a bit more of a crunchy cookie taste. All in all, this is a fantastic recipe and I will be keeping this in rotation!"
