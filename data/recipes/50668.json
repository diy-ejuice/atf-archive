  "description": "This profile all started a while back when a friend mine asked me to make him an Apple pie with Ice cream e juice. I thought it sounded pretty simple so I threw some stuff together, it turned out ok and he loved it but I  knew it could be better, a lot better. So I played around with it (made it not better) Then I got back on track. I tried some things that I should have thought about in the beginning and I thought dam this is good but I know it can be better still. So I let Joe aka RAGEISALOTOFWORK try it and he really liked it. I told him I think it still needs work. So he vaped a 30ml and hit me with a couple of changes that took it over the top. I now believe that this recipe couldn't be any better. It nails the perfect balance of pie crust to pie filling and the cream sits right to the side like I wanted. I really know that if you dig this profile, you will definitely love this recipe. Mix it on up and let me know what you think. Thanks KRUCIAL (this recipe is also interesting when you compare it to the original /Apple Pie Allah also available on ATF\\ you can see the development of a recipe profile, see what changes were made and ascertain why)",
