    "description": "No rocket science here. Both these flavors, OOO Butter Pecan Ice Cream and WF Butterscotch Cream Pie are great standalone flavors for a recipe. They're incredible and authentic tasting flavors!! I thought by pairing them together it would make a great recipe and boy was I right! Everything is there... The creaminess and body of the butterscotch, the smoothness of the butter pecan ice cream, and a slight hint of caramel. I'm using TPA Caramel Candy as the bridge between the 2 flavors and it did the job. This is a wonderful and simple but complex tasting recipe. \r\n\r\nTry it out and give me your feedback!",
