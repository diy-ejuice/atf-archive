  "description": "ONLY FOR THE OLDER VERSION OF INW GOLD DUCAT!\r\n\r\nINW is changing their formulation for Gold Ducat.  Shame.  I've had this one locked up for a while longer than I should have.\r\n\r\nThe FA Caramel and TFA Brown Sugar are just added little bonuses for this recipe.  Leave them out if you prefer and enjoy a solid pipe tobacco taste with notes of honey and syrup.  Steep time based on your preference.  To me, its OK overnight, but it does get better after a week, two weeks, and so on.\r\n\r\nMore on INW formulation changes here: https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/61mszy/inw_leaked_reformulations/?st=j0rda07p&sh=c08555ad",

Turns out this sweet jalopy of a vape is amazing. Frankly, I think I have the newer Gold Ducat. I have no idea what the difference is, but I can say I would love to! Gold is a strangely sweet, thick interesting medium flavored vape. Compared to ry4 dessert style vapes, you are going to get an enjoyable amount of tobacco in your mouth. Think of a pancake: bold at the beginning turning into something sickly sweet without the regret and collapse of the structure associated with the breakfast staple.  Try this. Update: even better mtl."

To me, it's more on the sweet side than it is on the tobacco side, but still very enjoyable. &#xD;\n&#xD;\nI'm just hoping that the new formulation of Gold Ducat won't be a catastrophe and this recipe will still be usable without any substitutions or reformulation.&#xD;\n&#xD;\nUPDATE: As was recommended in the recipe, I've also tried this recipe without the caramel and brown sugar, and so far I've been enjoying it even more without. Otherwise the recipe IMO is too sweet for a pipe tobacco style recipe. I suggest trying both to see what works best for you. "
