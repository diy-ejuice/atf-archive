    "description": "**Derived from Sugar Cookies and Cream by @chrisdvr1. **\r\n\r\n*In your face vanilla cookies laden with butter and biscuity goodness. Props to chrisdvr for the sugar cookie base. I find his sugar cookies and cream to be irresistible but I am a vanilla junkie thus spawned this recipe.*\r\n\r\n**TPA Butter\/JF BIscuit\/CAP sugar cookie**\r\n\r\nmore or less taken from the original recipe, I use JF biscuit because I can't stand INW's version. (if you like INW and have it, use it instead)\r\n\r\n**FW Hazelnut**\r\nI brought this guy over from the original recipe because its a magical ingredient that lends creaminess to the vanilla's and adds a subtle nuttiness.\r\n\r\n**INW Shisha Vanilla\/DIYFS Holy Vanilla**\r\n\r\nMy two favorite vanilla flavors. Shisha is more earthy, sweet, slightly creamy. Holy vanilla is more floral, still sweet, very creamy and a deeper vanilla. The combo here provides a mouthful of vanilla that endlessly caresses your palette and makes you ask politely for more. These two work so well in all types of applications but here they flex their bakery muscles. (there's no subbing either of these flavors, seriously)\r\n\r\n**CAP yellow cake**\r\n\r\nHere to bridge everything together, you don't get cakey-ness here but it smooths everything else out and compliments vanilla very well, pulls it all together. (sub JF yellow cake same %, maybe FW yellow cake at .5%)\r\n \r\nshake and vape is great but give it 3 days for the vanilla and butter to settle in. hope y'all enjoy, will be posting many recipes with Holy Vanilla. If you enjoy vanilla please do yourself the favor and order Holy Vanilla, its too damn good.",

The Yellow Cake is a superb idea here Vin: it smoothes out everything beautifully. I also added .75% Flv Cookie Dough in another mix and it works wonders. You can't go wrong with the solid cookie\/ butter\/ cake base in this recipe. Excellent job man! Not suprised people sing your praises on the electronic cigarette subreddit."
