  "description": " love just jam and wanted to create something based on that profile - and I am really pleased with this. On the inhale you get a sweet buttery jam that finishes with a toasted warm note .\r\nTested on a reload RDA with a .16 ohm alien at 76 watts\r\n\r\nThanks to fresh03 for the suggestion of OOO strawberry jam as this is a truly the best strawberry jam available and really needs very little help. it is a full sweet well balanced jammy strawberry\r\n\r\nRF strawberry jam and toast does the heavy lifting for this mix and provides a bright top strawberry with a toasted note that is a bit light\r\n\r\nThe combination of biscuit and breakfast add the warm dark toasted note that that is noticed at the finish . The SA breakfast is VERY predominate off of the shake but give it a week to 12 days to settle in and it is spot on.\r\n\r\nVT butter base is spot on fresh creamy sweet butter and just blends into the strawberry and fill in the middle of this mix\r\n\r\nCap supper sweet at .05 gets the strawberry to pop out on the inhale a bit which I like\r\n",
