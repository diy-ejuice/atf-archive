    "description": "An Apple pie containing mostly Silverline Capella.\r\n\r\n(Capella) Whipped Marshmallow: Gives mouth feel and body to the recipe.\r\n\r\n(One On One) Apple Granny Smith: It adds sweetness and its the key ingredient in this vape, its very juicy.\r\n\r\n(Capella) Cinnamon Sugar: adds spicy notes.\r\n\r\n(Capella) Biscuit: gives the apple pie its crust.\r\n\r\n(Capella) Butter Pecan: this is in the recipe to give a little hint of nuts on top.\r\n\r\nTo me this is sweet as it is, but you can always add a sweetner if you like.\r\n\r\nTested 12 November 2017\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nRight of the bat it taste like a spicy apple with hints of nuts, cant taste the pie part yet, but i believe it will come thro with steeping, i'll keep u guys updated.\r\n\r\nI might need to tune the cinnamon down 2 drop in 10 ml was to much, might need only 2 drops in 30 ml. keep in mind cinnamon is always strong and can easily overpower a recipe.\r\n\r\nWhat I wanted to make was an apple pie, but it seems like I made a apple spice.",
