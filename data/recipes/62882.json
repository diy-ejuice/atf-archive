  "description": "Sometimes Park decides he's tired of vaping deserts and that he wants to do fruits instead. Most of the time they suck dick. This isn't one of those times. \r\n\r\nI present to you the Malibu Driver. A Malibu Driver is an alcoholic beverage insisting of two parts orange juice and one part Malibu rum. I have never had a MD before, but I do like me some good ol' vitamin C and Malibu gets along well with me on occasion, so it sounded like a pretty good cocktail. Why not put it in vape form?\r\n\r\nOrange Juice - CAP Sweet Tangerine, TPA Orange Cream and FA Mandarin: these three combine to make our orange juice base. The Orange Cream more or less tastes like rind ( as noted by @Vurve ) and is by far the most realistic so that flavor creates our base. Sweet Tangerine is a very vibrant and delicious orange flavor, just a tad too \"Orange Tic Tac\" at higher percentages. FA Mandarin helps blend the two together and almost adds some orange zest to further the realism. \r\n\r\nMalibu Rum - FA Coco', TPA Coconut Candy and FA Jamaican Rum: Jamaican Rum is the head honcho being that this is a rum recipe. At 3% it was a little too overpowering for me so I dropped it to 2% and have been digging it right there. FA Coco' to me tastes like coconut milk and is a very authentic coconut flavor. At 2%, it's strong enough to be present but still plays nicely with the rum. TPA Coconut Candy is VERY easy to fuck up with. At too high of a percentage it makes your juice taste like sun tan lotion, but at .5% it just helps to boost the coconut aspect a tad. \r\n\r\nKoolada is optional, no one likes a warm cocktail so it is suggested. I'm waiting on some WS-23 to arrive and maybe that would work well with this recipe also. \r\n\r\nSweetener is always subjective, but orange juice is slightly sweet as is Malibu, so .25% works well for me. Feel free to leave this out. \r\n\r\nAnd there you folks have it, a fruity (?) recipe that Parkus actually can vape on for more than a few minutes. Mix this up and let me know what you guys think. \r\n\r\nDeuces‚úåüèª",
