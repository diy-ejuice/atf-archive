  "description": "Creamy delicious caramel with hints of butterscotch and some graham crust underneath everything. \r\nButterscotch ripple and caramel are a match made in heaven that blend together so nicely. Obviously the main note here\r\nVIC and Vienna cream has been my go to for a cream layer. Words can’t describe how delicious they are together.\r\nCGC was thrown in to add to the cream layer and give the whole recipe something “solid” to sit on. I think It worked out just as that. \r\nGive this at least a week but it steeps like a custard, nice and slow and only better over time",
