  "description": "Ok Christmas time love it or hate it you still can't help getting into the spirit it's when the coffee house's especially start competing with each other. They love bringing us limited edition seasonal beverages so why should us vapers miss out?? Then fear not let me introduce to you gingerbread latte. Forget the hustle and bustle and relax,slip on them slippers light that fire and take a moment out.\r\nThis flavour really does relax you it's something a little different it's warming and relaxing and it did take some development to create that perfect coffee flavour that alot of us struggle to create especially with the coffee aromas we have to work with.\r\n\r\nNOTES\r\n\r\nBEFORE YOU CONTINUE THE COFFEE FLAVOUR IS JUNGLE FLAVORS CAPPUCCINO AND NOT FW CAPPUCCINO \r\n\r\nJF cappuccino \r\n\r\nThis flavour is perfect here it just works it's definitely not an in your face coffee it's alot more mellow and doesn't leave that lingering burnt aroma and taste often found with other flavourings. It's creamy malty present is something that fits the bill when wanting a latte. It's not a strong flavour and 4% works well for the Base without overpowering or allowing other flavours to mute it.\r\n\r\nCapella gingerbread \r\n\r\nCapella did a good job with this flavour it does get weird if you go to high but here it blends well and gives the coffee that ginger syrup we are looking for. It is basically a bakery but it disguises itself very well and mimmicks what it intended to. It's not over spicy and it takes on that seasonal aroma....perfect!!! \r\n\r\nFa creme fresh/ capella French vanilla \r\n\r\nThese 2 is the milk the latte in harmony they work together very well they make an excellent milky Base. You have the freshness of the cream and the French vanilla adds some additional creamer. \r\n\r\nTfa marshmallow \r\n\r\nWho doesn't like marshmallow imagine this is the froth the creamy part on top of the latte it finishes of the cream flavours perfectly and acts like a glue between the coffee and cream. \r\n\r\nTfa brown sugar \r\n\r\nIt's there for sophistication if you have a posh coffee you don't dump white sugar in it.\r\n\r\nMerry Christmas and enjoy xx",
