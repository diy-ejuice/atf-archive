  "description": "The pineapple guava combo is just pure lust.  On Lust Island they pour that sweet syrupy mix all over you and lick it off.  Adding a little smoothie action never hurt anyone.  Even a little prick(cactus) goes a long way here.  Once you try it, you'll never want to leave Lust Island.\r\n\r\nThis was a collaboration between @humanpuck and I.",

      "text": "It's tough to put my finger on exactly what this tastes like as it's such an eclectic mix. My closest comparison is probably a starburst candy smoothie. It's not overly sweet or tart, but it is a pretty tasty, creamy, tropical mix. Off the shake the individual fruits were more discernible, but after a two weeks steep they've melded together into a singular and mellow tropical flavor. The addition of coolant is probably extraneous as this is a more luscious than it is refreshing and I didn't feel it did much for the mix, but it didn't hurt it either. However, I decided to pull that thread and add a drop of CAP SS to the last 15ml, and it only served to muddle and mute the already mellow flavor. So don't add sweetener to this, not that it terribly needs it anyway. Overall, this is a very unique and interesting vape and certainly worth a try, but not something I'd consider an ADV. I also feel it's best vaped within the first week, before the fruits get buried beneath all the yoghurt. "
