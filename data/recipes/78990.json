  "description": "After getting LB White Chocolate Peppermint and really liking it. I got an idea from tartarusspawn on ELR. Add some coconut to it. I had Purilum Toasted Coconut Cheesecake, which I like as well. So I figured what the hell and starting playing around. I am still working on the right balance of percentages, but I am really liking it so far.\r\n\r\nThe front is definitely peppermint. Ending with a slight coconutty finish.\r\nI added CAP Sweet Cream and TPA Whipped Cream for a more creamy taste and more body.\r\nTPA Graham Cracker Clear to boost the cheesecake graham. (This percentage still needs tweaking)\r\nJust a touch of FA Almond to accent the nut in Coconut.\r\nWS-23 30% to boost the cooling of the Peppermint.\r\nCAP Super Sweet at 0.50% to sweeten it up. You could go up or down on the percentage to fit your taste.\r\n\r\nIn the end the percentages on the Peppermint, Coconut, and Graham flavors need tweaking, but as is I am enjoying it.",
