  "name": "Choco-graham ice cream",
  "description": "Tastes like a moonpie ice cream sandwich but you replaced the marshmallow with vanilla ice cream.\r\n\r\nI threw this together for my husband's pod and it actually came out pretty well. The chocolate isnt quite as pronounced and the graham just kind of makes the ice cream seem like they used a heavier cream but it's tasty either way.\r\n\r\nFor him I used some of the precious lb lava cake v1  but I can see v2 working in it's place because its just to bend the graham a bit into a chocolate graham direction.",
