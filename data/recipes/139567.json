  "description": "A simple 3 ingredient pistachio ice cream, not too thick, heavy, and sweet like most of the commercial ones. I chose FW Vbic because I like the bright vanilla and good but not overbearing cream flavor. And used HS cream just to add a touch of heavy cream, I suppose FLV cream would work also. ",

Keeping HS Cream low gave this a very nice mouthfeel, while not getting too buttery. Not overly complicating the creams let the pistachio shine and be the main focus. Great job!!"
