    "description": "VT-Bilberry Ripe-(1%)-The minute I smelled this one I knew this was it!! I used this to boost the \"blueness\" in the recipe.\r\n\r\nTPA-Blackberry-(0.15%)-****Be careful with this one do not over use it is very potent** **I used the Blackberry as the main blue note because I pick up some florals out of it ,which sings with the hibiscus beautifully. (The blackberry has a tendency to stick to whatever you put it on)\r\n\r\nTPA-Hibiscus-(1.5%)-Big Shout out to Edible Malfunction for pointing me toward this hibiscus and away from FLV, compared to how the FLV was making this mix taste like i was eating the stem with everything this work a lot better but can be perfumery at high %(Not Saying FLV is bad but for this mix for me it just didnt work)\r\n\r\n(Removed 10\/6\/19 because of fading) LA-Lemonade-(2.25%)-This is my Lemonade base to provide that tartness I need to counter all the sweetness in this recipe.\r\nFLV Lemonade-(2%)- As a replacement for the LA Lemonade I kept having fading issues with it this also bring some juiciness to the mix \r\n\r\nCAP-Hibiscus-(1%)-Serves dual functions as an accent to the TPA hibiscus and an emulsifier to help everything blend.\r\n\r\nTPA-Strawberry Ripe-(1%)-helps make everything pop and bring some sweetness to the party.\r\n\r\nVT Yellow  Passion Fruit-(0.25%)- to give it more of a tropical body (did experiment with FLV Boysenberry, FA Passion Fruit , VT Passion Fruit and FLV Passionfruit)  Felt like this one fit the best and joined with the florals,\r\n\r\nFWIW I feel like this capture the drink perfectly if there is anything u guys think i can sub to make it better etc. please lmk =]\r\n\r\nI used  1 drop cap super sweet per 30 ml you can add WS-23 to your liking hope you enjoy as much as I did working on it then finally getting it the way i wanted\r\n\r\nStarbucks Drink Inspiration- https:\/\/www.starbucks.com\/menu\/drinks\/refreshers\/very-berry-hibiscus-lemonade-starbucks-refreshers-beverage",
