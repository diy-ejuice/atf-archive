  "name": "SaturDIY: S&V Tobacco Leaf and Coffee Custard",
  "description": "Mixed live for Fresh's 6/9 show.  The design brief was \"Not a Dessert\" and someone named dropped a Tobacco Leaf and Coffee Custard.  This is an attempt at that profile.\r\n\r\nThe custard base is straight stolen from the beautiful @EdibleMalfunction.  His S&V custard base is pretty tight, yo.  No need to reinvent the wheel when you can just plagiarize?\r\n\r\nAnd the tobacco/coffee.  You know what's a non-awful coffee flavor? Half of FLV Connecticut Shade.  Plus, it has some cool cigar wrapper type of cocoa notes.  Strong stuff, and a bit hard to use as the only tobacco in a recipe.  It's filled out with some FLV Cured, because it's one of the leafier straight ahead FLV Tobaccos.\r\n\r\nMy hot take: This is pretty solid. Since it's a S&V custard base with FLV Tobaccos it actually works surprisingly well off a shake.   I'm digging this.  Should follow the same general rule as other FLV tobaccos though, so it'll probably die down after 3 days and come back in a couple weeks.",

Most of my tobacco mixes that I used Connecticut Shade in absolutely destroyed my wicks so I assumed it was the cause of it, but this one didnâ€™t cotton was still whiteish after vaping 30MLs. I forget who you said you stole the custard base from, but it is super good and pretty rich off the shake. Look forward to trying one of your future recipes in MIXERS CLUB if you ever decide to join us again ðŸ˜‚ "
