  "description": "Kahlua Coffee-flavored liqueur is made with the finest 100% Arabica coffee beans. These quality beans  are then mixed with sugar cane rum, vanilla bean, and notes of caramel.\r\nThey combine perfectly to make an easy-sipping liqueur.\r\n\r\nDelicious description so i decided to serve it over a sweet melted vanilla ice cream. Enjoy!\r\n\r\nTook VTA Coffee Liqueur up to 8% to make it as thick as possible and added 2% VTA Light Rum to give an extra kick of booziness and rum flavour.\r\nLight rum also has a nice caramelic note that plays wonderfully in the mix.",

      "text": "Really digging this recipe.  I originally mixed this with what I thought was VT Light Rum and it was fucking terrible... like scorched cotton terrible.  Then I realized my bottle labeled \"VT Rum\" was actually \"Golden Rum.\"  Eventually I ordered the correct one and remade it and its great. Especially after a steep, gets better and better.  I haven't played with Coffee Liquor enough but this tastes like the dominant flavor by far.  Interested to try different variations on this but this is a great recipe for this type of profile."
