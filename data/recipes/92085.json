  "name": "Golden \"Honey Sesame  Custard Crème\"",
  "description": "Honey sesame custard crème = Golden\r\n\r\nDon't feel like you have to buy all these expensive ingredients. I put out recipes because I want you to have some delicious reference points when you are looking for uses of these flavors not to push an agenda or a brand just to put out delicious Vape juice recipes that you can mix or use for a reference. Enjoy!!\r\n\r\n\r\nFlavor notes.\r\n\r\nNow I was shooting for a honey and butterscotch drizzled nut custard creme. It turned into more of a honey sesame custard crème. Even at .25% sesame sweets by inw really shines. I think the .25% of marzipan by inw boosts the sesame sweets  because I am surprised at how prominent the sesame note is and I am not mad about it because it tastes really good to me. Its a good vape its outside the box but in a good way. For my honey/butterscotch drizzle I used a combination of fa honey at .25% and fa butterscotch at .50%. This sweet honey/butterscotch drizzle combination is \"golden\" lol. Seriously its a good honey combination and good honey combinations can be hard to come by. Now the butter pecan kind of gets lost in the mix. I am not sure if it is necessary in completing this delicious custard crème but I am sure I used it. I just can't puck up the butter pecan maybe you can?? What I do get is a rather delicious crème brulee with a sesame sweet candy crust drizzled with honey/butterscotch. Now for my custard/crème brulee I used inawera custard at 3% and crème brulee at 1.5% thus is a simple custard/creme brulee combination it just works. I didn't try it with 3% capella vanilla custard v1 in place of the inawera custard because I was out at the to!e I made this recipe but I would imagine that custard/crème combination would be really good too maybe even better I am a bit partial to capella vanilla custard v1. Now I know this dessert probably doesn't exist but I can assure you that if it did I would eat it up!!! I really am enjoying this custard/crème brulee recipe hopefully you all enjoy it as much as I do??GOLDENp time: Now don't let the use of inawera custard fool you this is a steeper!! This recipe needs a good steep! In my opinion it really starts to come into its own after a 14 day steep. You may get by with a 7 day steep but I didn't try this recipe until after 14 days+. All I know is i really like this recipe its \"GOLDEN\"\r\n\r\nSweetener: I used .25% Flavorah sweetness but feel free to use or don't use a sweetener of your choice. This maybe a recipe that is substantially better with the use of sweetener. I don't know that for sure because I only made it with sweetener but from my exspieriance  these ingredients may taste significantly better with sweetener.",
