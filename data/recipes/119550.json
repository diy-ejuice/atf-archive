  "description": "A straight up morning starter - Caramel Latte.\r\n\r\nThis kind of needs a long time to steep. I tried it after two weeks and it almost tasted like it had a tobacco in it. I tried it again after one month and two months, and there wasnâ€™t much change. So I put it back on the shelf. After three months, I was not hopeful at all, but it was actually really nice.  You could use more caramel, but it does kill the coils a bit, so I tend to use it sparingly. \r\n\r\nDefinitely DO NOT shake and vape.\r\n\r\nEnjoy",
