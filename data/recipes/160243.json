  "description": "Trying different vanilla/custard bases, I stumbled into this mix which I find specially suggestive.\r\nThe Custard base is smooth and rich, and the tobacco notes are well defined and don't get muddled up.\r\n(INW) Custard takes the reign for me (sorry FA Custard Premium!), (DFS) Holy Vanilla and (INW) Shisha Vanilla back it up.\r\n- for a really intense vanilla (as commercial VCTs, pump (INW) Custard to 2.5%)\r\n(FLV) Native Tobacco and (FLV) Kentucky Blend make a dry, leafy tobacco.\r\n (FA) Black Fire puts some smoke in, without the ash and not being too prominent.\r\nDoesn't need much steep, a few days and rip away!\r\n(Black Sabbath's \"Master of Reality\" released July 21, 1971: as a tribute to one of the greatest albums of all time,  for the name of the first song seemed too relevant to this mix. Sorry, no terpenes in the mix!)\r\nhttps://www.facebook.com/BlackSabbath/posts/10156689298094615",
