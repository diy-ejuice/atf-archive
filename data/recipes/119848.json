  "description": "One of my favorite desserts growing up has always been that green bowl of fluff.  I had no idea what it was actually called until I got older and went in search of the recipe.  As soon as I smelled the bottle of TPA-Pistachio it took me back and I knew exactly what I wanted to recreate.  I used the TPA-Pistachio along with FLV-Vanilla Pudding to create my pistachio pudding base.  Then I used the OOO-Cream Milky Undertone along with the OOO Marshmallow (Vanilla) to add in the whipped topping and marshmallows.  Naturally I had to throw in a bit of INW-Pineapple to keep it authentic.  I am still going to try one more version with FLV-Pineapple instead of INW and a bit of FW-Butter Pecan. If I like it even more I will come back and update this.  This is better after 3 days but the best flavor is before the 2-3 week mark IMO.  Some of the nuances start to blend in together if it steeps for too long.  Smaller batches would be better for this one.  ",

      "text": "If you try this directly after mixing, it's delicious but the pineapple dominates the mix. After three days of impatiently waiting, it calms down and this recipe becomes an insanely accurate recreation of the dessert that we all love and do not know the name of. This recipe contains one of the best uses of Cream/Milky Undertones I have come across for adding a dairy undertone without standing out at all. OOO Marshmallow is perfect for adding little marshmallows throughout the whipped pudding dessert. After waiting the required steep time, the INW Pineapple is just enough to remind you that it's in the salad without bullying anything else in the mix. At 4% TPA Pistachio is the leading role with an artificial pistachio Jello pudding flavor, and it pairs incredibly well with FLV Vanilla Pudding. If you enjoy the real thing at family gatherings or on lonely Wednesday nights, mix this up for a nostalgia enriched vape that won't disappoint. "
