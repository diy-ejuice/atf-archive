  "description": "This is somewhat of a departure from what a normally mix up, but don't pass up on it! In Hawaii they make these awesome snowcones that make you want to come back more than the beaches and waves.\r\n\r\nThis is a mix that will be full of in-your-face-flavor so keep that in mind before ordering/mixing.\r\n\r\nSubbing the watermelon or strawberry with a different brand will unfortunately not work here. LA Watermelon and INW Strawberry are sorta niche ingredients that are quite different than other brands that share the same name. Feel free to sub CAP Coconut with 1% Coconut Extra (TFA) or whatever coconut you like. I also like to add 1% MF Vanilla to this, so try it out if you get the chance (or any vanilla really)\r\n\r\nI recommend that you get the 'colorless' version of LA Watermelon, available at Wizards Labs and other vendors, so your coils won't gunk up as fast.\r\n\r\nCertified Shake 'n' Vape, better with time.",
