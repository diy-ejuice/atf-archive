  "description": "My take on Downside.. one of my favorite blueberry yogurt vapes. I'm fairly certain FW yogurt and FW blueberry are used in the original. a mix of the two is pretty close.. I'm constantly playing with this profile and trying different things, but no matter what it's always a great ADV-worthy mix that's fairly hard to screw up. They must have something else that adds a very crisp, very fresh taste to the downside that i'm not quite sure but again to me this is extremely close to The Downside by The Schwartz. critiques and tips are very welcomed as i'm an occasional dabbler in mixing but definately no expert, so help is always much appreciated (: have a great holiday!",
