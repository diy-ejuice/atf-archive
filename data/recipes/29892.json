  "name": "Condensed Lemon Milk",
  "description": "All ingredients of this recipe attribute to making a thick, lemon tasting -almost- condensed milk mouthfeel.\r\nThe sickly sweet nature of the CAP Juicy Lemon, blends with the accent notes of FA Lemon Sicily to provide our lemon taste.\r\nSweet Cream, VBIC and the Meringue provide everything needed for this thick viscous mouthfeel which is definately needed for this kind of target flavor, but the thing that keeps everything together, playing the middleman between the accent and base notes is the FA Torrone. In this mix the nuttiness blends with the base making it milkier while at the same time, it adds to the top of the accents.\r\nI am pretty sure the end result will be deficient without it.\r\n\r\nDue to the layers in this recipe, this needs a minimum of 3 weeks to blend properly. It's pleasant surely in the meantime, but the thick end result needs these 20+ days.\r\nFinally, the 70/30 ratio also adds to the thickness intended.\r\n\r\nEnjoy.",
