  "description": "\"Your task for this month is to make whatever you want, but then pick an additional flavor that typically wouldnâ€™t go with what your base recipe is. \"\r\nThis was my mission and I chose to accept it.\r\n\r\nAs a kid my mom used to make me rose milk all the time.  Its a great little Indian version of Nesquik syrup.  I've really enjoyed my Kheer recipe, but I've also really enjoyed my smoothie recipes which are basically lassi's.  So I decided to go all pen pineapple apple pen and UNGH Rose Kheer Lassi.  This is basically my Indian version of bubble tea, don't @ me.\r\n\r\nFor those that do not know kheer is an Indian dessert that is a rice pudding.  Generally consisting of rice, milk, cardamom, almond and pistachio.  I decided to use the first 3 ingredients.  My go to for rice was always FE Sweet Rice, but I decided to switch it up and give the VT Thai Sticky Rice a shot.  I gives you a nice sweet cooked rice flavor for the kheer base.  The cardamom was easy, its always FA Cardamom.  Next up we need the milk this is where the VT Peach Yoghurt comes into play.  I don't get much peach from it at all and I get no yoghurt, but what I do get is a rose like flavor with some nice milky creaminess.  When told @Zany I was combining VT Peach Yoghurt with Thai Sticky Rice he called me a monster, so that's how I knew I was on the right track for my mission.   I added the VT Glazed strawberries for some added pink syrupiness, but its not strong enough to turn the rose flavor into a strawberry.  The FLV cream rounds the cream base out.  I wanted to add a touch of tart which is where the MB Greek Yogurt comes into play, its not quite as tart as I want it, but I'll get there.",
