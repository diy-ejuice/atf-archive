  "description": "This is one of those that I made, tried and didn't like,  then left alone for 5 weeks and tried again, and it was WONDERFUL! Best banana bread recipe I have tried yet. Then again, with TFA Banana Nut Bread it's really hard to go wrong. \r\nTFA Banana Nut Bread : obviously the star of the show. Such a great flavor, only needs a little help. \r\nFA Cookie: to fill out the sweet \"baked\" flavor \r\nTPA Butter: because butter\r\nFA Meringue: for a sweet hint of frosting\r\nFA Hazelnut to add to the nuttiness\r\nand finally the flavor that has to steep in to be good...\r\nCAP Cinnamon Danish Swirl V2: this is for a hint of cinnamon, however after the shake it is still a bit overpowering imo. however, after a few weeks it works great!\r\nDefinitely recommend letting this one steep a bit, not exactly sure how long is best. Gonna say to start at 2 weeks and go from there. ",
