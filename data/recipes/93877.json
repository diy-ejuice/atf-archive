  "description": "YUP i went there and tried to capture that mythical Chocolate and Cream filled Egg that only comes out once a year . In doing some research for this mix I found out that the cream filling of the the egg is actually a liquid fondant which is just sugar, water and corn syrup - (what a let down - who knew )\r\n\r\nThe shell I used hangsen Australian chocolate , VT dark chocolate and VT chocolate mousse together to create a creamy chocolate that I am after. Hagsen Chocolate is a  great  semi sweet chocolate when used low - but  leans to the dark  chalky chocolate if used much above 1% So I balanced that out a bit with the mousse to create the creaminess and the dark chocolate  bring the chocolate forward   the VT white chiclate is used for smooth creamy mouth feel for the chocolate \r\n    \r\n\r\nThe filling i used FLV frosting which is a strong  forward sweet butter cream with white chocolate that creates the main base of the thick vanilla creamy texture I am after -  The Marshmallow and golden syrup create that sticky texture I am wanted \r\nThe super sweet is added to bring that over the top sweetness - but it is not needed\r\nThis is a high wattage  flavor profile ",
