  "description": "This is an easy banana cheesecake with a light sprinkle of coconut.\r\n\r\nINW Yes, We Cheesecake/FW Yogurt: All the credit here goes to DIYorDIE. He created such an amazingly simple and authentic cheesecake base, who was I not to use it. \r\n\r\nTPA Banana Cream: This flavor doesn't lend to much to cream in my opinion, but it has one of the best banana flavors out there. I didn't want anything too nutty so this seemed like the best/only option for what I was going for.\r\n\r\nTPA Coconut Candy: I can't imagine a banana cheesecake with out a touch, just a touch, of coconut flavor. While there are plenty of good coconut flavorings out there, I find this one lends a helping hand to the banana while also providing that smidgen of coconut flavor that I was aiming for. Subtle, as I imagined.\r\n\r\nFA Cookie: Crust. What is a cheesecake or a pie without a crust, right? Some will argue that there are better concentrates to emulate a crust out there, but this one has a FEEL that others don't. I chose this flavoring for that reason alone. I'm glad I did.\r\n\r\n",
