    "description": "INW Biscuit(1-1.25): what else is there to say about this popular cookie flavor...it's BUTTERY AF and it's here as the base of the recipe!?!?\r\n\r\nFLV Butterscotch (1%) & FLV Caramel (1%): these two flavorings together are BANGIN'! A delicious caramel and Flavorah's version of butterscotch because of its well-renowned background cookie note are used here to add mouthfeel to the cookie base.\r\n\r\nFLV Vanilla Custard (4%) & FLV Milk & Honey (0.5-1%):  the custard at the top end of the suggested percentage begins to exhibit nuttiness and the M&H (I like this better at 0.5%) brings a sort of dark sweetness (while retaining softness) to the mix (for which I did not want to simply just use TFA Brown Sugar).\r\n\r\nTFA Acetyl Pyrazine (0.25-0.5%): lastly, I figured a touch (because I wanted to retain a softer texture) of graininess was in order for this flavor profile.\r\n\r\nOptional: if you prefer an almond-flavored cookie, as suggested by Wayne, adding FA Almond (0.5%) would lend a hand to the nutty notes of the custard while adding more sweetness to the mix...however, I feel that M&H does the job well enough (at least for the sweetness).  \r\n\r\nSpeaking of profile, ehm...a sweet, buttery, honey COOKIE with a hint of nuttiness? I have no idea what I just mixed but, it tastes good.  *-*shrugs*-*\r\n\r\nAll recipe and notes credit goes to Wayne (DIYORDIE) because he is my coach and inspiration...this one's for you!   \\m\/\r\n\r\nWarning: diketone-sensitive individuals mix at your own risk!   o.O\r\n\r\nPlease, mix this and feel free to share feedback...if you don't like it, I shan't QQ.\r\n\r\n",
