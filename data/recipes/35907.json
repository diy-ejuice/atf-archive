  "description": "So I was messing around with some flavors and came up with this. Wow does this taste so good right off the get go. \r\nThe FW Green apple brings a nice tart to the mix. Add in the cloud nine which also has some tart but also a very nice sweetness. Then I wanted this recipe to have some more fruit notes to it so I added some strawberry ripe which is my favorite strawberry, and then some strawberry sweet. Next I wanted to add some white peach as this flavor smells amazing and at .5% it adds a nice peach flavor without completly overpowering the mix. Then I added DFS Banana Cream this flavor is so good and so creamy. I love custards so much that I thought with this fruit blend that FA Custard would be perfect. It has a great custard flavor with a nice lemon back note to it to really make it stand out. Then I added to me the heavenly Shisha vanilla. It's adds such a magical sweet finish to this recipe making it truly blissful. When I think of My version of bliss it's sitting on a tropical island sipping on a nice ilsland drink. Hence the name Blissful Dreams. To me this mix is just that a dream in a bottle where I can escape reality and live in my own paradise. ",
