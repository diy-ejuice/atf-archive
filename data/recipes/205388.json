  "description": "tiramisuuuuuu\r\n\r\nGot Cap CDS, wf angel cake and fw yellow cake as my base for this delectable dessert. Cap cds at 3% was just SLIGHTLY unbalanced and cinnamon foward over coffee so i dropped it just a smidge. You can bump it back to 3% if you want though and it tastes amaazing! I changed my mind 3% is perfect.\r\n\r\nMy coffee layer here is wf roasted pecans and cream, and at 3% for that flavor it bring a really good roasted coffee note, bolstered by wf smooth cappuccino cream (both are very dark flavors, this juice isn't light by any means)\r\n\r\nAnd for my creamy cheesy layer we combined fa custard premium at 1.5% with wf mascarpone 1% and that just wasnt shinning through so we bump em up each a bit and we landed where we are at time of public release.\r\n\r\nIf you like what i do please mix and review!!!\r\nLove yall\r\n\r\n**always sweeten subjectively**\r\n\r\n**this IS a cotton killer after about a day lol but worth it**",
