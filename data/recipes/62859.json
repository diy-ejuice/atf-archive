  "description": "Violet Hops is a take on floral notes, maybe even a bit herbal.\r\n\r\nI got some new flavors in to play and i thought these 3 main notes could play well together.\r\nSo here we are, smelling a blend of 3 quite opposite flavor profiles but there is a thing in common in all of them.\r\nIt's not a flavor combination that fits something you'll find on the store shelves, but to me it is a very interesting mix.\r\nMaybe you want to give it a try, let me know what you think.\r\nBUT:\r\nDo not, i repeat, do not vape this right after mixing!\r\nYou will smell just cold feet!\r\nBut after 3 days the magic happens!\r\n\r\nFA Violet - floral, slightly herbal, smells purple\r\nFLV Yakima hops - herbal, beer-ish, green leaf flavor\r\nFA Mangosteen - exotic, in the range of pineapple, smells green&yellow\r\nTPA French Vanilla - the glue between the floral top notes and the soft vanilla/yogurt\r\nWF Frozen Yogurt - the bed, the creamy bed, just a touch of tartness, brings the edge in this mix\r\n\r\nI repeat once again, please do wait 3 days at least after mixing, this is not a shake and vape!",

Allow me to proudly be the first then.  &#xD;\nIt definitely needs to steep but once it does, wow.  very unusual, like, wtf am I vaping?... I found myself vaping it while drinking gin and even beer.  I love, love love WF Fro yo and think this likely tipped me over on this one, prior to this I had yet to find a floral recipe that I could take to.  Amazing ingenuity with this flavour combination, its now in my rotation.  I don't think its an ADV for me due to its distinctiveness but very much one worth having around."
