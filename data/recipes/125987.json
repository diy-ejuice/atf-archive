  "name": "All the Pumpkin  Spice  ( made on Fresh' s Sat. show  - a pumpkin  spice ice cream )  ",
  "description": "Based on @shyndo recommendation   I pushed  **LB pumpkin Pie**  waaaaaay up there and  and tossed in  one of my favorite  ice creams  **LB vanilla  ice cream**  and  **HS  french vanilla ice cream**  for  some darker  buttery notes.   ( simple with  only 3 ingredients) \r\n\r\n What you get a sweet thick vanilla cream on the inhale and full on   pumpkin spice on the exhale from a  simple mix.\r\nThis  works well in a RTA/ Subohm   and  made for the pumpkin spice lovers out there.  This will not be for everyone, but if you like full  sweet spice flavor this is  for you .  \r\nIt does not  really need sweetener, but I like it sweet and added    FLV sweetness at 0.3% \r\n\r\n\r\nLearn more about mixing here:\r\nfacebook - https://www.facebook.com/groups/diydownunder/\r\nDiscord - https://discord.gg/kH4Fqbc\r\nYoutube - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCTCwb7ULyfJALQlehomZZQA\r\nwebsite  - https://www.diydownunder.com/",
