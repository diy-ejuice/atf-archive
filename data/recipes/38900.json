    "description": "So following on from the success of the DInner Lady Lemon Tart Remix let's go further and remix another one.\r\nNow before I start this time I'm not going to give myself brownie points or am I anyway going to suggest this next recipe is a clone or 1:1 or even a remix but in my opinion it doesn't need to be. It holds its own weight it doesn't need to be compared its fantastic either way. If you want to compare it feel free it might be better it might not,as we all know taste is subjective.\r\nSo this is my rice pudding & jam not dinner lady's but my take but we can use the platform to create some hype!!! I mean who doesn't enjoy hype!!\r\n\r\nThis in my opinion is spot on creamy, thick rice milk with a dollop of sweet raspberry jam that's it, it's tasty and hits the spot no gimmicks or crazy flavour bending just the ingredients in the recipe that take you to the profile without thinking outside the box.\r\n \r\nEnjoy!!\r\n\r\nFlavour notes\r\n\r\nCap horchata\r\n\r\nThis is straight up rice milk it works really well to mimic that rice pudding flavour. It stands up to its profile well and we will use this as the base of the rice milk but with some additional help we can really push this further making it more creamy and thicker.\r\n\r\nFW sweet cream\r\n\r\nThis acts as a emulsifier for the horchata it really gives the rice milk a more milky profile and adds some great mouthfeel.\r\n\r\nFa yogurt\/ Fa meringue \r\n\r\nAgain just some additional flavours that are really needed to get that rice milk to where it needs to be. Fa yogurt may sound weird here but it really does wonders rice pudding is thick I didn't want to use custard here so after much testing the yogurt really thickened the rice milk almost turning it into a ambrosia kind of rice pudding. Fa meringue just adds a little more milk and sweetness.\r\n\r\nFa raspberry \r\n\r\nSuch an amazing flavour that misses out somewhat due to inw and tfa but I tried both of them and neither hit the spot you either needed a shit ton to pull that profile through or the other just over powered. Fa raspberry is spot on at 1% it sits nicely at the back where I wanted it and I found its flavour on par as a more jammy raspberry especially with the help of the next two flavours.\r\n\r\nFa black currant\/ JF juicy lemon \r\n\r\nThese two flavours do the magic where the jam is concerned they totally transform the raspberry flavour and turn it jammy. If you haven't tried fa black currant then your missing out it does great things to darker fruits. The jf juicy lemon again sits on top of the berries and it's candy aspect switches up the fruits to that jam level alongside adding additional sweetness.\r\n\r\nFa cinnamon Ceylon \r\n\r\nJust a little here to add some accent to the rice pudding kind of acts like that burnt topping you get on the pudding and also adds some more interest to the pudding. You can leave this out if cinnamon isn't your thing but it really isn't noticeable but it does add a little cheeky twist.\r\n\r\nSo there you go rice pudding and jam my way but dinner lady I salute you for making me fuck with your profiles!! Thank you......\r\n\r\nxxx\r\n\r\nPs \r\n\r\nOne shot available at chefsflavours.co.uk under divine one shots\r\nIf you don't fancy mixing from scratch \r\n#supportthecreator\r\n",

But if it doesn't suit my tastes after 24 hours then it usually goes in with the hundreds of  other 30 and 50ml bottles never to be tried again.. But this one I think will go in the 0.5 percentile of liquids I have that I actually want to vape, because this is pretty friggin freakin fuckin good."
