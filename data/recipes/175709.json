  "description": "So  watching the  Great British  Bake off -  one of the challenges was  to make a lemon treacle tart .   Which is  basically  LOTS of golden syrup , bread crumbs,  butter, egg yolks,   a little  lemon juice and  zest and in a tart crust \r\n\r\n  I was intrigued and wanted to try it so  we made one and I am in love!!    Golden syrup is a major ingredient for this tart and it   is not available in the US -   so  amazon   to the rescue .  One recipe I found called for a 1 1/2  LBS of golden syrup.     Hence the name for the recipe \r\n\r\n**WF Lemon custard** is a light lemon, with a  touch of vanilla and a lovely silky custard mouth feel, the body fills out as it  steeps.   The soft  mouth feel is just lovely .  The lemon is  a base to mid note so if you really want LEMON you will need to add to it \r\n\r\nThe combination of  WF lemon custard and Lemon sour  work well for  lemon notes  in this mix the  lemon custard is a  mild and sits in the front and middle of this mix   with a  the lemon sour bringing a  lemon zesty  at the exhale.  \r\n\r\nWF Pineapple candy   is used low here to bring some of  the citrus sweetness   and support the  curd like texture of the mix\r\n\r\nSugar cookie and pudding base  are used to bring this mix together  with the golden syrup  and   add some bakery texture .  Pudding base  has a starch like body that does not have any additional   spice notes.   Sugar cookie fills in this mix and add some texture.   \r\nPie crust  by OOO is a really nice simple  plain  pie crust that works on its own with out much support and  is subtle in the mix  at the exhale \r\n \r\nNote:  I do think that FA custard could be used here instead of  WF lemon custard  as it does have a light lemon note -  but the silky mouth feel of this  WF lemon custard is lovely and works really well .   This is a Make your teeth hurt dessert so  I did add .50% of Cap super sweet to mine  -  but it is not needed \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
