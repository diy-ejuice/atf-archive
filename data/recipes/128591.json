  "name": "Nice lemon sugar pancake",
  "description": "In the UK, pancakes are more like French crepes and we often have them with lemon juice and sugar (and they are delicious). \r\n\r\nI did a little experiment to make that profile and it is awesome (if I may say so myself). \r\n\r\nMade 30ml yesterday and have nearly finished it already! \r\n\r\nI imagine that a bit of steep time will improve it, but I have to say it hasn't really needed it as it works right off the bat!\r\n\r\nGive it a try and please let me know what you think!

The crepe pairs well with it.  Not overly sweet.  Could definitely be an all day vape.  The flavors are very well balanced and not over powering.  Good job.  &#xD;\n"
