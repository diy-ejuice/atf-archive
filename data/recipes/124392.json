  "description": "This is a true muddling of flavors, difficult to nail down exactly *what* it is, aside from tasty.\r\n\r\nThe blueberry combo here has Bilberry adding more of the fleshy, more \"true\" blueberry notes, while FW is almost syrupy, vaguely candied berries. the combination doesn't have a truly dry element to it and leans more toward the sweeter side of what makes blueberries so tasty.\r\n\r\nThe peach combo was put together as an effort to build more body off of the delicate nature of white peach, while helping pare down the harshness of the peach juicy.\r\n\r\nThe magic here though is really all on the Pitaya. INW's dragonfruit is sort of hard to pin down, not the emulsification agent that TFA dragonfruit is, and more of a real fruit flavor. It's a potent one, and it sort of turns things in a unique direction here.\r\n\r\nThe ws-23 is pretty obvious, adding a refreshing chill and really makes this a more spring and summer mix than anything else.",

      "text": "The parallel here to grack juice is instantaneous, a fruit medley that defies description and is cold af. I was worried about the 1% ws23 as a person who likes ws but rarely ever uses it. I went with the original recipe and was certainly glad I did. Yes, it's cold. That's about all i can tell you without using an analogy of some sort. The fruits have mingled to where I can't pin a single one down. This is my first try with INW Pitaya so, im gonna chalk up the overall funkiness to that and being backed up by some sweet blue and stone fruit. What I get is akin to what I like about inw cactus without the overpowering strangeness. It's *delicate* strangeness, like the pomelo to the grapefruit.  A sweeter, milder version that is sort of what you want when you dont want to get beat up by flavor. Yet, there's no shortage of it here and the cold almost acts like a flavor itself, which is by far my favorite part. It seems so perfectly in place, even at 1%. Very interesting and unusual recipe, well deserved of 5 stars, because I would certainly mix this again."

This one is definitely great for hot summer nights. I had a moment of perfection with this in my tank. Peach sunset over blue mountains. One that you have to try for yourself as describing it with words doesn't do it justice."

      "text": "A delightfully confusing recipe. It's muddled in the best possible way, proving like Grack Juice, Fiestas and Fiascos, Coop's Kiwi Bourbon and a few other notable works of abstract recipe art that something doesn't have to represent a real thing to be tasty as hell. The closest thing I can compare it to... Have you ever bought frozen sliced peaches? You know you don't have to thaw them out, right? You can eat them right out of the freezer for a wonderful summer treat. Now imagine those peaches are blue. Not blueberry + peach, but an alternate universe where some peaches happen to be naturally blue and taste much different, and most agree better, than their yellow brethren. This juice is a trip into that fantasy world and it's a place I want to revisit.  "
