  "description": "This is an authentic tasting Italian Cream Cake. For the base I used WF Angel Cake SC. It reminds me of a nice and buttery moist yellow cake. I wanted to give the cake a little more substance and grit so I went with JF Biscuit. Of course you can't have an Italian Cream Cake without HS Italian Cream. This cream is off the charts good! All you need is 1% of this butter cream icing. FLV Sweet Coconut pairs well with Italian Cream. It's a very subtle coconut but it's the most authentic IMO. I topped the recipe off with FA Almond. \r\n\r\nPlease enjoy and share your feedback!",

Finally found some use for my sweet coconut and it blends in nice and subtle. I did sub the HS Italian cream with WF butter cream frosting and it's still good. If I ever get HSIC I'll go with it but for now I'll be putting this in my rotation. Nice job! "
