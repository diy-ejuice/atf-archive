  "description": "This is a remix of my favourite custard recipe,  3-2-1 Creme Brulee by Tootall. However, for shits and giggles, I tried out Vape Train's Creme Brulee, in place of INW Creme Brulee, and did a bit of tweaking.  \r\n\r\nAt 3% VT Creme Brulee manages to pull off the scorched caramel taste better than Inawera's brulee. And while it might have less body and be more milky than Inawera's offering, 2% INW Custard fixes that issue providing a thick creamy, semi-biscuity flavour.\r\n\r\nNext, on to the vanilla.  A mixer on this site suggested using dark vanillas over bright vanillas to complement caramel top-notes. To see what he meant, two batches of this recipe were mixed: one with Shisha Vanilla (the bright one) and the other with DIYFS Holy Vanilla (the dark spicy vanilla). It turns out he's right. The difference was subtle yet apparent: Holy Vanilla worked nicely with the caramel notes in VT Creme Brulee. By the way, It's always refreshing to learn from experienced mixers who aren't cynical and are friendly and welcoming instead. \r\n \r\n\r\nOverall, this is a pleasantly light yet decadent custard vape with caramel and earthy vanilla top-notes. 0.35% FW Sweetener was added to taste. Perfect as a S&V but gets richer as it steeps.\r\n\r\n\r\nTootall's  3-2-1 Creme Brulee\r\nhttps://alltheflavors.com/recipes/97165\r\n",
