  "description": "Really wanted a quick SnV desert tobacco. Connecticut Shade's chocolate/coffee notes lend well to blending with the chocolate mint of CdM, and they all work with cinnamon. Added some Australian Chocolate to make the chocolate the predominant non-tobacco flavor, and then the Red Burley and Native tobaccos to make it clear this is a tobacco vape.\r\n\r\nBonus for anyone who thinks they deciphered the acronym. And as always... use PEG or PDO if you're gonna mix at the suggested ratio, I don't need to end up on a Throat Offenders Registry because someone thought I meant they should vape that much PG.",
