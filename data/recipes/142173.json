    "description": "Custard cream donut filling with just a little hint of the actual donut in there. Grown-up fat kids rejoice.\r\n\r\nCustard Premium and Vanilla Buttercream Frosting make a thick, creamy, and sweet base with a hint of vanilla. Zeppola adds a touch of donut and some spice lingering throughout. It\u2019s loaded with Super Sweet for the sugary sweetness you\u2019d expect from donut filling.\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s pretty good fresh, but everything is better steeped.\r\n\r\nHappy mixing. \ud83d\udc7d",
