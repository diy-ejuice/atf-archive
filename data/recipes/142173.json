  "description": "Custard cream donut filling with just a little hint of the actual donut in there. Grown-up fat kids rejoice.\r\n\r\nCustard Premium and Vanilla Buttercream Frosting make a thick, creamy, and sweet base with a hint of vanilla. Zeppola adds a touch of donut and some spice lingering throughout. It‚Äôs loaded with Super Sweet for the sugary sweetness you‚Äôd expect from donut filling.\r\n\r\nIt‚Äôs pretty good fresh, but everything is better steeped.\r\n\r\nHappy mixing. üëΩ",

I love it as is and also with a a drop of rich cinnamon per 30 ml added to go more in the cinnamon direction. Mix this one up guys and gals. "
