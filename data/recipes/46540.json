    "description": "\"Pretty straight forward, looking for a delicious Banana Blueberry Cheesecake. I want this one to be REALLY creamy, sweet, and satisfying. I'm planning for the banana to stand out more than the blueberry. Wish me luck.\"\r\n\r\nThe above text is what I put in the description when I originally mixed this juice. I knew it would need steep time, but it was surprisingly delicious right off of the shake. I mixed a second bottle so that I could have one put away steeping steadily. A solid month later I came back to the steeping bottle, upon sampling this juice I was happily surprised. This was awesome! I really nailed this one, I had thought to myself. After a few hours I did realize  that I had over-sweetened a little bit.\r\n\r\nGiven a little bit of steep time, (3 days or so) the banana falls back a little, the blueberry jumps to the front, and the whole flavor melds together much better than it seems off the shake. \r\n",
