            "text": "I get a satisfying, full-flavored vape that mostly tastes as it should. Champagne with a splash of orange and berries. The champagne is perfect, has a fizzy feel, and isn\u2019t too funky. There\u2019s very nice syrupy sweet mostly-raspberry-tasting berry depth, with some darker black &amp; blueberry hints in the base. I think the catch here is how you perceive FLV Berry Blend. I find it to be a touch floral and I\u2019m getting that here as well, even at just 1.4%. It just has a light floral edge, to the extent that this Berry Mimosa tastes like it has flowers on top of it. If we\u2019re being real, it tastes like someone was trying too hard to get something in the FLV recipe book when they could have chosen different mixed berry and avoided that bit of floral upfront."
