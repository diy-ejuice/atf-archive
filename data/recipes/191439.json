  "name": "Night Cap- Strawberry Shortcake Clone",
  "description": "This is a clone for Night Cap’s “Strawberry shortcake” And i’m positive Flavor West strawberry shortcake is the main ingredient in there . So there for that’s our main note , It’s an ok flavor by it self but doesn’t seem to be all there so adding a little more cake with WF angel cake sc gives a nice cake lay out paired with some CAP whipped cream and i there some CAP Ripe strawberries on there to obviously add more strawberry but not only that , i also wanted to over power the Flavor west strawberry because it’s slightly artificial , so that really helps it out . And last but not least we got some CAP vanilla custard to give that cake some vanilla and to thicken up the creams a slight bit . Top it off with some CAP super Sweet and you got your self a Night Cap “Strawberry Shortcake” eliquid CLONE . Enjoy brothers and sisters of the DIY Community . Please give feed back as it helps others decide what they want to mix when looking through recipes on all the flavors . Thank you . ",
