    "name": "Night Cap- Strawberry Shortcake Clone",
    "description": "This is a clone for Night Cap\u2019s \u201cStrawberry shortcake\u201d And i\u2019m positive Flavor West strawberry shortcake is the main ingredient in there . So there for that\u2019s our main note , It\u2019s an ok flavor by it self but doesn\u2019t seem to be all there so adding a little more cake with WF angel cake sc gives a nice cake lay out paired with some CAP whipped cream and i there some CAP Ripe strawberries on there to obviously add more strawberry but not only that , i also wanted to over power the Flavor west strawberry because it\u2019s slightly artificial , so that really helps it out . And last but not least we got some CAP vanilla custard to give that cake some vanilla and to thicken up the creams a slight bit . Top it off with some CAP super Sweet and you got your self a Night Cap \u201cStrawberry Shortcake\u201d eliquid CLONE . Enjoy brothers and sisters of the DIY Community . Please give feed back as it helps others decide what they want to mix when looking through recipes on all the flavors . Thank you . ",
