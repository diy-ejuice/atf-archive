  "description": "PEACH TOBACCO  with a good throat kick.\r\n\r\nI do like a good fresh peach taste that makes the mouth water and i also like the taste of tobacco. So i went on my way for a mix of the two,but which tobaccos was the big question. I find the black mile plus a little weak on its own but i thought itll be good as a base for a better tobacco mix so in steps flv red burley with a little help from kentucky blend. The peach mix ive seen around on a few recipes and have enjoyed them +- %s.\r\n\r\nI tried 60-40 which for me gives a good throat hit but on my next batch ill be trying 70-30 to see how it turns out.\r\n\r\nIve put 14 days for steep time as i think i first tried it after around 16 days wanting the peach to settle and the tobaccos to blend nicely .\r\n\r\nSo to round it off its a mouth watering peach with a nice blend of tobacco backing it up. Hope you like it and leave any pros or cons for me down below.",
