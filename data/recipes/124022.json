  "description": "Temps are dropping, and the holiday season is rapidly approaching!\r\nThis is a simple 5 flavor recipe to ease into all the festivities; just sit back, and enjoy.\r\nAll 5 flavors seem to meld together quite nicely, and compliment each other; like a family gathering, where everyone likes one another (strange, right?).\r\nThe Biscuit was added for solidity, and plays rather nicely with the Eggnog and Hazelnut. The Vanilla Pudding gives a nice hug to everything, and the Vanilla Swirl is that aunt or uncle that is welcome everywhere!  ",

The hazelnut adds a richness and slight nutty flavor that plays well off the biscuit, which cements the dessert vibe. The vanilla swirl and vanilla pudding add a wall of thick tasty goodness for everything to stick to. Basically, this is a holiday cookie dunked in a glass of eggnog, and it's all very delicious.&#xD;\n&#xD;\nNice one!"
