  "description": "Now before I start my notes I'll just say I've never tried the original eliquid but this is my take on the flavour profile.\r\n\r\nJust a bright mix of fruits with a small amount of ice. \r\n\r\nCap double apple as 4.5% gives us our base for this flavour.\r\n\r\nFa kiwi I used as its the only kiwi flavouring I like but it is quite weak so I've pushed it up to 3%\r\n\r\nWf watermelon yellow at 1.5% allows you to just get a twist of it on the inhale without it overpowering everything.\r\n\r\n0.5% Ws23 for the ice. \r\n\r\nI haven't used any sweetener in this but feel free to use your preferred sweetener.
