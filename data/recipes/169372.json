  "description": "For Wendy Vapes DIY session.  All of the flavors can be used in other recipes quiet commonly.\r\nA quick and easy Angel food cake!  Glazed strawberries is a stand alone flavor, one if the few strawberries capable of being so.  Angel cake is a fairly close representation of the actual thing, the coconut custard rounds it out nicely while providing some moisture and filling in with a light vanilla.  Whipped cream is whipped cream.",

(I used JF Strawberry Harvest @ the same %) it did give it a nice flavorful strawberry glaze/topping but totally OVERPOWERED EVERYTHING else to where it was strawberry jam with hints of cake... So definitely my bad... Gonna give it another try at 1% JF Strawberry Harvest (cause it too is a standalone üçì &amp; I love the idea of this recipe! If you can offer up any other suggestions or help Fresh üòâ I'd appreciate it...&#xD;\nWill update the rating on the next try... (Just cause I messed it up the first time around)&#xD;\n&#xD;\nUpdate: so now I mixed it up with 1% JF Strawberry Sweet and it's a nice recipe! üòÅ You can actually taste the cake and not just a bunch of strawberries. Thanks fresh! üëçüëä"
