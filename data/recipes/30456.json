  "description": "Thick, rich and creamy... \r\n\r\nThe VBIC, NY cheesecake, Sweet Cream, and Creme Brulée all drive this thick decadent base. The butterscotch kind of sits on top for a few days and melts down in the mix after a week and a half and the cinnamon note from the graham fades as well leaving behind a rich buttery thick vape if you are into that sort of thing.",
