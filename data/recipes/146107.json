  "description": "Heat 2 - Pudding\r\n\r\nThis is our submission for Heat 2 of the DIYDU vs TFV MixOff. This challenge is all about pudding, but ensuring that the hero of the recipe is the creamy element. \r\n\r\nCollaboration Recipe by the TFV Team: Theo, Liam, Deetz, Daniel, Rudi, Richard\r\n\r\nWe decided to go retro, and create a full cream Panna Cotta. Interestingly enough, we only found 3 Panna Cotta recipes on ATF - and all of them use MB Panna Cotta - so creating this layer from scratch was part of the innovation we want to highlight in this recipe. \r\n\r\nThis is a White Chocolate Infused Panna Cotta - drizzled with Mixed Berry Coulis\r\n\r\nPanna Cotta Layer\r\nTraditionally a Panna Cotta is a sweet cream with a bit of gelatin added to help it set in the fridge. This is why we decided to go with CAP Sweet Cream, it has a full body dairy / cream behind it with a touch of sweetness, but it needs a little help - CAP Vanilla Whipped Cream, is a extremely underrated concentrate, here it helps fluff out the CAP Sweet Cream and adding a slight vanilla note to the mix that helps bridge the Panna Cotta Layer with the Mixed Berry Coulis Layer. Finally this delicate layer is infused with FLV White Chocolate - the creamy thick sweetness from this layer sets you up nicely to balance it with a mouthwatering tartness that inherently comes with berries. \r\n\r\nMixed Berry Coulis Layer\r\nThe mixed berry layer is made up of FLV Berry blend, an under utilised concentrate, this is a mix of red and dark berries with a slight syrupy mouthfeel to this we have added FLV Boysenberry low enough to impart the wonderful jammy qualities it posses without giving a lot of the flavour,  this enhances the syrupy mouthfeel of berry blend, giving you a wonderful mixed berry coulis with a mouth watering tartness, the perfect topping for the Panna Cotta\r\n\r\nThis mix is beautiful off a shake and will just improve with time\r\n\r\n",
