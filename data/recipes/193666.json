  "description": "Mixers Club April Submission\r\nSecret Santa\r\n\r\nUnknown to Kitu5, I was assigned to make something from our common flavors.\r\n\r\n\"Flavor: TPA Mocha (i have a metric f***ton of this...i'd like to use it)\r\nBonus brownie points if you can also use OoO Vanilla Frosting, cos also have a sh*tton of this.\r\n\r\nEh, either some decadent frilly coffee bullsh*t, Something nifty and dessert-like...or mebbe sneak in a hint of tobacco?  Just something that'll finally give me an excuse to start killing the hell outta this that's yummy.\"\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, I don't own TPA Mocha yet so my only option was the latter while keeping in mind that one could add Mocha later on to end up with something similar to a tiramisu. Or vape it on it's own.\r\n\r\nUpdate: After Kitus' review I decided to add the agreed upon 1% tpa mocha. Enjoy!",
