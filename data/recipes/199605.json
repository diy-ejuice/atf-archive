  "description": "I always wanted to try Yogi Original Granola but never had a chance so i decided to mix one my way.\r\n\r\nThe Granola:\r\n\r\nCAP Cereal 27 Is the base for the toasted granola, its AP, toasted cereal and sweet, at 5 % its the perfect base.\r\n\r\nTPA Rice Crunchies adds more AP to the mix and a darker cereal type flavour to make it a bit more fuller and interesting.\r\n\r\nWF Oats & Cream Cookie gives a tiny bit of a earthy oat flavour at the end and helps adding a bit of creaminess.\r\n\r\nFA Nut Mix is the secret weapon it has a great generic, earthy and creamy nut flavour that tricks tour mind making this flavours above mix and taste like toasted granola bar with some nuts in it.\r\n\r\nThe Honey:\r\n\r\nFa Honey is top heavy and very strong, with 0.5 % you get a lot of honey flavour just how its suposed.. a lot.\r\n\r\nFa Maple darkens the honey and adds syrupy taste and sweetness, while the dry notes it has get blended with the grainy part of the mix.\r\n\r\nCAP Super sweet Is essential as honey is basicly sugar so 0.75% + honey+ maple syrup you get that high amount of sweetness.",
