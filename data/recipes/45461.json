  "name": "Chocolate Cherry Cake",
  "description": "I stripped out the cake base from mlNikon and Cheeba Steeba's Peaches n' Cream Cake to use as a starting point after I picked up FLV Milk Chocolate and decided that I wanted to make a chocolate cherry cake vape. This was my first attempt but it turned out way better than I anticipated so I decided to share it.\r\n\r\nFLV Milk Chocolate & FLV Sweet Coconut - after tasting Hear the Girls Come (ID10-T) I couldn't separate these two. I needed more chocolate so I bumped up the percentages of both.\r\n\r\nFW Cherry Crush - I have a ton of cherry flavor concentrates and most of them taste medicinal. I needed a cherry pie filling type flavor like you would use in a real chocolate cherry cake and this one seemed like it would fit.\r\n\r\nI plowed through this as a S&V but it tasted even better after a week.",
