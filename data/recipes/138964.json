  "name": "Tony's Wife's Revenge",
  "description": "*(DISCLAIMER: Any similarities between Tony The Tiger and myself are purely intentional. Because, duhhhh...we're both like, tigers or something??)*\r\n  \r\n\r\nWhen I heard what that two-timing, no-workin' couch potato of a husband said about me on ATF? I was like, \"Oh **HELLLLLLL** no!\" \r\n\r\nLet me set *this* played out record straight once and for all:\r\n\r\nFor one thing, Tony did NOT fall into a deep depression because of Mr. Andy(aka Audrey) Snap(uses the \"they\"/\"them\" pronoun), Long Jack N. McCrackle, and \"Pop\" Meereally Hardson(though Tony would have the world believe otherwise!)!! That no-good \"husband\" of mine began a-drinkin' & a-druggin' with the massive profits from \"his\" cereal. And don't **EVEN** get me started on who **TRULY** came up with that damned recipe! Because I will **REALLY** start ripping skeletons from his closet if forced to do so!!\r\n\r\nAnd now I'll once-and-for-all explain that \"train\" accusation my deadbeat ex-husband made about me. Because I can answer it with one damned sentence: It wasn't me. It. Wasn't. Me. And even if it *was*? Tony and that Cap'n (with that crunchy moniker) had been frolicking around in New York's gay bath houses *wayyyyyy* before I filed for separation and subsequently, divorce. That's right. *I*. Filed. And whoever files 1st is right folks. Well, to be truthful, whoever has the nicest boobs is right. And look at my boobs in that pic!! *Meee-OWW!!*\r\n\r\nAdditionally, he never killed any gnom...er, midg...,er, \"height-challenged people\". Puh-lease!! The only thing Tony managed to kill over the years was to kill \"the mood\" in our budjois('bedroom', for all of you not skilled in the French language).\r\n\r\nI threw his butt to the curb because I could no longer tolerate the above behaviors, nor could I put up with him a-guzzlin' his hooch(and scratchin' his ball sack) on the sofa on our front porch(don't judge...we are from the South). And when he screamed, \"Oh this is just GRRRREAT!! How will I be able to watch uncensored reruns of Family Ties out *here*??\" I just slammed that broken screen door in his face and that was that. I was finally free of that no-good moocher!!\r\n\r\nOr so I thought...it was awhile later when a friend sent me a screenshot of his libelous post on ATF. Let's just say this, if it's not true-I could sue that scheming prick for everything he owns(which at this point, is 1/2 of a moldy loaf of bread, old pizza crust crumbs between his Lazy Boy cushions, and sticky porn magazines [circa 1950]). So let us **all** see that supposed vid, Tony! If a video of me and those 3 'real' men exists? *Prove it!! Pics, or the shit didn't happen!!*\r\n\r\nTony was a lush when I met him, my friends! And with the success of his cereal, what do you think he became? I'll answer that question for y'all-he simply became a **SUCCESSFUL** lush!! \r\n\r\nAnyhoooo, I hope that smarmy bastard thinks twice before calling me a whore in public again! Don't *make* me roast your nuts in public again fool!!\r\n  \r\nLove & Peace To All,\r\n  \r\nToni \r\n  \r\n\r\n  \r\n**FLAVOR NOTES**(because creative stories *STILL* are not considered cool anymore):\r\n\r\nOkay. Let's start off with the addition of **TFA Pie Crust**. I dare you to take the lid off that particular concentrate, take a hardy sniff and NOT think it's the missing link in the magic that is Corn Flakes/Frosted Flakes! Go ahead. The rest of the class will wait.\r\n  \r\nThe **CAP Cereal 27/TFA Acetyl Pyrazine/FW Hazelnut** is a pretty much 'tried & true' method of getting us started in the right direction to this specific malty, corn-like cereal flavor.\r\n  \r\nAnd then we come to...(insert sound effect of *duhn duhn duhnnnn*) the milk. My God, how I *lovvvve* milk! It's just so **GRRRREAT(oops, sorry)** on SO many daggon' levels. The *temperature* of milk, the *texture* of milk, and lastly, the *TASTE* OF MILK!!!! Thank *Jesus* I'm not lactose-intolerant because if I was? I would slit my wrists in a bathtub full of salt water and anti-coagulants, willingly bleed out & call it a day! \r\n  \r\nAgain we have **FA MERINGUE** which we sometimes use to build 'milks'(okay kids, pretty much *always* we are using this concentrate to build milk. If it isn't included? The recipe just plain sucks and you shouldn't bother mixing it up!!<---hah! Just kiddin'. At least I *think* I'm kiddin'). Can I just add that-if FA Meringue was in the entertainment industry, it *surely* would be referred to as a \"quadruple threat\"), as it performs **FOUR**(unprecedented, I know!!)   vital roles here: \r\n  \r\n(1)-the bridge that emulsifies our various creamy aspects together. \r\n  \r\n(2)-it provides a great foundation upon which to build our milk-like base. \r\n  \r\n(3)-the start of the sweet frosted sugary part of the flakes and/or bottom of the bowl of milk, and....*ANNND??*...okay, okay...there *IS* no 4th role for **FA Meringue** here. **PSYCHE!!** I lied(even though I was *completely* honest with Tony throughout our tedious relationship)!! \r\n  \r\n(4)-**FA Meringue** is of course, part of the milk. Oh wait. Okay yeah...there's no 4th part of its' role here. So in the entertainment industry FA Meringue would only be considered a *triple* threat. But still, a triple threat is way better than a single threat. And I'd bet mine & Tony's rundown trailer most would NOT argue that a triple threat is still better than a double threat. But I'm getting away from the notes here. Where the hell was I? Oh yeah...the milk part. **OOO Milky Undertones In PG**?? Well? You can't have a good *\"film-coating-your-mouth\"* milk without the 'ol undertone, now can ye? Only way you'll get *THIS* film out of your mouth is by brushing your teeth(all surfaces of your mouth, actually) and rinsing your mouth out with a generous portion of gasoline. *WeeeeeHOOOOO! Boy HOWDYYY!*\r\n  \r\nOh yeah, **FW Hazelnut** also helps here with our milk *and* with that malty note which was no doubt started by the Pie Crust. Okay okay. So it's only a \"*double* threat\", that hazelnut. But we already agreed a double threat beats a single threat any day of the week and twice on Tuesdays!!\r\n  \r\n**OPTIONAL(even though I find it pretty necessary):**\r\n\r\n**1 drop WS23**\r\n  \r\n**1 drop Polar Blast**\r\n  \r\n\r\n *Adding those 2 above enhancers to every 30ml of juice will make your milk a little more on the lukewarm side, instead of a hot vape. Go ahead! Add 'em and hot-diggety-do! Bob's your uncle(note to newbs: include at least 1 crazy British phrase to make all the UKers feel included)!!\r\n  \r\nVG Recommended 75%\r\n  \r\nSteep days: I vape it fresh. But it's better after(insert your own timeframe here, as mine hasnt even steeped a week so...it may suck). Really bad. Or? Not at all? Who knows? Hehe. Let's face it-we have a 50/50 chance here that it will be good. Or....bad, as I said!! \r\n  \r\n**FOR THE BEST FROSTED CORN FLAKES CEREAL RECIPE & DESCRIPTION IN THE BUSINESS, GO HERE:**\r\n  \r\nhttps://alltheflavors.com/recipes/41001#tony_s_revenge_frosted_flakes_on_steroids_by_steamon\r\n  \r\n**Thank you for your \"blessing\" on this, Steam!!
