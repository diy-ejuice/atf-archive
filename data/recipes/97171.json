    "description": "A vitalizing blend of fresh pear and vibrant lychee, accented with a touch of coconut.\r\n\r\nThis combo remains one of my all time favorites but I could not find a recipe which celebrated these magical flavours well enough, hence the creation of Pychee (Pear\/Lychee).\r\n\r\nFA lychee brings the authentic, fresh, lychee flavour to the mix and lays the foundation for the lychee layer. Lychee's unique tropical flavour (described by some as a mix between watermelon, pear and grape) is unmistakable and magical! Cap Sweet Lychee boosts the FA Lychee with a sweet, canned lychee vibe and rounds the lychee profile off perfectly.\r\n\r\nThe pear layer is courtesy of my favoutite pear combo consisting of FA & INW. \r\nFA Pear brings the fresh, juicy pear element whereas  INW Pear provides the grittiness, crunch and texture of a pukka pear.\r\n\r\nFLV Persimmon is described by many as a peach\/plum hybrid. I pick up up wonderful, deep, pear\/quince nuances which intensifies the pear profile and adds that little intrigue to the mix...  \r\n\r\nThe Persimmon can be substituted for TPA Dragonfruit at the same %. The dragonfruit variation is excellent, I just prefer the persimmon version.\r\n\r\nFLV sweet coconut fulfills 3 roles  here:  it provides a touch of creaminess, a spot of sweetness and imparts that magical taste  of fresh coconut ensuring adequate depth in the mix.\r\n\r\nFeel free to add your cooling agent of choice - WS23 at 0.5% is just enough IMHO.\r\n\r\nGive this one a good night's sleep, 3 preferable for the floral notes to dissipate.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
