  "description": "This is a collaborative creation by DEVELOPED: NaChef, Max Savage, Graham, and Folkart.\r\nMaxSavage suggested this profile based on a dessert created by master pastry chefs while he worked in the service industry.  This profile takes a lemon tart and makes it a bit more interesting by caramelizing the top to a golden brown.

The lemon is a nice baked sweet lemon with a little tartness still and is balanced really well with the rest of the mix. I was nervous to mix this up because of the ry4 double but I'm glad I mixed a 30 ml because it works!"
