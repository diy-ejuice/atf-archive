  "description": "*A Popsicle made of Pickle Juice*\r\n\r\nEven with fall just around the corner, it can still get hot as Satan's balls down here in Texas and if you do any kind of outdoor activities, electrolytes will be lost. If you're desperate to put them back, nothing, not even Gatorate, works as well as one of [Bob's Pickle Pops](https://imgur.com/dvO7JSs), the popsicle made of pickle juice. \r\n\r\nAll of this was built around **OoO Pickle.** Accurate as can be, but not a lot of fun to single-flavor test. Vaping pickle flavor is like drinking pickle juice. There's a world of difference in the experience of drinking warm (blech!), room temperature, or even refrigerated pickle juice versus the refreshment level of frozen pickle juice. \r\n\r\nThat's where **WS-23** comes in, to make it freezing cold. Taste perception is subjective and response to cooling agents is possibly the most subjective thing in DIY, so feel free to increase if you like Malaysian juice or decrease if you're scared. Here's how I arrived at that odd-looking 1.55 %, though. Using too much coolant *hurts,* like getting a brain brain freeze from a Slurpee. But there's a thin blurry line between pleasure and pain -- consider the spiciest food you enjoy, or what orgasms sometimes sound like without words like \"OHGOD! YES! YES, ID10-T, YES!\" mingled in with the screams and moans to let you know she's dying the little death and not actually being murdered. I wanted to explore that, really ride that line. At 1.5%, WS-23 (in a 30% dilution, the way you can buy it from ECX or Chef's) wasn't close enough to being painful. 1.6% was over the line, just a little, just at first, until I got used to it. 1.55% makes me unsure whether I'm experiencing pleasure or pain. [Like when you're done and she won't stop sucking](https://imgur.com/r/shestillsucking/ED8086p). FWIW, I'm definitely more sensitive than most to Koolada, maybe that's also the case with me and WS-23 and you'll find this amount too tame for all this pleasure/pain nonsense. Regardless, it'll make your pickle into a pickle pop.  \r\n\r\n**CAP Cucumber** is there mostly to move it from a Best Maid or Vlasic pickle juice to something more Claussenesque, but it also gives it some welcome body, like freezing pickle juice gives you something to bite into. Similar to the pain/pleasure line, there's as much **INW Cactus** as I can put in here for extra juicy refreshment without it turning into a pickle-cactus recipe. No aloe in my pickle pop, please. Turns out OoO Pickle and a ton of WS-23 can take on quite a bit more than the 0.25% that would normally be my limit for this use of Cactus, but not quite a full double dose of it. \r\n\r\nI owe a huge thank you to @ConcreteRiver for trying an earlier version of this via https://www.reddit.com/r/mixersclub/ and suggesting the addition of **FA Bitter Wizard.** It keeps the very light garlic note in the OoO Pickle from mingling with the relatively sweeter elements in Cucumber and Cactus (and VG, for that matter) and taking on a touch of a sweet onion vibe.   \r\n",

Slightest hint of dill, garlic, onion, and PICKLE. The WS-23 makes it deliciously cold. For what I kept going \"This HAS to be a joke\", it's awesome.&#xD;\n&#xD;\nThe fact that neither I nor my breath reek of garlic or onion is a huge plus. Banging job, ID10-T!"

It reminded me of being a young girl and we would suck on the pickle to get all the juice. Just loved that pickle juice.  Can't say I would Vape it all day. ðŸ˜€. Just like one would not suck on a pickle all day, but their is a time for everything.  Great job.  And awesome creativity."

I do think some sweeter body would help this out as a vape and I also think the bitter wizard is a bit of a genius addition. The way id10t bent this pickle flavor is beyond impressive and while the mcdonalds cheeseburger rick describes occasionally sneaks out, I think this is about as much as you can mask it. Well done Id10t!"

      "text": "**Do you want to vape pickles?**  This is a question you must ask yourself.  If you would like to vape pickles, then this is about as good as it's going to get, barring a great leap forward in pickle vape technology.  &#xD;\n&#xD;\nBy itself, OOO Pickle, smells like the inside of a mcdonalds cheeseburger.  It has this weird sweet onion thing going on that's a bit off-putting.  This recipe is going to be one of the best ways to get around that.  The cactus and cucumber help to moisten and thin out the pickle a bit.  The cooling really helps to mask some of that weirdness. And the bitter wizard further tamps down the sweet onion note and reduces it to more of a dull roar of garlic in the background.  &#xD;\n&#xD;\nI'm rating this as someone who a)wanted to vape pickles, b) understands that OOO pickle is a bit of an imperfect tool for which I know of no direct, easily available substitute, and c) can't think of a better way to approach this profile.  That's where the high rating is coming from.  &#xD;\n&#xD;\nIs it worth trying this if you have no interest in the profile...no, but that goes for any recipe.  &#xD;\n&#xD;\nIt's definitely a pickle vape though, and turning it into a popsicle was a damn fine idea executed well."
