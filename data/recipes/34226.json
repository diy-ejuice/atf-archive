  "name": " S≈çlus - Spicy Custard/Creme Brulee w/ light tobacco",
  "description": "This was my first venture into tobaccos - a custardy, subtly spicy cream that isn't as cloying as straight up custard, with tobacco as a fun element (this is my main theme with most of my liquids, authenticity matters fuck all if you can't vape more than 1ml a day of it because you wanna throw up).\r\n\r\nThe custard part:\r\nCAP Vanilla custard: @4% its exactly the right balance between heavy vanilla custard without going into wall cement territory. The backbone of this recipe, as expected.\r\nINW Creme Brulee : at 1% it imparts caramely note to the custard, which in turn plays really well with Soho and Catalan Cream. Also contributes to the custardy main note.\r\nFA Catalan Cream: I went to this recipe with Catalan Cream in mind - it's a zingy citrusy cream with subtle spice notes (nutmeg/cinnamon? Can't fucking tell exactly) at this percentage. I try to limit my recipes to 6 ingredients, and catalan cream is a nice all-encompassing flavor for the notes I wanted to hit.\r\nFLV Milk & Honey:  I felt the finished product was lacking without this. It provides another caramely hint with some dairy creaminess, and a really nice way to add depth and sweeten up the recipe without muddling up the profile.\r\n\r\nAccents:\r\nINW Biscuit: Good ol' buddy. Butter part plays along with the custard part rather well, while the AP in it further accentuates the Soho.\r\nFA Soho: The soul of this recipe. It's a more  amicable version of RY4 double - less sharp caramel, more woody and nutty, almost zero leaf. The very light caramel is boosted by Milk & Honey and Creme Brulee - nuttiness of Soho is builded upon with biscuit.\r\n\r\nAll in all, I feel like this one is a winner - every ingredients plays along really well with the others. Unfortunately, this isn't really a shake and vape - you can of course shake and vape it, but the least time you should wait before touching it is 3 days, really starts to come together after 7. \r\nSayonara bitches!",
