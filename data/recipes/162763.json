    "description": "I got the idea for the premise of this smoothie from Nachefs' OCD. He used cherimoya with dragon fruit and juicy orange. It was really good but I thought the cherimoya was just a little funky for my liking so I used guanabana to keep the tropical vibe going and switched out the juicy orange for cap sweet tangerine for a more syrupy sweet smoothie.",
