I did the same recipe while swapping it out with FW Kiwi, and right off the SNV it tasted like it was supposed to., and quite good at that. With FW Kiwi I'd give this 5 stars, otherwise, as it is, this recipe is gross."

      "text": "I always love FA Fuji and FA Kiwi paired together. They’re so complimentary and refreshing. Kiwi brings extra tartness to the apple, while the pomegranate adds an almost floral accent. The balance is fantastic, and nothing is taking over nor underutilized. Thanks for sharing, Evilin!"
