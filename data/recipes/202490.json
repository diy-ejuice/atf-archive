    "description": "I mixed this live on Fresh03 Saturday, August 1st.  After 5 days, this is delicious.  **WF Vanilla Ruyan Custard** is Wonder Flavours version of an RY4.  I love this flavor, and with the **WF SC Bourbon Aged Cream**, it is amazing.  For an added deliciousness, I am added some **WF Peach Pie & Cream** with **WF SC Bavarian Cream**.  \r\nThis is nice and creamy, light tobacco, and a delicious peach in the back.  \r\nEnjoy  \r\n\r\ncheck out **https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/c\/OGADIY**\r\nhttps:\/\/www.diyflavorchaser.com\/tam-vapes\r\n",
