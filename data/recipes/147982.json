I was already convinced... then I read the ingredients list... I just knew it was gonna be a banger. I admit I was tempted to switch TPA VBIC with LB VIC, but I stayed true to the recipe and it's devilishly good, a smooth, sweet vanilla vape at a perfect level of complexity. I mixed a small tester, so the extra drop of CAP SS that slipped in made this very sweet but the flavour is all there on this one and it's a great showcasing of what Holy Vanilla can bring to a mix. I will surely mix this again. Thank you for this gift of a recipe. I loved Mr Bean as a kid and this allowed me to relive that in a much different way, but perhaps even better. Much love Slushy! Keep 'em comin'!"
