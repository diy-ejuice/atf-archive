  "description": "A very simple and creamy Coconut Pistachio Cream Pie...\r\n\r\nAlthough WF Pistachio Cream is not 100% a Pistachio, it is a wonderful almond/pistachio flavor. The creaminess of this flavors blends perfectly with WF Coconut Cream Pie. WF Coconut Cream Pie is a wonderfully thick coconut cream that has all the feel and characteristics of a well-balanced pie. The crust part was lacking a bit so I added OOO Pie Crust and JF Biscuit. It definitely has that crust with burnt edge taste to it. \r\n\r\nThat's all I needed for this recipe. Simple yet perfectly balanced and delicious. It's all there.\r\n\r\nPlease try and share your feedback!",
