  "description": "The goal here was to create a grape flavored bubblegum with a texture reminiscent of the old individually wrapped grape bazooka joe/double bubble style gum.  I wanted a nice juicy, candied grape flavor/texture with, at the same time, somewhat of a dry smooth texture to emulate the dryness that one would find on the outside of the gum before chewing it and I think this easy, simple recipe hit the nail on the head.\r\n\r\nCAP-Bubble Gum.  This was a no brainer on the best bubblegum to use here and in all honesty the best bubblegum to use, period.  I tried numerous bubblegums and none of the 6 that I have on hand would have gotten the job done like the CAP did.  It provided me with the perfect flavor and texture for the profile I was after.  It provided me with that dry, somewhat chewy 'pink' flavor.  I started out at 2% but, quickly realized that this this low the flavor was not full enough so, I upped it to 4% and bingo, I got what I was looking for.  However, that percentage also provide me with a little harshness which I was not fond of.\r\n\r\nFW-Whipped Cream.  To curb the slight bit of harshness from the bubblegum I knew that this concentrate would remedy it.  I've worked with this ingredient extensively and for some extra mouthfeel and 'smoothing out' properties it was the perfect fit.  I started with it at .5% and it worked but, it didn't cut down enough of the harshness.  I bumped it to .75% and voila, harshness gone, and a little extra mouthfeel and body.\r\n\r\nFW-Grape Soda.  I really wanted a single grape flavor that provided the juiciest qualities along with being full bodied and somewhat candied and non realistic.  Having worked with this flavor before I new it would be the perfect fit and right off the bat it was.  I tinkered around with other grapes just to see if I could improve what I already had unsuccessfully and ended up going with this, my original choice.  Having used it at 3% elsewhere I knew that was right where it needed to be.\r\n\r\nCAP-Super Sweet.  Of course, being that this is a bubblegum we needed to add a little extra sweetness to it so, .5% suited this mix perfectly.  Feel free to raise or lower this to preference.\r\n\r\nFLV-Candy Roll.  Having watch all of the NOTED series and taking the advice from ID10-T on this possibly working to add dryness to a bubblegum, I decided to try it.  It worked.  And at .5% it seemed to add what I was looking for without compromising flavor at all.\r\n\r\nRight off the shake it's pretty well good to go.  I dont wait for a steep personally but, I do notice that after the 3 day mark the flavors seem to marry together and become more so one with eachother.\r\n\r\nHope you enjoy!",
