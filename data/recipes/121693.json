    "description": "Ahoy! 'tis me latest collaborative project, 'n I had th' pleasure o' workin' wit' a true gentleman 'n a scholar t' get it nailed down. Cap'n Burgundy 'n I 'ave been tryin' out numerous concepts, from th' enigma o' FA Breakfast Cereals t' th' cereal destroyin' FW Hazelnut. Thar were some moments o' pure joy, 'n some moments o' sheer terror (lookin' at ye Fizzy Sherbet). Let's walk th' plank.\r\n\r\nFLV Cream 'n OOO Cream\/Milky Undertones make up th' cream base fer th' cereal, 'n aye that's all ye needs. FLV Cream be easily one o' me fav'rit flavors, 'tis an awesome cream that I still can nah describe. OOO Cream\/Milky Undertones adds some, ye guessed it, milky undertones t' th' vape without bullyin' th' cereal too much. Movin' onto th' yellow, mouth-destroyin' loot pieces. FA Cookie adds some separation from th' cream base 'n all-around great texture t' th' cereal. Cereal 27 be wha' makes up th' yellow puffed corn bits, 'n gives a general \"cereal\" quality. Brown Sugar was Cap'n Burgundy's trick, hijacked from Breakfast Bowls #1. It adds some dark sweetness 'n makes th' Captain Crunch mighty tasty.\r\n\r\nNow 'tis me time t' shine. When we started this adventure, I was in charge o' findin' a TPA Crunchy Berry Soap substitute. In th' words o' th' cap'n hisself, \"I bloodhounded it, 'n when ye try it ye'll say, 'That Alfred sure knows wha' he's doin' wit' his schnozz.'\" Forest Fruit be th' answer t' th' crunch berry pieces, 'n wit' some brightenin' from Strawberry (ripe) 'n Super Sweet, it beats TPA Crunchy Berry Cereal by nigh-on half a league.",

That said, capn crunch berry is my favorite all time cereal and Alfred Pudding is probably my favorite DIY artist, so I felt I owed it to myself to get the necessary ingredients and give this is a go. I have to say it is outstanding. It tastes better than I would have really even dared thought possible, it is just straight up Captain Crunch Berries in all its sweetened, delicious fruity glory. The Forest fruit, Strawberry ripe combo is brilliant and I say that mostly hating strawberry ripe. The brown sugar and the way it enmeshes itself with the cream and the milky undertones. It is straight up the best cereal vape I've ever had. I really, really am enjoying this. Thank you!"

I feel like you've hopefully forever-altered the course for cereal vapes to become as complex and delicious as this fine one here without a hint of artificiality. Have you considered a future in mixology (only half-kidding)? I know you're not icarus and wont fly TOO close to the sun (stay in school) but goddamnit if you aren't selling oneshots in no time. Would always love to hear more from you so maybe consider starting a podcast. Much love my puddin"

I always thought of forest fruit as a garbage flavor. It's dry\/thin and useless to me, BUT it does smell exactly like the berries in Cap'n Crunch. The most impressive thing to me, as a strawberry mute... I can taste sweet strawberry milk on the finish. Well fucking done Alfred and Burgundy."

            "text": "Very nicely surprising mix that taught me a few tricks that I wouldn't have thought about. Firstly I was really surprised at the cereal elements being so authentic without using some AP. I was wondering where the corn note was going to come from but it's there thanks to the FA Cookie and brown sugar combo. The use of Strawberry Ripe and Forest Fruit as the berry was equally surprising as the berry note. I wouldn't have thought that it would bend into a crunchberry but it does so perfectly. Spot on. My only criticism is a personal preference issue. FLV Cream tastes a little sour to me unless it's steeped longer than a week. Because of that I probably would have used FA Cream Fresh if I had developed this. I tried it at the recommended 5 days and got the sour note from FLV Cream. At 8 days it sunsided for me and became the delicious cereal milk as intended. All in all this is a great recipe with some nifty tricks. I will definitely put those tricks in the mixing spank bank for use later. "

I can tell some time was spent tweaking as the balance is wonderful and the flavors are pretty damn on point and that's just after a day or two steep. Will be hard to not dip into the bottle for another 3-5 days so I can get a decent steep. I think I'll have to give the captain crunch base a shot minus the berries because a big bowl o plain ol capn' is my jam.

Either way, it was an absolute pleasure talking with him through this process. One of my biggest gripes with all of the Crunch Berry flavors is the overbearing soap that comes with them. In response, Alfred worked his witchcraft and summoned a flavor that fit the bill so perfectly they should use it in the actual cereal. The combo of Forest Fruit and Strawberry Ripe create a deep berry blend that replicates crunch berries while also expanding on what makes that flavor so tasty. Cookie and Cereal 27 combine to create a crunchy and sweet puffed cereal that straddles the line between corny and oaty. A little Brown Sugar in there is an old cereal trick that turns Cookie into legit Cap\u2019n Crunch. Alfred worked out a magnificent milk base. FLV Cream adds some pretty serious body while Milky Undertones boosts the dairy notes and sweetens it up. These two flavors make for a noticeably creamy vape without impeding on the delicate cereal texture. It all comes together to hit every mark you want in a cereal. Stellar work, Alfred!!! Thanks for all the fun, my dude!"
