  "description": "Its close, i may need to slightly edit the banana percentages.\r\nBut here it is in all its glory THE BANANA CHURRO\r\n\r\nNotes.\r\nCap churro.\r\nThis is the main pastry of the mix, sitting at 3.35% it has just the right amount of texture and flavor without hitting play dough.\r\n\r\nCap Pralines and cream.\r\nThis is our pecan dusting, while simultaneously boosting our cream mix.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nCap Banana & Banana Split\r\nBanana split is the start of both our banana and our cream base.\r\nBoth are nice, but maintain the artificial flavor i was looking for.\r\nCap banana reminds me of store bought banana cream pie.\r\nBanana split is ever so slightly different, complementing cap banana and starting a great cream base.\r\n\r\nCap cake batter\r\nThis is our cream-churro bridge.\r\nAt this low of a percentage it complements the whole recipe.\r\nAdded depth to the churro and a touchy of creaminess to the banana.\r\n\r\nCap vanilla whipped cream\r\nThis is the part one of our topping.\r\nA delicious cream, and one that compliments the rest of the mix. light vanilla and a dense mouthfeel.\r\n\r\nCap Honey\r\nthe finishing touch. a light honey drizzle on top of our fluffy churro.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCap super sweet\r\nThis is a 3 fold ingredient\r\n1. It tames the playdoh flavor some people get from cap churro.\r\n2. The citric acid in CSS pops our banana nicely.\r\n3. its a sweet recipe, we dumped sweetened whipped cream, pralines and honey on top of a savory fried pastry.\r\n\r\n\r\nLive mixing video and notes here\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTPx2xo2Axg\r\n\r\nSupport me on Patreon! \r\nEvery dime go to bring you more content and recipes! \r\n https://www.patreon.com/ChefJohnWK\r\n\r\n\r\nJoin the Facebook group! \r\nhttps://www.facebook.com/groups/eatsleepmixrepeat/\r\n\r\n",
