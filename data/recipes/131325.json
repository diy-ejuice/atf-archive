  "name": " Coquito ( Puerto Rican Holiday Eggnog) ",
  "description": "Coquito meaning \"Little Coconut\" in Spanish is a traditional Christmas drink that originated in Puerto Rico. The coconut-based alcoholic beverage is similar to eggnog, hence it is sometimes called Puerto Rican Eggnog. The mixed drink is made with Puerto Rican rum, coconut milk, coconut cream, and sweetened condensed milk. Other spices and flavoring can be added, such as vanilla, cinnamon.  Some  versions are made with egg yokes.   I work with college who gives me a home made  bottle every  year and I  so look forward to it!!   \r\n\r\nThe combination  of  **WF coconut  custard**  and **FLV sweet coconut** work to create the coconut milk and cream ,  the coconut custard being much more cream then any custard and providing more of a top note for the coconut \r\n\r\nSome versions of coquito   also add  egg yokes to the mix   so  **FLV  eggnog and  PUR condensed milk**  helps to create some  density and volume to this  mix \r\n\r\n**VT light rum** is the perfect rum as it does not have any spices  or dark notes and  has a nice warm boose note on the finish\r\nThis mix is relatively sweet feel free to add sweetner of your choice - I would recommend FLV sweetness  \r\n\r\nNOTES/SUBS:    If you want a denser thicker  vape, you can substitue  WF coconut custard for the  custard of your choice., I would recommend FLV custard   The brighter coconut top notes will  decrease and vape will be denser.  PUR condensed milk    can be subbed with  FLV cream  but you will loose  some of the inherit sweetness and body the condensed milk provides .  The VT light rum  can be subbed  for  WF coconut rum but  you loose some of the  booze notes that occur on the back end and  add an additional top note to the coconut in the mix ( additionally is a thinner flavor)  \r\n \r\nRich cinnamon is 1 drop to 30 ml\r\n   \r\nLearn more about mixing here:\r\nfacebook - https://www.facebook.com/groups/diydownunder/\r\nDiscord - https://discord.gg/kH4Fqbc\r\nYoutube - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCTCwb7ULyfJALQlehomZZQA\r\nwebsite - https://www.diydownunder.com/\r\n\r\n\r\n",

I love the coconut milk flavor here, and it goes so well with the mix of warm spices.  The rum note is terrific as far as booziness and in a sense authenticity, but I wish it had some of that darker, sweeter molassesy or brown sugary rum flavor. It’s like it’s got spiced white rum in it and I’ve never heard of that, gimme some of that dark base to slide in under those spices and mingle with the richer coconut cream. "
