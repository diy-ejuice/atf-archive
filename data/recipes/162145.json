    "description": "Chocolate cream with sweetened hazelnuts.\r\nThis recipe looks as simple as its description but this flavourings make a really good Nutella flavour.\r\n\r\nThe king of this recipe is VTA Sweet Cream( now is my go to sweet cream), has a good vanilla note, lots of butter content and gives a rich-thick mouthfeel.\r\n\r\nDouble Chocolate Clear is artificial and not that good but here fits quite well as a sweet chocolate but Sweet Cream turns it into something better.\r\n\r\nFw Hazelnut is the best.\r\nHas some kind of creaminess and infuses its flavour perfectly into the cream, as well as a malty note that comes really handy in this recipe.\r\n\r\nAdd 0.5 super sweet to make it closer to the real thing.",
