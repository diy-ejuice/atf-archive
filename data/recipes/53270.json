  "description": "Everyone does Strawberry and Cream or Blueberry and Cream. I can't taste strawberry for the life of me and I wanted to play with mango, so here ya go. I was wanting to go a little more basic than this but felt it needed all the mango flavors. Apricot gives it a nice bit of tartness and the CAP Sweet Cream was completely an accident as I was meaning to grab CAP Super Sweet and didn't realize I had grabbed the wrong thing until it was already in the mix. Happy accident and it stays. This will absolutely be in my regular rotation from now on. I gave it 5 days steep, but I'm sure you can get by on a shake. Enjoy!",
