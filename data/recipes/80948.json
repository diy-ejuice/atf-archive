  "name": "Apricot Clafoutis",
  "description": "Clafoutis is a flan-like French dessert with fruit (typically cherries) but can be made with many different fruits. The only version I've actually had uses apricots and is now my favorite dessert. Of course, I had to make this into a vape.\r\n\r\n**FLV / FA Apricot/FW Butter Rum** - When I first tried FLV , this dessert came rushing back to my mind. It has a very cooked/baked warmth about it. Definitely has some sweetness with a subtle tart note. I used FA Apricot to add a bit of fullness and soften up the entire mix. The butter rum just adds a bit of brown sugar and a touch of a boozy note. \r\n\r\n**CAP Vanilla Custard/INW Creme Brulee/FW Cake Batter Dip** - To give you an idea of what I'm going after, this dessert is a very simple batter. It's basically milk,egg, sugar, vanilla and flour blended together. CAP VC seemed like an obvious choice. But I also wanted that caramelized sugar and creme brulee does that very well. It also adds a bit more egginess. Together, these 2 flavors remind more of a flan. The cake batter dip is just adding a bit of texture, while not making it too cakey.\r\n\r\n**FA Cream Whipped/FW Lemon Meringue Pie** - When I have this dessert, I choose not to cover with powdered sugar. Instead, I put a dollop of whipped cream with some lemon zest. Most lemon flavors come off as a lemon juice or is too candied. I needed just a touch of lemon. I settled on FW LMP. It adds a light lemon note that stays in the back round. FA whipped cream is still the closest to the real thing, imo. It's light, airy and not overly sweet. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
