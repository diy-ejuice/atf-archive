  "description": "Today on SaturDIY'ing with fresh03 and Friends! Poke'Mixing Generation 2! We're doing Pokémon! I chose Galarian Rapidash because it is a beautiful pink unicorn that packs a fireball, just like me!\r\n\r\nTPA Cotton Candy Circus/OOO Marshmallow Vanilla/WF Strawberry Gummy Candy = That's my candy, soft, chewie and full in the mouth. Also sweet enough that you don't need and sweetener.\r\n\r\nINW Raspberry/FLV Red Raspberry/FW Razzleberry = my usual tasty raspberry with a little FW razzle to turn it into a candy. Anytime you're making a pink candy, through a dash of razzle into it and you'll have a candy berry trick.\r\n\r\nGive it a couple of days and you'll have a juicy and powerful gummy, that's really tasty.\r\n\r\nEnjoy, be queer and vape on,\r\n\r\nCécile aka Queer Your Vape\r\n\r\n[Photo credits: Galarian Rapidash by Kiiro-nee-san ]",
