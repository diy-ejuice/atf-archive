  "name": "The Celtic KNOT (Irish cream milkshake  cocktail - all VT contest)",
  "description": "This is a creamy caramel boozie milkshake similar to the cocktail called a mudslide.     This is a really well balanced mix with sweet creamy vanilla caramel on the inhale and some of the  Irish cream and scotch coming out on the back end.    This  mix starts to come together at  5 days and  really is developed at about 10 -  days  as the Irish cream and ice cream develop\r\n\r\nThe base for this mix is hokey pokey ice cream ( re - labeled as toffee ice cream)\r\n The **sweet cream** adds a buttery creamy chocolate caramel note through the cream base. The **VT milkshake base** when used low adds a slight malted note that is needed in this mix.  **The hokey pokey ice cream** provides a really thick vanilla ice cream that adds a darker sweet toffee note to contrast the  lighter caramel note \r\n\r\n**Honey comb** provides some texture and  toffee/ chocolate notes to the mix as a topping \r\n\r\n**Irish cream and Scotch whiskey** combine to create a baileys type of boozie note to the mix, that come out on the back of the the exhale . The Irish cream on its own does not provide a boozie note as much as I thought for a VT flavor but it is a pretty spot on Irish cream, with a noticeable chocolate note it is actually similar  to the VT devon cream.. The Scotch whiskey is a SPOT on whiskey that unlike some of the other VT flavors can be used low and still provide the boozie scotch note \r\n\r\n\"Learn more about mixing here:\r\nhttps://www.facebook.com/groups/diydownunder/\r\nhttps://discord.gg/kH4Fqbc\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCTCwb7ULyfJALQlehomZZQA\r\nhttps://www.diydownunder.com/",
