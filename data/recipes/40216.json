    "description": "This tastes very close to a Fudge Round by Little Debbie. Thank you SubstanceD for the reference food :) \r\n\r\nCAP Chocolate Fudge Brownie makes up the majority of the chocolate outside cookies of the fudge round. It is a very potent flavor so .5% is a good amount to use and still have it be the main profile.\r\n\r\nFlv Frosting\/Fa Meringue\/Bavarian Cream\/FW Double Dutch Chocolate - these flavors make up the chocolate icing in the middle of the two chocolate cookies.\r\n\r\nFlv Cookie Dough\/CAP Funnel Cake are used to add a bit of processed flavor. Without them in this mix it seemed too gourmet tasting, it was good but not what I was going for. \r\n\r\nFA Meringue\/Cap Super Sweet are used to sweeten up the entire mix since these snack cakes are full of sugar.",
