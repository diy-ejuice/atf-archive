            "text": "Weeeeow, that\u2019s terrific! It\u2019s just absolutely dripping with juiciness, maybe the juiciest juice I\u2019ve EVER tried. That WS-23 and mint from the Cucumber Mint complement each other so well. The iciness doesn\u2019t drown out the flavor. 2% TFA Honeydew is about my limit for that stuff and it can be a bully, but it\u2019s not pushing out the cucumber, which is surprising. It actually seems to be amplifying it vs. Cucumber Mint as a single flavor. All of these flavors work together beautifully. The only thing I can really say by way of criticism is that I\u2019m not convinced 0.1% TFA Peppermint is actually doing anything at all here. It\u2019s not a very strong flavor - 3 or 4% is not an unheard of amount for something like a peppermint ice cream. However, I haven\u2019t tried it without it so I can\u2019t say for sure that it isn\u2019t doing anything. "
