  "description": "This is a very simple lemonade base.  To me its fantastic and here's my theory.  FA Lemon Sicily notoriously fades quickly and combine with LA Lemonade it gives you that great sweet lemonade up front.  The problem here is that you can't really mix much of it, this is where the FLV Lemonade comes in to play.  It takes 3-5 days to really open up, its fine as a SnV but starts to shine after a few days.  You get that really tart and sweet lemonade.  As the Sicily starts to fade the FLV Lemonade starts to get brighter and sweeter, thus extending the life of your lemonade base.  Add your fruits and ws-23 as you like.",

It's very tart and tangy at first, and then after a few days it morphs into a more sweet, almost canned or powdered lemonade...which is by no means a bad thing. This has become a staple for me in my mixes."

I get a bright sweet artificial lemonade taste, kind of like the cheap lemonade you get from the supermarket, (which happens to be my fave type of lemonade). This will easily become my go to base for lemonade mixes in the future. "
