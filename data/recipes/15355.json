  "description": "This is a spin off of MBV Thug juice and I like it 100x better. Juicy cactus, jungle juice vape. After about a week the cactus comes to life.\r\nThis is great for cleansing your pallet. My go to juice when I get vapor tongue.\r\nI highly recommend trying this juice. If you don't like thug juice I know you will enjoy this.\r\n\r\nEdit: you can adjust koolada to taste.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nJungle juice + cactus is magical the cactus totally enhances the jungle juice with the juicy effects also adding the cactus flavor making it delicious. Koolada for a chilled effect and you can adjust it to your personal preference.\r\n\r\n",
