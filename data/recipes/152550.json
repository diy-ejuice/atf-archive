  "description": "TFA Banana Nut Bread is a solid flavor on it's own, however I like my banana nut bread with a bit of that frosting on top. VT Carrot Cake provides buttery richness and moisture to the body as well as a sweet buttercream frosting . You don't want too much carrot cake here though, as it is quite rich and will drown out the subtleties of the banana nut bread.  MB Nut Banana will add some of the awesome MB soft banana notes to counter any slight fading as well as adding some welcomed extra hazelnut.\r\nYou could play around with percentages to suit your tastes but this combo should get you there. At 12% of flavoring I found this gold enough to share as a quick and \"deliberately\" and carefully consolidated  3 flavor mix. \r\n\r\nI use a single coil RDA , 0.28 Ohms 50 Watts.",
