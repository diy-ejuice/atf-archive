  "description": "This is the result of a collaboration with Max Savage and originated from an idea that Silky had. Silky recommended that I try FA Passion, FA Papaya, and FA Guava together to scratch my itch for a funky fruit mix. I tried it out, but it wasn't weird enough. So Max Savage and I went through a few iterations to nail down an odd, but delicious combination of flavors. The end result is somewhat of a tropical smoothie, and I really enjoy it. \r\n</lb>\r\nWe started out using Guanabana, but it didn't get along with the profile so it was tossed. Yakima Hops any higher was adding too much bitterness, and CAP Sweet Mango wasn't showing up enough at 3%. My favorite part of this mix is FA Papaya, it adds a wonderful and smooth quality to the vape, and tones down all of the sharper edges of Yakima Hops and Pink Guava. FA Passion adds some nice brightness, and the super sweet makes everything pop. ",

When I looked at this I did think it was going to tare my throat up, but I was really pleasantly surprised that did not happen .  It is a funky fruity mix  for real  and I totally love that .    Not sure I think it is  a smoothie,, it does not have that density   but it is more of a  syrup like  nectar beverage  perhaps.       I  may take some liberties with this mix and see if I can i get it to work in a pods   (Well done pudding you  freakazoid  ...  much like your mix  that is  meant in a really good way  :-) ) "

      "text": "I wasn't sure if Alfred had lost his mind again or had just been listening to way too much James Brown. That being said I was glad to help scratch his funky itch (and I went pretty deep in there). Probably the most interesting thing that I got from this recipe is how FA Papaya really tones down the harshness of FA Passionfruit. I personally get somewhat of a funky tropical fruit smoothie out of this recipe. It's kinda hard to sell someone on a funky like this recipe, but this recipe has yakima hops and pink guava so that's enough of a reason to mix it up."
