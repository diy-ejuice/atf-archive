  "description": "Mixed up for the current DIY Downunder Challenge. A simple 3 flavor pear recipe consisting of a juicy pear, smooth buttery coconut cream, topped with crumbled graham crackers. I'm happy with the ingredients used in this recipe, might adjust percentages in the future but it's tasting good right now. Sweetener is optional, but I prefer 1-2 drops of CAP Super Sweet to give the dessert more of a sugary note. \r\n\r\n+ TFA Cheesecake Graham Crust - this concentrate is a triple threat in this recipe. Used mainly for the graham crust notes, but it also has some creamyness to it which plays nicely with sweet coconut. Lastly, it has a slight coconut note which also works well for this recipe. \r\n\r\n+ FA Pear - I get a really nice juicy pear note from this concentrate, and that's exactly what it's being used for in this mix. \r\n\r\n+ FLV Sweet Coconut - this to me, is a smooth buttery coconut flavoring. One of the best coconut concentrates I've tried. It works very nicely with the other two flavorings and just adds a wonderful coconut cream note to the recipe. \r\n\r\n+ Optional sweetener - I used 0.25 cap super sweet, but it's not an essential thing if you don't wanna use it. I just like a touch of sweetener in my dessert vapes. \r\n\r\n",
