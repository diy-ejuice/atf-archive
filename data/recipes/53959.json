    "description": "I can't quite remember which ATF recipe ID10-T said that TPA Dragonfruit kinda tastes like the essence of a white gummy bear, but it got my gears going...I single flavor tested this stuff up to 15% and was like...yeah...this shit is like licking a bag of melted white gummy bears...I knew off the top that I was gonna be settling at 5% Dragonfruit as my main note. \r\n\r\nWhat can I possibly add to this to make it stand out?\r\n\r\nWell, I need a base. Grabbed some TPA Gummy Candy and while it was a decent texturizer, it didn't quite give that chewy feeling I was going for. CAP Jelly Candy really gave me that chew that I was looking for, but needed a little help. Along comes, CAP Vanilla Whipped Cream to perfectly round out the chewiness of the exhale. Almost there, but not quite.\r\n\r\nThis isn't juicy enough...So, I grabbed some INW Cactus. That shit can make anything juicy. Started it at 1% and while that was juicy, I didn't get that mouth-watering sensation that I associate with eating gummy bears. Bumped it to 2, yes 2%, and got exactly what I wanted.\r\n\r\nNow, here's the kicker. \r\n\r\nUnfortunately, you can't just go into a store (at least not around here) and grab a bag containing only white gummy bears. The rest of those little fuckers are coming along for the ride. But at this point, I'm already 4 flavors into the mix and I don't want to add 4-5 more individual flavors to give the background notes of the rest of the gummy bears in the bag. In comes FW Beetle Juice. I haven't used this stuff since I made 500mL of Shurb v4 months ago. But I remember it tasting like a bunch of different fruits. Almost like it was created just to be a fruit melody background. I get a little bit of rasberry and something reminiscent of a tropical juice. I added it at 2% right away and boy...it kinda fights with TPA Dragonfruit for the star of the show. It's like eating 5 white gummy bears with 1 of each of the other flavors in the bag.\r\n\r\nJune 2017 Recipe Thread: https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/DIY_eJuice\/comments\/6ei80w\/june_2017_recipe_thread\/djt5lyh\/?context=10000\r\n\r\n*Recently tested with a lowered percentage of FW Beetle Juice and added INW Pineapple @ 1.5%. The Pineapple is definitely a prominent tropical note, but the Dragonfruit is still the star of the show.\r\n\r\nSettling on what you currently see above. The pineapple and dragon fruit is a delicious blend at the top while cherries, raspberries, and blackberries play in the background. \r\n",

Even down to the gummy bear texture. But, it\u2019s seriously messed up by tasting waaaaaay too floral and even a bit bitter upfront from the 2% cactus. That is a ton of cactus. It seems like some cactus is a good idea for that juiciness, but much much less than 2%. Would love to see this \u201cfixed\u201d somehow, but admittedly I\u2019m not sure how. The creator says 1% cactus wasn\u2019t enough. How would you get more juiciness in there without messing up that neat profile. Maybe a very light touch of TFA Honeydew in addition to some amount of Cactus that\u2019s less less than 2%? Or maybe some of that really juicy WF Starfruit?"

I subbed cap VWC with TFA whipped cream as I don't want to order it just for one recipe, so hopefully that doesn't throw it off too much. Excellent fruity gummy, beetle juice adds a whole other layer of complexity."
