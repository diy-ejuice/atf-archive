  "description": "**NOTE: NW eucalyptus mint is a place holder for   WF  eucalyptus mint**\r\nSimple and tasty mix when you  have a cold or have vapors tongue  .  The **WF  eucalyptus mint** is  lighter  and sweeter and less menthol then the INW and can even be vaped by  it self.    there is also a very subtle citrus note.    it does fade a bit after 5 - 7 days, and blends into the mix nicely.    \r\n\r\nThe use of  **fuji apple**  adds a bright sweet juiciness to the mix  and is well contrasted by the **cap sweet guava**  for some citrus notes   and  sweet thick mouth feel.  \r\n\r\n**candy roll** is  used as  texturizer here and can  and add a sweet tart  texture candy  base\r\nThis also works well with honeysuckle in  place of the  Sweet Guava  for a  more floral note, as it adds the body  and sweetness of a  sweet guava  with a different flavor profile.  \r\n\r\nAdd Sweetner to your preference  I used FLV sweetnes at .30 .\r\n\r\nLearn more about mixing here:\r\nfacebook - https://www.facebook.com/groups/diydownunder/\r\nDiscord - https://discord.gg/kH4Fqbc\r\nYoutube - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCTCwb7ULyfJALQlehomZZQA\r\nwebsite - https://www.diydownunder.com/\r\n",
