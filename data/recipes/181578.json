  "description": "I’ve taken on the task of producing a line of custards, which I’ve dubbed “Majesty Reserve.” This is the original and first of the line of custard based liquids meant to satisfy and appeal to all of my fellow custard heads. \r\n\r\nThis first liquid is meant to be a sweet, rich and creamy custard accentuated by the pleasant and enticing note of praline. Overall, I’m pretty satisfied with how it turned out. It satisfies my custard craving and I hope it does the same for you. \r\n\r\nThis definitely isn’t a shake and vape. Testing at ten days, the flavor was light. Testing again five days later and it’s starting to shine. The pralines give off a rich aroma and the custards with the sugar cookie provide a delectable, thick mouthfeel and scrumptious flavor. Enjoy!",
