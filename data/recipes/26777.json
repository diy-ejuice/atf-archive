    "description": "This is a mix that showcases the sheer beauty and delight of Passion fruit! Not a ton of mixers use this flavor, but it is incredibly versatile, blending well with teas, creams, and lots of other fruits. An Exotic fruit, it is bright and sweet but has a bit of an acidic edge. \r\nTo showcase this fruit, I put it front and center. Because it can be so bright, I wanted to add some earthiness and depth, which is where the fig comes in.  It gives the passion fruit dimension without detracting from it's beauty. Last, I added the caramel, to enhance the natural sweetness of the fruits and take the acid of the passion fruit down a smidge so that it can be enjoyed all day.",

            "text": "Where to start...&#xD;\nPassion Fruit has a way of overwhelming much of what most mixers want to pair it with in a mix.  Here, the flavor notes could not be more spot on.  It is front and center.  This definitely is a passion fruit mix!  How it got to be unique and enjoyable is where Chapel earns all the praise here.  The earthiness she describes in the notes is what Fig brings to the mix.  But, ya gotta know here that this attempt would have fallen on its face without bringing down the acidity, the same acidity that keeps many mixers away from Passion Fruit.  Caramel did it, and if you gave it to 50 mixers to try I would doubt that more than 1 would have been able to pick it out.  Masterful.  Add to that, I don't think the earthiness of Fig would have been able to peek it's head through on this recipe without the caramel doing what it did.  It's a great mix, and I appreciate it more for doing EXACTLY what the notes say it does more than anything else.  Huge props to Chapel for taming Passion Fruit...and with only 3 flavorings!  Not an all day for me, but I appreciate this liquid on a whole different level.    This recipe is a well deserved top 10 winner in the comp, and is a recipe that matches it's notes more than any other I have come across.  Super impressed."
