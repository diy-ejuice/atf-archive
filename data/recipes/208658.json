    "description": "I really wanted to jump into Raspberries.  I love FA Raspberry as it is the flavor of one my favorite candies, but I wanted to use it in a supporting role.  Build a more comprehensive flavor.\r\n\r\nRaspberries, the NF Raspberry Syrup at 2% is actually SSA Raspberry Syrup.  My first time using it, and it is fantastic.  I added a little of FA Raspberry to boost the note on the top.  I must say I really love it.\r\n\r\nI added a bit of FA Forest fruit just to deepen the berry.  Give it a little variety and depth.\r\n\r\nThe Gummy bit.  I really like Sour Gummy Candy by WF and have used it quite a bit at this point.  I don't have many gummy candies that don't have a particular fruit profile already in place.  So I may grab another and try it at some point, but for now WF seems to fit the bill.  I added a bit of CAP Strawberry Taffy to give both a taffy mouth feel and to add a bit more contrasting candy red fruit flavor.  I like it for that.\r\n\r\nA bit of Super Sweet pulls things together nicely.  Still a work in progress, but I really like this right off the shake.  Duel coil Kennedy on a stacked mech is how I vape.  So usually starts around 250 Watts.\r\n\r\n",
