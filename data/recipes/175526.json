  "description": "I wanted to create something I could actually vape.  Honestly, if you aren't as sensitive as I am, you'll likely want to pretty much triple all the ingredient percentages.   I get Chococlate cake, vanilla/almond cream with a hint of pistachio.  My hubby tasted sweet air.  Soooo...while the mixture of these ingredients might be great, you may have to adjust the percentages to suit your tastes.  I wouldn't go higher on the chocolate donut flavor beyond 5% or it will just overtake the entire mixture.  If you are turning everything else up, keep donut at like 4.5%.  This recipe won't work in a pod, all you'll taste is sweet chocolate donut. Might not be bad but it won't have nuances.  ",
