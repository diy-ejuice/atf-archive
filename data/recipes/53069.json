  "description": "In the original recipe I mixed up on the show I used 1% of flv sweetness.  While in the long run this isn't bad, it does have too much of the stevia backnote for me at this level, but it will steep out after about a month. I dropped it in this recipe to a more reasonable level of 0.35% but that means initially the mix won't be as sweet.  If you want it sweeter add some sucralose based sweetener to your liking instead. \r\n\r\nOverall the flavor is almost there now that it has had a 10 day steep. It tastes like a mouthful of the new m and m candies.  While I'm not a huge fan of the LB chocolate roll taste, as it does kind of taste like cheap chocolate, it is authentic to the type of cheap chocolate flavor that the candies actually have...though I guess I'm a bit of a chocolate snob and have been spoiled on European chocolate which is so much better than ours in America. \r\n\r\nI may still adjust this recipe after I let this mix steep for the full month, which I think the chocolates and cream and peanut flavors really need, but the coffee notes are good. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPhoto Credit: photo credit: slambo_42 <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/25356247@N00/1313728833\">Mega Ms</a> via <a href=\"http://photopin.com\">photopin</a> <a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/2.0/\">(license)</a>",
