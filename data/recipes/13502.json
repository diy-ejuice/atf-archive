    "description": "Elderflower cordial.  Think St. Germain. I'm still waiting to be rocketed into the fourth dimension of existence.  Until then, I'm going to miss cocktails... I mix at 75% VG.  Certified shake and vape.  Actually a bit better fresh before the champagne mutes everything all to shit.",

I've been trying to make an elderflower recipe (St. Germain is great stuff), and it's tricky, because it's a really strong flavor with a bitter aftertaste.  I find myself trying to dial it down, but this recipe takes the opposite approach, pairing it up with other florals that can stand up to it.  The inhale is great on this.  But, my criticism for this recipe is that I still get a lot of bitter aftertaste from the Elderflower and gin.  Definitely a lot of potential here, though."

I love this use of FA Gin and it has pretty much sold me on Elderflower. The use of Koolada was spot on for a cocktail vape with these flavors. Using INW Pineapple as a texturizer is some genius level tom foolery. The overall smoothness of the vape kept me coming back. This is simply a great vape, thank you!"
