    "description": "FLV Guanabana and CAP Sweet Guava create a delicious mix but i wanted some more so i added CAP Yellow Peach to increase the level of sweetness and complexity of the flavour, but still there was something that made this juice a bit linear, so i looked for a flavouring that gave a twist to the profile without changing its soul, and i came with FW Yumberry is juicy, its fruity and quite strange so this was the missing link to turn this recipe from mediocre to really tasty. \r\n\r\nI always add 0.75% Super sweet and 1% Ws-23 but i think without it is still pretty tasty. \r\n",
