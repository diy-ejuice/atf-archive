    "name": "RY4 Cream Pie",
    "description": "*A delicious RY4 rendition in cream pie form. Indulge your senses as you inhale this caramel\/butterscotch, graham, vanilla whipped cream pie with an RY4 bite!*\r\n  \r\n**TFA RY4 Double: My choice for the light tobacco note was obvious. I have every RY4 brand imaginable...but I always come \"home\" to TFAs RY4 Double. This is due to its stronger caramel note and its light yet biting tobacco back note. I never did get much vanilla from this flavor, but vanilla swirl will solve that issue as you read on.**\r\n  \r\n**CAP CDS: My mix seemed kind of one-dimensional in a way that's hard to articulate. This very scant amount of CDS added a bit more accent to the tobacco note in the RY4 Double. It kind of hits you on the back of the tongue. Don't worry if you don't like cinnamon vapes. It's positively not utilized in order to be prominent. It's only used as an accent. And very necessary in order for the mix to \"POP\" the way it's intended! One can argue that this concentrate is performing double duty on the down low, as it brings out the graham in Lucky Shot to a mouth-watering degree.**\r\n  \r\n**FW Bavarian Cream, TFA Caramel Candy & FW Butterscotch Natural: Every great RY4 eliquid I've ever fallen in love with adds Bavarian Cream. It adds an almost light... bitter(?) and heavy quality that seems to enhance caramels and butterscotch to a more \"soft-cracked\" state. Marrying these three ingredients together makes the perfect caramel-butterscotch in my opinion.**\r\n  \r\n**FW White Chocolate & TFA Vanilla Swirl: This luscious combination of white chocolate & creamy Vanilla Swirl is added for a thicker\/creamy vanilla mouth feel. I find I've been using TFA Vanilla Swirl in anything from creams to milks. It's just that versatile. And when combined with the perfect complement flavor, it can't be beat! I tried all manner of whipped cream concentrates here but they just couldn't hold up against the bold caramel\/butterscotch. So I had to make my own whipped cream topping from scratch**\r\n  \r\n**OSDIY Lucky Shot: Yep. This time, I saved the best for last. I purchased this on a whim and immediately went back online to buy a 120ml. It's just that good. However, I find that as a single flavor the taste becomes a bit \"tangy\" for my liking. It's described, on OSDIY's website, as a smooth and complex mixture of graham cracker, heavy vanilla and caramel notes. And trust me, it lives up to its' description! Absolutely GORGEOUS flavor!**\r\n\r\n  \r\n*This definitely kicks butt at 75VG*\r\n\r\n**Do not take it upon yourself to copy and publish this recipe over to ELR.
