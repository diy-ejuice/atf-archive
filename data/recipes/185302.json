    "description": "What can I say? I mean, two delicious breakfast items stacked a top one another is complete and utter heaven!\r\nWhat we have here is a Donut covered in Cream Cheese Icing, and then dipped in Cinnamon Crunch Cereal... Yummo, to say the least.\r\nAre you that person that's just got a sweet tooth, severe case of the munchies, perhaps a single bachelor with nothing but a bottle of hot sauce, an out dated carton of milk in the fridge, a box of cereal in the cabinet, and a dozen krispy kreme's hidden away in the microwave? Then simply ask yourself... What can I make!... Well to answer your question, MIX THIS UP!!\r\n\r\nLet me break it down for ya!..\r\n(FA) Zeppola is used as the Donut, while (TPA) VBIC is here to help fill it in.\r\n(TPA) Whipped Cream adds some fluffiness to the Donut.\r\n(LA) Cream Cheese Icing speaks for itself, while pairing with (TPA) Dairy Milk, lends a hand for a creamier Icing finish.\r\n(VT) Honeycomb is here to add some subtle Honey notes, deep richness, and more texture to the Cereal topping.\r\nNow to finish it off, we've got (TPA) Cinnamon Sugar Cookie. This is an important one, \"the topping on the cake\" if you will... This is used as the Crunch Cereal topping, as it obviously brings the cinnamon into play, but also provides more body to the Donut and adds that grainy sugary type texture to complete the crunchy Cereal topping.\r\n\r\nPlease give it a rating if you enjoy it!\r\nThis is definitely going to be one of my new ADV's!!\r\nHAPPY MIXING, & HAPPY VAPING!!! ;-)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

I had to sub the dairy milk with OOO Milky Underpants,  but I assume it\u2019s not the start of the show anyway because this really turned out great. I can\u2019t wait until it steeps for a bit... I\u2019m gonna have to make a second batch for that though, because I\u2019m gonna vape this 20ml tonight probably."
