    "description": "This recipe did not go down the road I envisioned it would when I was formulating it, but after quite a few mixes and tweaks I found it oddly alluring and so unique that I just had to get it out there. There are quite a few vapers that do not like yogurt, coffee, or peppermint flavors so I don't anticipate a wide acceptance. If you are looking for something different, make a small batch and give it a try - it might surprise you. \r\n\r\nThe inhale has a smooth coolness to it. During the initial exhale I get slight hints of chocolate, coffee, vanilla, and cream. At the end of the exhale the yogurt twang fills in with a peppermint back note that lingers on the pallet. I find this formulation yields a very smooth (at least as peppermint can be) vape experience",
