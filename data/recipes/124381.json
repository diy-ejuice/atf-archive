  "description": "I got back into fruits thanks to an old bottle of Bombies Cold Press I found, so i initially dove into citrus. This is the result. Terrorhawk is awesome, and was an inspiration for this, but I enjoy this much more. It's a sweet, floral grapefruit backed up with some dark berries. \r\n\r\nFLV Pink Guava - Not much to say, it's an awesome grapefruit. Very sweet, almost sticky, I needed the brighter, more realistic grapefruit notes. \r\n\r\nFLV Lychee - This stuff is great. I enjoy it at 1% on it's own or with a little WS-23. Very sweet lychee, more of a syrup. \r\n\r\nINW White Grapefruit - If you've never tried this solo do it. It is intensely floral, concentrated grapefruit pith. So, so good. It's super potent, so .25 brings that bitter pith I wanted for the grapefruit. \r\n\r\nFA Forest Mix - An easy choice for berries. Good on it's own, here it blends into and mellows the sharpness of the citrus. \r\n\r\nFA Sicilian Mix - Another one I would vape solo. A very good mix of lemon, lime, and syrupy orange. Not too tart, but pushes the citrus further. \r\n\r\nFW Ruby Red Grapefruit - A Pretty accurate grapefruit juice. Dry and bright, with a little pith bitterness. I really like this stuff, and here it rounds out out our grapefruit, bringing it more into candy / juice territory rather than an accurate grapefruit. \r\n\r\nTPA Honeysuckle - I wanted more floral but more INW White Grapefruit could be lethal, so in comes Honeysuckle. Lightly floral, sweet, and wet. \r\n\r\nWS-23 - This can obviously be increased to taste. The goal here was to have the mix chilled, not cold. Any higher and it was muting top notes for me. \r\n\r\nINW Cactus - This adds just a touch of that cactus 'wtf is that' and some wet. I think it adds a little complexity that was missing without it.\r\n\r\nFA Lime Tahity Cold Pressed - I wanted to push the sharpness of the citrus even further, and was having a hard time doing it until a reddit conversation gave me the little light over my head. This stuff is intense, and I'd say pretty floral. I love it. Too much and it will choke you out though. \r\n\r\nThe Burninator because it will punch you in your little bitch throat. I enjoy the harshness of the citrus fresh, but if you want to avoid that i'd give it a week or more. ",
