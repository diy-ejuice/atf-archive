  "description": "An explosive profile created based on the flavour affinities shared between Lychee, Ginger and Lime. Bright tropical toned fruit profile with a bitterish zesty lime and a dark syrupy ginger\r\n\r\nLychee\r\nI have used a combination of Cap Sweet Lychee andFLV Lychee to create a sweet almost over ripe tropical Lychee. I added FA pear to offset some of the dry notes from the FLV Lychee and to supplement the tropical tones of the lychee.\r\n\r\nLime\r\ni had a hard time deciding between FA Tahiti Cold Pressed and FA Florida Key Lime. Fa Florida is sharper and carries less of a zest. this would typically be my go to but the idea here was to have a bit of fun. so I chose Cold pressed, i felt the heavier zest bitterness will play nicely off the floral sweetness of the Lychee. but this also meant I had to be quite careful not to over flavour as cold pressed is very overpowering\r\n\r\nGinger: \r\nI had my mind set on FLV Ginger, alas I was all out and its doesnt seem to be stocked locally anymore. i would have preferred it as it is a more robust, syrupy, sweet ginger which would have been perfect for this profile and would have reduced the need for additional sweetener. if you have FLV Ginger use that instead at around the 0.5% mark\r\n\r\nSo I settled for FW Ginger. is it quite a linear, dry ginger but I was pretty much shit out of luck here. I i reckoned this will work well as the CAP Sweet Lychee has quite a syrupy quality and so I just added the smallest touch of FA Molasses and TFA DX Brown sugar just to push it to the dark side a tad bit. I chose DX because it is quite a bit darker than the OG.\r\n\r\nThe ginger settles in after about a week. I prefer this shake and vape as the ginger is nice and sharp straight off the shake. the Lychee also has a habit of turning quite floral at such a high percentage. So i almost want to say make only enough that would last you 2 or so days for best results.\r\n\r\nI quite enjoy the better zesty lime but if you want something bit more timid then feel free to sub with FA Florida Key Lime at the same % maybe a touch higher.\r\n\r\ndropped a tad bit sweetener to tame the lime zest just a tad bit\r\n",
