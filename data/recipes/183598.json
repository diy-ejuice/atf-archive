  "description": "Welcome to the 70's.\r\n \r\nA hazy purple funk all dressed up in a kaleidoscope of bell bottoms, bandanas, and tie-dye. A time when psychedelic, glam and heavy metal rock blasted from mega speakers at fairgrounds, stadiums and garages.\r\nCan you dig it? The take a good long pull of Monster Ultra Violet. Crisp and refreshing, with a sweet and tart pixie dust flavor powered with our Monster Energy Blend.\r\n\r\nTo make the purple juice i used TPA Grape Juice and MB Queen Grapes while they are pretty similar, i think using both they make a fuller purple juice.\r\nVTA Grape Juice for the bottom flavour and tart pixie stick notes \r\nIs perfect also has a bubble gum flavour that sells the Energy drink profile perfectly in combination with FLV Pink Guava wich adds the grapefruit tart notes and that overall fake fruity vibe monster drinks have.\r\n\r\nThis type of drinks are really sweet and served chilled so 0.75% Super Sweet and 2% Ws23 fit perfectly as cooling and sweetness balance each other but feel free to adjust the cooling.",
