    "description": "Here it is: my ADV purple vape. I really enjoyed the original recipe that inspired this recipe, or alteration of the original you could say. However, I needed something more personally. Without venturing too far and abandoning the intrinsically wonderful grape qualities of the original, I only tweaked it to give myself a wonderfully satisfying grape candy offering. \r\n\r\nI added the Fuji at the recommendation of the creator to up the refreshing aspect of the recipe. I added marshmallow and whipped cream in minute amounts for mouth feel and smoothness and hard candy to drive home the candy aspect of the overall grape profile. Sweetener is simply used to further accentuate the candy properties, but it is used sparingly to the point that it doesn\u2019t make the recipe cloying. Not to mention, your coils will thank you later. \r\n\r\nI hope you enjoy this as much as I do. All credit and thanks to the original creator, RockyHarlow, for inspiring this. \r\n\r\nSNV certified.
