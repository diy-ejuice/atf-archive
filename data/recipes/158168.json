    "description": "*Easy to mix, hard to define.*\r\n\r\nActually it's not that hard to define, I just thought that sounded cool. The taste is very similar to a licorice ice cream, but with a bit thicker mouthfeel. Personally I think this can be shake and vaped. The vanilla note is a bit more prominent the first few days, but as always with custards they start to shine after a bit of a steep.\r\n\r\n**FA Black Touch** it a great licorice flavor that is very much like Scandinavian licorice candy.\r\n**FA Custard Premium** is not available in the US AFAIK, but you guys don't seem to like black licorice either so I guess thats fine. Here's a couple of European sites that sell it:\r\nUK - https:\/\/chefsflavours.co.uk\/custard-prem-flavourart\/\r\nDenmark - https:\/\/dindamp.dk\/en\/flavourart-aroma\/1283-2622-flavourart-premium-custard-aroma-originalemallage.html\r\n\r\nThis is very much a work in progress, but I wanted to share it anyway because I enjoy it a lot, and I think it's a bit unique. I think a lot of Northern Europeans are going to like this. Feedback is very much apriciated! Keep mixing wierd stuff all you beautiful folks out there <3",

I don't get any black licorice at all from this but what I do get is a very dark and different custard that really is unique. Great work on this. "

My first try of custard Premium and they hype is real. Do yourself a favor and give this a good steep. At 3 weeks, this is a magnificent mix. Licorice is sweet and candied and soft, custard is strong and complimentary at the same time, marshmallow gives it body and sweet. The whole thing is glorious with no one flavor dominating. I could see experimenting with this more but, why? when it's already great!"
