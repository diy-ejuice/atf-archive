I never was big on dragon fruit at least as a primary element. While the dragon fruit isn't a primary flavor it's definitely noticeable enough. The core strawberry and cream is very solid and worth experimenting with. Definitely a solid flavor overall.&#xD;\n&#xD;\nAt 1 month this really excellent. The dragon fruit has calmed significantly. You can still taste the element right after the strawberry but it\u2019s far more blended in and has less of that dragon fruit bite to it. Nicely creamy and flavorful. Definitely easy to see why this one is popular.&#xD;\n&#xD;\nNotes - I made this same recipe sans the dragon fruit to see how it would work to build from. After revisiting it at 1 month though I might just try adding some NY cheesecake to it or sweet cream to suit my flavor preferences. Without the dragon fruit it definitely tastes like it's missing something. Another lesson learned, every flavor contributes to the whole and you can't always just axe what you don't like."

The strawberry flavor is extremely bright, thanks to the dragon fruit. The milky base made from a combination of bavarian cream and cheesecake (graham crust) is very mellow and enjoyable. As some people have said, as this steeps the strawberry does fade a bit. Overall this recipe is extremely well balanced and impressively made from all TPA flavors.  "

Such a simple profile, and extremely well done. Definitely a reliable, big-batch strawberry cream recipe all you fuckers should try. I have another 60mL awaiting a full month of aging."
