  "name": "Butterscotch and Bailey's Irish cream cannoli",
  "description": "This is just a recipe i was playing around with and i was really happy with how it turned out. Authentic who knows i think it is but i also haven't ever had one of these sweet treats. This came about from discovering how nice the chocolate notes were in my recent tobacco recipe from using flv mocha and flv smoked butterscotch. So here rather than smoked butterscotch i used just normal flv butterscotch because i think it will just work better. I then basically built my recipe around that combination of mocha and butterscotch. I again am getting a good chocolate vibe with this combination not to much and not to little. I then added a little flv irish cream really low because i didn't want it to too irish cream heavey. Then i added some vanilla custard v1 for the irish cream to blend with for  the cannoli filling. For the cannoli body i used flavor art joker because i really like it and it just works. Do i need a better reason to use it than that? Lol.  I find flavor art joker to be a great cannoli crust i dont get much if any filling from it but thats fine because i would rather make my own filling for it anyway.. Anyway for just playing around i really like how this turned out. Hopefully a few of you will actually have the ingredients and will actually give this a mix. Enjoy!!\r\n\r\n\r\nI added .35% flavorah sweetness you can use or dont use your preferred sweetener at your preferred percentage.",
