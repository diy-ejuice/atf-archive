Honestly, the idea here makes sense, while I haven't tried the recipe or the real world counterpart, I can assume what it should taste like. The issue here is that there is just far too many muting concentrates for anything to really come through here, save for a whole lot of mouth feel. TPA Orange Cream is gonna need some back up, regardless, to really suggest that orange flavour I'm assuming you are looking for. The use of Sugar Cookie and CCI is a pretty smart move here to suggest that kind of store-bought cake-y pastry experience. However, all of the good is just drowned out by a simple case of over flavouring and over complicating. With CCI and Cream Fresh, you don't even need the Creamy Yogurt or the Sweet Cream. All in all, one of the better attempts I've seen from our boy Conrad, but a little more foresight into how the flavours work together and impact each other would allow for a significantly better recipe. Cheers."
