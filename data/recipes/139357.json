  "description": "If the Godfather of DIY asks for a flapper pie you better make it happen :-) Hey I am from Jersey I know how this works. \r\nFlapper pie is a vanilla custard pie topped with meringue with a graham cracker crust. \r\nOn the inhale you get a get a thick creamy vanilla custard that transitions to a dark cinnamon brown sugar graham crust on the exhale.\r\nI personally enjoy this on a recurve RDA at about 60 - 65 watts \r\n\r\n\r\nThe **flapper pie** is a great and if pushed high can be a  SF, but with some support it is amazing.   **VT  creme brulee** is a nice  light egg vanilla custard with more  of a caramel dark note then a dark burnt sugar  so works well here .    \r\n\r\nThe Pie Shell (**Pastry zest, graham crust, cinnamon sugar**)  is based on @RinVapes  https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/134961#cinnamon_pear_tart_by_rinvapes  It is perfect here as it works as a pie shell that holds up in creams and  I get a really solid graham shell.   The pastry zest seems to add a grainy sugar  note and the citrus helps bring froward the sweetness of the creme brulee   as well. \r\n\r\n",
