  "name": "Blueberry Basil Peach Fizz",
  "description": "A fruity blueberry basil peach fizz that begs to be your favorite summer cocktail.\r\n\r\nPeaches, Blueberries, they are awesome on their own, but I couldn’t help using them as inspiration for a sweet, summery cocktail. \r\nMy first idea was to make a peach fizz, but I wanted to mix things up a bit so I added blueberry and basil as a nice twist on the classic cocktail. I love this combination because they are all iconic summer flavors and they all pair so well together. This also works as a very fun mocktail if you leave out the gin.\r\n\r\nRF SC Blueberries & Cream with TFA Blueberry Extra combined with  Peach Cream from Molin Berry mixed with FA White Peach for that lovely summer fruity mix. \r\nMolinberry Peach Cream is a wonderful flavor i recently discovered. Soft juicy peach in a beautiful creamy base. It can be subbed with a Peach Cream of your choice.\r\n\r\nFor the bubbles i used the RF SC Creamsoda to give that fizzy sensation. Finally, adding somec FLV Basil for a light, fresh and fennel taste.\r\n\r\nLet the flavors blend...Steep, minimum 3 days, ",
