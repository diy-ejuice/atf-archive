  "description": "A ripe golden delicious apple. Juicy, warm golden delicious apple flesh with a light peel note on the tail end.\r\n\r\n\r\nTPA Quince- Used for the juicy apple/pear volume of the fruit. The spicier top notes help reinforce the lingering peel.\r\n\r\nINW Cherimoya- A sweaty overripe tropical banana flavor, used to convey the ripeness and the warmth of an apple that's just barely on the cusp of being overripe. Adds some creaminess to the overall mix, keeping the juiciness of the Quince and Cactus from reading like straight apple juice.\r\n\r\nINW Cactus- Used primarily for the wetness and to keep the vape pleasant.  At this percentage, smooths the throat hit from the cherimoya and quince.  Any green aloe notes push toward to back end of the exhale and bolster the peel.  A bit recognizable S&V, it calms down and homogenizes well overnight.",

Putting the individual ingredients into the recipe, I thought hmmm, how's this going to work and then when it was all said and done and I gave it a whiff I was just like damn, this here is some alchemy. I do get a bit of a banana, more of a sweeter banana though with some sort of fruit-esque something or another going on, but the finish, that apple is there. Really enjoying this and for like 1.25% flavor it is fucking genius. Thank you !"

      "text": "Love this recipe because it's a very complex yet simple \"build it yourself\" mix. It's great as is but since it was a contest entry with restrictions, I decided to tinker with the top notes a bit. The overripe aspect plays really well with brighter top notes. Add 2-3% TPA Cranberry to this for a really pleasant surprise. It turns it almost into a combination of granny smith and golden delicious. "

      "text": "This is one of the more interesting recipes that I've come across recently.  The fact that it is an apple recipe without a single apple flavor, and has only 1.25% total flavoring, was what caught my attention.  If you have the ingredients handy, try it out.  You'll be glad you did.  I can't say that I would have ever guessed it was an apple recipe if it weren't for the title or description.  I personally get something closer to a banana, or more accurately, a collection of slightly over ripe (in a good way) fruits.  It's an extremely sweet and flavorful mix despite the 1.25% total flavoring, and a lot of fun to vape, especially if your palate has grown bored of the mainstream fruit mixes that always seem to put emphasis on the crisp and tart end of the fruit spectrum."
