  "description": "This is a lighter tobacco mix with some coffee and a little bit of a dark chocolate floatin around in there. It's a recipe I've wanted to make for a long time, and was for some reason much more successful being limited to just one flavor company. I initially mixed this for a MTL setup, but I know most people mainly use a dripper or higher wattage device, so that's how I developed the profile. I also included the MTL version at the bottom of the description in case that's the way you vape. I personally get a Off The Record Raw Power kind of vibe from this, which I wasn't going for but turned out to be very similar. This one definitely has to steep for about 3 days to let biscotti calm down a little bit. That guy is big mad.\r\n\r\nFLV Biscotti: The coffee.\r\n\r\nFLV Tatanka: One of my favorite tobaccos from flavorah to use in dessert mixes. It has a light tobacco with a good amount of caramel, its the closest tobacco to an ry4 from them imo.\r\n\r\nFLV Red Burley: Just threw some of this in there to boost the tobacco a bit. It also helps out the chocolate/coffee aspect too.\r\n\r\nFLV Mocha: Used to boost the coffee/chocolate and add a cream to the mix. The cream more so shows up in a MTL setup.\r\n\r\nFLV Smoked Butterscotch: Just to add a bit of butt scotch. When I originally mixed this it wasn't included, but when I tried this in a dripper I felt like it needed it.\r\n\r\nFLV Sweetness: My favorite sweetener to use with dessert tobacco mixes now thanks to Developed. It sweetens everything else up without touching the tobacco.\r\n\r\nIf you wanted some more of a nutty tobacco in here, swap red burley for FLV Oriental Tobacco at the same %, that stuffs delicious. You could also boost the tobaccos as much as you want and the coffee/chocolate will still stay pretty present. I also noticed in the first couple of versions that more sweetener would bring out more chocolate as opposed to coffee.\r\n\r\nMTL Version: \r\nBiscotti same percentage\r\nTatanka same percentage\r\nMocha @ 1%\r\nSweetness same percentage\r\nRed Burley bumped up to 1.5, unless you want a light tobacco\r\nTake out smoked butterscotch, as it muddles the profile in MTL. It doesn't normally do that imo, but in this recipe I noticed it.\r\n\r\nA huge thanks to Developed and Flavorah for hosting this awesome challenge! ",
