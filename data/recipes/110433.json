    "description": "So I have been on a Vapable Alcoholic drink kick here lately, trying to indulge alittle more on the adult side of the house, getting away from the desserts and candied flavs... this Recipe is very simple even a caveman could do it.. lol\r\n\r\n\r\nMain Profile is Orange, the FLV Blood Orange and Orange citrus played well together on this portion of the recipe.....i wanted the Vodka to be balanced and not to over powering everything to this point worked very  well together,,,added FLV sweetener to give that OJ a little pop and topped off with WS23 to cool it down ...this is definitly a shake and vape recipe should be G2G right off the shake",
