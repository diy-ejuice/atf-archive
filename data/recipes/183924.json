  "description": "Made for Mixers' Club Feb 2020\r\nAssignment: Duets\r\n\r\nTake the best parts of existing recipes to create something new.\r\n\r\nGreen Bastard (parts) + Panther Blood (parts) + Bert's Soda Base (whole)\r\n\r\nI started by simply trying to take half of 2 recipes (the first 2) and make it work but it was too much fruit and nothing else. It needed something more. Green Blood didn't work by itself even after tinkering the harshness of the blackberry and grapes down.\r\nThis is where I tried out a few bases for it to settle on top of with the soda taking me by surprise. It's not a berry-sprite as I was expecting given the ingredients.\r\n\r\nI hope that this too takes you pleasantly by surprise, as true love often does.\r\n\r\n[Btw, my ws23 is 30% in pg]",
