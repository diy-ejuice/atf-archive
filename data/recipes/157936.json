  "name": "Bourberry Jam ",
  "description": "Tested on Haku Venna @.30 ohm 45 watts. \r\nAbsolutely delicious after the shake; however, in a few days the depth of the bourbon and jammy Berry will come together and be even more mouth watering. \r\nThis recipe was inspired by a recipe I mixed of Simon Atherton, many know him on ELR as Woftam. Not a clone of his recipe by any means, just inspired. \r\nThis will make a terrific syrup/jam base to keep mixed as a one shot and add yogurt, ice cream, cookie, or custard. Just use your imagination and mix away. \r\n\r\nFB FlvFan Page https://www.facebook.com/FLVFan/\r\nÎ©hm Grown Alchemy https://www.facebook.com/groups/ohmgrownalchemy/\r\nMixing in the Kitchen https://www.facebook.com/groups/425650464915364/\r\n\r\nYouTube\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCpzG9vsIgaCUzHVrUMHiV_g\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCDi_UubimriLWjel5Hr0pIA\r\n",
