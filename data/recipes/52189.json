  "description": "Milk and honey Remix Version 2. To me the first version measured next to real thing had more of that Graham cracker flavor and just a hint of Peanutbutter. So I switched from Graham cracker Clear TFA to FW Graham cracker @8% which seems high but works really well in this recipe and lowered the TFA Peanut butter to .5%. This recipe taste almost 1:1 of the original MH after a 7 day Steep. \r\nIf you want it sweeter and .25 cap super sweet.",
