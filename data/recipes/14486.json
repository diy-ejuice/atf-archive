It is definitely an experience, one I suggest you take. I think i just finally found the vape that is simply too weird for me. One second it's creamy smooth, the next its fruity tropics, then it's juicy sour cactus and finally slightly fermented. And all over again in the next pull, but in a different order. If you want to try something that makes no sense at all, yet is oddly pleasant and full of surprises, by all means, this is your vape. As for me, I think I'll marry the butcher's daughter instead of eloping with the exotic dancer who's swung through town on a Tuesday night."

      "text": "This has to be one of the best examples of weird science in mixing I've ever had the pleasure to run across. The guava is blatant, and that's a good thing. Considering this is coming from someone who until very recently loathed guava, this is saying something. There's a creamy sweetness from that icing and the vanilla swirl that give it a wonderful richness that in no way detracts from the taste. The grapefruit confuses me though. Unless the Pink Guava is an amalgamation of pink grapefruit and guava, then there's seriously some wicked mojo occurring in the bottle. The cactus makes it a touch juicier and tastier.&#xD;\n&#xD;\nI have to agree with the crowd here. This is a fantastic mix, and one that simply must be tried. It's for guava fans, grapefruit fans, people who like a little sweet with their sour, smoothie junkies, or just looking for something tropical and different.&#xD;\n&#xD;\nThis l'il bad boy is a banger. Nice one Concrete!"

      "text": "I am not a fan of guava, grapefruit, or cream cheese icing, but holy hell, this amalgamation of the three is something special. This recipe takes nearly everything good about vaping and just assaults you with everything. The creaminess and thick mouthfeel from CCI and Vanilla Swirl keeps the harsh brightness of the guava and grapefruit in check. While those same tart notes are allowing the cactus to boost them into that addictive punch of flavour that makes a good recipe great. I have no idea what Yakima Hops tastes like on its own, but from this recipe, I think I am going to have to pick it up. There's a touch of bitterness and dry earthy notes that really just rounds this out into one of the best recipes I've tasted in quite some time. This is one expertly crafted mix, something straight from the gods themselves, if gods existed. Maybe Concrete is a god. At the very least, he is my god now. "

That's was the first thing that came to mind when I vaped it. Bubblegum. It doesn't taste anything like bubblegum at all, at least no bubblegum I've ever had, but it's both very thick and super wet and juicy in a way that's not quite like anything I've vaped before. It's exactly like the way good bubblegum makes your mouth water like crazy as you chew it. Amazing recipe!"
