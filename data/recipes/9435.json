As such, change the specifics however you wish.\r\nGive it 7-10 days to sink in that you actually decided to give this a try, evaluate your life's decisions, and enjoy before forgetting all of that nonsense.",

            "text": "EVERYONE SHOULD TRY THIS.... MISSION ACCOMPLISHED. This proves spectacularly that Cactus can be the co-star of a delicious creamy fruit custard show. It's as well-balanced as a trapeze artist. There's no aloe here - which is what I was mostly afraid of when I saw 2% Cactus - nor any soapiness or offensively floral perfume or anything like that. You first get hit with two distinct fruity top notes, the fruit of the prickly pear and natural pear, and then it registers that these are suspended in a creamy custard, which is just a delightful moment. This is not as totally off-the-wall as it might seem. Cactus and cactus fruit are staples in Central American cuisine. I have found culinary recipes for prickly pear custard, and pear custards are everywhere. This just puts the cactus fruit and pear custards together. At the end, you're left with a lingering lip-licking raw but wet sugar-glaze finish, like someone forgot to br\u00fbl\u00e9e a cactus-pear cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e. I can hardly wait to mix some more! "
