  "description": "DOD Mixing Assignment.\r\nBanana Split Cake: Subtle Graham crust layered with soft bananas and strawberry cream, topped off with a chocolate dusting.\r\nIt was tricky trying to balance this recipe but I think I've done it justice. I wanted to keep the banana the main focus and build some gentle bakeries around it. I get a soft, ripe banana and a little graham on the inhale, the strawberry cream on the exhale with a hint of chocolate dusting right at the back. \r\nEDIT: Adjusted Shisha Strawberry and Vanilla Whipped Cream slightly to keep the strawberry from getting lost in the cream. After 1 day the banana settles in nicely. Smooth and delicate desert vape. \r\nHonestly can't stop vaping this right now. \r\nThoughts and comments welcome! \r\n",
