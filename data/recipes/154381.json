  "description": "Peanut Butter Banana Tobacco\r\n\r\nThought of a Banana RY4 dessert style tobacco so i went trying the classic ry4's, butterscotch and caramel but found TPA's Peanut Butter screaming at my face so here it is.\r\n\r\nTPA Peanut Butter Is a great peanut butter with some flaws but here does his job perfectly. Adds a bit of butter to the mix as well as a chocolaty note that goes really well with bananas.\r\n\r\nTPA Banana Cream was another obvious choice for me i love it and its so easy to use, has good creaminess at 3% and the banana is exactly were i wanted it.\r\n\r\nTPA Ry4 Double ok.. i wanted an ry4 and went with the classic, at 3% adds a bit of tobacco like note with caramel.\r\n\r\nFLV Caramel is more of a brown sugar than a caramel at 0.5% helps the caramel from Ry4 to get deeper and adds that brown sugar sweetness to everything.\r\n\r\nFinally FLV Red Burley is my favourite flavorah tobacco, and in this case helps giving the recipe a slight tobacco note without having to steep the ry4 for 2-3 weeks, wich was one of my goals for this recipe. Has some nuttiness that plays awsamely well with peanut butter and a slight frutiness that goes nicely with banana, (Red Burley is aswame)\r\n\r\nI let it sit for 3 days but after a week or so it gets better. \r\nThe more you let it the better it gets.",
