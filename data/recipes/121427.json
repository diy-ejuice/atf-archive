The CAP golden butter does a good job at selling at the cake, but I still didnâ€™t get enough. INW Shisha Strawberry and CAP Sweet Strawberry were the perfect choices for this mix. When I mix this again, I will probably try increasing the yellow cake to 4%"

      "text": "I would give this 4.5 stars if I could. Why not 5?  Some cake flavor is there, but most of it, and all of its texture, gets smashed between sweet syrupy strawberries and rich, buttery vanilla cream after a longer steep. So despite the slight bakery note, it's basically just another strawberry and cream. On the other hand,  when it comes to the strawberry and creams I've tried, it doesn't really get any tastier. The combination of strawberries works perfectly for a bit of fresh strawberries situated in strawberry syrup. If I wanted to \"fix\" it I might try it without the Whipped Cream, as it's powerful blending ability might be the main thing working to drown out the cake. However, that's probably playing a large part in it having such a sweet, rich finish. It might not fully read Strawberry Shortcake, but aside from that it ain't broke and doesn't really need fixing, just enjoying. "

      "text": "This is a nicely sweetened strawberry shortcake type flavor. Reminds me a lot of the shortcakes we used to sell at my old job. Layered yellow cake and fresh cut strawberries with a nice dollop of whipped cream in between with a little more on top for good measure. For me being so burnt out on strawberry, there is a good balance of different strawberry flavors in this that gives me a nice fresh cut berry with a touch of some sweet syrup along with it. Works well in this mix and holds up well to the heavier cake/swirl flavors. In all this is a very good rendition of a light and tasty dessert. Goes great after a meal or just about any other time you're craving some sweets or strawberries. I also think this base could fairly easily be remixed with another fruit. Maybe some FA Forest Fruit or the Blueberry Trinity. &#xD;\n&#xD;\nNote: I did not mix this myself, I was sent a sample of the recipe by it's creator. Just wanted to mention that. But I like it enough that I'll order the missing flavors so I can mix some more up for myself."
