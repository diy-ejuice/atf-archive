I really just played off the dark berry notes that I got from single flavor testing. Same goes with the Caramel and Vanilla Custard I added to give it some creaminess and make it a little more dessert like. \r\nOverall it is a sweet and bold pipe tobacco with a kick of blackberry. Delicious!",

I also can't really figure out what the burley is doing for this mix well enough to make words.  What I do know is, I get a strong blackberry note from this recipe, and it's totally not unpleasant or what i normally expect from tfa blackberry.  You'd never know it from the above, but I really like this recipe, and I think it's a solid mix even though I can't seem to work out how everything comes together to make this happen.  I get this with Mophead's recipes more often than with others, it's like he's some sort of evil genius."

It was interesting enough to justify the purchase of Aged Burley, and has now become a staple in my personal rotation. The tart, sweet, and dark all play together here perfectly - a wonderfully balanced recipe."
