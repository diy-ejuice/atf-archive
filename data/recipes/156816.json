    "description": "This is not ment to be mixed as is, I mean, it could and it'll taste like a sprite, which of course isn't all that bad, but can get boring pretty fast on its own. The purpose of me sharing this is for you to use as base to put your own fruits or other flavors on top.\r\n\r\nFirst of all, my take on achieving a \"fizzy vibe\" in a recipe... As true effervescence is not (yet) possible to achieve in vape form, I feel that the sprite esque citrus notes from those flavors is as close as you can get to vaping a soda. Seeing as lemon\/lime pairs well with pretty much any fruit out there, you'll be able to do a lot with this base.\r\n\r\nThe starting % are pretty low, but it's usually where I start when I make a new mix.\r\n\r\n**FLV Citrus Soda** at 1.25% is where I start to get that \"fizzy\" feeling from it. I think it's usually best between 1-2% depending on what your goals are and what other flavors your mix it with.\r\n**CAP Lemon Lime** is just straight up sprite almost. It's usually what I start to add more of if I feel the \"fizz\" is missing, and I think it works best between 1-3%.\r\n**WS-23** as cooling works extremely well here to really sell that cold fizzy vibe. If you haven't used it before, start at 0.25%. Personally I do 0.5% - 1% depending on current mood.\r\n\r\nI don't have anything against **sweetener** really, but I don't like using it with this base. I mean it's definitley still good, and it can probably help a lot of other flavors in different ways so I'm not saying don't use it. I do however think it takes away the tanginess of the citrus flavors, thus making it slightly less fizzy. It's a personal preference though, but I never use it with this base. Usually other fruits, florals, etc can be used as sweeteners or are inheretly sweet themselves.\r\n\r\nOther good flavors:\r\n**VT Fizzy Sherbet** can  be used in combination with any of the other too, around 1-4% is usually where I use this, depending on  what else is in the mix of course.\r\n**FA Aurora** also great lemon\/lime flavor that can be used together with with FLV Citrus Soda or VT Fizzy Sherbet, use between 0.5-2%.\r\n**FLV Lime** be careful with this one, it's very potent. Start at 0.2%\r\n**FLV Pink Guava** the grapefruit note from this flavor can also help boost FLV Citrus Soda, that extra tang is usually needed if you want a soda type recipe. Seeing as this is not a lemon\/lime flavor like the others, it's not pairing compatible with as many other flavors. But for the right recipe, this can be amazing.\r\n\r\nGreat flavors, but bad for making a soda:\r\n**FA Lime (Tahity) Cold Pressed** & **VT Persian Lime** - don't get me wrong, both of these are GREAT flavors for most purposes, but they are terrible to use in combination with FLV Citrus Soda. What they do is just put a \"lid\" on the fizzy notes. Makes everything flat in a sense. They add a great lime note, but if you use them high enough, they will take all the carbonated vibes out of the equation. I won't say don't use them, but I think there are better alternatives if you want to boost the lime in this scenario.",
