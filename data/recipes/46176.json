  "description": "Apples macerated in whisky and baked with a lovely crusty taste and fluffy cakey bottom and topped of with cream.\r\n\r\nRF SC Apple and RF SC Apple Pie paired for perfection, very sweet and rich apple taste in a light crusty jacket.\r\nFA Liquid amber adds some needed acidity to the apples.\r\nTo give the mix a fluffy cake feel i've added some JF Yellow Cake\r\nFA Whisky was used for a light oak wood, grain and malted taste to the already sweet mix of apples. \r\nFLV rich cinnamon (2drops/10ml) added because i feel that the RF SC Apple Pie does not have cinnamon or at least i couldn't taste it.\r\nFA Vanilla Bourbon and FLV Cream rounds this mix off\r\n \r\nsteep at least 8 days, blame this on the whisky that needs to blend with the other ingredients, FA Whisky have a dry and rather earthy taste, it need the time to blend with the mix!\r\n\r\ninhale: apples and a lovely taste of whisky\r\nexhale: round vanilla and creamy apples with a cinnamon afterbite\r\n\r\nVery addictive dessert/bakery vape, you've been warned :-)",
