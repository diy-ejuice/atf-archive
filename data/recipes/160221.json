  "description": "Taking inspiration from an absolute wizard, Mr @alfredpudding, I decided to tackle a tobacco recipe that wasn't so much about capturing a specific flavor but instead about capturing a memory or a feeling. This boozy/smokey/chocolaty recipe is meant to capture the feeling, or foster some nostalgia for an evening sitting around a campfire sipping at a bottle of whiskey and maybe toasting a few s'mores. \r\n\r\nNot quite so elegant a solution as the 3 piece masterwork that is Cabin, we've kind of got a lot of moving parts here so let's try to break them down.\r\n\r\n**SC Old Captain** - Really the root of the recipe all started here, it's a tobacco alright, but really it's so incredibly chocolaty that I knew where I wanted to go with it the second I tasted it. It's still got a bit of tobacco behind it but pushed higher than the rest to really allow that chocolate to cut through into the final product\r\n\r\n**FA 7 Leaves Ultimate** - It's dry and sorta spicy, almost bringing the smell of the forest or firewood with it.\r\n\r\n**FLV Red Burley** & **FLV Cured Tobacco** - The tobacco base needed to be emboldened to keep up with the booze and chocolate so bringing in this combo was a suggestion courtesy of @NoWar, and it absolutely works without steamrolling everything else in the mix.\r\n\r\n**FA Irish Cream** - Partially aiding Kentucky Bourbon and partially helping keep the recipe from drying out to the point of being more reminiscent of a desert than a campfire.\r\n\r\n**TFA Kentucky Bourbon** - Booze, but with little focus on the burn and more on the flavor that lingers on your palate.\r\n\r\n**FA Vanilla Bourbon** - Just a touch of vanilla to help the chocolate along.\r\n\r\n**TFA Toasted Marshmallow** - Adding a bit of sweetness but, more importantly, just a hint of smoke to help really hammer the point home.",

Cured/Burley is solid, and the 7leaves brings the firewood exactly as planned.  SC Old Captain gives it the chocolate and some tobacco, and the alcohol mix is there without overpowering.  This is a great fall mix, and a great recipe overall. "

      "text": "This was a really intriguing recipe to me.  I'll get it out of the way right now. It's fantastic plain and simple, it really does create the mindset of sitting around the campfire. I genuinely had a hard time not taking more of out of the big bottle. As a complete tobacco noob who's experience extends no further than FLV Virginia I can't really speak to the inner workings of the tobaccos but it is a very enjoyable blend of tobaccos. Overall, everything is well balanced where not one aspect of the mix is shining over the other one. Each part compliments the other very well and while they all blend into one awesome flavor you can still pick out each aspect of the mix."
