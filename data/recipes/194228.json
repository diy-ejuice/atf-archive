  "description": "No nonsense! No gimmicks! Just straight up peanut butter goodness!\r\n\r\nSo, this is where my soul crushing and money consuming journey of finding the best peanut butter vape took me.\r\nEvery flavor in here that's not PB is to help the profile out and make it the best it could be on it's own, without going into custard/ice cream/etc territory. \r\n\r\nTPA DX Peanut Butter | FLV Peanut Butter:\r\nThe peanut butter base. Those are arguably the two best PBs on the market. The DX PB is the main flavor, FLV PB is here to boost it up. The only other PB I would even slightly consider is CAP's Peanut Butter V2, since it's miraculously light years ahead of the V1. Maybe a good substitute if you can't get FLV's PB.\r\n\r\nFA Peanut:\r\nThis is in here to bolster the PB just a little bit more. Any higher percentage would kill the overall flavor, but 0.5% is just right.\r\n\r\nTPA DX Marshmallow | TPA Marshmallow:\r\nI know what you're thinking: Both of these in the same recipe? What heresy is this?! But hear me out: TPA's DX Marshmallow tastes nothing like the regular one, and it's great! I think it's another underrated DX flavoring and one of my favorite marshmallows. Both of these in combination are my marshmallow stone. In general, the marshmallow really helps the whole recipe out in giving some sweetness and good mouthfeel, but doesn't take away from the pure PB experience.\r\n\r\nFW Butterscotch Ripple | FW Caramel (Salted) | FA Honey:\r\nThe salted caramel and butterscotch ripple just go great with PB. FA's Honey is really nice with caramel and creams in general. At those percentages there a not at all overpowering, but still noticeable and give some more dimension to the overall taste.\r\n\r\nAfter 3 days it becomes vapeable, I wouldn't recommend trying to vape this at any earlier point. Best after 2 weeks minimum!\r\n\r\nI hope you find as much enjoyment in this recipe as I do, it cost me a lot of tears and money to get it to this point. \r\nAlso I'm always open to suggestions on how to improve on it, don't hesitate to shoot me a message.\r\n\r\nHave a nice vape!",
