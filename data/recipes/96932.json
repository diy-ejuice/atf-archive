  "name": "Vanilla Chai Tea  latte",
  "description": "Simple spiced tea  using  FLV black tea which is pretty much a dark rich black tea, some nuttiness and  sweetness.  not much earthiness  or green.   You get some of that tannic  dry finish .    I can see this tea being used with tobacco, or  in a nutty  banana bread, I think  you can sneak this in some very unexpected places nicely .   \r\n\r\n  Used with the TPA chi tea  and cream of your choice  you have a really nice chai tea  mix.    I love OOO creamy milky undertone  and  FLV milk and honey here  seems to really hit that dairy sweet note  of steamed milk that I wanted.  FLV cream would also be used here nicely as well  i think.  The vanilla  is here just to boost that note a bit .  But you could add some toasted nut  notes as an additive if that is what you wanted to pull that forward from the BLK tea.    \r\n\r\nif you like chai teas this is for  you it is my ADV  of late ",

The 2 tea flavorings work very well together, but I find I am wanting a little more of the cream and vanilla as it is very faint behind the teas. Well done, and anyone else who enjoys teas, you need to give this a try. I would make it exactly as written first, then adjust according to your own tastes."
