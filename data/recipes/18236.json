  "description": "peanut butter pudding. covered in caramelized apples topped with cinnamon and sugar crumbs.\r\nMIX @ 30PG/70VG\r\nI use 1.5mg Nicotine\r\n\r\nthe combination of the fw yogurt and tfa peanut butter created the sense of a pudding. the lightness of the yogurt without a strong sour note mixed with the heavy peanut butter evens itself out to a smooth pudding like essence.\r\n\r\nfuji apple and strawberry ripe combined with each other as the apple is more prominent.  the combo brings a beautiful gel flavor but does not take away from crisp and wholeness of the apple chunks.\r\n\r\nfw dulce de leche offers a caramelized flavor to the combo of strawberry ripe and fuji apple.  i feel this is the best additive to give a true caramelized flavor to the mix. i tried many caramels or butterscotches and the fw version of dulce de leche gave this the perfect flavor. \r\n\r\nof course without a cinnamon crumb topping mixed with white sugar and cinnamon. The sweetener and cinnamon danish swirl v1 was the perfect ingredient to top off the mix.  \r\n\r\nit seems i did a big flavor bend with strawberry ripe @ 5% it gave many notes and assisted the entire mix without identifying itself as a predominant flavor note.  that 1 ingredient i feel assists the creaminess of the pudding, then added to the apple to help complete this original profile. \r\n\r\nI hope you enjoy it as much as I did since its creation it has been a ADV for me.  I only use drippers and it has been a beautiful mix to enjoy the past weeks.\r\n\r\nthis can be used as a shake and vape but i found after the 4th day the peanut butter stands out more and more. After 2 weeks i have found no more flavor note changes to my personal taste \r\n\r\n",
