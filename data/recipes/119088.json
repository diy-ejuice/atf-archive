    "description": "Finally It's Popcorn!! After years of mixing now I think I can finally mix a decent Popcorn recipe. While this is great on its own I think this is a good recipe to build off & around. Maybe some more Butter? Maybe add some caps golden butter if you like. The secret here is a discovery I made a few weeks ago by putting a touch of WF sesame candy behind FLV pop corn with some great results. It really helped to replicate that kernal on the pallette mouthfeel. For a hint of sweetness I enjoy how the VT sweet honey works with the light pour of WF Caramel Butter. The VT Salted caramel does very well at giving that salty caramel note and makes it so real !  I'm really enjoying this as I hope you do to, let me know what you think. Enjoy! :) \r\n\r\nLearn more about mixing here:\r\nhttps:\/\/www.facebook.com\/groups\/diydownunder\/\r\nhttps:\/\/discord.gg\/kH4Fqbc\r\nhttps:\/\/www.youtube.com\/channel\/UCTCwb7ULyfJALQlehomZZQA\r\nhttps:\/\/www.diydownunder.com\/\r\nHave you tried this recipe?!\r\nPlease rate this recipe and comment below!
