    "description": "A soft sugar cookie with a lemon cream cheese icing\r\n\r\nEvery holiday season i join a few cookie swaps and while going through my cookie recipes it dawned on me to make one into an E-Juice, here it is. \r\n\r\nI started with Yellow Cake, Sugar Cookie and Vanilla Swirl for the base but found it lacking as a \"cookie\".\r\n with the addition of Biscuit the base really came together but was missing the smooth\/soft mouth feel, Cap Butter Cream solved that nicely.\r\n\r\nThe lemon cream cheese icing was pretty straight forward with Cream Cheese Icing and Lemon Sicily but felt too one dimensional \r\nafter trying more than a few flavors to fix that i settled on Lemon Lime. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n",
