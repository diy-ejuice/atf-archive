  "description": "Breakfast Bowls #3: Groot Loops - A bowlful of fresh Froot Loops with a little bit of milk.\r\n\r\nThis is a pretty linear profile. I wanted it to be straightforward and simple. I kept turning Fruit Rings up until I was satisfied. Then, I used some creams to smooth it out and bolster the mouthfeel. Big departure here, I know. I'm stuck on cereal vapes. What can I say?\r\n\r\nFlavor Notes:\r\n\r\nAcetyl Pyrazine is giving texture to Fruit Rings. 0.75 is just enough to make it seem like fresh cereal without being too sharply crunchy.\r\n\r\nCheesecake Graham Crust helps both sides of the equation. The graham works with the AP to ensure a grainy cereal texture. The cheesecake gives body and sweetness to the milk. At 1%, it doesn't give off a cheesecake flavor in the mix; it just does it's background duties.\r\n\r\nCream Fresh thins the cheesecake out into something more like a subtle milk. 1% is enough to make a noticeable impact on the profile, but it doesn't distract from that main top note.\r\n\r\nFruit Rings is used pretty high here. I really wanted to get everything I could out of this flavor. I think it represents Froot Loops pretty damn well. The fruit notes are authentic to the cereal, and the texture is on target as well. 6% squeezes out about all there is to be had. It does get sharp up there, but I didn't want to accent it and distract from the profile. Chose to suck it up and work out the kinks with creams instead.\r\n\r\nMarshmallow is acting as both a mild sweetener and texturizer. 1% fluffs up the milk and cereal to a satisfying mouthfeel. It also helps out the fruit notes with its tasty, sweet deliciousness. It keeps the sharper notes of Fruity Rings subdued.\r\n\r\nSteeping is easy for this stuff. Mix it and rips it. I think it gets better after a week, but I just mix enough for a few weeks and vape through the steeping. It's great out of the gate, and I imagine some will like it best fresh.\r\n\r\nHappy mixing. ðŸ‘½",

      "text": "My favorite loops mix. Im thinking this is at least number 4 or 5. The reason for this 5 star is because how you worked around calming down the fruit rings. All the loops mixes I've tried are too sharp. The flavor is awesome. The milk is fantastic and all blend to create an awesome juice. The problem with the other loops is it's just too much from the fruit cereal or the milk is too much separated from the cereal. This juice is the whole enchilada. The milk feels like it carries the fruit loops. Thanks a ton for sharing this and what you do for our community. Just watched another noted episode where you were a guest (papaya)."
