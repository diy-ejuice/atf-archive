  "description": "So the name would lead you to believe that this one gives you bad breath...to the contrary it is my way of continuing to release recipes that do not have child inviting names..i mean how many children even know what Halitosis is right? Plus i thought it was funny...Let me know what you all think...THANKS.  Here is a link to my video mixing and discussing this recipe.\r\nhttps://youtu.be/gp3YnXM44Ok\r\n\r\nso RY4 caramel vanilla Tobacco  \r\n\r\nFLV  CREAM AND VANILLA  BEAN -  Provide the creaminess and the vanilla note\r\n\r\nFLV SMOKED BUTTERSCOTCH - useed here to support the caramel and add some more depth to the mix\r\n\r\nFLV CARAMEL - used low this one is a smooth caramel if you push this one higher it becomes a kind of homemade caramel that didnt cook long enough..it gets brown sugar grainy notes for me.\r\n\r\nFLV RED BURLEY -  Well well  I love this flavor  its tobacco and  i get a bit of coco notes as well\r\n\r\nWhile the percentages here seem low because its all Flavorah it IS a FULL FLAVORED Vape after the steep.\r\n\r\nI put 10 day steep however i shake and vape it and it changes to something even better around 14 days.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
