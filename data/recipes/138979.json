    "name": "Rhubarb Berry Butter Crust Pie",
    "description": "Where I'm from, pies that don't have cr\u00e8me p\u00e2tissi\u00e8re in them have a crust that is called bris\u00e9e or half cookie crust half butter flaky crust. It's my favorite kind and is perfect for fruits.\r\n\r\nFA Cookie\/CAP Sugar Cookie\/CAP Golden Butter form the cookie buttery crust. In France we don't use graham crackers at all, so we don't have graham cracker crusts. This crust is a little less defined but you will definitely taste a smooth buttery cookie.\r\n\r\nFLV Sweet Dough\/TPA Brown Sugar is here to add a little gooey at the bottom of the pie where you add a little semolina and brown sugar to absorb the cooking juices of the baking fruits.\r\n\r\nWF Sweet and Sour Rhubarb\/WF Bumbleberry\/FLV Cream are the fruit mix of this pie. The rhubarb is actually a little sour and bumbleberry does taste like a very dark but vibrant mix of berries. The cream is here to round it all up and add some body and sweetness.\r\n\r\nEnjoy, be queer and vape on !\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Photo: Becky Luigart-Stayner; Styling: Lydia DeGaris-Pursell]",
