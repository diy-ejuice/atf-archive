  "description": "With this flavor, I was going for a perfect blend of peach and mango, without going into the “peach ring” realm which I tried not to do. CAP sweet mango is a sweet, ripe mango flavor, and oh so delicious. By ripe, I mean very ripe. It's a little weak though, so I used a percentage that I thought fit the profile. FA’s peach is a wonderful strong white, bright peach flavor at 1%, luckily not too sweet. It fit the boldness I was going for in the peach. TFA juicy peach brought in the peach sweetness and wetness. TFA is where the gateway of real to candy can affect the outcome of the flavor. I knew I definitely needed the sweetness from TFA juicy peach, because I couldn't and didn't want to use any sweetener. I think I pulled it off really well. Unfortunately, we only had three ingredients to work with, so I feel this is a great interpretation of what a mango/peach hybrid would taste like.",
