  "description": "Bright and juicy melon with a little cream to smooth it all over. Inw cactus pushes the wild melon to a oasis of melons. Flv cream and cotton candy give you a smooth cream exhale that is not a thick cream but just right for these hot summer days. Bump up the wild melon to 3% for that extra punch. It can tend to be a bit harsh the first few days so if you do be patient and wait about 3 days. Otherwise mix and vape!",

      "text": "Very nice! Wild Melon is full-flavored without any off notes, a mostly honeydew mix of delicious melons. FLV Cream is the one cream I wouldn't hesitate to mix with melons because it has that creamy feel without really tasting of dairy or vanilla. Fluffed up a bit and sweetened with Cotton Candy it's even better. Cactus 0.25% doesn't always work to just juice things up without making its presence known but it does here.  Altogether, a great, satisfying simple recipe. Thanks for this! I waited five days to try it and can imagine it getting even better if I'd been a little more patient and was wanting more out of the bit of cream, but this is already terrific just the way it is. "
