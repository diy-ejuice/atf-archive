      "text": "I get the new vinyl shower curtain-type of notorious plastic off-note from LB Cherry Blossom Tea, but wanted to give this a shot anyway, in case maybe it was mitigated somehow. It wasn’t, and that completely ruined this recipe for me. If you don’t think LB Cherry Blossom Tea is a bit plasticy or bottom shelf rummy, maybe give this a try. Haven’t tried the GL Cherry by itself yet, as I just got it in specifically for mixing this recipe, so I don’t know if yet that’s a culprit as well. Having tried INW Elderflower by itself, I definitely concur with using it in something that’s supposed to be purple. I think elderflowers are actually white flowers, but that concentrate does taste very purple. And the idea of making something purple by mixing red and blue instead of just going grape is fun and creative. If only it weren’t for that damn plastic taste. "
