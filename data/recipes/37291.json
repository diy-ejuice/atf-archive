  "description": "I wanted to change up Mustard Milk with a blackberry flavor. I started with 5% Blackberry and 8% VBIC, then altered the recipe several times. I added Custurd to enhance the blackberry and balance out the VBIC. INW Raspberry is there to add a complimentary flavor to blackberry. I've tried CAP VBIC but it doesn't give the same profile. I have tried cookie when I was out of bisuit not bad. I've thought about subbing INW Raspberry for TFA Sweet Raspberry at around 2%. Hope you like it. The INW Raspberry needs a few days to settle down. ",
