    "description": "\r\nThis recipe was totally on a whim with a section of flavors I am used to.. The percentages have been worked on over and over for the last couple of weeks and I think I have nailed it down just right.. The Butter Pecan and Peanut Butter play well together as well as the Melty Caramel to add a slight caramel tone.. You do not get a huge chocolate tone on the vape but it is there melding with the other flavors..\r\n\r\nI was playing with the name I had something that was funny to me and to some others but in general I was a little immature so I edited the name and some wording in the description..",
