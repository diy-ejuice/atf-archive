  "name": "Nookie - A Delicious Caramel Apple Vape",
  "description": "I've been making my own juice for about six months now and with all the great recipes out there and my own admitted laziness I just never spent all that much time making my own recipes for juices. Tried some 1-2-3 recipes and a lot of them were okay, but it always just made more sense to head on over to popular and make something that I knew would be good. My girlfriend however has been hounding me for a caramel apple vape juice for awhile now and I thought it would be nice to try and make something for her.\r\n\r\nI've made enough of other people's recipes to have a pretty basic understanding of some flavors. I went off of that mostly and my own nose. I wanted the apples to have a little bit of a spice note and for that thought cinnamon apple danish would be a good choice. I started out with it at 2%, but the cinnamon was too prevalent and I wanted it as more of a background note so I dropped the percentage down a bit. At 1% it's noticeable, but doesn't overpower anything else in the mix.\r\n\r\nOf all the apples, I prefer double apple. Just taste juicy and delicious and is more of a non discriminate apple flavoring. Fuji is my jam too, so I chose that just to add some extra crisp juiciness to the apple profile.\r\n\r\nI'm not a huge fan of FA caramel, but I thought I could push it a bit and add some FLV cream to offset some of the offnotes of it while adding a dash of nice creaminess to it as well. I added Ry4 double to help with the caramel notes as well. I think it has more of a traditional caramel flavor and that, with the caramel and the cream are my nice caramel coating. \r\n\r\nOff the shake I'm really surprised and happy with it. It fucking taste like a caramel apple. The cream does a good job of adding some depth and mouthfeel to the flavor which makes the experience more authentic. If you mix this up I hope you enjoy it. This is my first recipe and after this, I think I'll try and make some more. it's kinda fun.\r\n\r\nCheers !",

I only primarily taste the cinnamon danish and an attempt at apple flavoring. This went into the trash after a day of trying to like it."

Keeping the CDS down lower worked well, as it tends to throw me off at higher percentages.  I may add some FLV Rich Cinn. next time, but I really do enjoy it of the shake!  Thanks!"
