    "name": "Jam Monster Grape - REMIX",
    "description": "After trying several different clone\/remix recipes out there, I have finally come to the conclusion that the most important pieces are these 3 components and you can build from there. \r\n\r\n4.5% Cereal 27 (Cap) - This is your bread\r\n5% Golden Butter (Cap)  - This is your butter obviously\r\n4% Sweet Strawberry (Cap) - Your Main Strawberry note\r\n\r\nBring in AP at 0.5% and you've got a bit more nuttiness to your bread. Want an even better bread? Add 0.15% of Joy (FA). You're pretty damn close right here and this is a very vapeable recipe. \r\n\r\nNow here is the catch, we know that with these 3 main components, we do not get a dark brown caramel look to the juice, and we know the original is definitely a brown tint. That could be the steeping process, but its likely that there is something more going on here. So if we look back at Waynes remix, the Strawberry Jam with Toast has that nice dark color we see present in Jam Monster. So it would only make sense that this is added to lift the bread rather than using the AP and Joy and also make the strawberry more jam like. Ive seen chatter around the web about Cranberry Sauce being in all of the Jam Monster series to give that nice jammy flavor, but I cant seem to find it. Strawberry Sweet on its own is close but starts to hide in the cereal and butter, so we need to bring it back with RF Strawberry, and then lift the toast with the Strawberry Jam\/Toast from RF\r\n\r\nSo if we add 2% RF Strawberry and 2% Strawberry Jam w\/ Toast, we start to get that nice strawberry and the dark golden color of the juice. \r\n\r\nThis will get us closer to the desired color, but i haven't had a chance to fully experiment. \r\n\r\nEither way, remember what Wayne says, think simple. The three main ingredients, to me, are very very close to the original and its all CAP. As a business, that would make more sense financially to build the recipe off these three main components. \r\n\r\nWould love any feedback! ",

            "text": "I haven\u2019t tried this particular mix, although I did make my own grape mix attempt, which turned out ok but lacking enough grape punch. Just wanted to share my thoughts with you and see what you thought... maybe we could bounce ideas. I see you have the butter percentage here pretty high around 5%, which several of the \u201cclaimed exact recipes\u201d have it at that level as well and while I do think that this juice tends to Vape very similar to the original Jam Monster at this level, after you switch juices and put something else in the tank the butter overhangs everything and leave a distinct old popcorn taste for the next several tanks or through the life of the coil and it doesn\u2019t do that with the real JamM so I\u2019m thinking that while the butter is a very present note, I think that it\u2019s a bit lower more like Wayne\u2019s remix version. What are your thoughts? 5 stars for sharing and even attempting,  I\u2019ve seen some negative reviews about the grape jam monster but I happen to love it. There\u2019s literally NO other recipes for it out there, at least that I could find. "
