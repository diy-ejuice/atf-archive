  "description": "**This is a delicious custard topped with oats and honeycomb.  The custard is filled with a tangy Rhubarb.**\r\n\r\nThe Custard is **INW Custard**.  This is a delicious and simple custard base.  I added **OOO Vanilla Custard Cheesecake** to boost the vanilla and creaminess.\r\n\r\nThe Rhubarb I choose was **DV Rhubarb Cuddle**  This is a tangy rhubarb that has been paired with Decadent Vapors Creme Anglaise, This also helps boost the custard a bit more.  \r\n\r\nThe topping is **WF SC Oats and Cream Cookie**.  This gives the oats taste and texture.  I also used **VT Honeycomb** at 1% it adds a bit of deep caramel and the honeycomb texture.\r\n\r\nHope you enjoy!  \r\nLearn more about mixing here:\r\nhttps://www.diydownunder.com/\r\nhttps://www.facebook.com/groups/diydownunder/\r\nhttps://discord.gg/kH4Fqbc\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCTCwb7ULyfJALQlehomZZQA \r\nwww.instagram.com/diydownunder",

Creamy, sweet rhubarb with subtle hints of the oats intertwined.   If you like custard and rhubarb then you have GOT to try this.  I let it steep for almost 2 weeks and it is absolutely delicious!"
