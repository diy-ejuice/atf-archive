  "name": "ICE WINE   (Sweet grape, apple and cherry) ",
  "description": "Mixed for the flavor _pro year of mixing   The picture was the inspiration  for this mix   \r\nIce wine is a type of dessert wine produced from grapes that have been frozen while still on the vine.   This allows for a more concentrated grape juice to develop. The grapes' must is pressed from the frozen grapes, resulting in a smaller amount of more concentrated, very sweet wine .\r\nhttps://www.facebook.com/groups/flavorpro/permalink/1745606565543419/\r\n\r\nOn the inhale you get a syrup sweet mixed grape  note that transitions to  a sweet apple  and ends with a light cherry tartness, that lingers.   This is  best vaped at 50 - 60 watts on an RDA\r\n\r\n**INW GRAPE**   is a sweet thick syrupy  mixed grape  that is the main grape profile here \r\n\r\n**INW SPARKLIG WINE**  is a brighter grape and has a  syrup finish that coats and lingers  which is characteristic of a an actual ice wine.\r\n\r\n**CONCORD GRAPE**  was used for its addition of stevia  sweetener  which I happen to like with certain fruits over  super sweet.  It  adds some of the darker grape notes in this mix  \r\n\r\n**INW TWO APPLES**  The apple sits in the middle  in this mix.    it is an accent note as  many white wines have an apple note that is even more concentrated in an ICE wine.  This note builds off the apple note in the sparkling wine. \r\n\r\n**CAP TART CHERRY**  is used for a  light tart cherry finish  that lingers , and helps to contrast some of the  sweetness in this mix  and I really am enjoying its use in this mix.  \r\n\r\n**VT GOLDEN SYRUP**  us used for body and mouth feel  that  an actual ICE WINE has  and it does that very well in this mix \r\n\r\nNOTES  this is  sweet but if you are looking for a more I would use a drop of two of  CAP  Super sweet. \r\n I tried this  mix with VT ICED grape and I just did not care for the koolada  effect i was getting and prefer this much more with   WS 23 if that is something you would prefer.    \r\n \r\nLearn more about mixing here:\r\nfacebook - https://www.facebook.com/groups/diydownunder/\r\nDiscord - https://discord.gg/kH4Fqbc\r\nYoutube - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCTCwb7ULyfJALQlehomZZQA\r\nwebsite - https://www.diydownunder.com/",
