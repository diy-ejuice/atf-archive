That’s it. This recipe does no.t have that jammy note your looking for and that’s jam monster really jammy."

This is actually the recipe that got me interested in mixing because I was so intrigued by how this flavor profile was even possible and the only vape shop near me didn't actually sell Jam Monster. That said I'm not getting much toast note, just barely enough for the butter to be good with the strawberry jam. Like I said, one of my favorite recipes so far but I'd like Wayne to do a little more tweaking, maybe not so much a clone and more of a flavor profile accurate remix using some of the elements he used in this recipe. Maybe this is also the recipe that will really get me into adding my own flair too, as I would really like to see this one move a little further."
