  "name": "pandan and coconut ice-cream with toffee ",
  "description": "Pandan is an edible plant that is used widely in South Asian cooking to give a fragrance to sweet dishes in particular, and often added to rice as well. (maybe a sticky rice!). Pandan is also often used with nuts and coconut and in this recipe plays with the coconut and toffees to make a nice dessert. The coconut is quite subtle here.  If cooling try 0.2% WS23 and 0.2% polar blast together for inhale and exhale cooling. \r\n ",
