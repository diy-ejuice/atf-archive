  "description": "A deliciously thick and creamy cheesecake blended with fresh mango &  a drizzle of passion fruit.\r\n\r\nI set out to create a thick and creamy European style fresh cheesecake, incorporating the magnificence of FE Mango... \r\n\r\nINW Yes, We Cheesecake is my absolute favorite Cheesecake at the moment. The Philadelphia style cream cheese base is so so smooth and delectable that is is just about perfect.  I added a touch of LA Cheescake to take this over the edge, without maxing out the INW.  Combined, this is creamy cheesecake heaven!\r\n\r\nAs explained in Pango, FE Mango is the quintessential mango flavour to date and I predict that it will become the go-to mango very, very soon. It perfectly encapsulates the very best a fresh, ripe & luscious mango to be with zero, zip, zilch, nada room for improvement. The is the epitome of mango. Period.\r\n\r\nFA Passion fruit is added with caution to cut the mango 'just so'.  It imparts a delicious Passion fruit back note without detracting form our hero.\r\n\r\nGive this baby 5 days or so to settle and enjoy!!!",
