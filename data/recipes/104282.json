    "description": "A gorgeous custard filled donut with caramel dripping and moreish nutty tones. \r\n Enjoy this mix that really brings together the levels of creams, caramel and bakery tones that I am totally into and enjoying right now. \r\nFirstly I start with a new Donut stone that seems to work beautifully by simply combining the WF Glazed Donut  & FW Cake Batter Dip. It seemingly helps to give that soft \"not to bready\" base and that's the way I love my donuts.  As most know I'm totally nuts so it;s only appropriate that I brought some beautiful nuttiness into this profile. The FW Butter Pecan plays beautifully and sells the nutty mouthfeel and when combined in this recipe with PUR Vanilla Nut Brittle it helps to bring \"next Level\" sweet nut  tones into this. Behind every lovely caramel is a butterscotch as a best friend and vice versa. The FA Caramel is a lovley soft caramel that seemingly melts in here with the FW Butterscotch ripple to help also get the custard middle ready. The filler of all this is the FA Premium custard that offers a generous yet balanced center that just oozes out at the exhale and plays an integral part in rounding out the overall profile. \r\nI'm really enjoying this as I hope you will to! \r\nLet me know what you think if you don't get distracted by mixing your second and third bottle of this. :) \r\n",
