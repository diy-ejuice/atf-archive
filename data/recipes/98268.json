    "description": "I posted one like this about a week ago which is going to get deleted this is the ticket. I think it tastes pretty good. Doesn't taste like fruit circles i would say it's just a cereal vape. This is pretty damn good after 3 day steep. Nice flavor kinda reminds me of a crunch berries with a little twist though. If you try it let me know what you think please.",
