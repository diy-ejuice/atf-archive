  "description": "I used Flv Maple Bar for the maple icing part of the donut. It has a nice sugary glazey type of note and used FA maple to just boost the maple goodness up a bit. WF Glazed Donut was used as the only donut note here, it is very sugary and glazey as well but it does have a nice yeasty donut note that fits in great here. WF Vanilla Cream Extra is just here for some depth and richness I felt the mix needed. Sorry to disappoint, but I could not add the bacon. :(\r\n\r\n\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s7V0JcOhbB0&feature=youtu.be",
