  "description": "Tobacco heads love it.  Tobacco haters say \"Wow, that's tasty!\"\r\n\r\nA delicate balance with just enough sweetness to keep you dripping until the bottle's gone.\r\n\r\nAll Flavour Art, no substitutes.\r\n\r\nFA 7 Leaves Ultimate serves as the tobacco base with slightly dry woodsy tobacco notes and hints of licorice, molasses, and spice.  I had to really push this percentage to bring out the sweeter spice notes.\r\n\r\nFA Desert Ship provides a touch of sweetness and adds depth to the tobacco base, almost fooling you into thinking you're vaping fresh moist pipe tobacco.\r\n\r\nFA Fuji we all know about the wonderful FA Fuji.  At 1 %, it adds a nice apple back note to the tobacco without taking over the mix.\r\n\r\nFA Blackcurrant compliments the FA Fuji, brightening up the apple taste by adding some darkness and a whole lot of depth.  If this was a a commercial juice, I think this ingredient would be tough to figure out.  It blends so nicely with the apple, you'd think I used a special 1-off type of ingredient.",

It has a dark, moist pipe tobacco taste and mouth feel, and finally here’s a recipe that makes the most of it. I like more intense mixes, so for the next batch I’ll boost the flavors by 50% and try adding some others I know that that work well with the Fuji apple."
