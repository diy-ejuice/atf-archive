  "description": "Graham cracker is something that's really important to me. As an ex-smoker graham cracker flavored eliquid is what helped me quit smoking cigarettes.\r\n\r\nTFA Cheesecake (Graham Crust) is not a cheesecake but it is a slightly dark, sweet, buttery graham cracker and it's my favorite graham.\r\n\r\nCAP Cereal 27 is here to give that graham tons of texture and a really pleasant honey note.\r\n\r\nTFA Vanilla Bean Ice Cream gives us our vanilla note with a slight creamy texture. If you're pepper taster (I'm sorry) LB Vanilla Ice Cream at 2% is a fine sub for this note.\r\n\r\nFA Marshmallow smooths out the edges of the recipe adding to the mouth feel and giving the flavor some sticky sweetness.\r\n\r\nCAP Super Sweet is optional here as always but I definitely recommend including it in this mix.\r\n\r\nWatch the Video Here:\r\nhttps://youtu.be/SAXu7CxTIC0",

If this was edible I would probably gain 50 more pounds eating it. I can hardly wait for the 3 day steep, if there is any left."

Not overbearing or cloying but packed with flavor at the same time. The graham is the obvious main note, cereal 27 backing up the grain of the graham. VBIC is a great choice here as the darkness in the vanilla melds perfectly with the graham. There is a slight hint of marshmallow but that is probably due to not using the original mixers exact specs. I mixed a 15 ml and started vaping it off the shake and it has only gotten better and more full as it hits day 3. This is one of the rare mixes that I have immediately mixed an additional 60ml of, and am putting the FA marshmallow on order to try the recipe as written. Great job!"
