  "description": "I told y'all I'd do it. That end of year banger that wont necessarily make waves for Recipe of the Year, but should make you feel bad for giving Chrisdvr the crown. This shit is a simple mix with a twist. You already know this was the year of motherfuckers dropping revisions on different strawberry creams. We had Skiddlz dropping a countless flurry of the same recipe. We had Vurve and his dumbass Egyptian Cum bullshit. Can't forget ID10-T and his Game of Thrones dragon juice. Manson dropped Shortdick, might have been last year, I can't be bothered to pay attention, but either way, fuck off. Even the self-proclaimed God of DIY Wayne Walker jerkin off My Man and making a clone of it. Y'all trippin.\r\n\r\nSo let me bury these fucks in a shallow grave so I can watch them as they become worm food. We got the classic strawberries in here, no reason to fuck around with that. But then the mix of TFA VBIC and JF Bavarian Cream creates a real thick and sweet ice cream base with just a touch of that brown sugar and maple notes. Oh that touch of Butterscotch Ripple? Yeah, put that in your ice creams. Don't ask, just do. Thank me later. Finally, that little touch of coconut and meringue. That's where I'm fucking y'all sideways. I ain't fucked with coconut all that much, but in here, it lightens up everything without muting the heavy flavour. Instead of something with crazy mouthfeel, that coconut and meringue adds not only a punch of coconut milk sweetness, but also the subtle hint that you dropped a handful of those delicious coconut flakes in your ice cream.\r\n\r\nShake and vape certified, since that's what I'm about. But after two days, that meringue mixes in with everything to give the coconut flavours more sweetness and helps emulate more of that coconut milk idea. And it lets the VBIC get to it's prime. But shake it up and vape it and love it.\r\n\r\nFuck 2016. Fuck your resolutions and \"2017 will be my year\" bullshit. Next year is gonna suck too. Deal with it. Keep mixing. Keep fucking up.",

      "text": "this is a dope recipe. because i am an asshole i subbed JF's sweet strawberry for TPA's and dropped the percentage to 1 instead of 1.25. it came out great and i don't think the flavor profile is altered that much from what you intended- probably the best strawberry cream i've tried. the coconut and butterscotch ripple really add some depth to it, it's hard to put down. i'll admit this recipe originally made me nervous because of the sheer amount of flavors used- i'm a new mixer and have really only had luck with simpler recipes- 3-5 flavors tops. this one has changed the game for me. i also appreciate your writing style and after stalking your profile a bit i've found some other recipes i'd like to try. thanks so much for sharing!

      "text": "I didn't have all of the ingredients so subbed TFA Coconut Extra for TFA Coconut and FA Red Touch for the TFA Strawberry.  The prominent flavor I get is a candied coconut which could be coming from the coconut extra.  I've since got the TFA strawberry in so may mix up again with a different coconut than the coconut extra.  Very tasty vape but not sure this was the profile you were going for."
