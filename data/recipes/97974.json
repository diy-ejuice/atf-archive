  "description": "\"'Member when vape recipes were simple?\" \r\n\"That was fantastic.\"\r\n\"Oh, I 'member!\"\r\n\r\nThis bevy of tarty fruit packs blueberries and blackberries, with a hint of raspberries and a touch of sugared lemon into a recipe that makes summer feel like it lasts all year round. Due to the way the flavors are balanced, I do not recommend any substitutions. You really need all these brands.\r\n\r\nAdd Sweetener to your personal liking. The Meringue does lend a bit of sugar but everyone likes their vapes at a different sweetness. I prefer no extra Sweetener in this recipe, but if Sweetness is what you're after, start at .25%.\r\n\r\nCertified SnV. This is not a recipe for the steep drawer.\r\n\r\n-vix\r\n\r\n",
