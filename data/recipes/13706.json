  "description": "It is what it is delicious. This recipe  must have at least a 1 week steep, at 2 weeks it is amazing. It can be mixed at whatever ratio you like but I think it's best at Max VG. The only difference between version 1 and version 2 is I added .5% butter pecan and .5% of caramel to sweeten it up version 1did not carry the sweetness that I had gotten from the reference. I was also considering raising the sugar cookie another .5% but I did not want to affect the cream negatively. So here it is feel free to make changes to suit your taste and enjoy.",

It is a very authentic gelato and I enjoyed this vape very much. The more I vape the more I love it. Its subtle but satisfying.  I will definitely make this one again. Great job on this one Krucial"
