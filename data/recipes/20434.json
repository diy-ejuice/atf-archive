  "description": "So there has been some talk a bit about tfa banana nut bread and how good it is so a couple months back I decided to order it and try it out. This stuff is so good even on its own. It inspired me to try to create my grandmothers homemade banana nut bread. She made this delicious bread with chocolate chips in it. I am not talking just a few chips, no no, she made sure there was chocolate in every bite of this amazing treat. Now I took her recipe and tweaked it a bit. I always though when eating her bread that it would be good with frosting on it since I have an insatiable sweet tooth and think everything needs to have more sugar lol. I am extremely happy with how this recipe came out, I am reminded of my grandmother with every puff. I hope you enjoy!  \r\n\r\n\r\n**Nutty Monkey**  \r\nTFA Banana Nut Bread - 5%  \r\nINW Chocolate Cream - 1.5%  \r\nLA Cream Cheese Icing - 2%  \r\nCAP Vanilla Cupcake - 2%  \r\n**Total Flavor:** 10.5%  \r\n\r\n*TFA Banana Nut Bread:* This stuff is amazing right on its own if you like sweet thick bakery flavors. The banana is very present but not overwhelming. It blends in so nicely with the bread. The nuttiness is there, though a tad weak for my tastes which is why I helped it along in this recipe you will read about next.  \r\n\r\n*Inw Chocolate Cream:* I used this as the chocolate chips because of two reasons. The first is the slight nutty flavor this chocolate has. Tfa Banana nut bread, while good on its own, was lacking in the nut department. This recipe isn't super nutty but I wanted more of an impression of nuts than the banana nut bread was giving me on its own The second reason I used chocolate cream is because, like its sister, it is a very creamy, milky chocolate that translates well into chocolate chips.  \r\n\r\n*LA Cream Cheese Icing:* I wanted to do something a little different than traditional banana nut bread and thought that a little cream cheese icing would be a great addition and I was right. This flavor bumps up the over all sweetness of the mix while also adding a bit of tangy cream cheese.  \r\n\r\n*CAP Vanilla Cupcake:* This flavor is helping boost the body of the cream cheese icing as well as the bread. I don't get much cupcake from this flavor at this percentage and get mainly delicious frosting to help round out the cream cheese icing.",
