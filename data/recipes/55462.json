  "description": "Sooo... Inawera did in fact reformulate their Lemon. I've searched high and low for a replacement and the best fit seems to be FE Lemon. It's not as potent as the original Inawera Lemon but it is very close in taste (with no off notes). Secondly I would try OOO Lemon (round candy) at 2% as it's even less potent but still close in flavor. \r\n\r\nAnother sub I often make to take it in an even more candy direction is Hangsens Blueberry at the same percentage. \r\n\r\nThis is my clone of my all time favorite juice, Seduction by Vapor in a Bottle. A brilliant combination of candy lime, lemon, and berries.\r\n\r\nFull notes here: https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/6n74xv/a_beginners_clone_journey_cajolery_a_vapor_in_a",

I never had the original but this mix seems to have enough going on to keep you entertained but not too much to seem convoluted and muddled. I omitted TFA Cotton Candy as I hate how bad it mutes mixes. I don't get really any harshness right from a S&amp;V so it worked out for me. I'd recommend giving this a go and buying the flavors for it considering it has plenty you can use in a bunch of different recipes."
