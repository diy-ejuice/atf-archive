I definitely don't get pineapple from it, seems the FA Milk and VT Love is whats helping bend it into the strawberry. Stupid good. Subbed cap ss for Pur ss. I have cap but i just like pur way more for the same applications. "

      "text": "Graham was absolutely right! It is recipe of the year 2019! I've always had trouble with strawberries because I'm almost blind to them... This was a mystery because I can definitely taste ALL of the commercial S&amp;C I've tried, but all recipes I've tried did fail me. Tried this one and it deserves all the hype it has generated. Acid from Pineapple Lassi blends with straws and after a 5 day to a week steep is indistinguishable and I'm sure if I wouldn't know it's there I would never be able to point it out.  And looks like that strawberries must be \"bent\" in order for me to taste them and one of the biggest mysteries of my vaping career has been solved... Nick (Nickevz) is a wizard and to all the Developed team - thank you for this masterpiece. Hey wayne stop being rear-hurt child and take goddamn notes haha!"

I don‚Äôt normally go for anything with fruit flavours but fancied a change and really happy I did.&#xD;\n&#xD;\nIt‚Äôs not necessarily nesquick but a bloody good strawberry milk, it reminds me of the pre made strawberry milk from Sainsbury‚Äôs in the uk. Probably the nicest strawberry milk juice I‚Äôve tried&#xD;\n&#xD;\nPerfect powder strawberry and fresh crisp milk taste with a touch of something quality (Probably the sugar cookie and white chocolate) in the background to bring it all together.&#xD;\n&#xD;\nI can‚Äôt taste the pineapple at all as it just blends into the recipe"

      "text": "So,when I first mixed this up I‚Äôve gotta be honest with you,I wasn‚Äôt digging it AT ALL!!!! The pineapple was far to forward for me and just took over everything. Now I‚Äôm not a fan of pineapple so initially,this was a huge no go for me! I then put the bottle away to steep for the 3 days as suggested and was absolutely SHOCKED at how this recipe had morphed in only 72hrs!!!! The pineapple has teamed up with the strawberry in such a way that it enhances its artificial like qualities that found in a nesquick milkshake. The milkshake base is a revelation! Thick,sweet,creamy goodness that  encompasses the strawberries to perfection. I‚Äôm actually blown away about how good this recipe actually is! Strawberry milk profiles are literally 10 2 the dozen and at some point, I‚Äôve probably tried them all! This is hands down the best strawberry milkshake I‚Äôve persoanlly EVER tried and I doff my proverbial hat off to you guys,great fucking job!!üëèüèªüëèüèªüëèüèª"

The first couple of days the pineapple note was really there for me, but now, I am getting a delicious Strawberry Nisquik Shake.  I am glad I mixed 120ml.  Thanks for the recipe and awesome content.  :) "

Off the shake you get that sweet pineapple lassi on the inhale and the sweet strawberry behind it. I'll probably only mix up this 60ml and not mix it after I kill it in a few days out of spite. Great job guys!"
