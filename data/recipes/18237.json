  "description": "Apple Strawberry Roll\r\n\r\nThis is my take on an \"Apple Strawberry Roll\"- vape. An old recipe created by my grandma. This cake is original made by painting a bright cake batter with strawberry jam, adding fresh shredded apple, some vanilla and a hint of cinnamon, rolling it up and of course baking it ;) So yummy... My take came out pretty close, close enough to bring me back in time to my grandma's kitchen. Enjoy!\r\n\r\nFA Fuji Apple\r\nI don't have to say much about this. Fuji apple is the most authentic fresh apple flavoring I know. If I was allowed to use more than 6 flavors for this recipe, I'd probably add some INW Two Apples to give it a more baked apple style taste. 2% turned out to be enough to be recognized without overpowering the strawberry. (Unfortunately I wasn't able to get my hands on JF Fuji, because I'm from Europe and no vendor here has it in stock atm.)\r\n\r\nTFA Strawberry Ripe\r\nAgain, IMO the most authentic strawberry out there and my favorite strawberry flavoring. 2.5% turned out to be the right amount to blend in with FA Fuji.\r\n\r\nFA Liquid Amber\r\nLA is used to turn the strawberry to a jam-like filling and to blend in with the apple.\r\n\r\nCAP Cinnamon Danish Swirl\r\nCDS is used mainly for the small touch of cinnamon and adding an extra note to the bakery element. 0.6% was best for me, adding more than 0.75% resulted in a muting effect on the fruits.\r\n\r\nCAP Vanilla Custard (v1)\r\nVC again found its way into one of my recipes. Its purpose is to add the vanilla note as well as a buttery note to the bakery, and also thickening up the whole vape.\r\n\r\nCAP Cake Batter\r\nTo find the right bakery flavoring was the hardest decision for this recipe. I usually use more than one flavoring to create a bakery style of vape. For this recipe I try several bakery-style flavorings (FA Cookie, FA Nonna's Cake, INW Biscuit, CAP Sugar Cookie, TFA/FW Graham Cracker,...) but CAP Cake Batter was the one closest to what I was aiming for. \r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nMixed with around 80% VG and 3mg nicotine. Best after min. 7-10 days steep.\r\n",
