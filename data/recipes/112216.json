  "description": "A good old vitamin c drink/vape. Sometimes pineapple is too sweet on it's own so you bring in some orange juice to settle the sweetness and this is just what happened in this recipe. Although the (CAP) Juicy Orange does add extra sweetness, this recipe pulls on the strength of the juciness from the (CAP) Juicy Orange. (FA) mandarin and (CAP) Sweet Tangerine carry a nice depth from an orange/tangerine flavor and are a pair made in heaven, they are meant to go together. The (CAP) Golden Pineapple is true to it's name and it's playing so nicely with it's citrus companions. For added excitement the (TPA) Rainbow Sherbet carries that citrus fizzle you'd expect to taste in the fruit being freshly eaten or squeezed fresh into a glass. On the inhale you have the liveliness of the mandarins and a pull of pineapple fizz, on the exhale is an orange blast. The entire experience from inhale to exhale is totally on par with a fresh glass of a pine/orange juice that you would skull down first thing in the morning to kick start your day. A total energizing mornings embrace that's packed with vitamin c.\r\nCheck out what DIY Downunder has to offer:\r\nhttps://www.facebook.com/groups/diydownunder/\r\nhttps://discord.gg/kH4Fqbc\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCTCwb7ULyfJALQlehomZZQA\r\nhttps://www.diydownunder.com/",
