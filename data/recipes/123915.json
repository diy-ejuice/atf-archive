    "description": "Delicious papaya dessert, very fruity with a touch of cream to it and the sweet juicyness of the black currant makes it perfect.\r\nYou can use The Perfurmer\/Flavor Apprentice in all the ingredients if you have them.\r\n\r\nPS1: If you like more papaya you may go up 1% if you like it more sweet increase 1% of the black currant and 1% of the bavarian cream.\r\nPS2: Inspiration taken from Victor de Campos Couto\r\nPS3: If you choose to use TPA's papaya please go down to 5% since it is a strong flavor, but the FW papaya (natural) really needs to be at a higher % like 9% or even 10%\r\nPS4: It is a floral recipe since all papayas taste like that, if you don't like floral notes you may decrease the papaya and increase the black currant.",
