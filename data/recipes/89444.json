  "description": "Wanted to use cap double apple but it seemed to get lost in everything i mixed even when i tried pairing it with FA pear. So i mixed it with some FA apple pie and threw in some LB vanilla ice cream. After week steep and some slight tweaking i am happy with what I came up with for the dmc Apple challenge. \r\n\r\nNeeds atleast a week steep 2 weeks is even better ",
