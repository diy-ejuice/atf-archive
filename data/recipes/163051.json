I mix it again and again.  I always have some form of this in my personal stash.  Great simple recipe.  Thank you. I give it a 5 because it's unique in it's own way and is exactly what it says it is.

But that could be due to the fact that I dont' care for INW Custard.  If you like INW Custard this shit may be gold.  If you  want the real deal custard go mix up Game Changer by furiosmixer."
