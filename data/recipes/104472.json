  "description": "A very refreshing sweet ginger mango vape.  Mixing recipes for the warmer time of year and playing around with NF Ginger.\r\n\r\nCAP Sweet Mango is the main flavor. As in a lot of punch drinks there are bright citrus supporting flavors. CAP Lemon Lime brightens the mix and the CAP Juicy Lemon pushes the sweet lemon flavor a bit more forward. NF Ginger gives a nice sweet ginger spice to the fruits. If you ever need a ginger flavor in any mix I would highly recommend this. A tad of CAP Super Sweet and it is complete. You may add 0.25% more or omit it depending on how sweet you want it. You may also add some WS-23, Koolada, or mint for some cooling/mint flavors that also play very well in this.",
