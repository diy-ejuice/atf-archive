    "description": "banana, butterscotch and brittle - cant go wrong, this is just  yummy.   I am a fan of Banana nut bread -  it is   just a fantastic flavor and i wanted to use it as the cupckae base.   if you like more of banana you can add  additional banana cream .   it is a  solid cake\/ bread base with a light banana  back note and some nutty texture, that becomes more prominent as  you increase the %.    The vanilla cupcake  is a very light cake with a strong vanilla  icing note, that works with the butter cream .    The butterscotch ripple adds   a creamy butterscotch top note that I wanted along with the vanilla brittle which adds some  more of that dry  nut note to the finish.    Over all this is a really yummy   simple vanilla bananna cupcake .   Best after 7 days \r\n   if you like that the sweet tooth  rattling type of  cupcake frosting then feel free to add sweetner \r\nIf you want more of a heavier butterscotch note feel free to add to it.    \r\n\r\nLOOKING for a group to learn about  mixing your own juice check out these groups and youtube channels  \r\nhttps:\/\/www.facebook.com\/groups\/diydownunder\/\r\nhttps:\/\/www.diydownunder.com\/ \r\nhttps:\/\/www.youtube.com\/user\/frank1360\r\nhttps:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=-0xkeZFSG04",
