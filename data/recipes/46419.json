  "description": "Who doesn't like a deep fried twinkie??? Well I sure do!!!! Here is how I made it into a vape juice.\r\n\r\nTHE DEEP FRIED  SPONGE CAKE: I used a combination of deep fried sponge cake super concentrate by real flavors and metaphor by flavor art  these two together make the perfect sponge cake consistency for a deep fried twinkie all its missing is that greasy deep fried feeling and for this I used none other  except for funnel cake by Capella. I find funnel cake by Capella to be the perfect ingredient to add the greasy just fried taste and feel I use it with anything I make that is deep fried and I think it works perfect. But if for some reason you hate funnel cake and think it tastes like a greasy mess than don't use funnel cake it will still taste great with or without it.\r\n\r\nTHE CREAMY VANILLA FILLING:\r\nFor the creamy vanilla filling I used a combination  of whipped cream and frosting both by flavorah then I needed to boost the vanilla and help bridge the gap and for this  I used vanilla swirl by tfa and shisha vanilla by inawera. Shisha vanilla helps mesh the bakery notes and the creamy filling it also helps bring out the vanilla notes in the sponge cake.\r\n\r\nSWEETENER:\r\nI used sweetness by flavorah which is my personal favorite sweetener.  The closest thing to it would be Capella super sweet. I do think that the sweetener is necessary. It is rather dry without any sweeteners. \r\nIF YOU MIX IT REVIEW IT!!!! Good or bad its better than nothing.\r\n ",
