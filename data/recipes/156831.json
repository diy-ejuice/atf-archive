    "description": "Made on Fresh03 staurday DIY show     where we try new flavors!  \r\nhttps:\/\/youtu.be\/WHsBKCNOgf0\r\n\r\nIce box cakes are no bake cakes that  you put in the fridge  to solidify  and they are something I grew up on .  This is a creamy full bodied mix with banana topnotes and graham and peanut butter base notes\r\n\r\nI really love the body in the  coconut custard  combined with the banana   works really well   together  and adds a creaminess to the peanut butter \r\nI wanted to mix with the new WF marshmallow gooey  - which in a SFT at 3% was a spot on fluff    with a light vanilla  back note \r\nBanana Puree is a great full bodied banana  that does lean  to slightly candy   and this sits on top of the mix as a bright top note \r\nThe graham  cracker  by FW graham   is just a  true honey  maid type of graham cracker that is supported by the caramel peanut \r\nDX peanut butter  is subtle  here and  dds that dark nutty base note that works with nutty notes in the graham \r\nWhipped cream    adds more body to this mix and  helps blend it  ",
