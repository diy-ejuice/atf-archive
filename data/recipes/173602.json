  "description": "Chocolate Virgina Tobacco\r\n( All Flavorah Recipe)\r\n\r\nThis was my go to hand-rolling blend and i think this mix nails the most remarcable notes i remember from back in the day.\r\n\r\nGolden virginia is a sweet, smooth blend and i always smelled a dark chocolate note when opening a new bag, thats why we have Chocolate deutsch in the mix also helps smoothing out the finish.\r\n\r\nVirginia was an obvious one, this concentrate is pretty one dimensional so here just adds the sweet and bright virginia leafy notes.\r\n\r\nThe main tobacco of the mix is Cured, as a generic tobacco filling is the best, also plays wonders with Red Burley, both giving each other complexity and some chocolate - nutty nuances.\r\n\r\nTo add that little extra notes of realism i used Cream and Sweet Cigarette.\r\nGolden Virginia is a super smooth blend, quite sweet with  the smoke being dense but yet soft and slightly ashy :\r\n 0.8% Cream and 0.2% Sweet cigarette nail this part.\r\n\r\n\r\nMix / Steep: \r\nI suggets 70/30 to get an extra smooth vape but 60/40 is also really nice.\r\n\r\nYou can SnV or either leave it 3-5 days to settle down but as always with FLV Tobaccos after 2 weeks they come back in a really nice and nuanced way.\r\n",
