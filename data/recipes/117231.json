I had a buddy try it thinking I\u2019d trick him in to trying something he hated, but then he said it was beautiful, so I reckon I\u2019ll share it with the world. I don\u2019t know if any place in the US carries the INW Aloe- it was an impulse buy the last time I ordered direct from Inawera. You could probably just use a lil bit of INW Cactus. ",
