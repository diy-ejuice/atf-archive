  "description": "I original made a version of this recipe for mixers club. Tasted great at first but after a few weeks steep I wasn't pleased with it. Dave Id10T suggested i add some FLV Apple Filling to it so that is what I did. Messed around with the percentages and gave my testers a good steep. Going on 3 months now and my tester tastes as good as it did after 7 days. Quite pleased with how this came together and in time for the fall/winter recipe time.\r\n\r\nFLV Apple Filling: adds a great cinnamon spice note and improves the overall apple note of the mix.\r\n\r\nFA Apple Pie: Not really any apple in this but it does add a nice bakery note.\r\n\r\nPur Country Apple: Brings a syrupy apple with no cinnamon or spice to the mix.\r\n\r\nHS French Vanilla Icecream: Brings a creamy vanilla element to the mix.\r\n\r\nMy tobacco combo: Kentucky has some mild spice notes that pair well with the cinnamon in FLV Apple Filling & FLV Turkish. FLV Turkish is mostly spice and it helps keep the Kentucky from fading away in a long steep. ",
