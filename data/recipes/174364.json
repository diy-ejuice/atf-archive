  "name": "apple bourbon bread pudding",
  "description": "Pretty simple premise.\r\n\r\n@ID10-T charged us with making a recipe that recalls a memory of a past Autumn. I have been working in kitchens for most of my life, and I love to play around with food. Last Autumn I made a bread pudding for work that included a whiskey flambeed green apple compote. I loved this dessert when I made it, and may yet make it again ahead of Thanksgiving. \r\n\r\nAnyhow, this is my attempt at recreating this in an eliquid.\r\n\r\nFE french toast and FA zeppola make up the bulk of the \"bread\" in my bread pudding. Conveniently the French toast brings along some extra spices, sweetness, and eggs.\r\n\r\nFLV eggnog is helping in two ways, it is broadening the custard, but it is more importantly doubling down on the spices needed to sell the Autumnal bread pudding.\r\n\r\nINW custard has one job here, and it's really straight forward, make sure the body of the custard is rich enough to stand up to the bread, apples, and whiskey.\r\n\r\nFW hazelnut is just helping normalize the bready notes\r\n\r\nPUR country apple is cooked apples, and absolutely necessary here. It has the sweetness you'd look for along with the \"cooked\" apples rather than something like FA Fuji which tastes much more \"raw\".\r\n\r\nTFA Kentucky bourbon carries the flavor I want and doesn't have the bite you'd get from FLV bourbon, which is perfect for this application. Cooking with booze, especially flambeed the flavor remains but none of the alcoholic bite.\r\n\r\nI've only had time to give this a shake and vape test, so I'm gambling a bit here but if this stays close to the shake and vape flavor without falling apart it should be a nice easy Autumn vape.",

      "text": "A really awesome and festive dessert style recipe. Right off the jump I get a solid punch of Bourbon followed by Apple. Let me just say this combo of FA Zeppola, FE French Toast, INW Custard, and FLV Eggnog is a fucking brilliant way to achieve the bread pudding aspect of this mix. I love this. I did notice that after continued vaping I would lose a little bit of the bread texture to the rest of the mix but I think trying to fiddle with this would just end in a painful circle of bumping one flavor and then losing another, then bumping another and so on and so forth. Long story short I think its great where it is!"

      "text": "Getting everything I should from this, but wanting more. The apple bourbon spice thing comes across perfectly. The bread part is on point, and I think I have to buy FE French Toast now. I even get the custard, but that’s the part where, more than anything, I want more. Bread pudding is just so rich, like sinfully decadent rich, and I just want more of that. More richness, more fullness. I want it to taste like I’m putting on pounds vaping this. I don’t know if just increasing the INW Custard would do it. Maybe it would, maybe something else would have to be brought in and then everything rebalanced.&#xD;\n"

What I am getting smells really good and kind of like a combination of spices, which would make sense for a bread pudding recipe.&#xD;\n&#xD;\nWow. This is amazing right from the start. Everything that was promised is in here. Apple, booze, and a bread soaked in custard. I can't even begin to guess what might be in here other than maybe PUR Country Apple because the apple tastes cooked. &#xD;\n&#xD;\nI had to look at the recipe right away on this one because I really wanted to know how you got the bread pudding aspect in this. This recipe is almost hard to write a review for because there is not anything that I am wishing was here and there is nothing that I would take out. The combination of FE French Toast and FA Zeppola make a very convincing \"bread,\" INW Custard was the perfect custard choice, and the spices from FLV Eggnog and FW Hazelnut make me really want to try your real life recipe. My only complaint is now I have to buy FLV eggnog and FE French Toast. Amazing recipe Fo!"
