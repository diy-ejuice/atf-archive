  "description": "Made a 3 2 1 quickie that I want to share with you guys - I find it difficult to get a custard just right. For me it needs to have a full thick mouth feel, with deep butter and light eggy notes. This is more of the custard base, look in the notes below for my recommendations on the vanilla. \r\n\r\nINW Custard - This is a custard that develops in a week, so I used this one as it gets you 90% there. \r\nCAP Sweet Cream - helps fill out the blank spots in the middle of INW Custard\r\nCAP Golden Butter - This deepens the custard right from the start. \r\n\r\nThis is pretty much a custard base - admittedly this needs a harder Vanilla in it, I would reach for one of these if you prefer your vanilla HARDER! :)\r\n-DFS Holy Vanilla at 1.2%\r\n-CAP French Vanilla or 1.5% \r\n-FA Madagascar (Vanilla Classic) 1%\r\n\r\nSweeten to taste, I like it sweet at 0.3% CAP SS.
