    "description": "If you like bubblegum flavors then look no further than MB American Bubblegum. It is a perfect pink bubblegum flavor. I combine it with FA marshmallow to add a little sticky sweetness that I think it needs for authenticity. \r\n\r\nCAP Sweet Guava is a huge punch of tropical fruit flavor that fits surprisingly well in to a bubblegum recipe. I\u2019ve paired it with Golden Pineapple and Banana Cream (DX) here to really give this recipe the full island treatment. \r\n\r\nBubblegum needs a good amount of sweetener too it. I suggest adding more sweetener than you normally would. \r\n\r\nWatch the video here: \r\n\r\nhttps:\/\/youtu.be\/1niJGsgoBD0",
