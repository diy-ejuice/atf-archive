  "description": "When I decided to quit smoking it was because I didn't like the taste, but still appreciated a good cigar. In La Palma (Canary Islands) they grow great leaves!\r\nThis is what I tried, and without steeping it is a great Cuban Cigar base, aiming to be amplified with some vanilla, or honey.\r\nGold for Pipe (INW) bring necessary sweetness, Absolute Cuban Cigar (INW) the basic spice and Absolute Garuda (INW) the leafy part. \r\nWill mess it up with a vanilla base, when I get to one I like (vanillas are playing hard, or I am just too picky!)",
