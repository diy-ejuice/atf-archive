    "description": "I am using the deep fried pastry dough and biscuit for the main note of the puff along with the eggy note from the Vanilla custard and the butter for my cream I wanted a flavor to spice it up and help set it apart I was torn between lemon and banana, since I just got banana puree in the mail I decided to try that with the cream from flv and again pulling notes from the vanilla custard  but this time I was looking for the vanilla.  As a shake and vape I am mostly getting the vanilla custard and banana puree. I am thinking in 5-7 days the bisquit and deep fried pastry dough will pop out and the banana will soften. I made this recipe by searching online for a recipe to bake some cream puffs and came up with this I have never had a cream puff in real life so in true #mixinvixens fashion I took a shot at it.",
