  "description": "GOT inspired mix made for FRESH03 saturday show  -  A pear dominate  thick syrup  brandy cocktail\r\n\r\nI have always been a Yara fan,  and lets face it  that lady has a set!   \r\n\r\nFor this mix pear is the star,    WF  ripe pear is  full sweet pear with  some flesh and  juiciness.  The  pear halves is a  sweet   almost canned syrup pear which adds the syrup note to this brandy. \r\n Cherimoya   fills out the middle of mix with some body sweetness and pairs really nicely with the pear.  \r\nThe yakima hops  helps add that slight bitter note  along with the brandy  to add the warmth  to give the impression of booze  \r\n FA brandy is not very  booze but really adds a dark sweetness and   sort of softens some of the brightness to the pair.   \r\nSour apple was added for a light sharp note to contrast some of the sweetness and  adds another note to the pear\r\n",
