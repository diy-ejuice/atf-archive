    "description": "CAP Lemon Lime is an ideal base for a limeade. It's pretty well balanced but you get a lot of the lime up front and the lemon sticks around through the exhale. It's sweet, not sour or bitter and has a good amount of body. \r\n\r\nI've added FA Marshmallow to round out the edges and give the profile a nice creamy head. \r\n\r\nCAP Hibiscus is sticky and sweet. It's not a main note here but it does help everything around adding to the authenticity. \r\n\r\nVTA Persian Lime is the star of this show. It is a zesty natural lime that sticks around through the steep. Very Good. \r\n\r\nSome sweetener is essential for this recipe. I use CAP Super Sweet at 0.5% and I think this is a minimum. \r\n\r\nWatch the Video Here:\r\nhttps:\/\/youtu.be\/4V6orBaLnEw",
