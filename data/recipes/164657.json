  "description": "The Finest Choc Mint Recipe I have ever tasted! \r\n\r\nLast week the \"Developed\" team on you tube attempted to create this profile and struggled. In the background I liked the idea of this profile so I challenged myself to create a version of this. \r\nFirst I came up with a concept recipe and then mixed it live on you tube on my channel here:\r\n https://youtu.be/y7uDMGgNxF0?t=2271\r\n Off the shake it was pleasant but I had a question mark over the texture off the shake. However like most mixes I do I try and return back to them after a steep to learn more. This one after a couple of days was ok but not the texture I was after but after a week I am real happy with this.\r\n\r\nThe mint was a bit to prominent for my liking off the shake & at two days but after a week it has settled nicely. \r\n\r\nBottom line is, this has turned out to be the most delicious choc mint recipe that I have not only tasted but also created and I have tried quite a few. \r\n\r\nWhat I did & Why: \r\nI referred to real life recipes, previous successful macaron eLiquid recipes and experience from single flavor testing ect to finally come up with this recipe that turned out amazing.\r\n\r\nThe Choc & MInt - I chose LB Lava Cake as I wanted an honest yet dense flavoured chocolate that wouldn't offend here and this ended up being a good choice along with some help from the contrasting chocolate notes that comes with MB Cookie BIte. The Mint couldn't only be about the flavour of the mint. It also had to be about the illusion of texture. The only mint I know of that I get a slight chewy like type of mint from is Capella Cool Mint & it works here beautifully, not only for the mint but seemingly assists with textual mouthfeel.\r\nHowever, it did take time to settle where I think it's at the right level. You could bring this down to around 0.75% but I don't think it would assist as well with the overall mouthfeel.\r\n\r\nThe Bakery - In my experience a macaron has a unique yet delectable texture and this is the biggest challenge of this profile and the developed team also seemed to struggle with for good reason, it's a massive level of difficulty. The macaron has crunch, chewiness, a meringue like texture and little mellow cream through the center. \r\nTo obtain the separation of all that in an eLiquid is no easy feat. I balanced the crunch from the tones of the MB Cookie Bite and the FA Almond, the chewiness come out from the Cap Whipped Marshmallow, a little from the FA meringue and the Cap Cool Mint. The meringue like texture came from the contrasting tones of sweetness from FA Meringue, OOO Powdered sugar and to be honest the lucky dip of notes that seemingly married together nicely from most of the concentrates that just seem to sell the over all mouthfeel of this very difficult bakery profile.\r\n\r\nThe Cream and Gloss of the Bakery - Macaron's have that lovely gloss on the bakery and to get that to feel real with everything else here I thought initially would be a challenge. Till I added VT Vanilla Buttercream Frosting that is. The buttery part of that really assists with that gloss I think and it gives a lovely center of dessert cream through the middle which just works. \r\n\r\nThis was a recipe of taking chances, combining experience and taking inspiration and going with it, but it works! \r\nI am so glad that I took a chance and didn't give up on this as most could,  because I now have a delicious all day vape that will be in a 250ml bottle ready to enjoy when ever I want. \r\n\r\nGive it a go and let me know what you thought of this!\r\n\r\nThere are no subs here, but don't let that hold you back from experimenting and trying other ways and let me me know how that went, \"Together, Let's Discover\" \r\n\r\nEnjoy!\r\n\r\nI tested on a Wotofo Recurve RDA 0.2ohm SST coils at 60w\r\n\r\nI hope you enjoy this just as much as I enjoyed creating this recipe, but let me know what you thought in the comments below.\r\n\r\nSeriously if you like a solid recipe that works give it a go!\r\n\r\nCheers for reading this far, now go and get mixing!\r\n\r\n\"Together, Let's Discover!!!\"\r\n\r\nFacebook - https://www.facebook.com/groups/diydownunder/\r\nDiscord - https://discord.gg/kH4Fqbc\r\nYoutube - https://www.youtube.com/c/diydownunder\r\nWebsite - https://www.diydownunder.com/\r\nInstagram IGTV : @diydownunder",
