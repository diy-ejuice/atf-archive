    "description": "\"Since I Hate the State That Reddit Is In, I Figured I Would Post Something to Piss Everyone Off\"\r\n\r\nRemember when pop punk bands used to write songs that had excessively long song titles like that? Yeah, I guess I'm bringing it back.\r\n\r\nAnyway, I'm not gonna do a super in depth breakdown of this, because it's pretty obvious how it works, but I'll do a proper flavour note documentation on reddit here in a little bit. This is just what it seems to be, a slightly tart and bright strawberry recipe. I was initially going for a candied strawberry soda profile, but it wasn't working out, so I went for a more tart strawberry, and that worked nicely. I'll post both of these, because I did a version that works really nicely in pod devices as well. Enjoy.",
