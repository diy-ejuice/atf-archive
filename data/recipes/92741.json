    "description": "Obviously working with all Vape Train flavors, I was really impressed with their tropical fruits. The fruit combination is very sweet and bright, with just a hint of tartness. The Sorbet is a really interesting flavor. It adds a full mouthfeel, almost creamy, and a cooling to the vape. This is my first time using any kind of cooling in a recipe since it isn't really something I vape, but this sorbet I had to make an exception for.",
