  "description": "New and greatly improved. This is super simple and authentically delicious. Tastes good as a shake and vape, and is great after an overnighter. 5 to 7 days for perfection. I haven't tried it but a smidge of ws-23 may drive home an authentic cold and milky bowl of Apple Jack's. So mix it up and enjoy, thanks KRUCIAL...",
