Normally I do mix Rin\u2019s recipes as written and usually I do find them plenty flavorful. This one, I looked at 2% LB Vanilla Ice Cream and was like no freaking way is that enough ice cream, and I immediately just doubled everything. Now I think that was a huge mistake. The peanut and ice cream parts are nice, but I\u2019m searching for the caramel and cone and mostly finding some kind of weird smoked vanilla instead. &#xD;\n"
