  "description": "A buddy of mine, his dad used to pour loads of syrup into peanut butter and just dip loaves of bread and eat it. Once I tried this, I gained so much weight eating this all the time. I had the urge to try it again, and decided to throw it into the vape form. Surprisingly this works very well off the shake, but I would suggest letting it sit for a bit, the bread base does so well after sitting. ",
