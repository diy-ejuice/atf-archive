    "description": "Updated changed cake in mix to JF Yellow Cake. \r\nThis is my version of a Ooey Gooey Butter Cake. I find it interesting to read the history on how a dessert came about, and just like most things in history, many different versions exist. \r\n**history**\r\nThe Gooey Butter Cake originated in the 1930s.  According to legend, a German baker added the wrong proportions of ingredients in the coffee cake batter he was making.  It turned into a gooey, pudding-like filling.\r\nMy favorite story:\r\nThis cake is a legendary Depression-era mistake. The story goes something like this: A baker in St. Louis accidentally mixed up the ingredient proportions for his cake, resulting in a gooey texture. Because it was the Depression, they couldn\u2019t just throw it out, so they sold it and it was an instant hit.\r\n\r\nWhatever the true history, it is loved by many, their are many different versions, here is my version.   Enjoy. \r\n\r\nLearn more about mixing here:\r\nhttps:\/\/www.diydownunder.com\/\r\nhttps:\/\/www.facebook.com\/groups\/diydownunder\/\r\nhttps:\/\/discord.gg\/kH4Fqbc\r\nhttps:\/\/www.youtube.com\/channel\/UCTCwb7ULyfJALQlehomZZQA\r\nwww.instagram.com\/diydownunder\r\n\r\nHave you tried this recipe?!\r\nPlease rate this recipe and comment below!
