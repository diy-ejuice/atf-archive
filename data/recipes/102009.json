  "description": "This is a wonderful spring time adv!  The flavors work really well together!! The top note being watermelon and all the wonderful flavors work really well to hit all the note in your mouth! Give it a try! You'll love it.  You can also add a drop of your favorite lime per 30cc to give it an extra boost.  No sweetener is necessary because it has a beautiful fruit flavor that is sweet enough.  The more i vape this the more i love it!!  It's so wonderful that you have to give it a try for sure!!! You won't be disappointed at all ðŸ’ž ",

Perfect summer ADV. I added 1% ws-23 for cooling after tasting the original mix. Love it both ways. Thanks for the recipe! "
