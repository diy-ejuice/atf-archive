  "description": "This started out as a basic strawberry vanilla mix to see if I could meet a friends expectations...then I realized, you're never going to meet anyone's expectations so....why not just give them a good recipe and some crazy eyes?\r\n\r\n**I leave out the sweetner - only added for those who want a commercial feel**\r\n\r\nCap Sweet Strawberry and the FLV Alpine Strawberry play nice together in this mix.  While many have moved on from FW Yellow Cake, it's my go to for a sweet, sticky cake base and with the addition of INW Yes, We Cheesecake, I get the body I'm looking for in the mix. \r\n\r\nVT Vanilla Buttercream Frosting adds a finishing creamy note that compliments the INW Cheesecake.  It COULD be used at a higher percentage to taste however I prefer this flavor under 2% in a mix like this. \r\n\r\n",
