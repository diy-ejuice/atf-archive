  "description": "**edit** i sorry if you have mixed this with the mad fruit but i had to remove it as it brang down the hole recipe i stand by that this is what a redbull should tast like ðŸ˜€\r\n\r\nI was trying to think about how i would replicate a red bull so i went out and bought every red bull drink i could get my hands on. what i soon realised was that i didn't actually like red bull lol or at least the ones i could get from the shop so i went about creating my own perfect red bull using flavours i could get from sydney vapour. i started with the forest fruit and lemonade and it was good but just felt the berry's needed a boost and i remembered some one from one of the forums i follow saying that blueberry is good with lemon so i added a dash of blue berry extra and it was great i vaped 30ml in one day after a 3 day steep and found myself wanting more. \r\n\r\n#diydownunderjulychallenge",
