  "description": "This started with a test. Wanted a strawberry cheesecake, but this time with strawberries way up front. \r\n3 days: Cheesecake had some weird off notes and strawberries were drowning somewhere at the bottom.\r\n7 days: Strawberries took over the mix pushing back the cheesecake. Crust was at place though\r\n14 days: This is the moment where all flavors melt together in a well rounded flavorful recipe with strawberry up front like it was ment to be.\r\nThe only change I made was lowering SS to 0.33.
