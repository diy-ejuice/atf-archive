  "description": "This is a recipe to highlight how delicious Holy Vanilla is. A couple of ingredients are thrown in to support it without getting in the way.\r\n\r\n**FA Coconut**: can't really taste it here and thats my intention. This stuff adds a nice and light mouthfeel. The slight coconut taste just accents vanilla very well and blends into everything else you're tasting.\r\n\r\n**CAP Vanilla Custard**: here to thicken it up a bit and not detract from everything else, just a bit of diacetyl for ya.\r\n\r\n**TPA Vanilla Swirl**: a nice counterpart for Holy Vanilla with a different vanilla flavor. adds slight sweetness and milkiness (not that we're in dire need of any of these qualities but it does add something else to the vanilla), needs 4-7 days to shine. \r\n\r\nThere you have it, if you own Holy Vanilla I'm hoping you've got everything else to mix this up. I do not by any means find Holy Vanilla boring by itself, but this just adds to it and takes it to another level. This mix is sweet and creamy with a nice light coconut and floral nuance. \r\n\r\n*I like this as a S&V but give it a week, its really worth the wait. This is for whenever I need to binge on vanilla.*",
