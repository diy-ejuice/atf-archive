    "name": "Honey Caramel Cream",
    "description": "After steep: \r\nAt first this tasted sour. like, soured cream almost... but after 3 days it seems to taste like a honey covered caramel cream\r\n\r\nThe cereal 27 adds a great honey grain to the mix.\r\n\r\ncaramel original helped mask the high\/sourness from the vienna cream and brings out more of the caramel from catalan cream. \r\n\r\nbavarian cream is the base. that sweet, custard-y cream.\r\n\r\nHazelnut works magic but you can probably leave it out if you'd prefer.\r\n\r\nWhy should you mix this up? \r\n\r\nIf you like honey and caramel and thickness to your vape.\r\n\r\nsteep this for 3 days minimum or it will be sour and not very good at all.\r\n\r\nremember to rate and comment, even if you hate it. Maybe we can figure out why you don't like it and improve it for your tastes. \r\n\r\nWhen using TFA's Smooth: Use only 1 drop per 10ML. so in a 30ml bottle use 3 drops. This blends it all together and puffs it up a little bit. Mutes the sour notes and brings out the more sweetness from the caramel.\r\n\r\nNote: This is a first run. there's room for improvement. \r\n\r\nLet it sit for 3 days minimum.\r\n\r\nBest after 14-21 days.\r\n\r\nE: This is pretty bad. I can't believe anyone saw this and thought it might be good.",
