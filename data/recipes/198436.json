  "description": "This recipe was created by me from a challenge I devised on Beginners DIY vape on Facebook. \r\n\r\nChallenge was given to me by TOC. Flavor profile was given and recipe was basically my best guess based on the recipe. \r\n\r\nTastes quite delicious. Needs a week steep to really shine but overnight it still tastes dank. ",
