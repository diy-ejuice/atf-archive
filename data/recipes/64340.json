    "description": "This is a nice light coconut cream pie flavor. Perfect for a nice light dessert vape. This could Definetely be used as a Stone to add fruits to as well. I simply love it just as is. \r\nFLV Coconut - Brings that Authentic cocunut flavor and really make it taste top notch.\r\nTFA Coconut Candy - This adds a nice cocunut sweetness to the recipe bringing it to more of that dessert type flavor.\r\nGraham Cracker Clear and inw biscuit -combine to bring the flaky Crust of a pie to the recipe.\r\nVanilla Swirl TFA - brings a solid vanilla flavor that works well in various bakery recipes.\r\nShisha vanilla - this Adds a nice light sweet Vanilla flavor to add to the goodness of vanilla Swirl.\r\nTFA Butter- just brings a little buttery note to the flaky Crust to make it feel like a true bakery pie fresh out of the oven. \r\nFA Cream Fresh adds that nice dairy note as well as the whipped cream topping that you experience in a real Cocunut cream pie. \r\nCap Supersweet- this is optional, but I think it just gives the recipe a much needed sweetness to make it that much better. Mixed at 70\/30. Steep 7 days for best results .",

That also is my only small complaint. While not being over powering, I get that suntan lotion off note from the coconut here. Only ever so slightly. I don't know how either with as low add the %s are here but that's also just me. This is still very good though. "
