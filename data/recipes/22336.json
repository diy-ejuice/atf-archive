  "description": "Cornflakes Cereal Milk with a Sweet Apple Accompaniment \r\n\r\nNot much to say on this one, It just works. - If you don't want to use the FA Fuji - you can pretty much sub it out for most other fruits. Everything else though, if you can include it, or can get hold of it on order it's worth it.\r\n\r\nCan be a shake and vape, but this recipe only gets better with time, I left a bottle for 3 weeks and it was in my own inflated opinion truly awesome. It develops into a golden beauty of a specimen.\r\n\r\nFA Meringue / FA Caramel - This combo helps give that caramelized/frosted flaked taste and helps boost the sweetness in the apple a little. The Meringue is higher than traditional usage but at high percentages helps give a sweet subtle dairy note.\r\n\r\nFA Cream Fresh / TPA Dairy Milk - This is the milky cream note, it's not swimming in milk but it's all softened by it, it fills in the gaps of this overall profile.\r\n\r\nFA Fuji / CAP Cinnamon Danish Swirl-  FA Fuji speaks for its self, one of the best apples around and helps give that apple juice taste in your mouth, then you've taken a scoop of cereal and omnomnomnom. Cinnamon Danish just adds a little extra richness to the flake glaze and a bit of traditional spicing to the apple, just a hint though.\r\n\r\nCAP Cereal 27 - In my opinion, this is the KING of the cereal concentrates, tastes exactly like it is supposed to. It's a corn flake. \r\n\r\nCAP Super Sweet - If you don't have it, aim for about 1,3-1.5% Sucralose as super sweet is double strength so better bang for your buck.\r\n\r\nIf you mix this and you like it please rate / review it.",
