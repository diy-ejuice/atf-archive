  "description": "This is the third of the 3 mixes I took with me to Vape Expo Nantes in March 2019. I was kindly offered the possibility to go sponsored by Wonder Flavours and I took the opportunity. The best part is, Frank also made sure I received the whole line of Wonder Flavours flavorings.\r\n\r\nThis mix being for the second biggest French expo, I decided to only use Wonder Flavours TPD ready flavorings. I just love exotic flavors and tropical drinks. They're my favorite things to vape and I couldn't pass on these lovely fruits by WF.\r\n\r\nI want to thank MB ( https://alltheflavors.com/users/MECH_MOD_RN ) who helped developed and test these recipes !\r\n\r\nWF Island Mango/WF Tangerine/WF Pineapple Candy = The Island Mango is just so sweet and so ripe it will hurt your teeth in the best way. The pineapple candy is very very pineapple, sweet and sugary, but the candy feeling will recess after 5-7 days. The tangerine comes mostly at the end of the vape for a nice little touch of tang that is welcome.\r\n\r\nWF African Horned Cucumber/WF Lemon Lime Soda = If you're familiar with TPA Dragon Fruit or INW Cactus, then you'll understand right away what African Horned Cucumber does. It's a juicy flesh flavoring that will turn any tropical fruit you pair it with into a juice. The Lemon Lime soda doubles up to turn this into a nice drink but also to support the tangerine's little twist of acidity.\r\n\r\nIt's a yellow mix, sweet on the tongue and with a little tang on at the end. Consume without moderation on the shake, or a few days later, it'll do the job.\r\n\r\nEnjoy, be queer & vape on !!\r\n\r\n\r\n[Photo credit: Delightful Adventures - Gwen Leron]",
