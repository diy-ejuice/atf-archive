    "description": "I have worked on French Toast for what seems like ever. It was always missing something. Once I finally got the Bread aspect, the Syrup and Butter just right I realized it was missing that Browned Egg portion on the outside of the bread. With a little help I settled on using INW Custard for the Eggy part. That was it... the Custard was exactly what it was missing. At this % it isn't overpowering but stands out enough from the other flavors that you actually get the Browned Egg coating of actual french toast. The Bread is made using the RF French Toast and WF Cinnamon Pastry, INW Custard is the Egg coating and OOO French Toast at this % gives the Browned egg and edges to the bread, the Butter Base is of course the Butter and the Maple Syrup perfected came from a lovely mixer whom I can not remember their name that posted a maple syrup that used Caramel, Butterscotch, Golden Syrup and FA Maple I just adjusted it to my liking for this mix. ( If this is your Maple invention please Leave a Comment so you can get credit for the delicious Mapley  mix)",
