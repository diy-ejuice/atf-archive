  "description": "**It's Peepus Christ, crucified on a white chocolate cross. He died for your diabeetus.**\r\n\r\nRecipe development takes time. Even when batching out different versions at the same time, it takes time to balance the ingredients just the way you want them. So I've shared weekly recipes on FlavorPro's [facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/groups/flavorpro/) for the #yearofmixing competition and even won a super fancy pen in one of the random drawings for it, but those recipes were version one and I haven't had time to develop any of them enough to be worthy of posting on ATF. Until now. This one was conceived for FlavorPro's Peeps Week. Mix some up and have it well-steeped in time for Easter! \r\n\r\nI used a combination of FLV White Chocolate and FW White Chocolate to get plenty of creamy white chocolately flavor, something I learned from trying the delicious [Crazberry Crack](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/32359#crazberry_crack_by_jbird) recipe by @jbird . \r\n\r\nFA Marshmallow, FLV Marshmallow, and FLV Whipped Cream make up Peepus' body, which is broken for you. Take, vape, do this in remembrance of him. FLV Marshmallow and FLV Whipped Cream are so similar, you could really use one of them at 1% instead of both at 0.5%, but the result will either be a little more dry or a little more loose, depending. \r\n\r\nGetting something resembling artificially colored granulated sugar coating was harder, but a combination of OoO Powdered Sugar, FW Sweetener, and a little FW Birthday Cake got me as close as felt I needed to go. Peepus will forgive me for it not being perfect as long as it's yummy. ",

Certainly well crafted and well thought out, I would have never thought to add birthday cake but it really works here.  I used all marshmallow b/cuz I didn't have whipped cream on hand and right off the shake its pretty tasty, can only imagine how this will steep in.  Im not much of a fan of simple 4 ingredient recipes, my style is more layered ones such as this, yet its not over complicated.  You can really feel the stickiness on the inhale and the creaminess on the exhale.  well done Dave!"
