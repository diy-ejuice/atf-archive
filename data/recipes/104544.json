    "description": "This recipe is a twist on the amazing mixing of Jennifer Jarvis.\r\nI copied her recipe with the flavourings I had at the time and have stuck with this since.\r\nThe percentages are very low but still produces an extremely complex and pleasant vape at every wattage I have thrown at it.\r\nEvery atty I try it on brings different notes to the surface, all of which have been delicious.\r\nThanks for the inspiration Jennifer.\r\n",

            "text": "Wow. This stuff is damned tasty. The sweet rice is excellent, the perfect amount of rice in rice pudding. The creme brulee, sweet cream, vanilla swirl make it the right amount of sweet, with the flv cream and inw custard making the pudding that perfect consistency. Gotta say tho, the CDS is an inspired touch. It adds a extra bit of mouthfeel, and some extra flavor that makes this go from rice pudding to a damned good rice pudding. That dash of cinnamon...just brilliant. And the coconut...perfect pitch. High enough to be completely there, BUT not high enough to be suntan lotion. This is a beautiful dessert.&#xD;\n&#xD;\nAs my buddy said when he hit it, \"Damnit, now i gotta go get some pudding.\"&#xD;\n&#xD;\n...he did, too.&#xD;\n&#xD;\nNailed it! Nice job."
