  "description": "A english fave an a american fave combined ! For a simple recipe im loving this at the moment ! \r\nGreat combo an loads of flavor wihout over doing any %s A sweet blackcurrant rancher with a touch of strawberry \r\nHave made loads of versions of this with different fruits an this is defo my favorite \r\nFew notes \r\n\r\nJF/CAP- SWEET STRAWBERRY \r\nPlay nicely together these 2 without taking to much of the front note loving the JF version which is a bit more sweety/candy style an works well with the more subtle cap version  ! i didnt want a INW sickly kinda strawberry wanted it to just an add to the Blackcurrant an support it \r\n\r\nINW-BLACKCURRANT \r\nLove this version super tasty soon as i tasted it i instantly had a ribena mix in mind ! Nice an full an has a bit of depth to it \r\n\r\nFW-HARD CANDY \r\nGreat to pair with fruits ive used similar recipe with watermelon, apple an bluberry an it gives a good base that is easy to work with ! Tried  many different %s but 5 is my fave ! 6+ an it can almost become harsh an slightly chemical \r\n\r\nEM \r\nHelps to smooth the FW candy with the strawberry an blackcurrant an pulls a bit of sweetness out !\r\nAs its a sweet i like 1% sweetener but you guys try what works for you \r\n\r\n",
