  "description": "It's getting to be that time of the year when you start to see holiday themed recipes.  So, to kick off the upcoming season we created a Cranberry Thumbprint.   This is a shortbread cookie infused with an almond essence and topped with just a \"thumbprint\" of  cranberry jam.  Super simple profile, but intricately designed.
