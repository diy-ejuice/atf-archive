  "description": "Delicious grapey lemonade with a twist of dark berries.\r\n\r\nTPA Grape Juice - sweet, juicy, candylike.  Reminiscent of Mountain Dew Pitch Black.  Perhaps that's why I like it so much.\r\n\r\nRF Blueberry Lemonade Slushie/FA Lemon Sicily - good lemonade base with a touch of candy blueberry.\r\n\r\nFA Forest Fruit - dark berries, blackcurrant, really helps push the grape in a different, but delicious direction\r\n\r\nKoolada and Sweetener added to taste.  I prefer 0.25%-0.5% koolada and 0.5%-1.5% sweetener.\r\n\r\nStill WIP.  I welcome any and all feedback!",

      "text": "I see this as a recipe with HUGE potential, held back by just one ingredient. Combining Grape Juice with Forest Fruits? Awesome. Combining Grape with Lemon and Forest Fruits with Lemon? Hell, yes. But that Blueberry Lemonade Slushie. It has a weird chemical off-note for me as a shake and vape. I tried this with just a short steep as suggested to see if something in the recipe managed to mask that, no luck. I tried letting it steep for over a week to see if it steeped out and it does, but what it leaves behind is a blueberry that's a little too earthy for this application and a lemonade that's a little too Country Time for my personal taste. Yanking that Blueberry Lemonade Slushie out of here and replacing it with a more realistic lemon flavor could turn this into an outstanding recipe, in my opinion. "
