  "description": "Have you ever looked at the art work on a commercial bottle of e-liquid and been inspired, when I saw the brilliant label on strange fruits \"Spoiled Milk\"  I wanted that e-liquid, but I wasn't going to pay for it, I read the profile, a lime citrus milkshake and I had a bash at it a few versions down the line and this recipe was born and so I proudly present \"Spoiled Milk blind remix\" .",
