  "description": "A while ago, I picked up WF Butterscotch Cream Pie - and quite frankly... I forgot why.\r\nSo I thought to myself \"enough is enough!\" and I made this with it.\r\n\r\nThe Crust:\r\n\r\nI decided the mixture of AP, INW biscuit and FA Apple Pie would make the perfect crust I was looking for and it has a sort of butteriness over this combo. And I really wanted you to taste the crust!\r\n\r\nThe Filling:\r\n\r\nDuh.. WF Butterscotch Cream Pie, which is helped on its way by INW Custard, FW Butterscotch Ripple and a little bit SS to make it disgustingly sweet.\r\nI find that WF Butterscotch Cream Pie has just about enough cream in it for me to get away not using a cream - although FW Butterscotch Ripple does give it a hand with that as well.\r\n\r\nEnd Notes:\r\n\r\nIt tastes pretty fatty, sweet and buttery. Makes me feel like a disgusting pig vaping this, but it's such a guilty pleasure really.\r\nGive it about 3 days steep and you're good to go.\r\n\r\nEnjoy!",
