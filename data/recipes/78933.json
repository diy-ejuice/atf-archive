I made a second batch subbing out the salted caramel for butterscotch (FW) at the same percentage of 3.5 and it was a dream also..  If I could give you 10 stars I would."

When I started mixing almost a year ago the two flavors I wanted to replicate if possible were Jam Monster Blueberry and Milk Plus....Milk Plus now DONE..  This doesn't just give you another Caramel and Cream this gives you the exact same Caramel and Cream  Bravo to the Creator for this one, I will always have some on hand as of now.   Love to all...Kim"
