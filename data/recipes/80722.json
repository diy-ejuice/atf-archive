The watermelon is sweet and juicy, the dragonfruit...yeah, don't really know how to describe it, dragonfruit is it's own weird tasty little beast. What throws me is the tag on this recipe for milkshake. There's not a drop of cream in this recipe, but damn me if it don't taste like a watermelon dragonfruit milkshake, or at least a smoothie.&#xD;\n&#xD;\nWhatever the hell it is, it's tasty. That's all I really need to know.&#xD;\n&#xD;\nThis one is for fans of watermelon, dragonfruit, fruit smoothies, and interesting, rich combinations that are much more than they would appear to be at a glance."
