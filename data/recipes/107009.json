    "description": "Profile: An spicy cooked and warm mango sauce.\r\n\r\nFLV Mango \/ CAP Sweet Mango - Both create an pulpy riped mango. The FLV Mango really helps on this task and CAP Sweet Mango brings authenticity.\r\nFLV Eggnog \/ FLV Rich Cinnamon (1 drop) - FLV Eggnog brings warmness without getting the nutmeg note, which sometimes ruins recipes, and 1 drop of Rich Cinnamon just complements and sweetens a little the overall profile.\r\nFA Apricot \/ TPA Dragonfruit - FA Apricot is a key ingredient on this profile. It balances the mango out and gives another vibe to the Mango itself.\r\nTPA Kentucky Bourbon - Helps to cook the mango without bringing booziness to the profile.\r\n\r\nI can't get where I live but FLV Heat it's probably great here. Just a couple drops is enough.\r\n\r\nIt's recommended to vape this in an hot temperature to get the full experience.\r\n\r\nGive this recipe 1 week steep or you'll just get the FLV Mango.\r\n",

            "text": "Someone get this man some FLV Heat. That\u2019s what this really needs. The cinnamon and little touch of Eggnog brings some warmth and spice but doesn\u2019t quite hit that \u201cspicy\u201d bar. It might also help to fully cook the mango more than the bourbon is doing. I enjoyed vaping this because mango, but it still tastes too fresh for sauce. Unfortunately I don\u2019t have an answer for what would definitely take it there. Experiments with FA Liquid Amber and mango haven\u2019t produced promising results. Maybe a bit of something jammy that tastes like some other cooked down fruit would get it the rest of the way there? VT Jam It or something like that?     "
