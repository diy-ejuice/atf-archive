  "description": "A sweet, sticky, tart berry hard candy reminiscent of those I used to eat during the hot summer months when I was a child. \r\n\r\nOriginally, I started with the goal of creating a sour gummy candy but, as soon as I tasted the flv sour apple and boysenberry flavorings, I knew what direction I had to go in. \r\n\r\nUtilizing a combination of FLV Boysenberry and WF Boysenberry Raspberry, I created a sweet berry base. The FLV Sour Apple added the tartness often found in berry candies and the CAP Jelly Candy adds that sweet stickiness that coats your mouth and leaves you smacking your lips. Finally, the FLV Wild Melon helps minimize the heaviness of the berry base and smooths out the vape while maintaining that candy goodness.\r\n\r\nTested on the Jenna RDA, airflow halfway open. Fused clapton with dual core 28g KanthalA1, 38g KanthalA1 wrap. 6 wraps, .65Ohms.\r\n\r\nAs with all recipes, I never think anything is fully complete, so all critiques are very much welcome.",
