    "description": "This my take on Strawberry Shortcake. For my strawberries and strawberry drizzle I used a combination of purilum\/nicotine river strawberry biscuit at 5% this is more of a buttery strawberry flavor almost more of a strawberry syrup but mixed with strawberry ripe by tfa at 3% it turns it into a more authentic strawberry with a strawberry syrup drizzle. Well the next part to my strawberry short cake is the base now there are many ways to achieve a strawberry short cake base so why limit myself to just one being how they are all delicious. So I chose to utilize a biscuit base and a sponge cake base both versions are good and both mix well into a Vape juice I did this with: Labyrinth by Flavor Art at 3.5% is my sponge cake and then I use Biscuit by Inawera at 1% for my biscuit blow its not really a biscuit but we can dream right and out really works in this mix. \r\nLast but not liest is the whipped cream: I achieved this by using a combination of Meringue by flavor art at 1.5% and cream fresh by flavor art at 1% and shisha vanilla by inawera at .5% Well all that's left is giving this recipe 3 to 4 days to fully blend although it is delicious almost immediately.\ud83d\ude01 Enjoy!!!!",
