    "description": "An artificial strawberry that hints at natural wild floral notes without focusing on them. It\u2019s fresh, clean and very different than any other strawberry vape I\u2019ve had. Like all of my endgame recipes, it\u2019s been developed using agile methodologies and improved using several documented iterations. I\u2019ve ensured each flavoring has a specific job to perform and taken into consideration the behavioral properties of the ingredients foster a cohesive relationship, bringing the recipes concept into reality across many different devices, temperatures and atomizer formats. \r\n\r\nAbout the recipe and roles of the ingredients: \r\n\r\n1.) Alpine strawberry brings an authentic wild strawberry to the mix. \r\n\r\n2.) Glazed strawberries brings a creamy sticky mouthfeel to the middle of the profile. \r\n\r\n3.) Sweet strawberry is the main body of the flavor, used at a higher percentage here to fill out the profile. \r\n\r\n4.) Strawberry ripe helps the natural wild strawberry brought by alpine while helping the flavors to congeal and for lack of a better term, helps the whole recipe get along and calm the fuck down. .2% alpine is high in my opinion, so this is more of a chemical \/ behavioral decision that shows a full effect after a few days of steeping. \r\n\r\nYou could shake and vape this, but you\u2019ll appreciate a little bit of patience to give the strawberry ripe time to enhance and mute some of the edges off of the flavorings involved. \r\n\r\n5.) Cool kids use sweetener, I wanted a commercial feel here so I went with super sweet. This is the only acceptable substitutable or optional point in the recipe. \r\n\r\nFor those of you mixing by volume, stop. Still mixing by volume? One drop of alpine per 30ml. No more. If you accidentally spill a third drop, your recipe is ruined. The shit means business. Even if you\u2019re mixing with a scale, it might be good to just use the drop method. You likely can\u2019t mix this under 30ml because of the concentration of alpine strawberry. \r\n\r\nEnjoy. Born. ",
