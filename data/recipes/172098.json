  "name": "TOC'S Bourbon Cream Cookies",
  "description": "This is a recipe I made for my 67-year-old mother who doesn't drink but can't live without this vape.  As in, it's the only thing she wants to vape.  I've tried taking down the FLV Bourbon and she doesn't like it as much (yes I know it's a high amount for FLV).   This is a very unique vape, and yes it smells like bourbon to everyone around you but it's also very sweet and creamy.  I've even gotten to where I enjoy this in my rotation.  I know these %'s seem high but seriously try it my way because I've tweaked this twelve different ways and this is the only one she wants.  In her words \"It's the only flavor I can really taste.\"   She refuses to wait for steeping and uses it as a Shake and Vape.  I like it better after five days.  I'm making this 120 ml a week for her.",
