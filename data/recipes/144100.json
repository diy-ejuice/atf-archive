  "name": "Mega Melons - Remix v2",
  "description": "Inspired by the recipe of the same name by MixinVixens. First off, I didn’t have the same ingredients for the most part, so I subbed my own. Secondly, I made some changes and introduced flavorah wild melon. The original recipe suggests 2% super sweet which is obviously excessive, but I tried it at 1% and was pleasantly surprised. It’s great. \r\n\r\nShake and vape but there’s a lot of flavoring there. It settles down and blooms around the one week mark. \r\n\r\nOriginal recipe here: http://e-liquid-recipes.com/recipe/1083464/Mama%20Melons%20%28Inspired%20by%20Monster/Mega%20Melon%29",
