    "description": "Inspired by a The Mixing Vixens challenge.\r\n\r\nWhen I was living in Puerto Rico I was introduced to a coconut pudding with cinnamon and toasted coconut called \"Tembleque.\"  This is a variation of that pudding topped with passionfruit.\r\n\r\nThe foundation is the WF Coconut Custard, but the Toasted Coconut Cheesecake brings out the custard and coconut flavor.  A simple topping of Passion with just a touch of Cinnamon Sugar completes the recipe.\r\n\r\nAlthough this tastes great off the shake, it improves with time.\r\n\r\nTested at 60\/40 VG\/PG, 0.45 ohm, 316SS, Citadel clone\r\n\r\n",
