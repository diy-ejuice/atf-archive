  "description": "This is a collaboration between myself and /u/boxerdog.\r\n\r\nBoxer set out with the idea for a truly tart sour apple with some pleasant melon backing notes. He laid the foundation with FLV Sour Apple and PUR Watermelon. We fleshed out the sour by adding WF Sour Ball Candy and TPA Tart Green Apple and then rounded out the apple and watermelon with the always-reliable Cap Double Apple and FA Red Summer.",

This is extremely well balanced, I tend not to care for apple stuff too much but when its balanced like this I love it, I keep a full 60ml of this mix available at all times throughout the hot spring/summer months, great job tes and boxer and thanks for all your help in the discord!!!"

This tastes like you took an apple and watermelon jolly rancher and UNGH APPLE WATERMELLON Jolly Rancher.  I'm so glad that I mixed a 30ML of this as I'm already through 20 ml, next up will be a 100ml.  This a true ADV and if you want to make it sweeter you probably can, but I just don't think its necessary.  This is so good!  Awesome SnV recipe."
