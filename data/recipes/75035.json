  "description": "This is a tweak/remix on a diy 3 ingredient master piece  Butter Almond Custard by Krucial!!! Its a three ingredient masterpiece so when Wayne from diy or die said it was going to be remix month again I thought it would be a perfect time to release my tweak/remix on butter almond custard. I call it Butter Nut Custard  the only change I made from the original recipe is I removed the Flavor Art almond and added wonder flavours hazelnuts and cream at 2.5% . I think its a great twist on a great recipe if you haven't mixed up the original butter almond custard by Krucial make sure you do its amazing!!! This recipe like the original is magical after a 2 week steep  but I would say its pretty close to perfect after a 10 day steep but like most custards it just keeps getting better and better. When I make custard recipes I know I am going to like I make 240 ml's so I can start vaping  it around 7 days and have enough to still have some after 30 days when its absolutely magical!! Just a great 3 ingredient  recipe/remix  of a great 3 ingredient  recipe.",
