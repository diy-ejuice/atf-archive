  "description": "Well for Starters FLV hit it out the park with the Apple Pie filling Flavor, it is pretty spot on for a Hostess or McDonald's Hot apple pie filling or Very close to a Krispy Kreme Apple filled doughnut...... this flavor is amazing i tested it @ 4% and wanted a little more of that sweet filling so i added another % to it .and im glad i did... all it needed was a good  baked pie shell to round it off , as i do not have any pastry bases i had to make my own ,So i chose the following as my pie crust base : FLV Graham cracker,Cookie Dough and INW Biscuit..IMHO it has all the elements of a flaky pastry crust and that coupled with the FLV Apple Pie filling made this recipe absolutely divine.. I really hope this gets the looks it deserves it is a very good and simple recipe ....ENJOY!!!
