    "description": "My Granny had a rhubarb patch in her back yard, and every year we would have rhubarb tart, rhubarb crumble, rhubarb jam, and my favorite: rhubarb fool.\r\n\r\nIt's essentially stewed rhubarb and sugar whipped into thick cream, and it tastes decadent, tart-sweet and divine.\r\n\r\nWhen I saw Vape Train had a Rhubarb Compote in their line, I knew exactly what I wanted to try to do with it.\r\n\r\nFLV Cream - I wanted a full cream with a smidge of sweetness and vanilla that stays well away from any buttery notes. 1.5% is to make sure it has body but doesn't start to feel too heavy.\r\n\r\nDIYFS Holy Vanilla - bolsters the creaminess while keeping things light, and the vanilla pairs beautifully with the hint from FLV cream to cut some of the tartness out of the Rhubarb.\r\n\r\nVT Rhubarb Compote - This is the bright shining star here, it's probably a little more like a stewed rhubarb than a compote - but that's not a bad thing. It's a little sweet, but plenty tangy too - just a really accurate flavor. I can see this being perfect for rhubarb and custard vapes, and it does exactly what I wanted it to here.\r\n\r\nFA Marshmallow: There is something of a marshmallow fluff texture to a good rhubarb fool, so I went here for that in terms of mouthfeel. And for the sweetness, of course. May seem high at 3% but I promise you that that's where it works best here.\r\n\r\nIt's fine to shake and vape but better after 72 hours.",
