    "name": "Grapefruit Sorbet #Developedsummer",
    "description": "Personally i think that a summer vape should be either fruit or ice cream\/sorbet . Custards and bakeries are just too heavy in hot weather and much more suited to autumn and winter . I wanted to mix something simple avoiding most of the usual standard fruits . I decided on grapefruit as it's something i haven't used very much previously . I chose VT Grapefruit as it is quite authentic tasting and also pairs well with other citrus flavours and combined this with Inawera Grapefruit to add more tartness and body . FA Mandarin is a real favourite of mine . It adds some sweet , zesty notes and i think it works well alongside the grapefruit . I added FLV Guanabana to give a tropical backnote without overpowering the grapefruit and mandarin . I've used a small amount of sweetener and ws-23 but this is optional depending on personal taste , can be higher or lower if you prefer .\r\nAlthough this is can be a shake and vape i think it is much better after a 24 - 48 hour steep.\r\n\r\n",
