  "description": "A cool Hawaiian drink on a nice hot day!\r\n\r\nTropical Mix Layer - TPA Mango & TPA Pineapple - These flavours play nice together and bring out a nice tropical mix.\r\n\r\nThe Berry Layer - CAP Raspberry & CAP Sweet Strawberry - Adding the red berry layer to the bottom of the drink.\r\n\r\nSweetness & Cooling Notes - CAP Super Sweet & TPA Koolada - Just to kick up the sweetness a bit and add some ice to the drink.\r\n\r\nThis isn't the most subtle recipe, but I very much enjoy the sweetness of this \"beverage\" vape! Enjoy!",

He uses apricot where you have mango.  I've been trying to nail the house mix for months now, and you just put me miles ahead of where I was with this, but I think I prefer your use of mango here...at least through the summer months.  Excellent work, this is going in my ADV rotation for sure."
