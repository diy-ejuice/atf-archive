Love you, dude! &#xD;\n&#xD;\nI'm a big fan of this mixer's Fresh Lemonade recipe, and I couldn't have imagined loving anything as much, but this version is so sweet, satisfying and incredibly balanced. A little less intense than it's fresh counterpart, this recipe has just enough creamy vanilla sweetness to give it some body, but it's not too heavy for a hot summer's day. Perfect in every way."

            "text": "Disclaimer, I've never tried the frosted lemonade shake from Chick-Fil-A. &#xD;\n&#xD;\nThis is really well done. It has my favorite lemonade base and favorite flavors for a shake. What's not to love?&#xD;\nThe cream's here aren't too thick and the lemons aren't sharp. The problem for most lemonade flavors are they contain citric acid, creating a sour taste and clash with creams. I have dabbled with LA Lemonade with creams and it usually ends with a clear distinction between the lemonade and the creams. The magic with a mix like this is the lemons. You can create a lemonade flavor that blends with creams or sharpen it to make a fruit lemonade profile.&#xD;\n"
