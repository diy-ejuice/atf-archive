  "description": "An ice cream with kettle corn and drizzled butterscotch\r\n\r\nThe recipe I know is high on flavor, but it is my ADV and alot of people I have made it for seem to enjoy it alot.\r\n\r\nThe kettle corn was one of the last flavors added to the mix and I had no idea how complete it would actually make this liquid come out. Cap sugar cookie I wanted to be my base. As you can see I went overboard with it but I'm glad I did because it gives the ice cream that cone. To add more to that cone and to give it more of a crust I used tpa cheesecake graham crust at 3%. I wanted it to be very creamy, which it is very creamy so I went with fw vanilla bean ice cream at 5%. Fw butterscotch was added at 2% to bring out more sweet notes like a vanilla ice cream with a swirl of butterscotch drizzle in it. EDIT: I now have fw butterscotch drizzle but I have not mixed this recipe with it yet. Next time I mix it I might just try using it in replacement to regular fw butterscotch and come back to this. 1% super sweet was added to brighten everything up and make it more commerical. This recipe the way it is can be good in an rda, sub ohm tank, or a pod! I have used it all my devices and it still holds up as a great eliquid all around",
