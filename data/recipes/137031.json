  "description": "Simple and Delicious, a touch of Apricot and Full on Peach Yogurt with a pop!!\r\n\r\nI Used Peach (Juicy) and White Peach for the main peach profile. I prefer the flavor of Peach Juicy to be the leading Peach and White peach to boost that moist fleshy sweet peach flavor.\r\nI also used some Armenia Apricot to compliment and wrap the peach flavor up with that Yellow nectary goo that it adds to the peach, making this a Full and well rounded peach profile with a little bit of apricot.\r\n\r\nI chose Greek Yogurt as it stands out to me as a fresh and texture rich Yogurt that does not fall flat under strong flavors. I have also added some Cream Cheese icing to ring in some of that tarty notes on the background of the yogurt.\r\nI wanted something more than a 'normal' yogurt, so Chose The Cream Cheese Icing to add a slight Panna Cotta type of flav to the profile, it really add some unique notes to the mix.  \r\n\r\nFinally I used INW Miss Cream to blend and round off the mix with some sexy sweet notes making this a Sweet and Rich creamy Yogurt.\r\n\r\nAdd SS if you want to, I did.",
