FLV's Root Beer is a killer flavor, and this really accentuates it. Drop the super sweet if you're not a fan of sweeter flavors, but I'd recommend keeping the FW Vanilla Bean Ice Cream at a bare minimum. It makes the whole thing really pop and adds a creaminess to it that the root beer alone lacks in my opinion."
