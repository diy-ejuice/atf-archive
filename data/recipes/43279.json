  "description": "So grape..... I think alot of us have played with grape and know it can suck at times. Alot of people I've talked to alot of people, friends, mixers and the biggest things I hear is it taste muted or it just not satisfying. That's a feeling I wanted to try and solve and take it out of the box and this recipe is the product of that. Flavor notes below thanks for looking hope you enjoy.\r\n\r\nGrape- TFA Grape juice, this is a great grape juice but it has its flaws. In my opinion its too linear by itself and its on the weak side so you have to go a little \r\n              higher on it to get what you need.\r\n              INW Black Currant&FW Blueberry, these two are used here to help bring up the grape juice and make it more rounded and full.\r\n              TFA Greek Yogurt, now this isn't used necessarily to make a grape yogurt but it has that tart or tang note that just helps bring out the grape and gives it \r\n              canvas to sit on.\r\n              FA Fresh Cream, this is here to help create that canvas with the Greek yogurt.\r\n              Cap Super Sweet, I just like a sweeter grape and I think it helps the profile but leave it out if you don't like sweetener",
