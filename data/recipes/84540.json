  "description": "Popcorn Sutton is a legend in the world of moonshine.  If you've never heard of him . . . google it!  Sutton Beauty is a type of apple.  Thus, Sutton's Beauty . . . my attempt at an apple pie moonshine.  \r\n\r\nINW Two Apples/CAP Cinnamon Sugar/WF Caramel Butter/FA Vanilla Bourbon makes up the \"apple pie\" side of this recipe.  I wanted a subtle cinnamon mixed with a buttery caramel layered with the apples.  I knew I wanted some vanilla, but nothing overly creamy.  I opted for FA Vanilla Bourbon . . . I thought it would play nice with the moonshine side the recipe.\r\n\r\nI used Liquid Amber to add a little cooked/fermented layer to the apples.\r\n\r\nI went with the combo of Kentucky Bourbon and Whisky for the moonshine aspect, though moonshine is typically a white, or clear, whiskey produced and sold without any aging.  This does a good job of bringing a subtle booziness to the caramel/cinnamon apples.  \r\n\r\nI'm really enjoying this as a SNV . . . mixed it up 60vg/40pg.  Enjoy!",
