  "description": "A Camel Turkish Jade inspired mix, intended for a short-steep & MTL vape (Kayfun Prime for me specifically).\r\n\r\nWhen you need a nice bacco vape quick, hangsen and FLV seem to be the ones to go for. I was considering HS Arabic but didn't want the fruity notes so much as just a camel-ish tobacco blend.\r\n\r\n Opted for HS Turkish combined with a bit of FLV Oriental for a decently dynamic, leafy/spicy base to build around. FLV CC is bringing some of that ash note and adding a touch of a burley note to liven up the tobacco mix. A dash of menthol arctic and ws-23 for that nice mentholated effect. S'camel is simply an additive that brings some Ethyl Maltol and Acetyl Pyrazine here to subtly sweeten, soften, and add a touch of nutty/graininess to the recipe.",
