    "description": "I've been playing with this recipe for about 6 months, and I've finally got it tasting like I envisioned.  It becomes a rather luxurious vape after a minimum 3 week steep.  After that, it really showcases the rich taste of INW for pipe flavors.  If you're a tobacco head, plan on making double what you're already considering, as you'll notice it goes quick,  \r\n\r\nIf you don't have the original version of INW Gold Ducat, Gold for Pipe is a decent sub, however if you have something smokier and less sweet, give it a try at the same percentage.  \r\n\r\nSo, I wanted this to be tobacco forward, and I ended up bringing the Black for Pipe a LOT from where I originally had it. The for pipe combo here really sets the tone of the mix. I also had originally used Gold for Pipe, but decided Ducat made it a little smokier and dirtier. Gold for Pipe was almost too sweet for the tobacco profile I wanted. FA Oakwood added another level of depth to the already dark and rich tobacco with it's subtle woodsy notes.\r\n\r\nThe custard part had always been CAP VC, but no matter the percentage, it just needed something else. That's where CAP Butter Cream came in. It was neutral tasting enough, and gave the custard base a bit more volume.\r\n\r\n",

            "text": "Finally my minimum 3 week steep is over, and I can give a proper review. Two things I want to say first: 1. I used TFA Toasted Marshmallow in place of the Butter Cream. 2. I'm not a fan of vanilla in my tobaccos. With that being said, I am very excited about this recipe. It is definitely heavy on the vanilla custard, but the smokiness of the tobaccos balances it all out perfectly. There's a hint of that dark plum flavor from the Dark for Pipe popping up on the back end that is very nice. Right at the end of the exhale I get a lot of the Black for Pipe smokiness, and then a good portion of the exhale is a creamy custard until the Dark shows up. While this may not be as dirty as I like my tobaccos, it's definitely a nice break from what I'm used to. I may experiment with INW Custard instead of the CAP, but there really isn't a need to. It would be just for me to see how the INW compares. If you're really in to RY4s and dessert tobaccos, an you're curious about dipping your toes in the non dessert tobaccos, this would be a great transotional recipe. As a bonus, you'll add 3 great tobaccos to your arsenal. "
