  "description": "I have played with a fruity pebbles and milk recipe since I first started mixing, and have had some success and created a couple decent mixes in the past. But, they all seemed to be missing \"something\" I couldn't put my finger on it but it needed something else. This recipe is a spin off of one of my most recent fruity pebbles recipes. I added FE Lemon, replaced the strawberry with FA Juicy Strawberry and then upped it to 1%, Then..... I got the WF Vanilla Ice Cream in and decided to give it a whirl in my FP mix. And VOILA I finally found that balance and little \"something\" that was missing... I gave this one a short 1 hour warm bath, an over night steep uncapped, then capped to steep for 5 days. It is a creamy balanced fruity pebbles almost fruit loopy at times yummy vape. Give it a mix and let me know what ya think.. Hope you enjoy..",
