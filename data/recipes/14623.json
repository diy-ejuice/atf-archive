      "text": "I made a batch of this and felt like I should be adding more flavor.  It doesn't need anything else though, the percentages are well utilized here.  FA Lime distilled really carries a much stronger and lingering lime taste than FA lime cold-pressed, not sure why I waited so long to add it to my arsenal.  Great simple and quick recipe.  I enjoyed it after an overnight steep, although it does smooth out a lot given the recommended steep time."
