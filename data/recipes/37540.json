    "description": "A blueberry cinnamon danish, using my [Dogma danish base](https:\/\/alltheflavors.com\/recipes\/31789#dogma_by_concreteriver).  \r\n\r\nBy adding some Acetyl Pyrazine to the base Dogma danish,  you turn a flaky, light, layered almond danish into a heavier, breadier, danish base.  I then added a variation of @EdibleMalfunction 's blueberry holy trinity and a dash of FLV Rich Cinnamon.  It's quite a bit fuller than Dogma solo, and those blueberries do a great job of tasting like a baked in part of the pastry.\r\n\r\nStill 100% S&V certified, although if you let the AP settle in for a couple days the danish base gets a little more solid.\r\n\r\nIt's 10 ingredients, yes. But 5 of those ingredients are currently available [RIGHT HERE](http:\/\/www.bullcityflavors.com\/dogma) from Bull City Flavors in one super convenient and dare I say, sexy, package.",

This excellent work at representing a TASTY blueberry danish. Not a danish topped with blueberry, but a blueberry danish. Phenomenal stuff, man."

Seems like it could even be a CAP Cinnamon Danish Swirl killer with just another 0.05 to 0.1% more Rich Cinnamon, without out the blueberries. But the blueberries are the star here. They really do taste deliciously baked into a fresh pastry. "
