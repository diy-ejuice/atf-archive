  "description": "A delicious smokey blend of caramel, vanilla and tobacco. \r\n\r\nI set out to explore different levels and uses of my Holy Holy Grail, widely revered as THE king of caramel, vanilla and tobacco triads. \r\nAdmittedly feint in the tobacco department, this recipe attempts to add some simple complexity to our main protagonist whilst celebrating its inherent sublimeness...\r\n\r\nSM Latakia fire cured is a superb ‘dark’ tobacco and is much more refined than other players in this tobacco category like Black Fire and the likes. It can be described as an ashy burning campfire log - intense and pure... Here it adds a delicious & refined sweet, smokey & ashy element and lifts the RY4 base to unexplored heights\r\n\r\nOakwood adds a slight sweet woody tone to bolster the feint tobacco in the Holy Holy Grail and adds a bit of complexity and intrigue. \r\n\r\nUse Holy Holy Grail V2 at 8%. \r\nFor a touch of additional sweetness, add 1% HS Caramel Toffee...\r\n\r\nGive this 7 days to settle, 10 days best.
