I very much enjoyed the experience. Can't think of anything I'd do to try to improve it.  I did noticed that some of the flavors here didn't seem to melt together perfectly. Although all of the flavors were always present, some hits were much more ashy, others much more fruity, and some were much sweeter, almost dessert-like. I don't know if that should be considered a bug. It kinda kept it interesting and fun in a never know what you're gonna get way. "
