  "description": "A delicious Creamy Jelly Roll, which is a sponge cake rolled with cream and berry jam. Topped with powdered sugar. \r\n\r\nTo create the sponge cake, i use **FW Creamy Sponge Cake** and **WF SC Angel Cake**. \r\nThe FW sponge cake is a great start, but needs more cake to help it out, as it is heavy on cream filling itself, so Angel Cake is a great addition to add that needed cake texture.\r\nTo really help with the cream inside theis roll, i use **VT Vanilla Cream**.  This flavor offers the perfect cream filling for this type of profile. \r\nThe jam/jelly is made with **FLV Jammy Berry** and **FLV Boysenberry**. These 2 combined create a delicious dark berry jam. \r\nTop this off with **OOO Powdered Sugar**\r\nJust yummy. Easily an all day vape. \r\n\r\n\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/user/frank1360",

After about a 10 day steep I'm not getting a heavy sponge cake but I'm getting a nice creamy jammy berry/boysenberry with a light fluffy cake adding a bit of texture. I can certainly see myself mixing this again, thanks for all your work on here as I've enjoyed several of your recipes!"
