  "description": "A nice harvest berry with a smidge of banana cream and sweet cream. my current ADV.\r\nMy girlfriend tells me it's a but too tutti frutti for her, but i love it. \r\n\r\nGood after a shake, but picks up that nice creamy note after a few days.\r\nThis recipe is not my set way to mix it. when i'm making this for myself i sometimes boost the harvest berry and sometimes the banana cream. so you can change it up however you want",
