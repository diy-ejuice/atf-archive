    "description": "Adapted from FoggyPhoenicia \r\ne-liquid-recipes.com\/recipe\/478218\/Mango%20Sticky%20Rice\r\n\r\nI felt FoggyPhoenicia recipe needed a thicker more full mouth feel and after a lot of tested settled on Vanilla Custard v1 (CAP) at 2%\r\n\r\ni would like to try replacing Vanilla Custard v1 (CAP) with \"Tapioca Pudding - One on One\" as this recipe is still missing the subtle tapioca flavor.\r\n\r\nHere is what FoggyPhoenicia had to say and i agree, ENJOY!\r\n\r\nI find this recipe to be an enjoyable complex vape with distinct layers that play well together.\r\n\r\nIMO FA mango is not \"ripe\" enough so I use it in combination with TFA Mango. \r\nThe combination of Sweet and Whipped creams along with the FA Fresh Cream form the base of the sweet and creamy coconut milk. 3% FA coconut might sound like a lot for an FA concentrate but it is needed here because the coconut would be drowned out by the other flavors otherwise. \r\nTFA Rice Crunchies is basically \"sticky rice\" in this recipe. I think going above 2.5% would ruin the recipe. \r\n\r\nThe vape I get from this is a sweet mango on the inhale followed by a pleasant creamy rice flavor in the middle and a deliciously sweet coconut milk on the exhale.\r\n",
