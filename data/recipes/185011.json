  "description": "I have several Orange flavors sitting around that I was somewhat disinclined to mix with. A few weeks ago I decided to dive in, and I came up with this simple recipe. This is kind of a cross between a Fanta Orange Soda and an Orange Sherbet. I don't find it harsh at all, and I'm looking forward to going into the Summer months with this recipe. I've been primarily vaping this recipe in an RTA with coils around 0.5 Ohm at 30 Watts.",
