  "name": "Swedish Cinnamon Apple Cake",
  "description": "This is a Swedish style Cinnamon Apple Cake, which is usually made with yellow cake and served with vanilla custard.\r\n\r\nDon't think the flavors needs much explaining, but I'll do it briefly.\r\n**FA Fuji** crisp, jucy and very realistic apple flavor, at 2% is just the right amount to get that feel of small chopped apple pieces in the cake.\r\n**CAP Cinnamon Danish Swirl** and **JF Yellow Cake** serves as the cake base, with CDS bringing the cinnamon spice that we all know and love pairs beautifully with apple.\r\n**DFS Holy Vanilla** is a an amazing rich, creamy and eggy vanilla flavor that emulates the traditional vanilla custard and blends perfect together with the whole mix.\r\nBest give it a few days of steep to let the yellow cake work it's magic, so you get that great fluffy cake texture.\r\n\r\nCAP Cinnamon Danish Swirl v2 can be used as a sub for the v1, both taste real good in this recipie. If you don't have JF Yellow Cake, FW can be used instead, even tho I wouldn't recommend using that flavor at all.\r\nDFS Holy Vanilla can be subbed for FA Custard Premium at 1%, it will be slightly different but not much really, it's just as good imo.\r\n\r\nTo get the real \"fika\" experience, this is best vaped together with a cup of coffee.",

Although you can taste the cinnamon, its not overpowering in the slightest and snuggles into this lovely appley cakey mix with ease. It tastes just like the apple cake my Mum made me for my birthday, so you scored maximum nostalgia points. Well done Bertie, smashed it again!"
