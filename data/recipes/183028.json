Mystical.\r\n\r\nThese were the words floating in my mind soup as I crafted this delectable masterpiece.\r\n\r\nFA Aurora - This one here imparts a sharp, sweet, fresh-squeezed lime note near the top. It's very versatile and should be in everyone's stash.\r\n\r\nINW Dragonfruit - Pitaya - The *real* dragonfruit flavor. This and JF Honeydew Melon form the unspecific desert-fruit base.\r\n\r\nINW Cactus - Here is your juicy, sour, tart enhancer.\r\n\r\nCAP Hibiscus - Here to provide humidity, sweetness, and the distinct floral tone you'd expect from a peyote.\r\n\r\nJF Honeydew Melon - The king of honeydews and just incredibly complex and amazing on its own.\r\n\r\nFA Lavender - To activate your throat chakra and speak your inner truth.\r\n\r\nThis has almost entirely replaced Grack Juice as my primary addiction. I hope you enjoy and I'd love to hear your reviews.",

I really like it, but if I ever get the chance to try it with JF's Honeydew Melon I update this review. I'm a big fan of FA's Lavender and I have to say this is one of the best uses for the flavor I've tasted so far. Also, this made me fall in love with FA's Aurora. A very good flavor. Mixed it with up with some WS-23 for that extra bit of kick."
