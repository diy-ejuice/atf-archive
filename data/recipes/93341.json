  "description": "From the minute I. Tried the FA Pazzo line Jack was speaking to me  because just like me and my friends, things seem great on the outside,  however we are so completely and utterly dead on the inside,  and I mean fucking dead.  Jack has the most perfect  candy strawberry shell , like the ones keeping your grandmothers house from smelling like piss and denture paste , but not really anything going on the inside part. Well luckily jack can be fixed and made into a perfectly complete geriatric treat with just a couple additions . its gonna take a a fuck load more than some forrest berries and strawberries to fix our depleted sense of self\r\nworth  ",
