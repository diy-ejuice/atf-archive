  "description": "Don't let the small percentages fool you.. Boysenberry and Fuji Apple are potent enough flavors that they still shine in this recipe. The Bavarian Cream as well as the Marshmallows smooth out the vape where the Oba Oba gives a slight extra Vanilla to the mix..  This is a recipe play off of a recipe I had on ELR that I have tweaked and Played with for a little while.. This vape is in my daily rotation of vapes juices. This recipe has been looked at by a few in the past as it was called ( Cloudy Fruit Juice 1.2% flavor ) but I changed the name when I added to the recipe.\r\n\r\nEDIT: I bumped up the FLV Boysenberry to .75% and now it is a very very nice mix also steep for 2 weeks minimum.",
