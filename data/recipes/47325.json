  "description": "Creamy creme brulee in a hollowed out pineapple. Now that sounds good. So I made it in vape form or at liest what I think it should taste like because I haven't ever eaten this delectable dessert. Enjoy!! This is a recipe that needs to steep. Without it it won't taste right. I suggest a 7 day steep but I do think the ends justify the means this is worth vaping... I used real flavors creme brulee super concentrate it wasn't an option  though. If you don't have Jack fruit just boost the pineapple a half a percent.",

      "text": "This tastes very close to what I would imagine a custard baked inside of a hollowed out pineapple would taste like, if you got a bite close to the edge where the pineapple meets the custard, used brown instead of white sugar, and didn’t torch the sugar long enough to really get that crunchy crust on it. So it doesn’t really taste exactly like the picture. But it’s delicious, and isn’t that what really matters? Also, I’ve tried several recipes that were modeled after pineapple upside down cake and I think this gets closer to nailing that caramelized pineapple better than any of them. If you could add a solid yellow cake flavor to this and maybe reduce the custard-ness just a bit, I think it would be really easy to get from here to the best pineapple upside down cake vape ever. "
