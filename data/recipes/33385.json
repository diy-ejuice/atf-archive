  "description": "A straight up VANILLA milkshake.\r\n\r\nI wanted a dark, dense, thick and very rich milkshake. Always room for improvement but i've been very happy with this one.\r\n\r\nSome notes,\r\n\r\nWF Tahitian Vanilla Cream - This is the main profile of the mix. 2% was plenty for me, it's pretty damn strong in the mix but that's okay because it has the darker vanilla taste i've been looking for as opposed to VBIC.\r\n\r\nFA Fresh Cream - I like my milkshakes like I like my women, thick AF. Fresh Cream does just that, makes things even thicker while adding more creaminess to the mix.\r\n\r\nFA Marshmallow - Sweetens things up a tad and adds even more to the super denseness that I was going for.\r\n\r\nWF Hazelnuts & Cream - Hazelnut adds to the dairy factor a tad while adding another small layer of creaminess.\r\n\r\nDIYFS Holy Vanilla - The secret ingredient, just tops off the vanilla making it even darker and richer. I love this stuff and 0.5% is plenty here. Really rounds of the profile for me.\r\n\r\nNone of theses concentrates can be substituted in this mix, at least not for me.  \r\n\r\nSteep time 7-14 days. I've never been able to last past the 2 week mark and always end up vaping it all tho. \r\n\r\nI hope you enjoy!",

      "text": "Mild vanilla cream.  The Hazelnuts and cream do give a nice malty note hinting at a shake.  For me it is missing the ice cream note.  It feels a tad dry for a milk shake.  This is close and fairly pleasing to the palate.  For me I would replace the cream fresh with something like Hangsen ice cream.  The fresh cream may be drying it out just a bit.  Iâ€™m going to try this with hs icecream and OOO vanilla marshmallow in place of the FA marshmallow.  This recipe is heading in the right direction."
