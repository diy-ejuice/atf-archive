  "description": "Based off a Bourbon Rickey... and well seeing as Concrete River's name is Rick and he put me onto Auroa which I love I thought I would use his name in this one.\r\n\r\nKentucky Bourbon = We all know and love for that boozy note\r\nVT Bourbon =  Has more complexity in flavour than the Kentucky so rounds out our bourbon heavy cocktail\r\nFA Aurora = The real citrus bite that you need in a Booze and Lime cocktail plus it adds some \"fizz\"\r\nFizzy Sherbet = Helps boost that fizz of the soda water and general cocktail feel\r\nFA Lime Tahity = Pushes it a bit more towards the \"lime\" rather than a generic citrus or lemon\r\n\r\nThe harshness seems to settle after a day but its pretty good off the shake",
