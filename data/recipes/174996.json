I would like more of a fluffy, thick mouthfeel but it's not too far off the mark to stop me from keeping this in my daily rotation.  A really nice toffee custard! "

Really smooth and dark flavor, nothing too crazy or complex, just a very satisfying and tasty mix. Lately Cap vanilla custard hasnt been doing much for me, been getting really burnt from that flavor. This is a great mix that doesnt let it overwhelm at all, and for me makes it very enjoyable again. "
