    "name": "Buttered Cornbread",
    "description": "I wanted to try a different approach with this recipe. I tried all the cornbread recipes I could find, and most of them are really good, but they all just remind me of a standard cream or custard vape with different corn highlights. What I really wanted was something more focused on the cornbread experience. It had to be moist and rich on the inside, slightly crumbly, with a lightly crispy crust and just a touch of sweetness to balance everything out. I borrowed elements from Jennifer Jarvis and fresh03's cornbread recipes for the framework, added Taro for more body, boosted the butter and AP to enhance the main profile, then tweaked everything until the smell and taste were just right.\r\n\r\nOverall, I am extremely happy with this recipe. It has that craveable factor that makes you want to hit it over and over again. I found myself going through 20ml and 30ml bottles like they were samples.\r\n\r\nI hope you enjoy my Buttered Cornbread recipe. Feel free to post any feedback you have, and if any tweaks make it better for you, please let me know.\r\n\r\n***NOTE*** This recipe HAS to steep for at least a week. Otherwise, the only thing you taste is Buttered Zeppola. Everything really comes together after 2-3 weeks when the Zeppola tones down and the corn starts shining through.",

            "text": "This was just not for me... the taro in the mix just overpowered everything and was almost all I could taste, even had to change the cotton out of my unit b\/cuz afterwards even while vaping another mix, that taro just kept coming through.  Maybe its just my palate or that flavor doesn't agree with me but either way it seems like its just way too strong.  Might try again omitting that completely, I do like the idea of the zeppola added in where I don't see that in other cornbread recipes.   appreciate the efforts :)"
