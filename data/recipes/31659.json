  "name": "Fried Pumpkin Fritter",
  "description": "So I wanted to use up FA Zeppola in something, so I started looking at fried desserts, and found this one! \r\n\r\n\r\nHS Pumpkin Pie is perfect for the rich pumpkin flavor, although it requires a bit of a steep to get those sour off flavors and for it to really start filling out to the creamy pumpkin it is, the steep time is worth it. It's a weaker Hangsen flavor, but really good. there are really no spice flavorings in it, it's just straight pumpkin pie filling. I'm dropping it from 6 to 4, because I think it's a bit too strong here. I still need to test it, it may be good, may be too strong. But the fritter aspect seems a bit lost sometimes when vaping and not consistent.\r\n\r\n\r\nI added Cinnamon Danish to give it some spice, and help fill out the bready part of the fritter. After some time the Zeppola really takes over and the pumpkin takes shape into the baked aspect, tastes like a pumpkin cake with some sugar on top. \r\n\r\nThe picture/recipe I derived this from has some ice cream paired with it, so I decided to throw in VBIC and Vanilla Custard for some creaminess, kind of like a side of ice cream with each bite, but I think it really helps out the mix altogether. I only tried it a few days after I mixed it, and all I could taste was pumpkin, tried it 10 days after mixing and now it's way in the back. I'm very pleased with this, probably going to go through the little of the 10mL I have left and mix up something more long term. I may keep updating this but for now I really like where it's at. ",

      "text": "This is a tasty, interesting recipe. I’ve never had a fried pumpkin fritter but it seems to hit the profile right. Rich fried doughy taste with pumpkin, cinnamon, and vanilla. I do think there’s a small room for improvement though. There’s a slight sourness here even with the steep and it think it’s from the CDS and the way the CDS is reacting to either the Pumpkin Pie or the high % of Zeppola. This probably could be improved with FLV Rich Cinnamon instead of CDS, and then coming back and making up those missing bready notes with some Sugar Cookie or Biscuit. Overall though, this seems like a great idea pretty well executed and it’s worth a mix just to have something seasonal and somewhat familiar, yet different. "
