  "description": "Also good with HS French Vanilla Icecream @ 2%. Good shake and vape. 3 to 5 days steep.\r\n\r\nI will be releasing more simple mixes in the future. I gave up Cap Vanilla Custard V1. Not for the DAAP , but for the steep. After 2 year of my ADV being cap custard I said enough. I wasn't mixing new recipes either. So I quit cold turkey and I've been mixing more ever since.\r\n\r\nsingle stagger fused clapton coil @ 50w .2ohm\r\n\r\nOnce I mix a 120ml of a recipe I release it.\r\n",
