  "description": "I wanted to make  a  quick steep pudding with out custard or  FLV pudding  for daytime franks show  on puddinghttps://youtu.be/2Uf1VbUySSk    so this is where avocado comes into play.  On the inhale you get a bright sweet ripe strawberry that transitions to a creamy sweet pudding and  on the exhale you get a buttery sweet cookie note.   best on an   RDA around 50 - 60 W \r\n\r\n**Avocado cream** VT avocado is used for the  silky almost buttery texture with a slight banana note, that will add some additional sweetness \r\n\r\n**INW Biscut** the texture will be able to hold up in this mix and add some additional buttery notes on the exhale\r\n\r\n**Cake batter** adds some sweet vanilla body to the mix and also has the unique benefit of having an animal cookie note \r\n\r\n**FA Juicy strawberry** is a great slightly jammy ripe strawberry that will be able to stand out against this base.\r\n\r\n\r\n**FA fuji apple** adds some bright sweet top notes , that support the strawberry in this mix. and helps to pull the strawberry out a bit from the pudding \r\n\r\n**milk and honey** adds some darker sweet base notes for this mix as well as some additional body \r\n\r\n**VT sweet cream** adds some creamy body and diary to the mix , it is shorter steep then most creams and does not add an additional  strong vanilla note but does have a slight caramel note on the exhale\r\n\r\n**sweet Coconut**  adds  some silky and creaminess  and a natural sweetness\r\nNOTES:    this is pretty intrinsically  sweet but  if using sweetner  I would recommend using FLV sweetness around .30% to .50% ",
