    "description": "\u2022 TASTE\r\nFull-bodied wheat-driven, malty taste with a soft fruity sweetness from the blood orange, balanced by a slightly yeasty taste.\r\n\r\n\u2022 APPEARANCE\r\nYellow \u2018clear\u2019 liquid.\r\n\r\n\u2022 MOUTH FEELING\r\nFresh, slightly acidic and thick mouthfeel\r\n\r\n\u2022 FRAGRANCE\r\nCitrus and orange, fruity with an undertone of yeast\r\n\r\n\r\nYAKIMA HOPS, WHEAT AND FRIED DOUGH:\r\n- This is my beer base. I pushed the wheat as far as I could to get the whole wheat experience and paired with fried dough, which to me is pure beer and Yakima hops I get a full bodied wheat beer with the very notable yeasty flavor. \r\n\r\nBLOOD ORANGE, PINK GUAVA:\r\n- This is my blood orange top note. 1.25% Blood orange was just the right amount to let you taste the blood orange on the inhale but still makes room for the beer to come out. The Pink guava gives some body and depth to the orange.\r\n\r\nCITRUS SODA\r\n- This is kinda a addictive in this mix. It works as the \u201csour\u201d. It helps sale the blood orange as a actual blood orange infused into the beer and if gives the kinda feeling of carbonation.\r\n\r\nOn a fresh drip you get a lot of blood orange and while vaping it, it becomes more beer than orange. So if you like the orange flavor more, drip less but often \ud83d\ude42\r\n\r\nI am very pleased with how this turned out, and it really showcases how much I love to work with Flavorah flavorings. I hope to see some more beer building flavorings from them soon \ud83e\udd1e\ud83d\ude0a\ud83d\ude09\r\n\r\nTested on a Hadaly, fused Clapton 0.95 and 35-40 watts.",
