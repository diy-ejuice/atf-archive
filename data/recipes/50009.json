  "description": "A very nice sweet and tarty watermelon candy like flavor. Very well balanced flavor great for the summer. Very good for those that like watermelon vapes. \r\nPurilum watermelon is the most candy like watermelon I've tasted with a great amount of sweetness. \r\nFW green apple is great as an accent to add flavor and tartness. Used in low percents as it's very strong and can overpower the recipe. \r\nThe cranberry adds a nice tartness as well but brings a unique flavor too the recipe , making it different from other recipes.\r\nThe red touch adds some strawberry notes with some brightness to make the recipe great.  Good as a Shake n vape. ",
