  "description": "This recipe is not at all original, it is all based around https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/143364#the_trinity_vanilla_ice_cream_by_eyemakepizza\r\nWell this one started with me asking for free flavor samples in my last order. I was sent WF Molasses, and it smells soooo good! \r\nAnyway, I had just recently tried @eyemakepizza's Trinity Vanilla Ice Cream, (which is AMAZING btw, go try it!) and thought it would be good with some of that Molasses. \r\nAdded in some FW Hazelnut for a little bit of nuttiness, and some INW Biscuit for a cone. \r\nWOW!! It tastes amazing! SO good, even after the shake, but I am sure with some steeping it will be even better. \r\nGive it a try, let me know what you think. It is still in progress so always open to suggestions. ",
