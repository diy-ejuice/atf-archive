  "description": "Respect (Illusion's Taste of Gods Remix)\r\nIn Memory of Aretha Franklin\r\n\r\nA coconut, pineapple and blackcurrant mix\r\n\r\nI've been working on this remix for quiet some time. \r\nIt was hard to nail the pineapple in this recipe because the coconut was overpowering the pineapple.\r\nAllthough the pineapple is very subtil in the original it was very hard to get the right one in.\r\nAfter I made the Papio Remix I had to revisit my Taste of Gods remix to check how the Double Apple and Sweet Guava would work in here.\r\nGotta say it was a pleasant surprise.\r\n\r\n1.3% FLV Sweet Coconut and 0.1% FLV Coconut is the perfect combo to get the coconut taste from the original juice. However for me personally I lower the Sweet Coconut to 1% because it suits me better. If you want to get as close as possible with the original juice you should stick to 1.3%\r\n4% FW Blackberry, 0.5% FA Blackcurrant and 1% FLV Boysenberry gives a perfect and sweet blackcurrant taste.\r\n6% CAP Golden Pineapple, 0.5% CAP Double Apple and 1% CAP Sweet guava will give you that subtil Pineapple taste that holds up against the coconut.\r\nDon't be affraid to use CAP Golden Pineapple that high because that's what it takes to even get a subtil pineapple flavor in it.\r\n0.5% Super Sweet is optional.  \r\nYou can vape it S&V but after a few days the pineapple and blackberry come through a little better\r\n\r\nI'm mixing for a few years now. Most of my mixes are based on premium juice profiles.\r\nMy recipes are remixes and not clones. In my attempts to remix these juices I'm always trying to make\r\nit as good as, or even better than the commercial juice without the loads of sweetener these companies throw in.\r\n\r\nGive it a try and enjoy ....................................",
