    "description": "Just a very simple custard recipe using one of the newer fantastic custards out there.  This is a nice a sweet banana custard with a hint of bake strawberries.  I just wanted to use some newer 2019 flavors here and see what I could come up with in a 1-2-3 format.  \r\n\r\nThe TFA VC II is an amazing vanilla custard.  Its rich, a bit sweet with some nice vanilla notes to it.  The banana custard at 2% isn't really a custard, but more just a nice fresh banana.  This gives you a very interesting baked strawberry with ripe banana's mixed with a vanilla custard.",
