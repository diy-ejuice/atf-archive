  "description": "I was sick and tired of strawberries and cream recipes. So my answer for this is blueberries and cream!!! This is also made with ingredients from the first 25 from ejuicemakers.com .  If you mix it up leave a review please!!!! \r\n\r\nBlueberries: well of coarse I had to pick flavor west blueberry. Its the best in my opinion and in this situation it seems to work the best. There are a few I am yet to try so let's just say it's the best I have tried to date.\r\n\r\nCream: Now creams aren't as cut and dry in my book I can't really say what I think is the best because there are so many good ones and they all have there own place. I can say the one I use the most is definitely cream fresh by flavor art and in this recipe I had to use it. The next choice was Bavarian cream by the flavor apprentice this adds weight to the cream fresh and adds mouth feel. So now I wanted too sweeten the cream a bit so I added meringue by flavor art. Lastly I wanted a little vanilla swirl by the flavor apprentice to make my cream more of a vanilla cream. Well that's it Blueberries and cream simple and to the point.  Add sweetener to your taste I personally like it without any.\r\n",

All I get is a light cream note and blueberries. Still good, but with some tweaking it can be so much better."
