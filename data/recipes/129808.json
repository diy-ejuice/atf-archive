  "description": "Buttery crumbly pastry, a layer of jam and banana, filled with custard and topped with coconut.\r\n\r\nI‚Äôm a huge fan of a method I call the ‚Äútwo birds method‚Äù, showcased here by using the VTA creamy custard to aid the custard element and also that banana note without using a banana titled concentrate. \r\n\r\nThe custard - creamy custard, premium and Devon cream make up the custard here, the creamy custard adds a basic custard taste, mouthfeel and that banana note. The FA premium adds another layer and Is brilliant at lower levels of the spectrum and the Devon cream transforms all of that into your typical tinned custard taste.\r\n\r\nThe jam - VTA raspberry jam is a killer concentrate but needs help here to prolong that raspberry taste on the tongue so good old raspberry sweet comes to the rescue, both concentrates together along with super sweet give that jammy taste.\r\n\r\nThe pie crust - the apple pie, biscuit and zeppola make up the pie crust here, there‚Äôs something in zeppola that to me adds a ‚Äúcrumble‚Äù mouthfeel at lower percentages, along with INW biscuit, FA zeppola also has a slight coconut note which helps the coconut out by giving it another dimension.\r\n\r\nThe coconut - fairly explanatory... the FA coconut adds a nice coconut taste while making the whole vape fresh and moist, along with the zeppola it‚Äôs a really good coconut flavour that I‚Äôm happy with.\r\n\r\nPlease rate and review if you make it üòä",

      "text": "First off, I've never had a tart like this so I can't comment on the authenticity of the profile. I can say though that the description does a good job of explaining what the flavor is. I spent a day vaping this to understand it, so now for my thoughts...I'll start with the tart:&#xD;\nThe combo of Apple pie, biscuit, and zeppola does well here. Normally zeppola can be rather polarizing for me and demands attention from other parts of a recipe it doesn't do that at all in this. What I get is a baked, flakey pastry crust sitting on the back. It's nice and has a solid butter note that's backed by the butter from premium custard &amp; Devon cream. &#xD;\nThe custard:&#xD;\nPremium custard is just amazing, it's buttery, rich, full, and just plain magic. The DC and creamy custard in this adds depth and a dairy note that I'm picking up. The creamy custard does have a banana note but mixed with the bright top notes of the raspberry and the rich base of the custard it's a little tricky to find, but it's there if you look for it. I'd imagine in a tart like this it would be the same exact way so we'll done with the balance. FA coconut isn't an overwhelming coconut, but with the coconut note in zeppola along with this it sits there in the back with the crust and pokes it's head out on the tail end of the exhale.&#xD;\nThe raspberry:&#xD;\nI never tried VTA raspberry jam until now. I've had it, but haven't got to testing it yet. I'm familiar with everything else in this mix so I was really curious to see what it would do here with the raspberry sweet. It definitely has a jammy quality as described in the name, with a slightly floral edge. Not floral like a flower, but similar to what a real raspberry tastes like. The raspberry here sits firmly on the top, it's bright but jammy and sells itself easily as the raspberry topping. &#xD;\nOverall this is a lovely recipe, it's we'll balanced, well thought out, and I'll for sure mix this again. Thanks Nick!"
