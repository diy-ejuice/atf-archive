    "name": "Dinner Lady's \"Rice Pudding\" Remix",
    "description": "This is my remix  of another famous e-liquid made by Dinner Lady from UK and my contribution to the \"Remix Month 2017\" by the DIYorDIE community.\r\nAs you would expect, the main profile of this e-juice is a rice pudding-flavor and it is topped with raspberries or a raspberry sauce. If you like the original I suggest you give this a try, since it is pretty close to the original. And even if you are not a big fan of Dinner Lady's version, but are attracted to this profile in general, give this a try and please let me know what you're thinking. Many of my friends prefer my version, saying it is more round and full in taste. In my opinion, I have to work a bit on the \"rice-flavor\" and maybe try other flavorings; please let me know if you have any suggestions on that. Hope you like it and if you do, I'd be very pleased if you leave a small review ;)  Enjoy!!\r\n\r\nSome \"quick\" notes:\r\n\r\nCAP Horchata \/ TFA Rice Crunchies\r\n\r\nHorchata gives the impression of a rice milk but also leads to some weird off-notes when used to high in this context. I used TFA's Rice Crunchies to add more of a rice flavor to the mix.\r\n\r\nTFA Bavarian Cream \/ FA Fresh Cream \/ CAP Vanilla Custard\r\n\r\nThe combination of these three flavourings gives a nice milky impression of a pudding with some vanilla notes. Fresh cream adds some light \"milkyness\", while Vanilla Custard adds some more heavy and buttery\/eggy cream notes, leading to a thicker pudding-like vape experience. The Bavarian Cream adds more vanilla and is used to blend everything together.\r\n\r\nCAP Raspberry V2\r\n\r\nI used Capella's Raspberry, because I didn't want a too realistic and more syrup-like raspberry flavor as a topping and it does a very good job in this context. Note that I used the V2 just because I don't own V1. Since I don't know if there is a big difference between Version 1 and 2, I can't say for sure that you can substitute V1 for V2, but you probably can...\r\n\r\n\r\nMix @ 70\/30 VG\/PG. You can shake&vape this, but i suggest to let it sit for at least 2-3 days.\r\n",
