    "description": "This is a fresh, bright fruit recipe. A lovely offset to the heavier bakery or custard recipes that are often on our rotation.\r\nIt's a light tropical taste.\r\n\r\nI leave this to steep for 24hr, but it will change in the first three days as any fruits do.\r\nSee below on my notes about the Passionfruit and Raspberry fading in time.\r\n\r\n**TPA Blue Raspberry is actually Frandy Flavours Raspberry (a tart, bright, sweet berry)**\r\n\r\n*FA Passionfruit & FRA Raspberry*\r\nThese are the stars of the show here. They dance together beautifully.\r\nThey both will fade unfortunately - so turn them up by 1% if you intend for the recipe to steep for more than 5 days.\r\n\r\n*INW Cactus*\r\nSimply to offset the dryness\/powdery note that the Passionfruit has.\r\n\r\n*FA Lemon Sicily*\r\nThis is a nice sweet lemon, used here as an accent to complement the tartness of the other fruit.\r\n\r\n*TPA Strawberry Ripe*\r\nYou won't taste the strawberry much in this recipe. It's used for body and sweetness.\r\n\r\n\r\n_image from https:\/\/www.halfbakedharvest.com\/meyer-lemon-poppy-seed-morning-buns-with-blueberry-passionfruit-glaze\/_",
