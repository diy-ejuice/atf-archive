  "description": "You know what they say... There is nothing better than a friend, unless it is a friend with chocolate.\r\n\r\nSo here you go friends, some chocolate milk for y'alls! Been working real hard and methodical on this one. Thanks to all the kind souls on the DIY eJuice discord for your endless help and friendship.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n**VT Devon Cream** is the main star here. Even though real devon cream is just very thick cream, this flavor has an *amazing* chocolate note to it. As @shyndo said on discord: \"best dairy note, best chocolate note\". I concur.\r\n**VT Chocolate Mousse** is here to add an extra dimension of the chocolate note we're getting from the devon cream, also to give the chocolates a bit more strenght as they can easily be muted by the vanilla.\r\n**OOO Cream (Milky Undertone)** brings the true milk taste, as it's the only flavor I have yet to try that have all elements you expect from a milk.\r\n**LB Vanilla Ice Cream** was the last piece of this puzzle, I knew straight away when I added it that it was the right path. The cream is very rich and sweet, and in my opinion the vanilla is needed as I think many relate that taste to ice cream or even sweet milk in general. This is also the main reason for giving this a few days of steep, the first days it will taste a lot of vanilla, but by steeping that will mellow out to a much more perfect level for this mix.\r\n**Sweetener** is mandatory here. Not TFA per se, but any sweetener is. In my opinon chocolate milk should be sweet. If you have **CAP Super Sweet** use it at 0.5% instead.\r\nOPTIONAL:\r\n**WS-23** to make this thing ICE COLD is a good choice. Summer is coming up, so who doesn't want an ice cool chocolate milk to vape on? If you're not used to WS-23 I suggest  you start at 0.25%. Personally I mix this at 0.5 - 1%.",

I really enjoy this recipe as is but I also love VT Chocolate Mousse and when I mix this again I'd like to bring the % up a notch or two. I'm thinking I'd like  to bring a chocolate syrup top note too but this is cause I'm a massive sweet tooth and I love a strong chocolate milk. Bert this is a wonderful mix - it makes me think of all the possibilities and the combos I would theoretically add to this work of art. (Then again, often I don't recognise a complete piece and continue to add details that only distract from the main focus) But either way, I think this chocolate base could be quite versatile... üòÉThanks for sharing Bert and thanks for the inspiration! Great work my friend!üôè"

Definitely one of, if not the best chocolate recipe I‚Äôve tried- and it‚Äôs nice and easy being only 4 flavours and a bit of sweetener. I‚Äôve had VT choc mousse and Devon Cream knockin about for a while and haven‚Äôt got round to really using them- but I certainly will now. I haven‚Äôt SFT them but the choc mousse seems to have an incredible airy mousse like quality and the chocolate note in this recipe is bang on creamy milk chocolate. I‚Äôm guessing from the notes that‚Äôs mainly coming from the Devon Cream. I might try adding a little FW Hazelnut. If you like chocolate you have to mix this up! I can‚Äôt see anyone being disappointed."

      "text": "So bert convinced me to pick up some Devon Cream and Chocolate Mousse from VT, and I'm glad I did. For my first foray into chocolates, I grabbed a handful of other flavors as well and after SFTing them all, those two are right at the top alongside HS Aus. Cream and Co. I don't know what I can say about this really - it's just creamy, delicious chocolate milk. I've had this in my squonk for the past week and blew through all 60ml I mixed. The VT chocolates are hands-down some of the best chocolate flavors available and this recipe shows just how much potential they have. I'm definitely going to be using it as a base as I develop my own chocolate mixes. Don't think about it, pick them up and mix this shit - it's a great introduction into chocolate vapes. "
