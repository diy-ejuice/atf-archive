    "description": "A delicious & thick tropical papaya cocktail.\r\n\r\nA redux of my Pango recipe offering a much improved papaya forward fruit blend where papaya is the hero in place of mango.\r\n\r\nAs a seasoned vaper, I have moved on form mainstream fruits and, like many others, am sooooo over of the monotony of strawberry, apple and blueberry based fruit vapes. Luckily, mother nature has provided us with a  veritable smorgasbord of fruity wonders, including the must underrated Papaya.\r\n\r\nI love, love, love the inherent bitterness & body of TPA Papaya which lays the substructure here. It perfectly balances the sweetness of the other fruits, whilst boosting the mouthfeel to create a thick, full vaping experience.\r\n\r\nFE Mango perfectly encapsulates the very best a fresh, ripe & luscious mango. Used at 1%, it masterfully imparts the essence of mango & allows the mango to shine.\r\n\r\nA splash of CAP Cantaloupe & a smidgen of Peach juicy keep things nice and moist & deepens the melange of fresh, ripe fruit without distraction.\r\n\r\nFA Coconut enhances the creaminess & imparts a delicate, natural coconut edge. It is barely noticeable (which was the  intention) and allows coconut haters the opportunity to experiment with this stunning multi-use beauty.\r\n\r\nGive this baby 2 days or so to settle.\r\n",
