  "description": "This recipie is a malty strawberry vanilla shake. It's super sweet and delicious,  this was my ADV for such a long time. \r\n\r\nDulce de Leche + Marshmallow + merengue is going to create a super sweet malty foundation.\r\nMalted Milk + pie crust and VBIC will help with mouth feel and will add a touch of Graham flavor  (if you are one of those who get a peppery taste out of TFA VBIC you can substitute for CAP or FW) \r\nClassic strawberry + strawberry ripe combo will make your mouth explode. \r\n",

      "text": "This is a great recipe for a malty thick strawberry milkshake... The strawberry doesn't fade off and it has that thick malty taste you get in a milkshake (not a S&amp;C) only thing that I think needs to be done is lower the Dulce de Leche just a tad bit as it's really overpowering at first and even after a month or so steep it's still a prominent flavor in the mix. It's needed to get the malty aspect but imo it's a touch too high for my taste otherwise I'd give it a 5... Nice job tho indeed! üëçüëç"
