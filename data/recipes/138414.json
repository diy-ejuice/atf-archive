  "description": "( mango rum punch for Fresho3 fund raiser for the guardians foundation) \r\nHelping one of the hardest working advocates out there  NorCal Sickboy.  He  wanted a nice  drink for the  beach   So @queeryourvape and I decided to help him out!!!  \r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sRCfaYVQWC8\r\n\r\n**VT mango juice** is perfect for this as is has a nectar type juicy mouth feel,\r\n**Royal orange** is very much like fresh squeeze OJ  and has a nice brightness and acts as is more of the top note here \r\nThe combination of **light rum** and **Jamaican rum** create a slightly spiced warmed finish  for this punch  \r\n**pomagrante**  was added for a slight grenadine effect \r\n**sugar loaf Pineapple**  sweet  less bight pineapple that contrasts some of the brighter top notes  of the other citrus \r\n**cinamon** is added as an accent note that really creates a nice back note with the tropical flavors ( dont knock it till you try it  :-)  )  \r\n\r\n\r\nThis is our take on a mango  rum punch \r\n",
