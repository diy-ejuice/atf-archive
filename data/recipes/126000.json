  "description": "This is a simple yet oh so tasty apple tart. Pur country apple is like a great baked apple or apple sauce flavor. The apple filling helps bring that texture home with some welcoming spice. The caramel cinnamon roll helps to add to the cinnamon note while bringing a nice warm caramel-y bread-y texture that gets the crust started and lets Pie Crust bring it home with that dry, flaky texture. This is simple yet very addictive. If you want, you can add your favorite sweetener but imo, it doesn't really need any. ",
