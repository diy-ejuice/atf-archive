  "description": "So the Developed boyz of Summer stole my thunder with this recipe - ha! like I have thunder to steal. It does seem to me that these Blackberry/Raspberry Lemonade vapes are somewhat the rage these days, so I might as well join in with my Razzleberry/Boysenberry Lemonade recipe. Not much to say here other than the berry notes come out in the initial exhale with the Lemon lingering on for a while. While not a complex profile it is a pretty smooth and refreshing vape on a hot Summer day. The addition of Polar Blast at around 1 drop / 15 ml is optional, but I like the effect it gives along with the WS-23. \r\n\r\nI usually vape this on a restricted air flow single coil RTA like a Kayfun V5 running 38 Watts into a Kanthal Clapton at around 0.5 Ohm. \r\n\r\nJust a note - FW Lemonade is usually called FW Natural Lemonade.",
