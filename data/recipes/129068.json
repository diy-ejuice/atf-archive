  "description": "I just recently started mixing up some salt nic recipes for my Breeze 2 pod type system. I noticed there wasn't many recipes for pods, so I thought iâ€™d whip a few up. This one turned out quite pleasent! You really have to boost your percentages to get decent flavor in these things. This combo of berries taste great with a bit of apple to brighten them up and give them some texture. If you dont have razzleberry or RF strawberry TPA sweet raspberry and TPA strawberry will do just fine. I hope you all enjoy this recipe! Please let me know what you think in the comments!",
