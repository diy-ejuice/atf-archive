  "description": "I've been working on this one for a while. Before I even had the idea for Cabin, I wanted to capture the idea of rain in a vape. Now that it's Spring I decided to get back to work and finish this thing. I'll try to include some development notes, but it was mostly just trying things that reminded me of being outside in the rain and countless adjustments.\r\n</lb>\r\n I started working on this before I picked up WF Starfruit and after trying it I knew it was the right place to start. It's a flavor that really captures a clean, slightly citrus dominant, water-filled fruit. I was working with this higher in the beginning from 3-3.5% but it was too aggressive to blend into the rest of the profile. Since it had to be at a lower percentage I wasn't getting the same effect, so I decided to add .25% INW Cactus to bring back some of that water content while obfuscating the Starfruit flavor a bit. \r\n</lb>\r\nThen I started to bring in some florals that wouldn't bully the profile too much or stick out. The first addition was Hibiscus Candy. I was working with this one lower towards the beginning at around 2.5-3% but it wasn't showing up enough with the Starfruit in there. I decided to see what happened if I push it fairly high and it ended up working perfectly to add a solid amount of body and tone down the citrus in Cactus and Starfruit a bit. It still seemed lacking so I added TPA Honeysuckle at 1% and hoped for the best. I really enjoyed what it was doing to the overall idea so I started incrementally increasing it and it landed at 3%. It really helps to sell the rain concept, provides some more floral nuance, and brings an almost apple-like quality to the recipe. \r\n</lb>\r\nFinally I wanted to add something to bring a blue hue to the recipe and make it just a little bit brighter overall. I landed on VT Bilberry Ripe because it's an awesome blueberry (kinda grape?) jam flavor and it did exactly what I was hoping for. It started down around 1% but I brought it up as much as possible without it showing up in the final product as a separate thing.  Then to make it even more refreshing I tossed in .5% WS-23, but feel free to use your usual amount of cooling additive here. After making this I found that many people before me have had the idea to capture rain in a vape, so hopefully my edition is good enough to stand among them. ",

It's floral, but the florality is subdued, more something in the air than flowers in your mouth. It's beyond juicy and into wet, as something called \"Rain\" should be. There's some tartness to it that reinforces that because it's mouthwatering. It's light, but deep and full flavored, like the layers of a rainforest from the brighter canopy down to the darker forest floor.      "

      "text": "I have to concur with the other reviewers. Alfred is the best I've known to have the ability to capture an abstract concept in vape form, and this is the best example of that ability. It reminds me of fresh springtime rain showers, which makes the exact taste a little difficult to describe. It's tart, mouthwatering and refreshing with a very unique, almost candied mouthfeel. The sensation is slightly sharp, and perhaps so unique as to be jarring to the palate. Not an ADV for me, but when I want something refreshing and different, this is usually what I reach for to scratch that itch. A must-mix recipe for anyone who hasn't yet, even if only to experience the amazing things that are possible to accomplish in the mixing craft. Sublime. "

It is like a light spring rain, gentle but vibrant. Definitely worth mixing and waiting for the 5 day steep. Alfred, you have an amazing palette and your artistry never ceases to amaze me, thanks for another great mix."

The cactus makes it even juicier. the Bilberry provides a beautiful counterpoint and the ws-23 just enhances that lovely fresh feeling. This is one of the most logical recipes I've ever seen for something so ephemeral and abstract. Wonderful concept and even better execution!"

      "text": "So I mixed this yesterday as I thought is was definitely a unique mix. I vape off the shake and it was delicious. I'm not into florals at all. However I think the starfruit is the star of this show as it brings almost a slight sour apple flavor. Combined with the floral flavors which do not over power the recipe at all. This recipe is nice mellow juicy flavor with a perfect amount of cool. Definitely reminds me of rain. Well done. Very good. "
