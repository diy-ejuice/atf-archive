  "description": "Finally a custard I can be proud of. If you are looking for a simple vanilla custard that is creamy and smooth, then here it is. Don't worry about the banana and the hazelnut as they are just for rounding off flavor...but don't leave them out. You wont pick them out and they were just what I was looking for to fill in the gaps. Enjoy everyone. ",

Starts off with a very nice velvet cream feel, and finishes off with the sweet tinge of Banana and Hazelnut. This recipe is my go to. I always have a few bottles in the drawer of my desk. I find a 2 week steep really settles the flavours together. Everything comes together for a nice sunday vape. "
