  "description": "This is a very good straight forward recipe. It tastes like a papaya limeade and that's it. Great when you need something different. A very refreshing summer  vape. You probably can shake and vape but I honestly didn't try it on a shake I made a bunch of stuff and was pleasantly surprised out how awesome this turned out. Let me know what you think in the reviews.",
