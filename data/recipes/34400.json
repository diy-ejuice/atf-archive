      "text": "I mixed this up and Vurve's original at the same time. I have gone through about 60ml of each in the last three days. I will say this is far better then Vurve's version. One thing I have to mention is I swapped out CAP Raspberry with LB Blue Raspberry which wouldn't make this an entirely accurate review but I will get the CAP version. I am sure it wont change my opinion of this all that much. On another note I would like to say I also tried some with TFA Marshmallow and I felt that it did well to providing more body to this. Not that it is really lacking. I've also messed with some limes and other lemons. The mix shown here is solid and i would say as a whole doesn't do better with extra fiddling. I respect Vurve's work I just prefer this one better. I had about 1/2 dozen try both also and they came to the same conclusion. Thanks for sharing the recipe great job."
