    "name": "Sweater Weather (Pumpkin Custard)",
    "description": "The pumpkin element - HS Pumpkin Pie (4%) and FW Vanilla Butternut (2%) come together to create the canned pureed pumpkin (which is far superior to harvesting your own pumpkin).  HS brings the pure, un-spiced flesh of the pumpkin, while FW Vanilla Butternut adds some sweet, gourd-like body with a touch of vanilla and maple (which brings to mind the natural caramelized sugars in the cooked gourds).\r\n\r\nThe spice element - Wanted this to be mellow and nuanced . . . not in your face pumpkin spice, so the pumpkin flavor could be the star only backed up by the spice.  I went with CAP Cinnamon Sugar (1.5%) and TFA Pumpkin Spice (0.4%).  This lays underneath the pumpkin just right, in my opinion.\r\n\r\nThe custard element - The obvious choice, INW Custard (2%), mixed with CC Devon Cream (1.5%), which brings a creamy\/vanilla marriage to the custard base.  It's nowhere near in your face vanilla custard  . . . but paired with the pumpkin and spice, it adds a nice body of custard to fold the pureed pumpkin into.  On a lark, I threw some CAP Whipped Marshmallow (2%) into the mix to, possibly, add some more body to the custard and help keep the spice element in check.  Whether or not it did either of those things . . . I'm not sure.  However, this is the 4th iteration of this recipe, and I was trying to use a few concentrates I hadn't tried in the recipe previously.  I am happy with where it landed   \r\n\r\nThe cookie element - I didn't want to use gingerbread, as I was not happy with what it did in previous mixes . . . it was too forward.  I went with CAP Sugar Cookie (1.25%) and FLV Graham Cracker (1%).  It is by no means a crunchy cookie crumble here.  It is like a cookie that has been submerged in the custard and softened (like a vanilla wafer that's soaked in the vanilla-banana goodness and become a part of the lusciously thick custard).  It adds some overall sweetness to the recipe, in my opinion.\r\n\r\nNot being a huge fan of the pumpkin spice profile . . . I was inspired by Centerfold Vape Co's Bebe (a pumpkin cream dessert flavor) which I found to be extremely enjoyable.  This is not a clone, per se, but simply inspired by how much I enjoyed the original flavor profile that I expected to be underwhelmed by.\r\n\r\nI mixed it at 60vg\/40pg and sat on it for a week before trying it.  All in all, I'm pleased but am open to critiques and suggestions.  Enjoy!",
