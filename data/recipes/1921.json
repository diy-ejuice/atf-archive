  "name": "Dutchie - a delicious stroopwafel",
  "description": "Do Not, I repeat; DO NOT mix this if you don't have the now discontinued INW YC Waffle. I'm sorry, but, no suitable substitute exists at this time, and mixing this without it absolutely destroys the profile. If you don't see any new recipes from me for a long time, you can rest assured I ran out of INW Waffle and died of sorrow. RIP Waffle. And to the folks over at Inawera; I will never forgive you for this.\r\n\r\nA Dutch cookie consisting of a sweet, thick syrup of maple, brown sugar and caramel sandwiched between two thin, chewy waffles baked on a special iron. \r\n\r\nFull notes here:  https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/4e7snt/dutchie_a_delicious_stroopwafel/?",

I'm so glad I managed to get my hands on some of the now-discontinued INW Waffle to be able try this out-fucking-standing recipe. The authenticity here is so ridiculous that I can hardly wrap my head around how much work must have gone into it. Anyone who happens to have some INW Waffle left and hasn't tried this yet is doing themselves a tragic disservice, and we DIYers should take up a collection to hire RuntDastardly to find a way to remix this without it.

It is true to the profile that RuntDastardly was going for, and despite the long list of ingredients, everything is perfectly balanced and contributes something essential to the mix.  Thank you for sharing what obviously took a very long time to perfect, and for rebooting this tired old palate with something new and exciting."

I just wanted to note that I made this with 1% fw waffle because I dont have INW, and it came out amazing. I think  the last time I made it, I didnt have rich cinnamon, and being able to add it made a big difference. thanks for posting!"

      "text": "I had never had a stroopwafel, but I found the name enticing and the flavor notes made my mouth water. To boot, I knew that INW Waffle is an amazing flavor, albeit a strong and difficult one to tame. So, I immediately ordered the ingredients I was lacking, and mixed some of this up. I have since mixed over 300ml. The longer this steeps, the better it gets - and I ALWAYS want steeped Dutchie on hand! Everything is just perfect. Fresh, it is cinnamon-forward (to me), but quite good if you enjoy cinnamon. As it ages, the cinnamon recedes greatly into the background, providing a nice sensation behind the gooey cookie waffley goodness. At 7 days it is great, and at 14 it is a phenomenon. I say - mix no less than 100ml for your first batch. You'll be sorry if you do! Greatest DIY recipe I've ever come across. My new ADV."

It's such a full flavor and it smells absolutely divine. You will make stomachs rumble with hunger when vaping this around people. No subs allowed: it is perfected. :P What are you waiting for??
