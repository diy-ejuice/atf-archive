Even though it's VERY similar to Grack, it hits the mark more for my personal taste and I feel like it's really easy to get addicted to this stuff. Big fan of using Polar Blast and WS-23 vs just Koolada in the original recipe here too, as I'm a sucker for a nice cold vape like this. I made a 15ml mix just to try it and ended up vaping nearly the whole thing in one day, so it's time to get on making some more..."

I posted it in a very targeted manner in order to see what kind of reaction it would get and to prove a very specific point about the utility of using larger amounts of Cactus. I did NOT anticipate the number of people who would actually mix it, or even see it! &#xD;\nThis recipe is a bit more complex and a lot more polished. That 'purple-ness' is still there and the copious amount of Cactus is integrated with help from the minor florals and Boysenberry. The cherry finish, with help from the marzipan may be a more palatable alternative to the Meringue in the original for many. I had a discordant experience vaping this because it is so close to Grack until the finish. Better? Idk. More accessible and enjoyable to more vapers as a finished product? Yeah...I would say so. Well done. I'm glad that you are able to have your Grack your way and enjoy it =D"

            "text": "Grack makes me think of the quote \u201cToo weird to live, too rare to die\u201d it\u2019s a unique and uniquely polarizing recipe that either grows on you or repels you. Seeing anyone claim to improve the recipe seemed absurd, bold and easily falsifiable but, to be perfectly honest, seeing that claim from this particular mixer had me jumping at the chance to prove him wrong.&#xD;\n&#xD;\nAnd yet, here I am, 5 subjective stars in hand, ready and willing to admit he was right. With Grack, part of what makes the experience unique (at least for me) is how much you want to put it down but how quickly it becomes addicting. With GIGI it bypasses the first part and, in a nutshell, is just instantly more approachable and palate pleasing. The only critique I can come up with is that it\u2019s not as weird as Grack.&#xD;\n&#xD;\nAs much as I love Grack, the next time I find myself needing a fix, this will be the recipe I mix."

            "text": "A bold statement to make but I think it has been pulled off. One word for this recipe: amazing! I'm getting the familiar Grack taste of grapey cactus with a magic backing from the other ingredients. I'm not sure what honeysuckle or hibiscus taste like individually, i picked them up to make this and I'm so glad I did, the cherry is sitting in the background nicely with no signs of cough medicine. I usually drip a new recipe every other drip or so but I can't put this down. 30ml hasn't lasted long at all. Definitely one for the squonker. Thank you for this recipe. If you like Grack, you'll love this. "
