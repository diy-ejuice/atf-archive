  "name": "A Very Berry Cereal",
  "description": "A very nice and tasty fruit cereal. TFA Berry Crunch is packed full of Strawberries and Raspberries. It definitely has that corn element that comes with CaptNCrunch  Cereal. I paired VT Milk Fresh with FA Marshmallow. The marshmallow enhances the VT Milk and gives the dairy a little more body and brightness. CAP Cereal 27 is my go to cereal. What can I say about this flavor? It's Corn Flakes with a touch of butter. It emulates cereal perfectly. The star of the show is FW Wild Berry Cobbler. I know it sounds weird in a cereal recipe but it's perfect. The berries in FW Wild Berry Cobbler mixed with TFA Berry Crunch is a perfect marriage. There's a definite cereal aspect to Wild Berry Cobbler and it's nice and buttery. \r\n\r\nPlease enjoy and share your feedback.",
