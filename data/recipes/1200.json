Add a dash of FA Pear and now it's delicious! The custard in this was also the wrong creaminess... Van whipped, sweet cream, LB Van ice cream, basically anything else works better. As is this mix is harsh and sharp. The meringue doesn't lend much sweetness either and I think could just be muting some of the creaminess."
