    "description": "Back in the early days of 2019, before the world went to shit thanks to COVID19 and politicians didn't spread it to each other, @Alfredpudding @eyemakepizza and yours truly decided, that we were in the need of a damn good key lime pie.\r\nSo we set sails trying to create what we thought would be the best damn key lime pie we could make.\r\n\r\nThe pie crust itself is simply just made using TFA Cheesecake (graham crust), INW Yes, We Cheesecake and CAP Graham Cracker.\r\nThe filling is super simple, using TFA Bavarian Cream, VT Shisha Lime (which really to us is the best damn lime in current state) and a pinch of meringue. TFA Cheesecake (graham crust) obviously help the filling too.\r\n\r\nIt's a simple and pretty straight forward recipe, but it stands to prove that you don't need that many ingredients to make something utterly delicious and authentic.\r\n\r\nWe never got around to uploading this recipe, so now is the time to do so.\r\n\r\nEnjoy!",
