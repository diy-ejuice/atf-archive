    "description": "I'm a Custard guy so why make ice cream when you can have Frozen Custard, and why stop there if you can infuse Golden Graham cereal milk flavour!\r\n\r\nThe flavours chosen are pretty self-explanatory  but im going to point out some of their qualities.\r\n\r\nTHE FROZEN CUSTARD\r\n\r\nFA Custard Premium: I chose this one (beside being the best ) because of its clean flavour. \r\nA lot of greasy-oily notes would not let the custard turn into an ice cream or at least let it keep that rich custard flavour from turning into a milk\/ice cream base.\r\n\r\nTPA VBIC: At first i did not want these one in this mix as nowadays there are lots of mixers avoiding it for it's peppery taste.. but TPA VBIC it's almost a frozen custard! Its rich, buttery and thick and has a wonderful ice cream taste so i had to use it.\r\n\r\nTHE CEREAL \r\n\r\nCAP Cereal 27\/ FLV Milk & Honey this two make a great Golden Graham like taste, and with the two other flavourings the milky, creamy cereal milk part is covered.\r\n\r\nIt's pretty tasty as a SnV but after 10 days its wonderful.\r\n\r\nAdd: 0.5% Fa Meringue and 1% Inawera Custard to Boost the milky-creaminess.\r\n( it makes it quite more towards a true custard but its makes it smoother,tasty and rich)",

I swear I am even getting hints of marshmallow in here too = its just a lovely recipe and one I will be making a whole lot more of... 5 stars all the way! "

All these flavours work so well together and I haven\u2019t stopped vaping it all week which is uncommon for me as I get bored easily &#xD;\n&#xD;\nGreat recipe "

In the past I fell in and outta love with Cereal 27 and it's used perfectly here.  I'm only about 4 days into the steep and this is already a 5."
