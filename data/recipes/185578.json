  "description": "It was the summer of 2018 and I was about 6 months into my DIY journey when I threw this recipe together with an equally small amount of flavorings, knowledge and notes. It was ‘candied’ and ‘sweet’ I was pursuing, and it had to be creamy too. Almost 2yrs. and hundreds of other mixes have passed and I still enjoy this as one of my first successful ventures. Give it a go, I think you’ll be glad ya did! ",
