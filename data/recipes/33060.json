  "name": "Tropical Banana Smoothie",
  "description": "This recipe came out as a first attempt, and I feel that my next batch will change a few things, primarily dropping the Papaya to 3% and possibly the tangerine to 3% to compensate for the Papaya. I feel like an equal mix of these two creates that perfect tropical real fruit-like tang found in a freshly blended smoothie. However for me that tang is a little too tart for me specifically; although this flavor still hasn't left my tank so some people may prefer it the way it is. I just picked up some TPA Ripe Banana that I am going to try to incorporate into this, possible substituting the Lorann's Banana Cream as its candy-like property may not blend as well. Currently in this mix the bana portion of the aftertaste is similar to a Banana Runt candy.\r\n\r\nFlavor Notes:\r\n\r\nLA/TPA Banana Cream - My preferred ratios of 1/3 LA to 2/3 TPA for a realistic banana cream, Lorann's is a little too potent and candy-like to me, and TPA's is a little unripe but a mixture of them together creates a more realistic concept of fresh banana's. \r\n\r\nFA Marshmallow/Banana Creams - Alongside the banana flavoring, the Banana Cream blend adds that full mouthed creaminess that comes from a smoothie. The Marshmallow also gives it a \"wet\" feeling alongside the creaminess.\r\n\r\nTPA Papaya/Cap Sweet Tangerine - I don't know exactly how to describe this mixture besides \"real tropical fruitiness\" however it is a little strong and can overpower/mute certain flavors.\r\n\r\nINW Shisha Strawberry - This is added to help curb the sharpness of the Papaya/Tangerine mixture that I mentioned above, it also adds to the fruit-blend of the overall smoothie itself.\r\n\r\nSweet Coconut - I don't think this recipe would be the same without it, however it isn't that present in the flavoring itself. It's more of a background note, which helps round together the other fruits. Anyone who has worked with this can attest to the potency of the coconut and how it basically overpowers most flavors easily above 0.5%. For this recipe, due to the tartness of the other fruits combined it actually falls into the background while keeping the other flavors in check.\r\n",
