  "name": "Kindground Blue Haze  (Tart  Berry Lemonade) ",
  "description": "This was made for the KINDGROUND fundraiser on the DIY or DIE you tube channel \r\n\r\nYes I know there are  100s of  lemonade and berry mixes, what makes this mix is the  use of a bit of lime to that lemonade and the use of VT lemon sour,.  This is a  nice bright sweet berry lemonade with a tart  finish.  It is  juicy and refreshing  \r\n\r\nRazzleberry and Blue raz  create a  bright sweet   and sour   mixed  berry note, that supports the tart aspects of lemon \r\nVT lemonade clear and VT lemon sour  have a bright slightly candy lemonade with  nice tart pop ( if you want more  sour note feel free to boost  VT lemon sour  %)\r\nFizzy sherbert supports the citrus and the bright raspberry  of this mix  \r\nI like WS - 23 so I added it at .50%  \r\nI like adding the cap super  sweet to this mix    it really  round this out and lifts the profile up \r\n",
