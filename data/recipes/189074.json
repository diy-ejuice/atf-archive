  "name": "Boysenberry Syrup Crumble (Dinner Lady Blackberry Crumble Plus Remix 1st mix)",
  "description": "I LOVE Boysenberry...especially the SMUCKERS Boysenberry Syrup...so when I first bought Dinner Lady's Blackberry Crumble I was in heaven, it taste so much like that Smuckers Syrup to me I can't get enough.  This is my first trial, it is definitely not exact BUT I can tell I am on to something.  Got to get the Crumble down and the Buttery flavor but the fruit is very close with the one FLV Boysenberry.  I will be trying to perfect it over these next few weeks of Quarantine...God Bless Everyone...Love to all...Kim  Still a very good Boysenberry Cream right now but I can make it better.",
