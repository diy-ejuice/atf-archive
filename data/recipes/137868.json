    "description": "I have gone through so many variations of grape recipes to finally get here. The Grape Juice & White Grape combo is great - but can easily read as sweet wine, which is useful, but not what I was going for. I did want a darker grape, without using Grape Concorde. I wanted it to read as a slightly sweetened, blended grape drink that is somewhat authentic, and somewhat sweetened & flavoured. \r\n\r\nGrape Trinity\r\nFE Grape - lovely mix between authentic, and slightly candy. Works great to add another layer to my grape\r\nFA White - adds a smidge of body, surypy sweetness\r\nTPA Grape Juice - this is mostly the base of the trinity, extremely underated grape\r\n\r\nFA Black Currant - was added very low to bring some body, as most grapes can read quite flat - it also adds a bit of purple to the paler grapes. \r\n\r\nSweeten & Cool as you prefer - my suggestions here is for a more commercial feel sweet grape juice. The WS23 I use is a 20% dilution. \r\n",
