  "description": "Nothing fancy going on here just a simple creme caramel that has become my default dessert vape. \r\n\r\nThis is a Reworking of a recipe I had published a while ago as I wasn't happy with it. \r\n\r\nWF Crispy water was dropped. It's a muddled flavour and not to my liking. I'm convinced a lot of WF flavours are better off in food recipes. \r\n\r\n3% VT Creme Caramel is quite a weak flavour but after it steeps a bit those creamy caramel/ butterscotch notes come out. \r\n\r\nHowever, it has zero body so  2% FA Custard Premuim adds a creamy custard base.\r\n\r\nFinally 1% DYFS Holy Vanilla adds that smoky vanilla top-note and a little cream without detracting from the recipe. . \r\n\r\nâ€¢ 0.35% Flv Sweeteness (optional)\r\n\r\nDig in if you like but benefits from a 3 day steep.\r\n\r\nDisclaimer\r\n\r\nAny resemblance to actual \"1-2-3\" recipes is purely coincidental.",
