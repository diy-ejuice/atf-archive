    "description": "A nice strawberry coated waffle with ice cream \r\nIve tried so many different waffles flavors an they have varied from plastic to play-doh so was super happy to find this one from liquid barn! An absolute banger this an has a load of potential in desserts ! \r\nNever seen it in a mix but its well worth getting in my opinion \r\nFew notes on the recipe\r\nBELGIUM WAFFLE LB- super good rich, dark almost a chocolatey note in the back ground with a hint of maple an butter! Miles better than the TPA or CAPs versions its nice an sweet an rich without being sickly or over powering !\r\nSTRAWBERRY SWEET\/RIPE CAP\/TPA - Straight forward enough not looking for a candy\/sweety kinda strawberry so stuck with the old combo\r\n\r\nVANILLA BEAN ICE CREAM TPA AN LB - Ive been splitting up my 4% ice cream with 50\/50 TPA an LB as i find LBs is super creamy an adds something more to the recipe than standalone TPA ! But add to much an it can get a bit too rich so a few % of each really plays nice i think\r\n\r\nVIENNA CREAM FA - Just adds that rich notes an brings the waffles an ice cream together for a nice silky smooth taste\r\n\r\nSucralose is optional as i dont think it needs a huge amount as its fairly sweet anyway\r\nFound its good after a few days an just gets better an better ",
