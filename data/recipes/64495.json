      "text": "I kind of love this, especially the way the guava and cinnamon play off each other, the authenticity of the fried pastry dough and cream cheese, and the bit of warmth from the Kentucky Bourbon. It reminds me of a guava cream donut I bought from a Cuban food truck some years ago, but in fried pie shell instead of a donut. It doesn’t seem super saturated and in your face, flavor-wise, despite being perfectly balanced. It’s just not that intense. That could be a drawback if you’re looking to get whacked upside the head with flavor or a plus if you’re looking for an ADV with cinnamon. Personally, if I’d purchased it as a one-shot that said use at 12.25%, I’d probably try pushing it up to 18%. Maybe it would be terrible, I don’t know, but it’s worth a shot. &#xD;\n&#xD;\nThis is an old recipe from 2017, I wonder how Emily would remix it if she were going to give it a facelift. I hope the fried pastry dough and CAP Sweet Guava would stay, but what other changes could be made? Maybe ditching the CDS in favor of Rich Cinnamon and some other bakery to make up for the missing D in CDS?  "

Was looking to make  a guava empanada as  I have been on a guava kick and found you mix ...   so mixed it up and fell in love with  the contrast of the guava and the cinnamon .    This is great off the shake and just gets better, really well balanced.   Curious what   Kentucky burbon does for the mix?  "
