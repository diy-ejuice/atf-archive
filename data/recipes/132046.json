  "description": "I've been working on a Samoan girl scout cookie forever!!! This is my latest, turned out really good.\r\n\r\nThe recipes a little coconut forward, on a shake and vape., the coconut does fade, I haven't found a coconut that doesn't yet.\r\n\r\nShortbread cookie base- JF biscuit, TPA butter and \r\nFA vanillaa classic come together to create a delicious shortbread cookie.\r\n\r\nCoconut - sweet coconut with a touch of f l v coconut to make it slightly more authentic and it helps keep the coconut from fading after steeping.\r\n\r\nChocolate - they've trained Devon cream and FLD milk chocolate in my opinion are the two best chocolate flavorings on the market. JF milk chocolate is a suitable substitute if you do not have FLV s offering.\r\n\r\nButterscotch - FLVS butterscotch does a nice job here.Toyed with the idea of adding fa caramel as a supporting flavor. didn't really feel like it was necessary in this recipe if you find the butterscotch lacking .25 fa caramel should give it more body.\r\n\r\nMerry Christmas\r\n",
