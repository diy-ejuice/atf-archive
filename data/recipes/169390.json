  "description": "MOCONANA.\r\n\r\nThe names says it all.\r\nFresh mango, creamy coconut & a bit of banana to bring it all together. Straight forward yet dynamic and well balanced.\r\n\r\nEssentially, I just took my favorite concentrates from each category and layered them together to create something that is fruit forward & tropical but still delivers a creaminess I love in any mix. Instead of getting carried away with loads of flavorings as I tend to do I wanted to keep things as simple as possible. 5 flavors and some super sweet. That's it.\r\n\r\nIn my mind nothing tops FLV Mango or VT Shisha Mango in the mango category. They're both fabulous but they're also quite different. Combining the two was a no-brainer for me. VT brings the bright vibrancy. FLV brings the creaminess. FLV Sweet Coconut is the coco goat. There is simply NO possible substitute for this one. Lastly, TPA Banana Cream is my #1 when it comes to bananas and pairs beautifully with the sweet coconut. \r\n\r\nThat's all folks! Enjoy! And be sure to post your feedback in the comments ;)\r\n\r\n-Modesto Bravo\r\n",
