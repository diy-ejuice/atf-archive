I\u2019m not good at letting stuff steep but luckily I made this when I had a scratchy throat and this mix irritated the SHIT out of it... so I put it away for a while. I just recently was dripping stuff Inset aside and came across this mix and fell in love with it. I love the banana cornflake combo. It goes so well together. Good work man!"

To me its more of a raisin bran type flake than a corn flake... in that case if you do like that id say try the new raisin bran banana nut crunch... thanks for the delicous recipe i will stop being a shill now be safe =] "
