  "description": "Speckled Eggs\r\n\r\nA Celebration of INW Milk Choc OG - R.I.P. 2017\r\n\r\nChocolate Layer INW Milk Choc OG and FW Milk choc creates a fairly realistic milk choc base and I have added some vanillin to add a bit more body... and by fairly realistic I mean as close as the concentrates at our disposal and my efforts to create a realistic milk chocolate got me.\r\n\r\nINW Milk Choc translates more to a homemade chocolate milk to me than the real thing, but apart from perhaps MF Chocolate, this is a good as it gets. FW Milk choc has a plastic-y quality to to that with quite a tame milk choc flavour, I am using the to bend the INW to a commercial milk choc texture... the result is far from fantastic but yeah what ever... I used vanillin... no idea what brand, so lets pretend it TFA :) and sweetener is kind of a must here.\r\n\r\nCandy Shell I am using a combination of FW VBIC, FW Jawbreaker and FA oba oba to achieve this. I wont claim its fantastic but does translate loosely to a candy shell.  I have added a drop or two of FA Meringue for good measure. I am not sure if it really made a difference here, but I like the recipe as is and with limited amounts of INW Milk choc left I am not going to start experimenting,\r\n\r\nGummi, gooey goodness\r\nI used a simple combination of fw swedish and fa rose to create the almost non-descript floral jelly candy flavour. \r\n\r\nyeah so that is it, I hope this is not too disappointing a recipe - Look its a pleasant profile and a fun vape and anyone who have worked with chocolates know the milk choc territory is pretty much undefeated - hope you enjoy\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
