  "description": "TFA Nectarine is my favourite flavour at the moment after buying it to work on a Pacha Mama Fuji clone which I'm still tinkering with. I have discovered that this and TFA Dragonfruit are a perfect match. The Nectarine feels like the perfect finish to the tropical beginning of the Dragonfruit inhale, and with the body and warmth of INW Shisha Vanilla added it makes for a delicious warm fruity vape. Hope you enjoy.\r\n\r\nI recommend at least 48 hours steep.\r\n\r\n",
