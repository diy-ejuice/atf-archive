  "description": "This is a  spot on Moito - for me  it s  just the perfect mix of  sweetness, lime and mint  \r\nThis was mixed for the PRIDE fundraiser, for the Ali Forney center for LBGTQ homeless youth on Fresh03 channel https://youtu.be/5Xa1eZqfwK8\r\n\r\nThe base for this mix is   lemon lime soda   - the lemon helps to boost the lime  in the mix and add a bit of sweet  tartness \r\nThe combination of   person lime which has some intrinsic sweetness and body  added to the bight  slightly tart  lime Tahity creates  a really nice  full real lime\r\nI wanted a sweet mint  and the combination of  INW mint and spearmint    provides a realistic sweet mint   \r\nVT light rum is the only rum  I would use in this mix, I did not want to add coconut  rum or a spiced rum I wanted the  lime  and mint to  stand up and the rum to come out on the finish \r\nRaw sugar works really well as the base sweetness  ( NOTE: I added   .05%  cap sweetener  to help lift the lime in this mix)   ",
