  "description": "BREEK starring: Greek Yogurt and Fresh Blueberries\r\nTheo said just mix it so do that.\r\n\"Breeks gotten himself into the blueberries again. We can't allow that now, can we Breek? Drowning you in Greek Yogurt would be a reward.\"\r\nCreamy greek yogurt front, blueberries in the exhale. To me there is a huge difference between blueberry flavored yogurt, and yogurt that has blueberries in it. This is my take on Greek Yogurt with Blueberries.\r\nInspired by: Downside by: Schwartz\r\nNo there are no subs, i didn't make this that way. \r\nThank you and enjoy. Sorry not sorry if this is very addicting. Highly recommend pairing with your morning coffee. Coffee first, dank vape after. Trust me.\r\n\r\n",

      "text": "I mixed this up only after making sure I had the original FA Yogurt. I don't get why so many people dislike this flavor. This flavor blew me away when I first tried it. I thought I had the original version until @LiquidAntlers steered me in the right direction. The original FA is creamy, tart, and full flavored. It's my new favorite flavor.&#xD;\n&#xD;\nThis recipe is so good even after you mix it. I had to hide it so I wouldn't vape thru it before a few days had past. It's now been a few days, and is only getting better and better. It's perfectly balanced. I can't compare this to Downside by Schwartz, since I've never had it. What I do know is I'm mixing 120ml after this review. The blueberry is absolutely perfect. It's sweet and slightly tart and sits wonderfully in this creamy authentic Greek yogurt. It does go great with coffee as suggested, and the flavor matches the description. &#xD;\n&#xD;\nThis is subjective but the only thing I can think of changing is, lowering the sweetener maybe a 0.25%, but again, it's subjective and by no means is the sweetener overpowering. Great job on this recipe and thank you for steering me in the right direction with the original FA Yogurt! "
