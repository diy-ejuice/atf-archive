    "description": "Green Team Mixer's Showdown 4 6\/11\/19 \r\n\r\nThis 40 minute timeline is fucking bullshit, but the Beginner Blending boys knocked it outta the goddamn park, as expected. The full name is above, but the user friendly version is simply Tesseract. This is a triple trinity mix, inspired by none other than Graham aka DigitalDrops aka ThatVegasManiac. He suggested a trinity trinity once, and I loved the idea. So here we have all three trinities, all using the same percentage in each. So the bourbon trinity is all at 3%, the Apricot\/Peach trinity is all at 1%, and the cake trinity all at 2%. Jerry's psychotic ass decided to add 1% VT Golden Syrup in the final seconds of the timeline, but it adds some wicked sweetness\/juiciness to the mix. Good on him for being a fucking idiot. There isn't enough time to dive deeper into this.\r\n\r\nThree trinities, you can't fuck with us. This whole competition was making three become one, well, we made nine become three become one, so fuck you. CokeCan and DrunkLordGG out here.\r\n\r\nhttps:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/DIY_eJuice\/comments\/bz644h\/mixer_showdown_5_the_heavyweights\/\r\n\r\nCome join us on Discord! https:\/\/discord.gg\/ufVTyAQ",
