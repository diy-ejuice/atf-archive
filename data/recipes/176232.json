    "description": "Silk tart\r\n\r\nMy take on a milk tart\r\n\r\nOk, starting off FA Apple pie lays down the crust, crispy wafer and pudding base adds a buttery richness to that crust. And that\u2019s it for the crust.\r\n\r\nNow the filling, everyone knows I\u2019m fond of FA milk but it didn\u2019t fit well here, I needed something with more of a butyric vibe so I chose VTA fresh milk backed up with VTA pudding base it\u2019s a good filling but it wasn\u2019t complete, I added sugar cookie to fill it out and add a touch of vanilla, FA almond is self explanatory and is also helped out by the slight nuttiness of the crispy wafer,  the chai masala brings nutmeg amongst a few other spices hidden in the back, because this is a simple profile I find sweetener really helped out the mix as a whole so even though you can drop it out I recommend not to.\r\n\r\nI also recommend giving this a week steep to let everything blend and to let the chai masala settle down.\r\n\r\nIf you like this mix and what I do then please rate and review accordingly \ud83d\ude18",
