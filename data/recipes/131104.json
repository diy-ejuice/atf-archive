  "description": "I wanted something semi simple to vape while playing Red Dead Redemption 2. Since Im not a real cowboy I wanted something sweet with  definitive tobacco note (JF RY4 DOUBLe) building on the sweet side of the profile, I decided to use sweets that would compliment Ry4. so dulce de leche and a hint of FA vanilla were my choice, instead of a cream I chose Vanilla Pudding because i like the mouthfeel and flavor it provides after a few days steep. \r\nI made a nicsalt version of this so that I could get a nice nic buzz from my Sourin Drop as I bring justice to the Digital wild west!  Hope y'all like it.",
