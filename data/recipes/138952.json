    "name": "Layerz - Mixed Berry Jam",
    "description": "This is not a complete recipe, its a Mixed Berry Jam layer that would work well on top of a cheesecake, ice cream or a crunchy toast layer - it will also work as a jammy filling inside a bakery. \r\n\r\nBlack Berries \/ Blueberries with a hit of Strawberry. Its super gooey and sticky - with a nice round mouthfeel. Not overly sweet - but somewhat sweetish. Hope you guys enjoy. \r\n\r\nWe talked about FLV Berry Bend in a live show - https:\/\/youtu.be\/BYKq4D3Fh6o\r\n\r\nEDIT - @Tam Vapes suggested 0.25% FLV Boysenberry to deepen this jam, and it worked.
