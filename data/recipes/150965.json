  "description": "This is a rich vanilla ice cream with a sweet sticky peach sauce all over it. I took eyemakepizza's delicious ice cream trinity and topped it with my own peach trinity and what you get is a beautiful, sweet, very commercial like recipe that is universally tasty. This will be delicious no matter what you vape it in whether its a tank or a flavor rda, you are golden! Big thanks to Alfred Pudding for working on the peach trinity part with me. ",
