            "text": "I love the idea of this one and it's not terrible to vape, but the bright, fresh, and almost floral qualities of the FA Fig Fresh is really clashing with otherwise nice Kentucky-Catalan combo for me. This tastes like it would be much better with a darker, slightly musky fig, specifically CAP Fig, but not FLV Fig because that would be going to far and competing with the Catalan spices. "
