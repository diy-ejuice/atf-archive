  "description": "Okay so all the percentages are 2% maybe it's not exactly a 1-2-3 recipe.\r\n\r\nFLV cream + FLV vanilla bean= stick Rich delicious and absolutely amazing vanilla cream add to that they're mouth watering blood orange, and you have a simple mix packed full of flavor.\r\n\r\nAs far as substitution go I'm sure you could substitute any one of these ingredients or something in Your Arsenal. That said you should really pick these up it is a fantastic recipe the way it is!!! \r\n\r\nOn a personal note I'm headed to Vegas for the The first-ever Vape Expo to feature DIY if you happen to be there please stop by and say hello.",
