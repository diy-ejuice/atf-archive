  "description": "I  am not a tabaco lover, so this is as close to a \"tobacco\" as I can come ..LOL , this is a scotch Ry4 double  cocktail  that is tasty as a SV and hit its mark at around day 4 - 5  \r\n\r\nMy inspiration for this was the picture  in Jenifer Jarvis flavor pro FB group   in the year of mixing \r\nWeek 46- Winding Down In the Ski  lodge \r\n\r\n\r\nVT scotch is one of the most boozie authentic scotches on its own - it even has some oakiness. It really does not need support from another scotch \r\n The holy vanilla is a vanilla bean with some spice that also adds some body to this mix and rounds out the edges and works with the devon cream. \r\nDevon cream adds body and a chocolate note on the exhale . \r\nRy4 double has a very subtle tobacco back note but is mostly caramel, nutty and chocolate notes which is good pairing for scotch\r\nHoney comb adds some texture and sweetness. \r\nBlood plumb adds some brighter top notes to this mix.\r\n\r\nThis is pretty sweet but  add sweetner to your liking  - I add just a touch  of FLV sweetness  at .03 \r\n\r\nLearn more about mixing here:\r\nfacebook - https://www.facebook.com/groups/diydownunder/\r\nDiscord - https://discord.gg/kH4Fqbc\r\nYoutube - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCTCwb7ULyfJALQlehomZZQA\r\nwebsite - https://www.diydownunder.com/",
