  "description": "Meanwhile in Belgium..\r\nThe gouvernment called in a national state of emergency. One day before Trump did in the US. Bars and restaurants are closed for the next three weeks now. Only pharmacies and supermarkets are open during the weekend. No more festivals or markets.\r\nThis left me at home thinking about how I could turn Corona into a creative recipe. And this is what my twisted mind came up with:\r\nCOconut VIolet and Dragonfruit with a little help op juicy strawberry. \r\nCOVID-69 saw the light, hoping to bring people some smooth inhales and tasty exhales. And last but not least a little less mass hysteria (arrows at all the hoarders) \r\nJobs done ðŸ˜‹ðŸ’¨ðŸ’¨",
