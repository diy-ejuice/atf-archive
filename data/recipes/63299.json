    "description": "A remix of sorts of my Native GOD recipe. Added some cantaloupe! Native GOD was originally created to be a tobacco base in an apricot tobacco I was working on, but I ended up going a different route with that one, but the base was good enough to stand alone. But now I have decided to fulfill its destiny and throw something fruity on top of it, and now it really shines. \r\n\r\nThe cantaloupe isn't very in your face, so if you want it a bit fruitier, bump that up a bit.
