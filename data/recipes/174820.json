Saw it in a shop and tested it with the wife (she loves it), so here goes... \r\n\r\nThe recipe actually even up coming out beautifully! But if anyone of y'all have had the real Noms v2 let me know how this compares so it can be on point! Like I said... I just tried it one with my wife and went off the description of the ejuice. Thanks & enjoy! ðŸ‘Š",
