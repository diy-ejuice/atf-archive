    "description": "I took Wayne's Yeo Layer crossed with the creams and honeysuckle from ID10-T's Longing, added a hefty dose of Holy Vanilla, and applied a sprinkling of FA Coconut . . . this is The White Hummingbird.\r\nSweet rice is the main note here layered on top of a warm, sweet honeysuckle-laced vanilla cream.  For me, it's a very satisfying vape . . . sweet, savory, warm, and slightly floral.  I mixed up 30mL, shook it like hell, and let it rest for 24 hours before trying it.  It will be interesting to see what happens as this continues to age . . . as it stands, I'm thinking I should mix up another because this bottle may not last long enough to find out. \r\nMuch respect to ENYAWREKLAW and ID10-T for the exceptional resources they provide to the DIY community!",

            "text": "I love this incredibly delicious, unique recipe! When I was a young kid one of my favorite breakfasts was warm, fresh white rice with a pat of sugar, a spoonful of sugar, and a splash of milk. The milk &amp; sweet rice combo strokes that childhood nostalgia spot, while the vanilla cream with honeysuckle speaks to my adult tastes. No off notes or flaws in the recipe, it's exactly as described. I gave it only an overnight steep. I suspect it could deteriorate relatively quickly. I'm sure it would still be tasty, but that rice would melt into an indistinct starch and vanilla will take over. I won't find out, though, because this 30 ml doesn't stand a chance of making it more than a day and a half or so before I blissfully vape it down to the last drop!  "
