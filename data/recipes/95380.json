  "description": "This recipe is inspired from @freshepies (Fresh 03)\r\nHis combination of LB Vanilla ice cream with Flv vanilla pudding really does create an excellent \"custardish\" Base!\r\nAlso using Fresh's suggested combination of FW Blueberry, Flv Boysenberry and FA Blackcurrent creates such a delicious berry flavor.\r\nThis mix is really good off the shake and just improves quite quickly.\r\nI was hesitant to make this public as it really is entirely inspired by Fresh 03, But I just had to share this ADV with the community.",
