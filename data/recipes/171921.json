  "description": "\r\nThis is a Rich Chocolate Pudding with light Bourbon Notes.  Great Mouthfeel Dense Vape. We can all have an off camera Zippy Moment with this one!!\r\n\r\nhttps://youtu.be/f85t-4LT5wc\r\n\r\nThE pUdDiNg BaSe\r\n\r\nVT CHOCOLATE MOUSSE -  This is one of my favorite chocolate concentrates sadly  it cannot be used in every application but  it still ranks very high for me.  This concentrate brings a medium to dark chocolate flavor but the greatest part about this n es it actually taste fluffy and airy like a mouthfull of chocolate whipped cream. \r\n\r\nVT FRENCH VANILLA ICE CREAM - This adds a much needed vanilla note and creaminess to the base of this recipe as well as adding to the overall mouthfeel\r\n\r\nFLAVORAH VANILLA PUDDING -  Not much else to say about this one that hasn't been said.  Light vanilla pudding texture and creaminess. great mouthfeel as well as a blender to combine the ingredients in the recipe for a uniform taste through out.\r\n\r\nThE bOuRbOn \r\n\r\nWONDER FLAVORS BOURBON - For me this concentrate taste and smells like Jack Daniels - It is pretty well balanced in flavor profile. There really isnt a total bourbon flavoring out there for me but this one would be in the combo to achieve it .  The Flavor has a slight alcohol note and some of the oaky flavor needed in a bourbon. it is missing that burn you get from drinking a bourbon by the shot.\r\n\r\nVAPE TRAIN BOURBON - This concentrate has more of the alcohol note you need to do a bourbon right.  It is still light on the woodsy notes needed in a bourbon but again would be part of a combo if trying to make a good bourbon vape. I think i could relate this concentrate to maybe a Makers Mark type of flavor.\r\n\r\nThese two together give a nice Bourbon NOTE ON THE EXHALE  of the vape and doesn't hide the Chocolate Puddin'.  \r\n\r\n\r\n",

      "text": "What a terrific recipe! Rich chocolate pudding achieved. It’s so thick and creamy and smooth so it not only tastes but really feels like I’m vaping chocolate pudding. I love the creativity of mixing Bourbon with chocolate pudding and it really does taste like it has whiskey in it all the way through, somehow without making the chocolate pudding seem thin. It tastes like a lot of work went into this. As much as I might like some of the charred oak barrel of FLV Bourbon in there making it taste like a better quality bourbon was mixed with this chocolate pudding, but it might not work as well as this combination of VT and WF bourbons does texturally. The WF has a oddly thick nearly creamy feel to it that blends in, and the VT just sits right on top without interfering with anything else. All of these ingredients are working together terrifically. Recipe describes it as a work in progress but I think it’s done.  Maybe some would prefer it with a little sweetener to taste, but not enough to get cloying as it is already pretty sweet. "
