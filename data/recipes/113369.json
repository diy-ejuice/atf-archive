    "description": "Stewart's has a delicious ice cream that I just had the other day called \"Crumbs along the Mohawk\" it's described as a Graham Cracker ice cream with Graham Cracker pieces and caramel swirl... now this stuff leaves a delicious aftertaste in your mouth and that's why I'm trying to translate it into vape form here...\r\n\r\nThis is still a WIP... I'm needing the GC pieces to stand out more... Maybe uping the FW 1% and adding .5% AP will help? It's pretty damn close but I need some of y'alls help... Thanks and hope you enjoy... Flavor notes to follow... In the mix is on right now!",
