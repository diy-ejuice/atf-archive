  "name": "Southern Cuts v2",
  "description": "With some guidance/flavor recommendations from CBV, this is my attempt to clone Marlboro Southern Cuts. Of course they're cigarettes so they smell a lot better than they actually taste, but that's fine as vaping tobaccos is often more like vaping the aromas of tobacco rather than actually smoking it. Plus these smell amazing. I've done 3 iterations so far and this is the closest, still subject to change/revised versions in the future. Yes I know it's a shitton of flavors, but it was for mixing experience, not so much for an ADV.\r\n\r\nOn-the-pack description: \"Uniquely rich and smooth. Our master blenders begin with choice Burley, Virginia and Oriental tobaccos in creating the distinctly flavorful taste and warm aroma they call Southern Cut.\"\r\n\r\nPersonally, I get a really rich honey note when I first open the pack and give them a smell. Other comments on them often report hints of vanilla. When I smoked them, I distinctly remember a slight nutty bitterness on the aftertaste as well as an overall fairly dry profile.\r\n\r\nINW Gold Ducat + Dark Fire: This is the honey note here. I remember when I first started getting into tobaccos I bought gold ducat because I liked the name, and when I did a sniff test on the bottle it immediately reminded me of that same scent I got from Southern Cuts. I'm leaning on it a bit here in this mix because of that, and Dark Fire brings some more of that honey note to really lift it out of Gold Ducat and put the fruit and cocoa/coffee notes I get from Ducat moreso in the background.\r\n\r\nFLV Red Burley + FLV Virginia + INW TA Oriental: These make up the tobacco blend inside for the most part. Gold Ducat and Dark Fire are great vapes but they are fairly aromatic and I needed something to make up that medium-bodied tobacco leaf blend. I basically went straight off the pack's description here. My only gripe is that I get that hay flavor from Virginia here, but I don't want to throw off the accuracy of the mix and v2 is by far the closest I've gotten to legit Southern Cuts. If I am to make a change, I'll likely replace Virginia with FLV Kentucky Blend.\r\n\r\nFLV Classic Cigarette + DNB: Bringing some ashyness to the party here. CBV mentioned to me that he gets some Burley notes from FLV CC and I had to agree with him. I think in combination with FLV Red Burley, the CC at a rather heavy handed 1% blends in fairly well but brings some of that crucial burning cigarette paper note. DNB is there to simply bolster that.\r\n\r\nTFA Toasted Almond + Vanilla Tahity: As explained before, these are here simply as accents. I chose Toasted Almond primarily for that slight bitterness and dark toasty nut notes. It's pretty smooth in comparison to \"nutty\" tobaccos like 555 gold, which give me nothing but straight roasted peanuts so I opted to just use a specific almond flavor instead of another tobacco. Vanilla Tahity is an excellent vanilla for tobaccos because it's rather dry and also has some almond notes, but it's soft and sweet. These 2 can potentially be bumped up to 0.75% or even a full percent but I wanted to keep it subtle. The tobaccos are the star of the show here and I just want the occasional whiff of vanilla and almond.",
