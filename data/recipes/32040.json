  "description": "This one is my first attempt at a clone of a \"premium\" e-liquid. The liquid is called \"BA-NA-NAS\" by Coil Butter. The profile given for their liquid is as follows: A freshly baked snicker doodle infused with ripe banana. I feel like I have come as close to the actual recipe as I can. Here comes the breakdown:\r\n\r\nTFA Banana Cream: This banana is creamy enough to hold it's own against the other flavors in this recipe, while being subdued enough to let those other flavors shine through. I also chose this banana over LA Banana Cream, as this has a more authentic banana feel, where LA is more candy like. \r\nFLV Rich Cinnamon: A user by the handle \"Drumbtr\" on the DIY or DIE Discord chat gave me the idea to make a dilution out of this one. At a 10% dilution in PG, this recipe now sits smoothly into the recipe, and really compliments the cinnamon in the TFA Cinnamon Sugar Cookie.\r\nCAP Sugar Cookie v1: You guys already knew this one was in here. One of my all time favorite flavors, and the absolute best sugar cookie to use as the base in this recipe. It really sits on the palate well and provides the warm bakery notes that this profile is based on. \r\nTFA Cinnamon Sugar Cookie: This flavor is by itself pretty damn tasty, but in this mix, the cinnamon is accented by the FLV Rich Cinnamon. This flavor also really helps to add another layer of that sweet snickerdoodle cookie, and backs up the CAP Sugar Cookie perfectly.\r\nTFA Sweetener: Tbh, CAP Super Sweet would have probably fit better in this recipe, but I only had TFA Sweetener. Sue me, lol. The sweetener really brings out the, welll, sweetness of the other components in this mix. It also helps to add to that, er-hem... \"premium\" feel. \r\n\r\nHope you guys like this recipe. Your constructive feedback is always well appreciated. \r\n\r\n",
