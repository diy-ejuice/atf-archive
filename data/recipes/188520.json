  "name": "Boysenberry Custard",
  "description": "Wanted a different take on a dessert as well as a custard. I put a good amount of boysenberry in it so it can really come thru. The custard for that eggy component and the cheesecake for a little bit of cream cheese to amp up the custard and the butter for a little bit of richness and saltiness. Supersweet at 1% to draw out the berry on top of the custard so you get hit with berry up front and the custard on the back end. Made for tanks and rdas. Up the flavor percentage to 20 if you want a pod. Tested on a profile and couldnâ€™t be more happy with it off a shake. As time goes on that eggy flavor will really start to come out.",
