    "description": "My recipe from February 2017 Recipe Thread on Reddit.\r\n\r\nIt is one sweet recipe (both in terms of it cuteness and actual sweetness).\r\n\r\nProfile: a creme brulee with a slice of pink guava \/ grapefruit inside the caramel crust.\r\nThe body: the soul of a recipe is INW Creme Brulee - it is nice, fully developed creme brulee flavour with decent caramel \/ burnt sugar notes. I used FW Butterscotch Ripple to support it and make the body a little bit round and caramel-y.\r\n\r\nThe slice: FLV Pink Guava is a pretty straightforward guava \/ grapefruit, and it will fight the brulee-caramel body in your very mouth. Which is good, because this is what I aimed for. A drop of TPA Orange Cream to make it even more sour and flashy.\r\n\r\nThe accents: Vanilla Custard v1 makes the whole bouquet a little more buttery and creamy, without extending it into even more caramel-y zone. And TPA Peach (Juicy) helps with a tricky aftertaste: I've found that this pairing (flv pink guava + inawera creme brulee) gives some almost-peachy aftertaste, so I used some TPA Peach (Juicy) to make that ghost a real thing. Because it was annoying to almost taste peach but not taste it at the same time.\r\n",
