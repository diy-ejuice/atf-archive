  "description": "Tart, bright raspberry, with fragrant, silky, tropical vibes. This is another 'showcase' style recipe to highlight some characterstics of a few flavors I enjoy. \r\n\r\nI really like how vibrant FA raspberry can be when it sits on top of a mix. INW Dragonfruit is soo damn smooth and I feel it contrasts nicely. Cactus is my main squeeze and hangs out in the middle, lending some floral aspects to the main pairing and helps with the mouthfeel. INW Melon (in its older formulation because the flavor gods hate me) just makes a nice fruit base in general with subtle, yet deep melon presence. FLV Guanabana lends some tropical vibes and gives some more body.\r\n\r\nThe overall vape is chill, yet powerful like a tai chi master or something.",

Six days in and it's completely transformed into a rounded, mellow, complex vape. Not sure if the INW Melon I got recently is the new formulation, but whatever it is, it definitely works here. Think this might be a new favourite. Thanks for sharing! üèù"
