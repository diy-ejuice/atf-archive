  "name": "Them Apples",
  "description": "Bananas are boring, strawberries are sweet, cinnamon is spicy. You're a tough sale, but that's okay! How do you like... Them apples?\r\n\r\nToasted Redux #3. Pulled that cinnamon, threw in some apple, and adjusted the base. Upped Cereal 27 to compete with the crispness of Fuji. Dropped Meringue and Cream Fresh a touch because the apple sticks to them and they were taking over. Makes for a nice dry cereal and tart apple cream vape. Notes for everything but apple are over on Toasted.\r\n\r\nFlavor Notes:\r\n\r\nFA Fuji is my guy. I needed a crisp apple to drop right next to the cereal, and there's nothing better than ol' faithful. At 2% it doesn't totally take over, but it begins to command the recipe. Fuji's tasty. I know it, you know it, we all know it. Boom.\r\n\r\nThis is good off the shake, but after 5 days it starts to become whole. Fuji will recess a bit and the creams will settle.\r\n\r\nHappy mixing. ðŸ‘½",

      "text": "Apologies, I'm just now getting around to reviewing this. This is excellent! I agree TFA Meringue is better in a cereal than the FA counterpart.  Although still delicious if others only have FA to sub. Crazy close this recipe is to my remix of The One: Apple Cinnamon by Beard Vape Co. and a variation of this is adding cinnamon. I like a drop of Rich Cinnamon to a 60ml but I'm sure a drop per 30ml would be loved by many.  If you like that juice...  add cinnamon and this is a cleaner, smoother, and overall way better version IMO. "
