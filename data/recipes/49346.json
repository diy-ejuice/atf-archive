  "description": "This is a well balanced rich Strawberry Cream Milkshake. \r\nHoly Vanilla is such a great Vanilla that gives off a a Dark rich vanilla cream flavor. \r\nDiy FS French vanilla is so good it's very creamy and has notes of vanilla and butterscotch to me which works so well in a milk shake\r\nCap vanilla bean ice cream is smooth vanilla flavor that makes the milkshake taste great.\r\nCap butter cream is just such an amazing flavor that gives a nice sweet cream flavor almost frosting like.\r\nTFA Marshmallow brings in some fluffiness to the recipe while adding to the sweet flavor.\r\nStrawberry ripe really brings in that nice tarty strawberry flavor and really make the recipe sing.\r\nShisha strawberry is so sweet and yummy and adds to make the strawberry work so well together to really get that authentic strawberry ice cream flavor. Taste great as a Shake and Vape. For best results steep 7 days. \r\n",
