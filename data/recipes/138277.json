I'm only on day 3 or 4 maybe it has to do with the Holy Vanilla but whatever the reason this is simple and easy and delicious! Keep up the great work with the simple recipes! I've been mixing for quite some time now (3+) and it's always nice to see an enjoyable simple recipe... Even for us older mixers! Nice work! üëçüëç"
