  "description": "So I had a Rum Ba Ba at a restaurant (see picture) and it was wonderful. A lighter than air dough, they cut it open at the table and then poured a lot of rum over it and spooned the lightly whipped cream ... and then the sugary glaze like syrup... it was wonderful so here is my take.\r\n\r\nWF Rum Baba SC - It;s got a bit of the rum and the nice glaze to it so its a good starting point\r\nJamaican Rum - It needed a good rum boost and boozy note and this brings the noise on that\r\nCreme Chantily - This is the cream on top, that melts in, its got that wonderful creamy texture (thanks MlNikon for this tip)\r\nyellow cake + zeppola - The rum ba ba flavour is missing the \"baba\" so these two add a light fluffy baba with a hint of doughyness\r\nCaramel Salted - This just drives the caramel flavour home I think\r\n\r\nStraight off the shake it tastes good but over a couple of days it picks up on the cake a bit more and fills out.
