  "description": "The first in a possible series of SmotherU variants, SMOTHEREDLEMON is a simple mix that brings the sweet and heavy notes from SmotherU, but brings some nice citrus flavour to make it an enjoyable ADV for the warmer weather. Mix this shit up, it's been my go to for the past week. As always, flavour notes below.\r\n\r\nTPA Marshmallow / CAP Marshmallow - these are the two most important parts of SmotherU, obviously. The TPA Marshmallow brings on that fluffy marshmallow mouthfeel as well as some really heavy sugary sweetness. The use of CAP Marshmallow (use v1 if you have it, v2 doesn't really work in any recipe because it's trash) is here to boost the genuine marshmallow flavour. Simple.\r\n\r\nCAP Vanilla Whipped Cream - one of my favourite concentrates right now, this shit is just heaven for any recipe that needs some thick and fluffy sweetness. The added touch of vanilla works really nicely in the SmotherU recipe, and works even better in here due to the citrus notes.\r\n\r\nFA Lemon Sicily - you learn something new everyday, and I learned recently that FA Lemon Sicily can actually be used at high percentages. Realizing this has changed the game for some of my test recipes that will be released in the near future. I've always used FA LS below 1% because it imparts this lemon zest type flavour there. I never thought to boost it higher because, well, I just had assumed it'd either get bitter as fuck or just fade out entirely. How fucking stupidly mistaken I was. At 3 and 4%, this concentrate brings out some delicious bakery notes, almost like a straight up lemon cookie. Slightly below 3%, like we did here, creates something that can only be described as a baked lemon flavour. This melds so nicely with the marshmallow to create just a really pleasant sweet, fluffy, and citrusy inhale.\r\n\r\nFA Blood Orange - I used this simply to boost the flavour of the lemon, and it works perfectly at a low percentage. Instead of imparting any sort of real orange notes, it just adds some deeper complexity and body to the lemon. You don't necessarily need this one, but it adds another subtle layer to the mix. Keeps the overall profile from being too linear.\r\n\r\nFLV Cream - we all know how this concentrate works, and in here, it does exactly what it's supposed to. Add a little mouthfeel, emulsify the citrus into the other creams, and create an extra touch of sweetness, all while being as inoffensive and hidden as possible.\r\n",
