    "description": "Wet and juicy apricot tobacco. Just enough tobacco to add a bit of smoky feel on the exhale. The apricot sits right up front though. If you're in to fruits, this could be a bit of a dirty break from all that sweetness. If you're in to dirty tobaccos, this could be a break from all that filthy ash. A little something for everyone.

Personally, I appreciate it for reminding me how good Gold for Pipe is. This recipe steeps into exactly as promised, a wet and juicy but slightly smokey and dirty sweet, rich pipe tobacco. It's surprising to me how present that apricot is on the front end at just 1%. I usually find it to be a fairly good background note that doesn't assert itself too much, but it works differently with these tobaccos. Which is not to say it's too strong here; it's balanced perfectly on top of the tobacco here. Awesome recipe, as usual for CBV.  "

The sweetness from the Apricot sits up front and then you're left with a tobacco in the background, mixed in nicely. Definitely need to mix up a bigger batch of this and try and forget about it."

            "text": "If you have these flavors, then you know what each one of them tastes like. I followed the 30 day steep to the minute. Vaping this is hard to explain the subtleties. BFP and GFP are both rich flavors on their own but I always have seen them as so different. GFP is more sweet and almost syrupy to me and BFP is dark and rich and bold. Here they form a strong chain linked from the DNB\/BFP to the GFP sweeter aroma to the juicy Fruit but it's all subtle and wrapped up in a blanket of woodiness. I almost wished I had tried it as it was steeping to get a sense of how each flavor battled it out for top dog until they all agreed to settle back. This is a great recipe to try if you are starting tobaccos since BFP and GFP (and even DNB) are both excellent flavors on their own and apricot and cactus have loads of uses outside a tobacco profile as well as Oak wood. Well worth the wait; did not disappoint. nice job, cbv."
