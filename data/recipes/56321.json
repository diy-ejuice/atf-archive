    "description": "This is a refreshing Cucumber Cooler, infused with lime and mint. Perfect for a hot day or as a palette cleanser.\r\n\r\nCapella's Cucumber is semi sweet and has the taste the inner portion of a ripe cucumber. It has some nice weight\/mouthfeel, and is a delicious flavor.\r\n\r\nFlavorah's Cucumber is very refreshing and less ripe than Capellas offering. This flavor tastes more like the outer half of a less ripened cucumber. It to has a little sweetness, and helps round out Capella's Cucumber.\r\n\r\nFlavour Art's Lime Cold Pressed is crisp and refreshing. \r\n\r\nCapella's Lemon Lime helps round out the citrus note of this recipe.\r\n*This flavor was added after the initial posting.\r\n\r\nInawera Cactus adds extra succulence.\r\n*This flavor was added after the initial posting.\r\n\r\nTo finish off the recipe, I added Inawera's Natural Mint. It's a clean refreshing mint that works nicely in this recipe. 1 drop per 15ml, or 1 drop per 10ml, if you prefer more mint.\r\n\r\n*Optional - If you want to add some juiciness along with some extra sweetness without using a sweetner, add Flavour Art Pear @ 1-1.25%\r\n\r\n####Feedback is welcomed. If you mix this and review it, in return, I will mix a recipe of yours and give you an honest review. Enjoy!",

            "text": "This is a solid recipe that does indeed taste like a nice recipe for a hot day or a tired palate. Lime is probably an even better pairing than the much more commonly seen melon with cucumber. I do wish it had a little more chill, like some Polar Blast on the end. As it stands, it kind of tastes like dressing up a glass of cucumber-lime gatorade with a slice of cucumber and a sprig of mint, but forgetting the ice. It also tastes like it could use a punchier lime, like maybe some VT Persian Lime instead of, or in addition to, the Cold-Pressed.  "
