    "name": "An Incident In The Orchard | DEVELOPED",
    "description": "This is a collaborative creation by DEVELOPED: NaChef, Max Savage, Graham, Folkart, and Guest, ConcreteRiver.\r\nThis was an exercise to see how FLV Eggnog would pair with FLV Back Bar Bitters to create a spicy custard base to add brighter fruits notes such as apple.  It was quite the experiment full of twists and turns, with a finished recipe that could only be described as a burning apple orchard.  Now you may think that is not a very desirable profile to end up with, but it is surprisingly addictive and wonderful.
