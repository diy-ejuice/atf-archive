  "description": "One of my first recipes I deemed worthy of sharing on ELR some time ago. I've lowered the % on the FA Cream since it was first posted . \r\nThe raspberry adds a subtle bump to the strawberry and helps it stay in front of the dairy flavors. Alternatively, FA Pomegranate at 0.3% to 0.5%  will be more than happy to act as a substitute kicker. Recommend aging for 5-7 days.\r\n\r\n",

I put it aside after a few days and it sat in the drawer for another month. While some of the pink has faded, I loved this mix. Not sure what the magic was, but it crept up on me, kind of slapped me around. I think the SB faded a bit and let the raspberry really shine like the hunker that it is, like a solid reach around. I'm writing this now, a solid 7 months later and -- guess what -- yup I found the last 10 ml of this sitting around daring me to mess with it like that tramp you know you can have a wild romp with every now and again. So here I am, the morning after, with no regrets. You should try it some time, have your turn at it."
