  "description": "As with most Italian pastry deserts they are not overly sweet and that is what is what I wanted to capture here, more of an authentic Cannoli I grew up with . This is really good and ADV for me. The use of catalan cream and hangsen Italian cream will bring more unique flavor profile without overwhelming sweetness or vanilla notes - if you are looking for a sweeter more american cannoli then you can use Vienna cream, a dash of a vanilla ice cream and cheese cake of you choice for the filing\r\n\r\naustralian chocolate - smooth, somewhat sweet, dark chocolate. used low up to 1% - if you go higher it does not bring you more flavor but more a chalk mouth feel - this is more of a accent chocolate to me in a recipie and does that well here ( VT dark choclate could also be used ) \r\n\r\nBurlone (Joker) FA Pazzo - is a spot on cannoli shell with a dash of cinnamon and powered sugar - you get that fried dough crispiness for sure ( very much like Zeppola) . I can see this being used in many many combinations of cream, chocolates, and fruit . I can see this working well with a brandy cream filling or a vanilla burbon RY4 cream filling \r\n\r\nitalian cream/ Catalan cream / lemon sicily - these are used for the filling - catalan cream is a niche type cream to me it is weak on the cream texture and body but has some flavor profiles that are needed in this mix - most notably the citrus, vanilla and cinnamon . The cheese cake and the Italian cream work to create that thick type of ricotta cream filling. NY cheese cake needs a little more of that \"cheese\" note and Italian cream does that - it a thick tangy cream that really bring that unique note almost like a mascapone cheese - it has a low ceiling to to me and needs to be under 1%\r\n\r\nThe torrone is used for mild powdery sugary almond and citrus back note - used low to support the exhale \r\n\r\nMade for Mixin in the kitchen episode \"leave the gun take the cannoli\"  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Es07SSpD-Ow   ",
