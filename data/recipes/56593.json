    "description": "A yammy, creamy greek yogurt with Apricot and a touch of orange\r\nBoth layers of the juice are very well balanced making this a creamy and fruity vape.\r\nHowever, I regret that I couldn't get the tipical yogurt sourness\r\nFor me, the sweetness is on spot, but you can add CAP Super Sweet to suit your taste\r\n\r\nTo make this a frozen yogurt, add FA Polar Blast or TPA Liquid Mentol.\r\n\r\nVisit DIY MIXERS CREW on Discord https:\/\/discord.gg\/3K56qB\r\nFollow DIY MIXERS CREW on FaceBook https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/diymixers\/\r\nJoin DIY MIXERS CREW on Facebook https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/groups\/456512471380574\/\r\nWatch DIY MIXERS CREW LIVE on YouTube every Sunday at 4:30 pm EST https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/channel\/UC1ENB0bSNrG_1KETYwZ154g\r\n\r\nPlease remember, smoking is dead, vaping is the present, mixing is the future \ud83d\ude0a",

It also ages very well if you steep it longer with the creams and fruits developing more fully. It never really hit yogurt town for me, but is enjoyable none the less."
