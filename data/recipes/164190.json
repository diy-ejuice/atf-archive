  "description": "I have finally done it. I started DIY 5 years ago and have been trying and trying to create the perfect cookie dough ice cream. \r\n\r\nHere it is!!\r\n\r\nI have to thank, and give an honourable mention to ID10T for his superb recipe Longing. This gave me the perfect Vanilla Ice Cream. Honeysuckle really does work its magic in this recipe.\r\nAlso Wayne Walker, for his more recent attempt of a cookie dough, utilising Flavorah Cookie.\r\n\r\nI use TPA VBIC, FA Cream Fresh and TPA Honeysuckle to create a fine ice cream base.\r\nThen with FLV Cookie, FLV Cookie Dough, VT Devon Cream, INW Shisha Vanilla and FW Hazelnut I create a fantastic cookie dough base. \r\n\r\nI tried the recipe with just Ethyl Maltol but it lacked the sweetness you get in the cookie dough ice cream. \r\nI then tried it with just Super Sweet, but some bakery notes were lost. \r\nWith a small combination of the two, the perfect balance was found. \r\n\r\nDo try and give the recipe a good 5 days for all the flavours to combine together and settle. \r\n\r\nIf you do mix it up, let me know your thoughts below :)\r\n",
