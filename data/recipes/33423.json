  "description": "This is my lemon meringue cannoli!!! It has a lot of ingredients but trust me it works.  Give it a try and let me know what you think you won't be disappointed. This recipe is good after a shake but really  comes alive after a 5 day steep and to be honest it gets better and better every day it steeps. \r\n\r\nFLAVOR NOTES:\r\nLemon Sicily and lime tahity cold press both made flavor art make up my lemon flavor of the lemon meringue filling of the cannoli. Of coarse i need some  MERINGUE by FLavor Art this adds a creamy sugary sweetness to the mix.  Well then I have the flavorss that make up the creamy cannoli center. I used a combination of New York cheesecake and vanilla custard by capella i add a small amount of vienna cream by flavor  art it helps pull the new York  cheesecake  and vanilla custard together. I also add in custard by flavor art I added this to the mix to help with the lemon flavor and the cream part because it has notes of both in it. It is a different custard that doesn't work in many situations but it works great in lemon  flavors. To be honest I added the Nonna cake at a very small .25% more for mouth feel than to help the outer cannoli wrap. So i guess that brings me to the outer wrap of the cannoli i do this by using Inawera  Biscuit and  Flavor art Cookie both at .5 % . Well that's it$$$$$$ LET ME KNOW WHAT YOU THINK!!!!! I HOPE YOU ENJOY! !!! LOTS OF FLAVORS THAT WORK ",
