Added here for others to use. https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/8g4z5m/may_2018_recipe_thread/\r\n\r\nNotes Intended to be used with at least 200mg per 15ml, more if you can stand it and can keep the PG ratio high. Add the powdered CBD isolate first to the empty bottle, add the PG and flavorings and wait until fully dissolved. Add VG after. Steep time is 4 days due to the crunch berries flavor.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
