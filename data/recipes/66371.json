    "description": "This one has an odd genesis. Watched this back in 2016: https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=7noLAUMuosg. The names unicorn puke and dragon jizz sent me on a research bender. Nope. No dragon jizz to be found anywhere, other than in google image search.\r\n\r\n Damn furries. ;P \r\n\r\nOddly enough, found an image belonging to a commercially available juice called Unicorn Jizz.  http:\/\/stores.goodasgoldpremium.com\/unicorn-jizz-ejuice\/.\r\nCouldn't bring myself to try it. Too tropical in my head for unicorns.\r\n\r\nSo, after a long discussion with friends of mine who are furries, started joking about making some. This is not the Dragon Jizz (that's still a WIP). But, since my 'sona is a cross between a kitsune, and a unicorn, and has a candy corn horn? Started noodling out what the hell that'd taste like. So here we are:\r\n\r\nOrange, creamy as hell, and a hint of candy corn.\r\n\r\nNow I just gotta find a dragon. It's for science >.>",
