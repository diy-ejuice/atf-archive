    "description": "Boysenberry and Coconut is an absolute match made in heaven. The dark berry flavour of FLV Boysenberry goes soo well with the creamy nature of TPA Coconut Candy. Chuck a touch of Pink Guava in there for some brightness and citrus to balance it all out and some WS-23 to keep it cool for summer in Australia at the mo. \r\n\r\nThis is a simple 3 flavour banger that absolutely rips. Stoked on this one to be honest. Enjoy!",

The Pink Guava is a great accent note to it all. Only issue is that the cooling agent is a bit too strong for my taste. Kind of distracts from the profile a bit. So I'll lower it for future batches. Well done mate!"
