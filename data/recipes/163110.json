  "description": "I wanted to come up with a juice for my upcoming holiday to the Caribbean using tropical fruits. I had a base of orange, pineapple and mango to which I added passionfruit to bring some brightness to the party and cactus to get the juices flowing. I added the pink guava as I didn't have a grapefruit and it works really well with giving a bit of tang. The final piece was the FLA sweet coconut which compliments the other flavours and leaves a nice sweetness without being sugary.\r\nI'm delighted with the outcome as a SNV and think I have nailed what us Brits know as Lilt",
