    "description": "Ladies and Gentlemen. in the name of Remix Month, I present to you a remix of Vapergate's Crystal Smurf. \r\n\r\nVapergate is a great company with absolutely divine juices. I've been buying Smurf and Crystal Smurf, along with the alliance, the masons, dumptanks, Slut Pumps and really whatever they put out I jump on. \r\n\r\nI was blown away when I discovered how simple this recipe really is. \r\n\r\nHere's what I put together: \r\n\r\nI purchased some Capella Blueberry Jam and tested it at 8%, where I generally sample Capellas. it was throaty and harsh as fuck. Ok, I said, add it to a batch and try it again tomorrow. 24 hours later, I have Smurf. I was blown away.  \r\n\r\nHowever, it's not an exact match. there's a cool exhale on smurf which may be mint, lemonade, or even Koolada. I went with Koolada at a very low percentage to try to capitalize on the tiniest touch of cool exhale. \r\n\r\nIt's basically perfect. And now it's yours. \r\nplease enjoy, and if you can afford it, check out Vapergates whole juice line. Donkey is a personal favorite. \r\n\r\nWith love. \r\n\r\nBorn. ",
