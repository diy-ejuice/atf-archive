    "description": "Okay I'll be the first to admit this is some weird shit! \r\n\r\nInsanely creamy on the inhale, with a sweet and juicy melon top note, in the middle of the vape, you are hit with an insane amount of delicious vanilla, that blends in flawlessly with FLV peach, the edition of FLV cinnamon gives it a spicy counterpoint, to all the creamy, sweet, deliciousness that is going on. \r\n\r\nSteeping\r\n\r\ncan't really give you any steeping notes, I literally made this a few hours ago, just so good I couldn't wait to share it.\r\n\r\nSubstitutions\r\n\r\nSuper sweet can be substituted out for whatever your preferred sweetener. Or just leave it out if that's not your thing. \r\n\r\nFLV Rich cinnamon, there are a number of cinnamons that could work here, FLV fire cinnamon is next on my list to try, I think it just might fit the profile better. If cinnamon is not your thing, nutmeg, cardamom, Ginger, and clove should all provide a nice contrast to the recipe.\r\n\r\nFLV cream- 000 creamy milky undertones \r\n\r\n",
