  "description": "I replaced Pink Lemonade and Keylime with Lime Tahity Cold Pressed. Gives it more lime skin taste.\r\nAlso replaced CAP Sweet Strawberry with Cotton Candy and TPA Strawberry Ripe to provide more sweetness and denser strawberry flavor.\r\n\r\n\r\n==============================================================================================\r\nThis is a Strawberry Lemonade recipe focusing more on the strawberry notes with a touch of lime in the mix. \r\nThis recipe was made for FlavorBook Entry \"(FA) Juicy Strawberry\"\r\n-> https://diyordievaping.com/2017/10/30/fa-juicy-strawberry/",

      "text": "Honestly man, this is just way too much EM. It mutes the shit out of the mix for me. 2% cotton candy seems insane IMO, on top of how light and fickle Strawberry ripe already is, I just didn't get any flavor whatsoever out of the juice. If you want a denser strawberry flavor, I'd suggest JF Sweet Strawberry or FA Red Touch instead of Strawberry Ripe, and replace EM/Cotton Candy with a bit of INW Cactus or INW Cactus Lime to add some juiciness, maybe a sucralose/stevia based sweetener like FW sweetener or CAP super sweet instead of ethyl maltol.&#xD;\n&#xD;\nI was in a bit of a pinch and just wanted some strawberries, but on a triple core clapton in a hadaly at 40w or massive series build in a kennedy 25 at 100w I barely tasted any strawberry at all. If it works for you, I can't knock it! But I think there's ways to improve upon this profile."
