    "description": "So, a co-worker's girlfriend's step-sister's grandmother (no joke) wanted a simple sweet spearmint menthol\" flavor. She just started vaping after decades of smoking and couldn't find anything that gave her that strong mentholated minty goodness she got from her cigarettes. At the time, having no knowledge of spearmint or menthol, I decided to go to BCF and order some things. After looking at a few things, I ended up with these two flavors. There wasn't too much thought put into this recipe, honestly, but it did turn out delicious.\r\n\r\n\r\nFA Spearmint... What can I say? It's just like Wrigley's or Trident spearmint gum. It's sweet enough all by itself, so it fit perfect in this recipe. The ginger got lucky and didn't need to try another flavor for once. Used here at 4.5%, I think it is just bright and sweet and minty enough for what I was going for, and what I was asked for. If you're a fan of minty goodness, you will enjoy this flavor. Also, as a side note, apparently it is now called White Winter, and not just FA Spearmint.\r\n\r\n\r\nFW Menthol... It's menthol. That's all there is to say, honestly. It's strong stuff, so 0.5% was plenty enough.\r\n",
