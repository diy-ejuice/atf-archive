    "description": "Perique is usually described as a strong, peppery blending tobacco. I\u2019ve done a straight Perique NET, and a few Virginia\/Perique NETs, and while I see where the \u201cpeppery\u201d description could be applied, it always came across as more of a fermented, dark fruitiness with a bit of a kick. That\u2019s what I was going for here. Not anything that\u2019s going to make you hate your life because it kicks so hard, but enough of a bite to make you notice. \r\n\r\nBrandy\/Red Dates\/Liquid Amber in there to try to get some of that funky dark fruit. Almost like a raisin or prune wine, if that\u2019s something you want to imagine (I think I want to imagine it.)\r\n\r\nFor the tobaccos I went with Dark for Pipe because it\u2019s got a bit of that fruitiness that\u2019s already got a bit of funk to it, and also adds a good kick. Black for Pipe because it\u2019s required to be in every recipe of mine. Also because it has a dark fruit and hint of pepper-ness to it. It\u2019s all about packing a punch. Red Burley to bring a bit more body and bass notes along with some sort of moist earthiness. Moist is the best kind of earthiness. Mmmm. \r\n\r\nSo anyway, my goal was to make a better tasting Perique than anything that is currently sold as a single flavor of the same name. Looking at you, FA. Instead of hating yourself for picking up that flavor, just mix yourself up a better Perique. Or... wait for it.... Abetta Perique. God damn I\u2019m clever. ",
