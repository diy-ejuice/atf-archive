  "description": "Perique is usually described as a strong, peppery blending tobacco. I’ve done a straight Perique NET, and a few Virginia/Perique NETs, and while I see where the “peppery” description could be applied, it always came across as more of a fermented, dark fruitiness with a bit of a kick. That’s what I was going for here. Not anything that’s going to make you hate your life because it kicks so hard, but enough of a bite to make you notice. \r\n\r\nBrandy/Red Dates/Liquid Amber in there to try to get some of that funky dark fruit. Almost like a raisin or prune wine, if that’s something you want to imagine (I think I want to imagine it.)\r\n\r\nFor the tobaccos I went with Dark for Pipe because it’s got a bit of that fruitiness that’s already got a bit of funk to it, and also adds a good kick. Black for Pipe because it’s required to be in every recipe of mine. Also because it has a dark fruit and hint of pepper-ness to it. It’s all about packing a punch. Red Burley to bring a bit more body and bass notes along with some sort of moist earthiness. Moist is the best kind of earthiness. Mmmm. \r\n\r\nSo anyway, my goal was to make a better tasting Perique than anything that is currently sold as a single flavor of the same name. Looking at you, FA. Instead of hating yourself for picking up that flavor, just mix yourself up a better Perique. Or... wait for it.... Abetta Perique. God damn I’m clever. ",
