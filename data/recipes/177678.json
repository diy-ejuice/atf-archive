  "description": "I built this recipe with layers from Mixin Vixen's Berry Custard Episode #88\r\n\r\nCranberry Cobbler, Wild Berry Cobbler and Sweet Currant\r\nML Nikon mixed the Cranberry, Wild Berry and Currant in her Berry Cobbler Custard and that got me thinking about making this into a rich holiday tart wrapped around a Cheesecake. I mixed this as a V1 without the currant and it was a bit tart... but I think it could be a tad heavy in this version and will likely drop it to 1% on the v3 mix. I have also been playing with a touch of FLV White Chocolate in my cheesecakes and think this recipe could benefit from a touch of that as a binding agent to smooth out the berry and accent the cheesecake.\r\n\r\nPastry Dough\r\nAlong with the cobblers makes the bakery/crust note in this and is spot on to how I wanted it to feel on the mouth and the richness of that crumb topping and bits of soft gooey cobbler funk that I love so much.\r\n\r\nPudding, Ice Cream, Cheesecake - WOW... this was a winner and works really well to soften the berry and add that thick mouth feel and rich creamy after note. The LB imparts some butter and almost a thick rich cream to add to the cheesecake.\r\n",
