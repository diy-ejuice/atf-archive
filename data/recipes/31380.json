  "description": "I did a lot of tweaking to get it to this point. Silly Rabbit is a mediocre flavor that I picked back up trying to mix something similar to Bird Brains from Cuttwood. I still haven't had it myself, but my 2 tasters say this is close, but better. Cap 27 is a nice base to play with, may just be my favorite cereal.\r\n\r\nEdit 5-16-17 I found Tricks Cereal to be an even better fit than SR! To be fair, chewymidget mentioned subbing it because of a lack of SR. It is really good with either, so you can't lose here.",
