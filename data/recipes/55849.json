  "description": "Kid tested, mother approved.\r\n\r\nKix is a lightly sweet corn cereal with just a little bit of milk.\r\n\r\nAn update to my kix cereal+milk. Mixed around cream flavors, added marshmallow.\r\n\r\nBavarian Cream/sweet cream/cream fresh - milk base. very dairy without being TFA Dairy/milk.\r\n\r\ncereal 27 - the star of the show. Honey grain cereal. Great for creams, cereal... I can't think of much this wouldn't fit in apart from straight fruits, menthol, alcohol, drinks, or anise.\r\n\r\nmeringue/marshmallow - cereal staples, KIX itself does not have marshmallow in it but here marshmallow is used with meringue to boost the sweet honey sugar glazed corn/grain cereal and overall sweetness.\r\n\r\nPossible additions:\r\n.25% TFA Cotton Candy (Ethyl Maltol). Used to take any harsh edges off, I tend to prefer it with it in the mix.",
