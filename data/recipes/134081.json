  "description": "There are many others like it, but this one is mine. My own cookies an cream recipe. \r\n\\\\\\Mixed at: 70vg\\30pg\r\n\\\\\\Steep Time: 7 days\r\n\r\nI had been craving a cookies and cream vape over the past couple of months. So I started to get to work on it, I wanted to keep it simple enough without sacrificing the profile I was going for. I hope you enjoy this as much as I have. To the Notes!\r\n\r\nDat Oreo: In my oreopinion RF Cookies and Cream - SC has no equal when it comes to an Oreo flavor, it really captures the chocolately goodness that comes from it, but like a lot of base flavors it still needs a little help. So I brought FA Cookie and FA Meringue to the party. FA Cookie gives a bit more texture and FA Meringue helps with that good ole grainy and sugary white filling. FA Meringue also serves a 2nd purpose in this recipe by helping out our ice cream base.\r\n\r\nWe all scream for Ice Cream: I've been an enormous fan of TFA Vanilla Bean Ice Cream for a long time, but I know the biggest problem a lot of people have with it is a peppery taste. I really wanted as many people to enjoy this as possible so I opted for my 2nd favorite ice cream. HS/LB Vanilla Ice cream is definitely a bangin combo, with HS bringing that slightly musky vanilla note, LB bringing that heavy cream flavor, and a dash of FA Meringue to bridge the texture gap between them. FA Meringue is just really versatile, \"It really ties the room together man\"\r\n\r\nCAP Super Sweet is in here just because this is an ice cream, it's meant to be sweet (I do about 1 drop/30ml, or 3 drops/60ml). This will still do great on it's own though if you're not a fan of adding sucralose.\r\n\r\n If you're really craving a good cookies and cream, I hope you give this a try. Don't forget to leave a review! I always appreciate feedback and constructive criticism.",
