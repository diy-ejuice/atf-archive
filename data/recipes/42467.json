  "description": "A simple springtime vape with a classic pairing of pear and honeysuckle. \r\n\r\nFA pear is closer to an apple and more succulent and tart.  TPA pear balances it out with flesh, water, crisp, and slightly floral notes. Honeysuckle blends with TPA pear enhancing the floral note, adding complexity with no downside, and enhancing the refreshing aspect of the overall flavor.  TPA Dragonfruit works as an emulsifier; blending our pairing together and helping hit those middle notes of the fruit.  FLV cream brings down the highs and mellows the notes out a little bit turning this into a nice subtle all-day vape.",

The pear and the honeysuckle work so well together in this mix, and the cream and dragonfruit help to smooth it all out. Both subtle and complex at the same time. This is definitely going into heavy rotation starting today! Perfect!"

      "text": "One of those recipes where five stars doesn't seem sufficient. I don't know what this creator was thinking, but it tastes like he tried TFA Honeysuckle by itself, thought about what to add to make it taste as amazing as possible, and succeeded. The TFA Pear and honeysuckle melt together to become one delicious pear-suckle thing, while FA Pear gives it so much sweet juiciness. The cream pulls it all together and finishes it with a light, yet satisfying fullness. Proof that the classic honeysuckle &amp; pear combo doesn't need melon, lime, or strawberry to be sexy as hell. And a standout example of how a relatively simple recipe doesn't necessarily have to taste simple. "

      "text": "A fantastic floral pear vape for your summer adv. The layered pears are complex and not too overbearing while the dragonfruit helps to blend and boost the fruity combo. Honeysuckle is the real star of this recipe, boosting the floral note of the pears and grounding it in some earthy notes. If you thought the 3% of honeysuckle was too much, don't worry FLV Cream has your back. Flv Cream acts as a neutral cream, taming the honeysuckle and keeping it from getting out of control. Great Job!"

      "text": "I mixed this one up on a whim for the Mix It Or Fix It segment on the BLND Podcast. Assumed, based on the recipe and the profile, that this would be a solid, but simple fruit vape. How wrong I was about that. This recipe is an absolute banger, with some hidden complexities and an incredible evolution through the steep time. As a shake and vape, the pear is obviously the focus, for that FA/TPA combo creates something very delicious and potent. However, after a few days of steeping, that FLV Cream and TPA Honeysuckle just push this recipe to the next level. The cream blends all the fruits together while adding the perfect amount of thickness and fluff, all while still allowing the pears to take the spotlight. However, that honeysuckle comes in to bring a bit of unique earthiness to the mix, while also giving the dragonfruit some personality. I've yet to keep a bottle around for longer than a week, but I constantly find myself coming back for more. If you're looking for a refreshingly light, yet absolutely delicious fruit ADV, look no further. Great work, as always."
