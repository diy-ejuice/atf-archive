  "name": "KIWANA  U WANA   CUSTARD!!!",
  "description": "This is my new all day vape Its a  kiwi banana custard, But it truly becomes its own sweet fruit by the times it steeps.  Definitely not an authentic fruit but delicious all the same. This Is a custard for those people that dislike capella vanilla custard v1 or those who don't want to wait the two weeks  for it to steep. This custard combination needs half the steep time of capella vanilla custard v1 at 7 days it. Is completely blended I love it after 3 days but I also like capella vanilla custard v1 after 7 days so its fair to say you may want the full 7 day steep???  This Is definitely one of my favorite mixes I have made to date its a  Sweet Creamy candy custard leaving only   one question KIWANA U WANA??????\r\n\r\nUse any VG/pg % you prefer it has plenty of flavor as a max VG but will be great at whatever % you prefer.",

Love the caramel undertone from the creme brulee and can't wait to see how this steeps. I can definitely see why this is your new ADV...I can't put it down. Delicious!"
