    "description": "I've been on the search for a nice Grapefruit soda, and failing to find one, I thought I'd give it a go.\r\n\r\nI saw OOO Squirts Soda which is the prime flavor in this case, but I felt it need a little more support.  \r\n\r\nI like a heavy grapefruit flavor so borrowing from my favorite Developed Recipe - Mellow Pomelo I used the combination of FW Ruby Red and VT Honey Pomelo.  I tried a couple of other combinations and always came back to this duo.\r\n\r\nTo support the soda side of things there's nothing better than FLV Citrus soda and a healthy dose of CAP Lemon Lime to really bring the soda forward and blend some citrus into the mix.  For a more rounded soda flavor.\r\n\r\nA dash of Super Sweet to round things out a bit.  \r\n\r\nYou can add .25% WS-23 if you like, but I prefer it without.\r\n\r\nIt seems to be the thing today to list what you are testing your recipe with, so here you go.  Series Mech, .3 ohm dual round wire at about 250 Watts on a Kennedy RDA.\r\n\r\nSuggestions welcome. \r\n\r\n",
