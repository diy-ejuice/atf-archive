  "description": "CAP Sugar Cookie is the star of the show here. The buttery yet soft cookie provides the perfect base to this cookie.\r\n\r\nJF Cookie helps shape it and provide the realistic crunchy edges and golden flavor that a fresh baked cookies have.\r\n\r\nTFA Butter is used just low enough to provide a buttery note that is present in a fresh sugar cookie or even snickerdoodle.\r\n\r\nCAP Cinnamon Sugar and FLV Rich Cinnamon provide the spice backnotes to a true spice dusted sugar cookie\r\n\r\nFLV Vanilla Custard helps provide the right amount of body while thickening the mix to provide a dense slighhtly saturated mouthfeel that you get when eating a sugar cookie.\r\n\r\nCAP Super Sweet at 0.25% to 0.5% is crutial here to provide the sweetness you get while eating cookies especially one as sweet as a sugar cookie. I like it at 0.25% however\r\n\r\nSUBS: If you don't have FLV Vanilla Custard you can use CAP Vanilla Custard at 1%,",
