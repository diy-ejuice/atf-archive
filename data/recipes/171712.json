    "description": "This is just something that dropped on me... I think it needs a lil improvement. (FLV Vanilla Pudding instead of the the VT pudding base) but it is getting to a banging stage of taste... It's not bad but probably could be improved... If not from me maybe from one of y'all... \ud83d\ude01\r\n\r\nIdeas that are in the making... FA Premium Custard...\r\n\r\nBasically I'm going for a Kronut filled with custard or a Kronut dipped in custard... What y'all got to say that mix it? \r\n\r\nIt's not bad it's just not there (GREAT)! TIA for mixing it up and any help into brining this into fruition... I Absolutely love thick fall vapes! Hit me up with your suggestions! \ud83d\udc4a\ud83d\udc4a Happy Friyay to y'all! ",

Looking at the placement of the ingredients I think you're going to have separation of layers.. I don't see a base.  you know, a foundation?  I think this would be like a donut was dropped in the pudding and is smack in the middle of everything instead of the Pudding and Custard resting in the middle of the pastry.  I would create a base with CAP Sugar Cookie Or (FA) Cookie if you want a light texture on the bottom of your pastry.  For a bit more defined bottom bite Try (INW) Biscuit.  THEN put your gooey center in with custard 1st, then pudding. I thjnk Zeppola "
