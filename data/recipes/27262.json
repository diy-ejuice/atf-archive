  "description": "\r\nOne version of a \"French dude\" remix that I've been working on.\r\nA very sweet, buttery waffle base drizzled with blueberry & maple syrup.\r\n\r\nNotes and subs:\r\nJF biscuit can be subbed for INW at the same %. They are close enough to sub and I just prefer the JF in general.\r\n\r\nThis mix needs to steep, off the bat the biscuit dominates and needs time to calm down.\r\n\r\nSuper sweet can be upped to 1% for more store-bought sugariness.\r\n\r\nFrench Vanilla Creme can be subbed for TFA VBIC at same %\r\n\r\nIf you don't have INW waffle just leave it out - it adds some authenticity to the waffle base, and is definitely a worthy inclusion but not 100% necessary.\r\nIn a pinch you could sub the INW waffle for FW at 2-3%\r\n\r\nHappy new year!",
