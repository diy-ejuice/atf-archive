  "description": "Setup i used: dual fused clapton @0,21Ohm on a Velocity RDA @75-80 Watts\r\n\r\nThe Idea:\r\nI did not want to use the basket ingredients to be the base for a pastry,which would be pretty obvious.Especially Cinnamon Danish Swirl and Fuji together could already be a pretty good and simple recipe.\r\nSo i had the idea to use CDS only as a top note.But the challenge was to find something that binds to this ingredient and is strong enough to cut through the fruit mix without overtaking it.Pretty soon i found that TPA Pie Crust could be a good match for what i was looking for.It's not sweet,dry and strong enough to differentiate itself from the sweet fruit base.I also think it mimics the crisps quite well in this particular case.\r\nIt's a little \"sharp\" though at this fairly high percentage so in order to round those sharp edges a bit i used EM at 0.5%\r\nEM also brings out some of the inner sweetnes of the fruits,which isn't a bad thing at all.\r\n\r\nThe fruit base: Fuji is the main note and Strawberry Ripe is more of a sweetening agent here.It's not supposed to be a strawberry blast which hits your palate like there is no tomorrow.The good old FA Meringue has never let me down when it comes to add some white sugar to a recipe. FA Liquid Amber was also a No-brainer.It brings some fermented,warm feel to the table which turns that fruits/meringue combo into something that has slowly being cooked and stirred for some time .Meringue and Liquid Amber together brought me the Compote taste i was going for.\r\n\r\nThe Conclusion: A sweet,warm Apple Strawberry Compote freshly made with some Cinnamon Crisps on top\r\n\r\nSteeping:after 4 days everything comes together nicely and especially the Pie crust tones down a bit.\r\n\r\nSidenote:After i had the recipe together i realised the i have been using V2 of Capellas CDS.I know i'm an idiot but i hope that V1 is not completely different than V2.I don't know if you guys see it as a major mistake,but now it's too late anyway because i can't get V1 in time here.\r\nThanks for this awesome Competition!\r\n\r\nFeedback would be highly appreciated especially if i won't make it into the next round!\r\n\r\n\r\n ",
