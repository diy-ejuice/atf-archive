  "name": "Tiger's Blood Pod/MTL",
  "description": "This is a Tiger's Blood recipe optimized for pod/MTL vaping. Purilum watermelons the most important ingredient, it's got a sweet candy vibe and does great work here. If you don't have JF - Sweet Strawberry you could sub it for the CAP version but they're pretty different, results not guaranteed. Tiger's Blood is all about the creamy coconut, so I layered them a bit. Give it two days for the fruits to relax and the coconut to come through.\r\n\r\nThe coolants are optional. At this level they don't really cool the vape just add a bit of mouthfeel. You could also use one or the other at .7% if you don't have both.",
