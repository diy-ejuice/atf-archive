  "description": "I wanted something *different* in my ice cream for the winter months. Something dark and warm. In initial mixes I chose to go with FLV Milk & Honey but since Folkarts incredible Boss Reserve clone has gained such hype (it really is good), I chose to steer a different direction. I landed on Toffee. Having not worked with Toffee it was completely alien to me. However, Now that I've experimented, I very much love this flavor.\r\n\r\nIt's a dark, sweet and rich butterscotch-y ingredient. I chose to add WF Honey Roasted Peanuts in it to layer in some intrigue to the recipe, But could totally see hazelnut or almond playing good as well. The mix ultimately accomplishes a thick mouthfeel with sweet (but not too sweet) complexity. CAP Vanilla Whipped Cream plays it's role in adding a thicker creamy texture along with the vanilla attributes from TFA VBIC. INW Biscuit obviously plays the part of the cone.\r\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nJoin our group: https://www.facebook.com/groups/steamroomunderground/",
