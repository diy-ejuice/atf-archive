    "description": "This is a recipe I've been developing for a friend of mine who still dual uses and I'm trying to get them out of that habit. She loves her coffee black and she's been all up in those flavor roasted coffees. She likes the black cherry in her French roast.\r\n\r\nWF Brazilian Coffee\/FA Carmel\/FA Bourbon = That's your black coffee. I really like WF Brazilian Coffee, even though I don't like coffee in general. It's an authentic flavoring and definitely the best coffee on the market right now. Fresh gave me the advice to add a little FA Carmel for that rich coffee liquid darkness profile and to use a darker vanilla flavoring to spice it up, hence FA Vanilla Bourbon.\r\n\r\nWF Blackcherry Jelly Bean\/FA Cherryl =  That authentic, fleshy black cherry profile that will marry my black bourbon vanilla coffee base.\r\n\r\nOOO Marshmallow Vanilla = At 1% you're not getting a lot of vanilla or marshmallow flavor, however, you're getting the best mouthfeel you can find for something like this.\r\n\r\nI hope it works out and she likes it, but also I think this gives people the idea to try vaping and mixing flavor profiles that are strong and a little different from what we're used to.\r\n\r\nEnjoy, be queer & vape on!\r\n\r\n[Picture Credits: www.cherryblack.com.au ]",
