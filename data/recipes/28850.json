  "name": "Strawberry fluff ",
  "description": "Besides the obvious  trade infringement  the name is self exsplanitory . The ingredients are fairly self exsplanitory also. The strawberry taffy I realized on a failed recipe that it tastes just like strawberry fluff flavor to me anyway or at liest it did in my failed mix. The marshmallow flavors are for none other than the marshmallow taste . The butter cream was my way of adding the creaminess of strawberry fluff.",
