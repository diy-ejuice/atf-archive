    "description": "A nice summer vape. I really hated honeydew vapes until I found JF honeydew melon. It's phenomenal and cannot be subbed so fuck off. \r\n\r\nErythritol is a great sweetener for fruits so yes I used it here, really not necessary though so you can leave it out. \r\n\r\nCAP cantaloupe is a really nice base for melon mixes, it's a pretty nondescript melon flavor that works best as a background note. JF honeydew is the star of the show at 1%. The watermelon mix sweetens things up and adds a nice depth to the recipe. Cactus is here because juicy yummy and it tastes pretty melon like especially at low %. \r\n\r\nThis is pretty straightforward and honestly it is downright delicious and complex enough for me to enjoy.  I normally don't go for fruity blends but this one kept me going for over 50mls, enjoy!\r\n\r\nShake and vape but as always I let my stuff sit for at least 3 days to homogenize.",
