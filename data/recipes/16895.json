    "name": "Maple Infused Apple-Berry Brulee",
    "description": "What a great time I had crafting multiple variations of the basket ingredients.  It was definitely a challenging experience, but what I finally settled on to present to the judges is a Maple Infused Apple Berry Brulee.  \r\n\r\nThe Brulee is simply a baked custard.  This is why I chose (I know...I know) CAP Vanilla Custard v1.  Adding to the \"baked\" feel, I wanted a little more volume and sweetness to the custard - this is why I chose to add TPA Toasted Marshallow.  I felt it was the perfect amount of \"burnt\" sweetness to play nicely with the custard.  Adding in CAP CDS adds to the overall appeal of the custard while also giving the custard more of a rich spice.  \r\n\r\nMaking the custard a little more playful, this is where the Apple-Berry combination comes into play.  Image marinating freshly cut apple slices and strawberry slices in a bath of maple syrup.  After a nice long marination period, this mixture is then intertwined within the custard mixture and then placed into the oven until completion.  This is the experience I get with my vape.  \r\n\r\nI wanted to step outside of the box a little bit and add another layer of complexity within this baked custard mix.  This is where the idea of adding maple came in to play.  FA Maple is a flavor that can easily overpower a mix, but with the various basket ingredients it was easier to go on the higher side of the recommended percentage to allow it to be a relatively front-forward note.  \r\n\r\nI hope you all enjoy ... win or lose - I had a blast!\r\n",
