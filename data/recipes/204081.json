    "description": "FA Cookie is a wonderful base for a shortbread cookie. It's got a little bit of sugary sweetness but it doesn't mask the other notes and it's not creamy at all. \r\n\r\nINW Biscuit is a perfect addition to what we're trying to do here. A simple a delightfully crunchy note for an authentic butter cookie.\r\n\r\nWe're getting our butter from WF Cookie Butter SC. It's just a nice warm butter goes a long way in this recipe adding to the mouth feel and texture of this recipe. \r\n\r\nSweeten to taste. I use FW Sweetener at 0.5% in here. \r\n\r\nWatch the Video here:\r\nhttps:\/\/youtu.be\/DmgK3Qxoz_k",
