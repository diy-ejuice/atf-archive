      "text": "A fantastic recipe. Full bodied, very enjoyable, great upon mixing. I was afraid the bananas might be overwhelming or too ripe, but they are just right on the inhale. Reminded me of GSV bananas foster, but less gooey. I made a small batch at 75/25, will definitely make a bigger batch now, maybe with a bit more biscuit.    &#xD;\n&#xD;\nedit: After about a couple of weeks tastes just as good. I made a second batch with the bananas kicked up just a notch since i thought they were getting a bit light after a few days, it works well. The best ADV for me."
