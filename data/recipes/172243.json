  "description": " Made for Fresh03 Saturday show  - we were challenged to make a  \"Fair - ified\"   mix  and use more then 5  flavors to create a profile (as a  tribute to the juice fairy   Jennifer Winstead) .  I went after a little Debbie's  oatmeal cream  pie   mix with some raisins and light cinnamon  .    https://youtu.be/2YQHvHRczNs  \r\n\r\nThis was tested at 60 watts on a reaload S -   off the shake it is  a full body,  sweet cream vanilla mix  with some light oat notes on the back  - as this steeps the bakery notes, and raisin  notes  will come forward a bit more and fill out\r\n\r\n\r\nfor the cream I wanted that super sweet make your teeth hurt cream  filling    So  FLV  frosting,  and    WF gooeey marshmallow work  perfect for that  -      along with  cream filling ad vanilla cream extra  for some additional body \r\n\r\nSadly  there really is not a solid oatmeal flavor that I have come across - but the combination of oatmeal cookie RF and  Oats and cream  does have an oat note on the finish       The  body of the cookie needed to be filled out so Sugar cookie ,  FA cookie   support the body \r\n\r\nBaker touch adds some  body  along with some cinnamon and brown sugar notes \r\nRed dates  is  a brighter then a cooked raisin so the addition  of  fig helps to darken it a bit  -   along with some molasses \r\n\r\nA simplified  version of this could be achieved   with  RF  Oatmeal cookie,  WF Oats and cream, WF buttercream frosting,   CAP sugar cookie and  LB bakers touch",
