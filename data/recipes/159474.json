  "description": "\"A spoonful of spooky fun in every bowl, Franken Berry is a whimsical way to start the day. Made with whole grain corn, Franken Berry combines strawberry-flavored cereal with colorful marshmallow shapes to create a delicious cereal that kids and adults can enjoy.\r\n\r\nOk! Trick or treat !\r\nAnd know the real description:\r\n\r\nMixed berry marshmallow cereals and milk.\r\n \r\nThe Cereal:\r\nCAP Cereal 27 is the king, you have the perfect corn cereal vape. OOO Powdered Sugar makes them sugary coted.\r\n\r\nThe Milk: \r\n2% OOO Cream Milky Undetone and 0.75% FLV Cream with the support of TPA Marshmallow create a rich sweet cereal milk.\r\n\r\nThe Strawberry:\r\nCAP Sweet Strawberry and FLV Berry Blend are mostly artificial or candied strawberry and berry flavours that go pretty well here. \r\n0.5% Berry blend makes CAP sweet strawberry deeper and more interesting.\r\nThe blackberry/raspberry notes in Berry blend makes the milk kind of purplely, i love it.\r\n\r\nMarshmallow Bits:\r\nTPA Marshmallow fits very well the profile, helps with the milk base, sweetness and mouthfeel, as well as giving marshmallow flavour.\r\nAlso OOO Powdered Sugar Makes the illusion of having Sugar Coated marshmallows floating in milk more than a marshmallow cream.\r\n",
