  "description": "So for the virtual mixing for May's mixer's club (May 2020), I got Kopel, who wanted...well...\r\n\r\n\"Cocktails! Whiskey drinks are my favorite and since I can't go out for drinks right now this is my escapism\"\r\n\r\nAs a devout vodka guy (mostly), the closest I get to whiskey is jack and coke, or if the joint (or plane) is fancy enough, Jack and ginger (preferred with honey jack)...so I had to look around the net. \r\n\r\nThen I found the Whiskey Smash.\r\nThen I found a variant that was made with cucumber and mint muddled with a LOT of limeade, and garnished with lime wedges.\r\n\r\nWith all that green, and whiskey...30 more seconds on the internet of searching for an image, and I bring you the Smashed Hulk. Because sometimes, the jokes write themselves.\r\n\r\nGreat off the shake, thought it hit perfection at day 3, and just stays beautiful, even 2 weeks later.",
