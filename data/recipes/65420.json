    "description": "I\u2019d heard so much chatter about Capellas new Silver Line the last few days. \r\nHere\u2019s my first entry using the new flavors. \r\nBiscuit gives that delightful cookie flavor. I\u2019d say it\u2019s a cross between a shortbread and a digestive biscuit. Has a light coconut taste to it. \r\nButter Pecan I can only say wow. I\u2019m not a nut flavor vaper, but this changed my mind. It\u2019s sweet and buttery and decadent \r\nCinnamon Sugar It reminds me of that premix blend you can get from your local supermarket. A lovely blend not too sweet and not too much cinnamon bite. \r\nI\u2019ve been pleased thus far by the first flavors released in this line. \r\nCan\u2019t wait to see what\u2019s next! \r\n",
