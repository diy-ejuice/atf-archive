    "description": "A creamy, tangy and sweet lemon pudding. \r\n\r\nLemon Sicily and Juicy Lemon make a great lemon flavour in combination, with the tang from lemon sicily being smoothed out by the juicy lemon and creating a beautiful dessert lemon flavour.\r\n\r\nI used Lemon Meringue Pie as a bridge into the creams (which form the pudding layer of the recipe), as it has a hint of creaminess and Meringue to add sweetness.\r\n\r\nFor the creams, I wanted something light, flavourful and sweet, but that wasn't overpowering and would support the lemon. This is a combination I have used to good effect in other recipes, and it seems to work well here.\r\n\r\nVT pudding base rounds the whole thing off, adding a lovely mouth feel and roundness to the vape.\r\n\r\nThis needs a couple of weeks to steep and get to the sweet spot, but I have been trying it since I made it and it is really good so far. \r\n\r\nI would appreciate any feedback! \ud83d\ude0a\r\n\r\nEdit: a friend has told me that this is extremely similar to\/a clone of Milkman's Pudding. I haven't tried it, but if you have and you liked it, give this a go.",
