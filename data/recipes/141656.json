  "description": "First of all before I start...big shout out to @ID10T  for the great insight and flavour notes on the coffee episode. FLV Irish cream and VTA coffee liqueur are both sex in a bottle! (ZERO CAT PISS DETECTED).\r\nNow let’s get down with the nitty gritty...\r\n\r\n Time for the ultimate tastebud seduction with this absolutely delicious Tiramisu recipe! I have put so much work into this recipe to get it exactly like the desert itself and I honestly couldn’t be happier with it. I would add flavour notes but if I’m completely honest with you guys,anyone who knows their flavours SHOULD take one look at this recipe and see it’s got serious potential. Plus I’m currently very poorly and tbh,really can’t be fucked to be writing countless notes. Please take it from me....this COULD be one of the  best Tiramisu recipes you might ever mix/try and I’m glad I can share it with you all. Please leave your feed back for me that’s all I ask in return as it helps me grow as a mixer. Please allow Atleast a week for the full experience as I intend it to be but truth be told this shit is good off the shake after a 2hr warm bath. ",

      "text": "This is awesome! Absolutely slays with morning and after dinner coffee. What I'm getting isn't 100% perfect, but I'm still leaving five stars for the following reasons: It tastes amazing, this is a difficult as hell profile, and I'm not sure it's possible to get any closer to tiramisu in a vape. Imperfections include a little too much chocolate, and a very slight coconutty note that's out of place. If you don't like cocoa, you shouldn't be trying to vape tiramisu anyway, and I happen to enjoy coconut enough that the little touch of it here doesn't bother me at all. The soaked ladyfingers and cream are perfection. I usually have them soaked in coffee liqueur rather than the kind with espresso with a touch of amaretto or spiced rum, but those varieties are wonderful too and for this one you could just say you went a bit tropical and used espresso with a spoonful of coconut rum. Hmmm.... I feel inspired to make actual tiramisu that way and see how it turns out! "
