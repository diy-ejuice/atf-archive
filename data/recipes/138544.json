  "description": "That, my friends, is a truly magical cookie. The tobaccos infuses very well the with the toasted hazelnuts, adding that nice nutty flavor and brings that milky and creamy flavor out in this mix as well. The oats keep the texture soft and on point, and the dough itself bakes up chewy and buttery, with just a little crunch around the edges and blend perfectly.\r\n\r\nThese cookies are a fun, decadent treat for anyone who loves cookies…or nutty chocolate or cream…or tobacco…so basically, anyone :)\r\nTime for me to finish my thesis…you go enjoy some cookies!!\r\n\r\nPerfect after 2/3 weeks",
