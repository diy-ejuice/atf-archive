    "description": "Laugh all you want at the ingredients and percentages, but this tastes like Captain Crunch.  If that is what you want to vape, this is what will deliver that to you.  Nothing out there delivers an authentic Captain Crunch base than FLV Crunch Cereal, and believe me, I have a whole shelf of cereal and corn flavorings to prove it.  It's the sharp corn bite that is essential to the profile, that I cannot seem to get anywhere else.\r\n\r\nCrunch Cereal has been panned heavily in the DIY Reddit, ranging from \"it tastes like mushrooms\" to \"it's pure jizz.\"  Like sure, by itself at 5% I get that.  But blend it and it takes on a life of it's own.  And I'll take your word for it on the jizz part.\r\n\r\nThis is essentially a mish mash of various ceral base receipes I have seen, with the FLV Crunch Cereal on top.  The AP adds another sharp bite to mix.  If you like to shove your mouth full of cereal to the point of causing trauma to your soft palate, this may be what you are looking for.  \r\n\r\nIf you don't want vape juice that tastes like somone who ate a bowl of cereal burped on it, enjoy.",
