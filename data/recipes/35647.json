  "description": "This is a remix of my Momma Slap Cheesecake. I took advice from other mixers to pair down my ingredients and also added a few new flavors.\r\nLA caramel - This is used to give a slight dark buttery taste to the crust\r\nTPA VBIC - This is used to balance out the sometimes \"dirty socks\" aroma that cheesecake can sometimes have and it helps round out the ruff edges of the cheesecake\r\nCAP Vanilla Custard - This is used to add that eggy mouth fill that cheesecakes tend to have\r\nCAP NY Cheesecake - well....base\r\nTPA Graham Cracker - pretty self explanatory\r\nINW Biscuit - This helps to bolster the Graham Cracker by adding texture and cookie-like flavor\r\nTPA Greek Yogurt - I add this in small amounts to give the cheesecake a slight sourness. It seems to balance well with the JF Strawberry Sweet\r\nTPA Lemon/Lime - You may ask yourself why? Well this adds a uniqueness that makes my cheesecake stand out among the rest by adding a slight freshness and \"mouth watering\" feel to it.\r\nJF Strawberry Sweet - I like this strawberry because it gives a strawberry like syrup instead of just fresh strawberries  \r\nMaxVG\r\nBest steeped for a week\r\nPlease comment or review, That's what makes all mixers better :)\r\nEnjoy!
