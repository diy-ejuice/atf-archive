  "description": "CAP Vanilla Cupcake is a really good cake on its own. At 4% you get a nice fluffy white cake with a little bit of vanilla frosting. I’ve added the TFA Vanilla Custard II to add to the depth and make it a little darker. \r\n\r\n\r\nCAP Sweet Strawberry is so good. It’s a nice in between artificial and natural strawberry. CAP Vanilla Whipped cream for a nice fluffy cream on top. And a little bit of CAP Sugar Cookie to make the cake a little drier. \r\n\r\nWatch the Video Here: https://youtu.be/4WploIH0Ti8",

It's floury and biscuit-like with just the right amount of sweetness, and the strawberry compliments it nicely without being overpowering.  I'll definitely be making more of this in the future!"
