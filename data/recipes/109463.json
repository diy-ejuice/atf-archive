  "description": "Well we've had some hot hot weather here in the UK, so here's my take on a Pineapple Sorbet!!\r\n\r\nAfter having tried various Pineapples, I wasn't impressed.....\r\n\r\nChefs Flavours just update their Vape Train range, including some interesting Pineapple flavours, so naturally, I got them all in. \r\n\r\nSugarloaf Pineapple- Solo tested at 2%- A subtle pineapple, tastes like a pineapple tastes when freshly cut. Fairly sweet.\r\nPineapple Juice- Solo tested at 2%- A darker pineapple than the above. As the name suggests, a much more juciey type pineapple, like you'd expect in a carton. Ticker, almost as if its a Pineapple Puree.\r\nIce Pineapple- Solo tested at 2%- Theres the ice I was after. I can tell I wont be needing to add any coolada or WS23 to this mix. A very cool Pineapple, with a very slight menthol taste,\r\n\r\n\r\nOverall I feel this is a perfect, cool, fresh, pineapple sorbet :D\r\n\r\nLet me know your thoughts :):)",
