    "description": "A Banana Marshmallow Salt Water Taffy.\r\n\r\nI also tested this recipe with Lorann's Banana Cream. Lorann's Banana Cream was just as good as TFA's but it just overpowered the recipe.\r\n\r\nTFA Banana Cream is a great banana candy flavor. Very creamy and smooth. I added WF Marshmallow (Gooey) to give the recipe a sticky and gooey candy like feel. I ran across some taffy a few months back that had Sprinkles in them. The sprinkles made it taste even better. It made my recipe stand out. FW Sprinkles is a great additive to ice creams and yes, taffy. FW Salt Water Taffy is a great tasting Taffy. You definitely get the mouthfeel of Taffy with a hint of vanilla. All around I'm very happy with the results.\r\n\r\nPlease enjoy and give me your feedback! ",
