    "description": "Another request for a pod\/MTL vape. This time I'm after a really classic cotton candy flavor profile that you would find at the fare. Just a pink cotton candy that tastes like red candied sugar and vanilla.\r\n\r\nTPA Cotton Candy Circus\/TPA Marshmallow = this is ethyl maltol for days, but the closest you can get to an actual cotton candy flavor.\r\n\r\nTPA Vanilla Swirl = for the vanilla and for the mouthfeel. This is the body of the vape.\r\n\r\nWF Strawberry Gummy Candy\/FW Razzleberry = the redness in this vape. I like strawberry gummy candy because it's a very good candy flavor that isn't exactly strawberry but carries that gummy\/candy profile very well. Razzleberry is bright but mixed and I'm using it here for its pink fruit quality.\r\n\r\nCAP Super Sweet = You don't have to, but I like how it rounds everything in this recipe.\r\n\r\nThis is a popular profile yet it's pretty hard to actually manage the texture of cotton candy, but I think this is nice. You can do a 50VG\/50PG for your typical pod\/MTL tank or 70VG\/30PG for your sub-ohm tank and RTA\/RDA.\r\n\r\nMany thanks to @MECHMODRN ( https:\/\/alltheflavors.com\/users\/MECH_MOD_RN ) who is, as always, a great sounding board and support.\r\n\r\nEnjoy, be queer & vape on!\r\n\r\n[Photo credits: www.oceanmistsoaps.com\/cotton-candy-dreams\/ ]\r\n",
