DNB and Dark for Pipe in there to create a nice strong base to showcase the Black Fire and Kentucky Bourbon dream team. ",

FA Black Fire can be a little unwieldy because it's hickory-ish smoke notes are just so damn strong but it pairs so excellently with the Dark for Pipe and Kentucky Bourbon here. As with everything else I've tried from you so far CBV, it's smooth as hell for a dark, rich, ashy tobacco. Unlike anything I've had, and I can't put it down!"
