  "description": "A scrumptious sugary doughnut stuffed with thick & creamy custard, drenched with sticky icing...\r\n\r\nThis recipe was inspired by St. Louie Butter Cake and all honors go to @MrBurgundy for his  awe inspiring base for this reincarnation.\r\n\r\nFA Zeppola and yellow cake combined creates an impressive doughnut base for this indulgent treat. The yellow cake adds some needed body to make this a fantastically fresh tasting, crispy fried doughnut. \r\n\r\nThe creamy custard filling is provided with compliments of my trusty custard combo of INW Cuastrd and Creme Brulee. These soulmates are the most perfect custard companions and their pairing here celebrates their combined brilliance.... \r\n\r\nThe vanilla layer is boosted with a touch of Madagascar Bourbon Vanilla, which I discovered recently to be a contender to dethrone the other bourbon vanillas around... A faboulsy dark and rich vanilla flavour without adding any sweetness to the mix.\r\n\r\nThe icing is proved by a marvelous combo of LA CCI and FLV Frosting which, when combined, makes for an orgasmic, lip smacking, lick-your-fingers, sweet and sticky enrobement. \r\n\r\nThe powdered sugar works it way through the doughnut base and sits beautifully atop the icing as a sort of tactile base enhancer. Itâ€™s pure magic...\r\n\r\nGive this baby 2 weeks to come together.\r\n\r\nPrepare yourself for oral bliss... \r\n ",
