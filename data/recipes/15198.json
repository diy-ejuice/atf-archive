  "description": "Oh, that smooth caramel skin... Let's put that in a bottle, yeah? I took the cream base for \"Ginger Sauce\" and augmented it a bit to make a caramel cream that is sure to knock at that sweet tooth. FA Caramel and FA Catalan Cream were made for each other, and a quick sniff of the two is plenty enough to tell anyone that.  I took out the CAP Graham Cracker v1 and CAP Vanilla Custard v1 out of \"Ginger Sauce\" and kept the cream base for this recipe. It's fairly straightforward.  I hope you enjoy it.",
