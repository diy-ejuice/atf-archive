  "description": "This was created mostly to combine some of my favorite flavors. When I was working on Cap'n Burgundy's First Mate, I discovered the beautiful pairing of FW Graham Cracker and brown sugar. I opted to go to the source, and use WF Molasses in place of TPA Brown Sugar. Then I added some texture to the back of FW Graham Cracker with FA Cookie to prevent the graham cracker taste from becoming overpowering. It was a lot of dry ingredients, so I finally found a place to use CC Devon Cream. Along with that I used FLV Cream and FLV Milk & Honey to achieve a nice textural balance. FA Maple Syrup is used for the maple and to sweeten the recipe overall. FLV Popcorn has a unique textural component that I wanted to use, and it provides a slight hint of caramel and butter in the background. ",
