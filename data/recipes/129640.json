      "text": "I’m a sucker for gin recipes. Like really, if you want me to try your recipe, your best bet is to look for profiles that we have coming up on Noted that I’m not likely to have a ton of flavors for, and mix that profile with gin. And I love the idea of cranberry with gin and Blood Orange Champagne with gin and cranberry with Blood Orange champagne. And all of that is good. But the TFA Ginger Ale and Golden Syrup messed this up for me. To be fair, she explained in the notes that Ginger Ale adds some darker sweet notes to contrast the brighter top notes and the Golden Syrup sweetens like simple syrup in a cocktail, and they mostly do that. But I get quite a bit of vanilla from the Ginger Ale and a tiny hint of butter from the Golden Syrup as individual flavors. I get the vanilla coming through here and it clashes with the gin and champagne. I don’t get butter necessarily from the recipe, but there’s a savory-ish richness here a beverage shouldn’t have. I’d mix this again but with something else for the syrupy sweetness (CAP Hibiscus comes immediately to mind, but there might be something else that would work better) and just ditch the Ginger Ale without replacing it with anything."
