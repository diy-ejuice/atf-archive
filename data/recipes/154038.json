    "description": "This is a rich decadent custard with a topping of bright passion fruit. I had to look up what the stuff in the picture was because I had never seen a real passion fruit. I am really digging the combo of Devon Cream and Custard Premium for a really nice thick custard. Cap Passion Fruit is a very basey, syrupy sweet passionfruit and fa passion is very bright and tart so the two together make it a very well rounded passion fruit.",
