    "description": "I've always a been a fan of a custard cookie vape. My first experience with one came with the use of Sad Boy's Custard Cookie. I enjoyed it and still enjoy it to this day. My thing was that it's a bit one note. I wanted something unique with a bit more nuance, so I put together this rendition of a cookie custard. I call it Rational Gaze after one of my favorite songs by the band, Meshuggah.\r\n\r\nI have a newfound love affair with Legendary Custard. It hits all the right notes for me in terms of creaminess, sweetness and mouthfeel. Couple it with OOO's Vanilla Marshmallow, it gets a kick of vanilla and body. Sugar cookie, JF cookie and JF biscuit make up the cookie note with sugar creating the thick mouthfeel, and JF cookie and Biscuit providing that crunchy cookie texture to round off the doughy feeling of sugar cookie it provides when left by itself in a mix. JF Cookie Butter is where I ventured to add a new twist on the custard cookie profile. Cookie butter enhances the creaminess further and adds a bit of a spice note to the layers of cookie and custard. \r\n\r\nI've been vaping it consistently after a 10 day steep. I hope you enjoy. \r\n\r\n",
