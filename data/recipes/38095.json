  "description": "A calming floral tea, perfect for chilly spring evenings.\r\n\r\nThe tea base starts with FA Black Tea, a straightforward black tea without a lot of sweetness on it's own. FLV Lemon Tea provides the forward tea flavor, accompanied by a warm lemon note that compliments the FA Lavender nicely.\r\n\r\nFLV Cream and FLV Milk and Honey provide a slightly creamy background to smooth out some of the dry notes in FA Black Tea and FA Lavender, while adding some body and sweetness. Overall a very simple flavor, with enough quiet complexity to keep me coming back to it.",

I was pleasantly surprised that the micro-overdrive of Lavender did not cause any problems at all, not only in this mix but also on those I based on it."

Tea forward, but with just the right amount of cream to smooth the entire thing out and make it really nice and relaxing.  Good balance of floral, citrus, earthy, and creamy. "
