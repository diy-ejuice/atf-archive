    "description": "When faced with the assault of cold months ahead I really wanted a warm and decadent tobacco to shepherd me through the winter winds.\r\n\r\nTFA RY4 Double - I mean when you hear \"decadent\" you know you have to go with RY4 Double, a nice easy bakery-esque flavor with a hint of tobacco. Really one of the best go-to flavors for when you want a mild, non-offensive tobacco.\r\n\r\nFW Butterscotch Ripple\/ FW Butterscotch (Natural) - Ripple is the go-to Butterscotch for just about every application you need. Its wonderful, rich, and creamy. Butterscotch (Natural) is used to boost the main butterscotch flavor of Ripple. Ripple is fantastic but sometimes can be lost in a complex\/dense mix and either needs to be mixed dangerously high or it needs to be reinforced with other flavorings.\r\n\r\nFW Butter Pecan - while RY4 Double is a great tobacco flavoring, it wasn't nutty enough for me. Added Butter Pecan to fill out that nutty tobacco note. I didn't want to go too high with this because I've found this flavor will REALLY take over a mix if you go slightly too high. \r\n\r\nTPA Brown Sugar\/FLV Milk & Honey\/ FA Bourbon (Vanilla) - These flavorings are blended together to bring a darker sweetness to the mix. The butterscotch notes are reinforced by the Brown Sugar and Bourbon (Vanilla). The latter also brings a warmth to the mix. FLV Milk & Honey adds a dark sweetness while accenting the pecan.\r\n\r\nMix it up and throw it in a dark cabinet and let it sit there. I'd leave it for a few weeks BUT if you are impatient (like me) it can be good to go in a week. \r\nPersonally I mix this at 60\/40 and I would probably not go much higher than 70\/30.",
