  "description": "VT Banana custard is such a nice banana flavor, with the custard contributing to the entire pudding base.\r\n\r\nThe Devon Cream comes with a nice soft Chocolate note, teamed up with Chocolate mousse makes for a creamy mellow milk chocolate .\r\n\r\nThe cookies and cream also does contribute to the pudding with the cream portion and adds a mild bakery note in the back to keep it interesting at 1.5%.\r\n\r\n\r\nMy first version did not include the devon cream and was not nearly as flavor full or creamy. It also had Croissant for the little bakery I was looking for instead of cookies and cream. This version is the winner!\r\n\r\nReally enjoying this one! First vape with chocolate that I can vape all day.\r\n\r\n\"Together lets discover\" :)\r\n\r\nI prefer this recipe with a small % of sweetener.it really helps the chocolate come thru in a more realistic way.\r\n\r\n",
