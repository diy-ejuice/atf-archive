You got a good base going, although Raspberry sweet + SS + FW is EM overload, and I'd guess OOO too, but I don't know if they release SMS sheets, however I'm going to pick that flavor up now that bullcity carries it. If you have INW Raspberry (malina/shisha), combo them would be best or fw razzleberry try that instead of the TPA and see what you think of it because I bet it'll improve 10 fold. If you want any suggestions or questions as I'm very familiar with the profile PM me and I'd be glad to help."
