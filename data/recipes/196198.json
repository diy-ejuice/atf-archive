  "description": "Bubba is throwing a carnival and you're all invited. Don't forget to grab some deep fried watermelon ice cream on your way out. For y'all new to BubbazBrewz, Bubba is my dog. He is a great dane/black lab mix. Bubba likes to eat everything he can smell, and we here like have a nose for flavor and a passion for DIY and affordable vaping. \r\n\r\nTimes like these are too stressful, so I wanted something reminiscent of a day at the fair. Loading up on fried sweets and sprinkling in sweet fruity treats. I'd come home with a blissful stomach ache every time. Those were the days weren't they? \r\n\r\nLB Vanilla IC is one of those gems that has gotten a ton of attention recently. I actually pulled it out of the first box I started DIY with from LBs starter kit. This is a delicious VIC base for this fried watermelon ice cream \r\n\r\nWF- VC extra brings a more complete feeling to the Vanilla ice cream, as LB lacks a touch of the 'nilla' essence. \r\n\r\nWF deep fried pastry dough - one of the main components here for the carnival fried food effect. May be replaced down the road but for now it stays where it stays. \r\n\r\nMB Big Watermelon - we are hooked on this melon here at bubbaz and we love the somewhat artificial candied taste of this watermelon flavor. We often eat a watermelon sherbert from Wally world that tastes just like it. \r\n\r\nCap sweet watermelon - extra layering for the watermelon flavor so the MB doesn't get lost in the deep fryer \r\n\r\nAcetyl Pyrazine - this is our choice on this mix to help boost the fried flavor of the whole mix. 2 drops per 15 ml is our reccomendation. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
