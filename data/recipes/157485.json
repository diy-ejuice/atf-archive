  "description": "Vanilla Cupcake is a Placeholder for Molinberry Cactus Cupcake, \r\n\r\nThis mix was created during the LGBTQ+ Fundraiser with QueerYourVape on the Fresh03 Youtube channel.  https://youtu.be/5Xa1eZqfwK8\r\n\r\nThis is for the colour green in the pride flag that celebrates nature, and what a good time to show off this awesome M Line Molinberry Product called Cactus Cupcake. \r\n\r\nI know off the bat that might sound bizarre, believe me - I had my reservations. But in the honor of celebrating diversity, i've given this a go - and I LOVE IT. \r\n\r\nWell done Molinberry, this concentrate is a banger. \r\n\r\nMB Cactus Cupcake - This is the hero in the mix, with it distinct but not overboard caky cactus notes\r\nPUR Yellow Cake - To boost the cake notes, what a lovely yellow cake. \r\nWF Buttercream Frosting SC - Add some buttercream frosting and butter notes that completes this mix. \r\n\r\nYes this is a bakery good off the shake. Hope you enjoy",
