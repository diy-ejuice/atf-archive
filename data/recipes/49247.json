  "description": "Waffle Me This? This is my final version of Strawberry Waffle. As I mentioned in V1 of Strawberry Waffle, my local vape shop mixed this recipe and I fell in love with it when I first started vaping. It got too expensive for me to buy and that's when I began mixing. This was a riddle that I had to crack.....10 months later I finally think I have it where it needs to be.\r\n. \r\nTo celebrate \"remix\" month or \"clone\" month I'm releasing this recipe. \r\n\r\nThis recipe has a nice Belgian waffle taste smothered in maple syrup and strawberry syrup with a slight hint of freshly whipped cream. It has a great full mouth feel and is perfect with a nice cup of your favorite coffee. You may want to lower the CAP Super Sweet to .25% if you want less sweetness, but I like it at .5%\r\n\r\nSteep 5 days is best\r\nPlease comment, mix, and or rate,...it makes us all better mixers. Enjoy :-)",

Granted it needs atleast 48 hours to steep but its worth the wait 10 fold. It brings me back to that mom and pop dinner that serves homemade waffles top with strawberries drizzled with maple syrup and a touch of cream. Well done folkart. It will be part of my adv rotation. The more it steeps the better it gets. Thanks for the share. Vape on dude!!!!!"
