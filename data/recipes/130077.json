  "description": "I based this recipe off \"Fugly Butters\" @Ebc88 \"This is a fried banana pudding\" & Bad Drips \"Ugly Butter \" description: \"They don't call it ugly for nothing... Uncle Freddy's famous, fancy fried dough, showered with carnival cultivated cinnamon-sugar, serenaded with a cosby-quality banana pudding.\" \r\n\r\nSo, here it goes...\r\n\r\nFLV Vanilla Pudding/VT Pudding Base: these 2 combined make up a delicious \"Cosby-esque\" vanilla puddin'\r\n\r\nSA Banana Flambe: gives the fried banana aspect and also adds a touch of cinnamon...\r\n\r\nVT Banana Custard: ties together the banana flambe with the pudding while adding some more depth to the banana pudding aspect of the recipe\r\n\r\nFLV Rich Cinnamon: turns up the cinnamon flavor. \r\n\r\nCAP Funnel Cake: In Bad Drips description they talk of funnel cake and Capella had just dropped their funnel cake around the time that Ugly Butter hit the shelves, so I figure it's in there... so why not? \r\n\r\nWF Cinnamon Pastry: no reason other than I just picked this up and wanted to give it a try... plus I figured it would add some more depth to the bakery/dough aspect of the recipe while adding a bit more cinnamon... which it seems to do just fine...\r\n\r\nTPA Toasted Marshmallow: to add a little sweetness, mouthfeel, depth and body to the entire recipe. \r\n\r\nCAP SS: why not?... It's a tooth rotting belt busting State Fair Treat... it needs to be sweet! 0.5% does just that... add more or don't if you want to...\r\n\r\nFA Joy: to bring out the yeasty-ness of the fried dough just a lil more... feel free to omit it... I personally don't care for joy either, but it works well here...\r\n\r\n3 day steep and the banana calms down... day 5 the pudding melds together and everything tastes delicious... didn't make it past a week with the first batch, so I don't know if it'll change much at the 2 week mark...\r\n\r\nPlease rate and review if you mix. \r\n",
