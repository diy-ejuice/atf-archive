  "description": "NB NB NB please use INW Wild Ice Cream in the place of INW Grape. I had no option available for it. \r\n\r\nHere is my take on the popular South African e-liquid - Trinity. In the 7 years i have been mixing for myself this was one profile I struggled to get right... Until I got my hands on INW Wild Ice Cream. \r\n\r\nInw wild ice cream form the foundation. This is predominantly a strawberry and white grape sorbet more than an ice cream. It has that instantly recognizable tone that defines the profile\r\nTfa double kiwi, strawberry ripe just to boost the grape and tfa double kiwi to complete the holy trinity. \r\n\r\nThe grape is the one aspect I am not yet 100% certain of. But it works just fine.\r\n\r\nLeave a comment below if you have tried this and let me know what you think. ",
