  "name": "Make Purple Grape Again!",
  "description": "Made by @NoWar (Isuamadog) and @UnappreciatedRobot on the DIY_eJuice Discord\r\n\r\nAre you tired of being promised a grape vape but instead getting “generic purple flavoring?”\r\n\r\nWell by some weird witchcraft and wizardry, we accidentally found out how to make that happen. INW Grapes is a good flavor already, but it really didn’t taste like an actual grape. This started off by picking three random flavors, and throwing them together. UnappreciatedRobot accidentally over dropped the apple to 3.8% and NoWar was gracious enough to join him in his blunder. What we discovered was that the this created a delicious grape inhale with a slight apple exhale. We were blown away by the fact that bilberry wasn’t showing up at all and we were getting a very pleasant grape flavor. We decided to mix it again as a 1-2-3 since that’s what we originally intended. The only change is that the apple also completely disappeared.\r\n\r\nSo, with that, we somehow fixed everything wrong with INW Grapes and now you can enjoy an authentic grape base.\r\n\r\nSpecial shout out to @Zany (Dico1337) for the name.",

Its so spot on for it and I have no idea if that's what you guys were going for, but that's what I'm getting and I'm really enjoying it.  Another big plus, doesn't taste like grape medicine.  Well done gents."
