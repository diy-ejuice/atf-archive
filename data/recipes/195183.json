  "description": "A fairly simple & straight forward recipe...\r\n\r\nYour up late on a Saturday night 🤪 and your dying to tame the munchies growling in your stomach 🥴 along with your desire for something sweet to feed that ol sweet tooth 🤤. \r\n\r\nYou think to yourself \"microwave mug cake?\" 🤔\r\n\r\nSo you mix up a cup real quick & on your way to the microwave the demons 😈 in your belly, coupled with your short attention span 🤯 & inability to wait 45 seconds to cook it take over and you devour the raw cake batter straight out of the cup!\r\n😵😵😵\r\n \r\n\r\nThis is basically my Battered Berries recipe (sans berries) tweaked a tiny bit 😉 so feel free to add whatever fruit (or other toppings) you might be desiring at the moment... & Enjoy! 😁\r\n",
