Packed with flavour, simple to make, and you don't have to wait long for it. It's my go to ADV whenever I'm not tasting other recipes or just waiting for others to steep in order to taste them. Great with coffee. I'll probably never tire of this one. My taste buds are shot, and find most recipes lacking in mouth feel and genuine punchy flavour, but this is spot on. Thank you man."

This is a ridiculously simple recipe that is ridiculously good.

The only reason I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars is because I think something else can be put in there. I'll try to put something in the next batch i mix (and I certainly will be mixing more) but I dont know which direction I want to go. Maybe some CAP Marshmallow for more richness and mouth feel or maybe some FA Cookie for more cookie flavor. Definitely a solid recipe "
