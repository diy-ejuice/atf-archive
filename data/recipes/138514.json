  "description": "A rich, thick and sweet banana honeycomb milkshake.\r\n\r\nWF banana purée in my recipe again shows how much I prefer it to all other bananas, it’s so realistic and gives a full mouthfeel along with that creamy custard which layers the banana beautifully this gives you the ultimate banana with a thick mouthfeel perfect in this sort of profile.\r\n\r\nThe FA milk,  TFA whipped cream and FLV frosting give that sweet and fluffy milk which sits there from start to finish, emphasis on the finish! \r\n\r\nThe VTA honeycomb even at 5% is not the star of the show but makes a great partner to the banana, everyone knows banoffee is a classic and Honeycomb is cinder toffee so say hello to the new classic combination ;) (al Pacino voice)\r\n\r\nThe Super sweet is there for my personal taste but keep in mind it is subjective and you can add and subtract sweetener from this mix and it won’t take anything away from it. If you like what I do and want to support me all you have to do is rate and review my recipes if you choose to mix them up :)\r\n",
