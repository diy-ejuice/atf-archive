    "description": "Having spent quite a while working on my DIY game by mixing other people's recipes, experimenting with percentages, building up my stash and mixing gear and starting to look into profiles, I have finally created something of my own which I feel is worthy of sharing!\r\n\r\nI have been enjoying banana milks recently, but noticed a lack of available banoffee profile recipes when a friend asked me to make one for him. \r\n\r\nI started off simple, but kept adding more to the profile until I had the complex beast you see before you (of which I went through 30ml in a day after a 7 day steep).\r\n\r\nI won't do a huge breakdown of all ingredients and how they add to the mix as it would take way too long, but would love any suggestions for improvement.\r\n\r\nInitially mixed with a milk frother in a warm water bath (not for speed steeping but because it reduces the viscosity of the base making blending more effective) in a 180ml batch, the recipe starts to get great at 7 days but is AWESOME after 3 weeks.\r\n\r\nGive it a try and let me know what you think! \ud83d\ude0a ",
