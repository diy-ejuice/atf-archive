    "description": "This is  my take on  a fruit lassi .  Lassi is a blend of yogurt, water, spices and sometimes fruit;  served cold.  \r\nVT yoghurt base  at higher percentages  can give you a some tang  which works as a nice contrast to the mango \r\nFLV mango  as a single mango will be able to stand up to the yogurt and the coconut  and  provides an authentic mango when added to creams \r\nFLV Milk and honey   provide some darker sweet  base notes  to contrast the vibrant top notes  of the mago and tang of the yogurt \r\nFLV sweet coconut holds down the middle  of the recipe and   helps bridge the darker notes and  top notes \r\nVT macadamia  nut and  ginger provide  some accent notes for the finish similar to  the tumeric or cardamon that is used in a traditional mago lassi \r\nVT sorbet has a  slight citrus note along with some cooling that is perfect for this mix to give the impression of a chilled beverage \r\n\r\n\r\nLOOKING for a group to learn about mixing your own juice check out these groups and youtube channels\r\nhttps:\/\/www.facebook.com\/groups\/diydownunder\/\r\nhttps:\/\/www.diydownunder.com\/ \r\nhttps:\/\/www.youtube.com\/user\/frank1360\r\nhttps:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=-0xkeZFSG04",
