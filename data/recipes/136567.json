  "name": "When I Want To Taste",
  "description": "Also known as Fuck Me Up. I originally made my graphic and wrote this recipe under the working title of Sick AF and then remembered the homie https://alltheflavors.com/users/matthewkocanda had rudely stolen that name over two years before I even came up with it! I knew it sounded familiar /s\r\nOn a related note his recipe called Sick AF can be found here (https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/22099#sick_af_by_matthewkocanda) and is awesome as well, and I tend to vape it when I'm actually sick vs. just congested. Great with a cup of tea I tell you. If you happen to find this post while searching for something to vape while you're sick, give both of these a shot.\r\n\r\n\r\nI'm congested, thank you sweet Jesus for blessing me with the gift of YEAR ROUND allergies that impact my ability to taste and breathe like a normal human being. I generally keep a 30ml of this mixed up in my steep cabinet for days when I can't taste anything else. I feel like vaping a complex or super tasty recipe when I'm congested is just a waste of expensive flavorings so I mix this stupid simple stuff. \r\n\r\nINW CACTUS at 2% is a little high for the average use, but it's mighty tasty and reminiscent and I love the hubbabubbaesque pink vibe I get from it turned up this high. \r\nWS23 at 0.25% is about as high as I like it save for total emergencies when I tend to crank it to 1%. If you want that coldness then by all means take it as high as you please, I'm not a cop. \r\n\r\nShake and Vape certified.",
