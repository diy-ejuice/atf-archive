  "description": "Crème Jeans....So good, it'll make you crème your jeans! \r\nI was going after a cookie dough base though I didn't have a cookie dough flavoring. So I used INW biscuit, Cap vanilla cupcakeV2, and CAP vanilla custard to simulate the cookie dough. I think it's pretty close. I also wanted to add a side note. Instead of using chocolate for a chocolate chip cookie dough, I used banana and banana cream. I think it's a well balanced pairing, although unusual, with a cookie dough taste.  Banana is not over-powering and that's the way I like it, hope you do as well :) \r\nMaxVG\r\nShake and Vape",
