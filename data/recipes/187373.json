    "description": "FUCK A PMTA or a Vape Ban\r\nSweeteners I used (Only thing i ever measure in drops)  :\r\n2 drop fw sweet for 59 ml\r\n\r\nSO i had tried Mango Berries by Coastal Clouds i liked the profile but for me it was lacking some citrus so i took that Mango Mixed berry pro and added it to lemonade first I started with my Mango base in which I used my two favorite mangoes atm (FA Mango Indian & FLV Mango ) The FA brings a slightly candied mango  along with FLV Mango which is a solid mango imo not too tart or juicy .With this i used my two favorite berries that i like with citruses (Flv Boysenberry & JF Blueberry). The JF is nice and natural but also slightly syrupy. I wanted to brighten this mix so I used the FLV Boysenberry which also accented the syrupy-ness of the JF Blueberry. FInally I have my lemonade base. Most of the heavy lifting is done by FLV Lemonade (Fucking love this stuff) which i accented with FA lemon Zest. This was kinda my tester for The Raspberry Lemonade (WHICH AGAIN IS NICOTINE RIVER\/RIVER SUPPLY NOT OOO) i used it to kind bridge the berries and the lemonade base which worked out. SNV all day Would love to hear Feedback \r\n",
