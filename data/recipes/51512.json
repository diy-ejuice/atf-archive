  "description": "Everything about this vape screams slushy. Flv lime is the perfect candied lime for this mix. Oba Oba adds a nice candied sweetness to help sell the slushy feel as does cap hibiscus. Fa mandarin just ads an extra dimension of citrus. Fa sour wizard adds a bit of tang and helps make the lime pop.",
