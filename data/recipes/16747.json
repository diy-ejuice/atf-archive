  "description": "Strapple Crisp Flavor Notes:\r\n\r\nTFA Pie Crust / CAP Cinnamon Danish Swirl\r\nTFA Pie Crust is a great foundation for the crisp crust, since you get the flakey crust of the pie ready to be layered on.  CAP CDS at 1.5% adds in the additional bread like feel with a hint of cinnamon that accentuates the crust.  \r\n\r\nFA Meringue / CAP Vanilla Cupcake\r\nI find that a mix of FA Meringue & CAP Vanilla Cupcake work together to sweeten the whole mix, but they really work well to sweeten the crust and bring a nice bakery style frosting to glaze the fruits.\r\n\r\nJF Fuji / TFA Strawberry Ripe\r\nThese fruits are the top notes and are pronounced throughout the vape.  JF Fuji builds on TFA Pie Crust / CAP CDS to give the “warm apple pie” with just a touch of bright apple fruitiness taste as well and TFA Strawberry Ripe comes through with the sweetness of a glazed/cooked strawberry note that complete this – Strapple Crisp! \r\n\r\nSteep 3-4 days \r\nDelicious!\r\n",
