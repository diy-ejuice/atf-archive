  "description": "I was at my local b&m the other day and the guy was raving about this juice. It was apple, pomegranate and blueberry. Weirdest combo I'd heard  of but I was interested. I took a few good pulls off his and it was surprisingly good! Not $20 a 30 ml good but good. So I went home and this is the first thing I threw together. It is a very pleasant s&v. The bilberry and blueberry give a nice vibrant blueberry, pomegranate is there and well the apple is there too. This is one of the hardest juices I've ever had to make notes on because everything blends together so well it becomes hard to even differentiate between the flavors",

      "text": "This is yummy. Pomegranate-Blueberry is an excellent fruit blend that made for an enjoyable vape, so that's where the five stars are coming from. That said, I'm disappointed that I'm not getting any apple for this. I wouldn't know it was in there if I hadn't mixed it myself. I'm sure it's working behind the scenes to help make this so tasty, but Apple is the A in APB and I'd love to really taste it. Please note, I didn't SNV this. I didn't get a chance to try it until it had already steeped for 4 to 5 days. So it might be there in a fresh mix. If you want A in your PB and want it last longer, maybe add more Fuji or bring another apple to the party.  "
