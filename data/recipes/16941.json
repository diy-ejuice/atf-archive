    "description": "So I decided to give this update it's own post because this version is definitely far superior to V1.\r\n\r\nThis recipe started as a one-off to Drunken Pears, but as time has progressed and the recipe has evolved, it definitely has taken a spot as being a unique and interesting profile. Expect heavy cream notes on the exhale, and an explosion of apple, pear, caramelized sugar, and sweet cream flavours on the exhale and aftertaste. Pairs beautifully with bourbons, stouts, and whiskey cokes.\r\n\r\nArt by me. See more at http:\/\/www.matthew-kocanda.com",
