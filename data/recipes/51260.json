    "description": "I love elements fresh squeeze, especially during these summer months. So I wondered, could I could improve on something I enjoy so much? I really enjoy it but I leave the verdict up to you! \r\n\r\nCaps juicy Orange:  I started with the Orange of course. I wanted a juicy sweet Orange with a hint of authenticity and caps juicy Orange is just that.\r\n\r\nEcto cooler type: this hi c inspired flavor works so well with Orange that it was a natural selection in my thought process. It adds to the sweetness and helps add punch to the juicy orange.\r\n\r\nShisha Strawberry and red touch: here's where the remix part comes in. I wanted something to add to the fruitiness without taking over the Orange and add a bit of juicy flavor to the mix and these strawberries do just that. I love these in tandem and they are just the supporting note I needed to give it a fruity inhale. \r\n\r\nSuper sweet: I'm remixing a commercial juice  that's known to have loads of sweetener. I believe I used far less than they prob do but got the same effect by accentuating the Orange with the strawberries and ecto cooler. That said still went 1% here. \r\n\r\nIn closing I feel I've remixed this quite nicely. I've spent nearly 2 months working on it trying different fruits for accents and different levels of sweetener to get it down as low as possible without losing that sweetness we all associate with commercial juice. I hope you will give it a go and leave any and all feedback. \r\nCHEERS!",
