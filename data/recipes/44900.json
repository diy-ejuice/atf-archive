I did use the sweetner per your recipe as I like my juice sweet also.  It's not sugar lips just sweet enough.  The AP is a backnote.  Enjoying this will be added to my ADV rotation!"

It was tasty after a few days like mentioned, but I think was MUCH better after about a week. It seemed to help the brown sugar meld into it a little better. I did not use the amount of SS listed, I do not like my mixes that sweet but I did include some sweetener. The AP gave it some good grit and a slightly nutty finish, but I had to look for it. I made a second batch and added 2% FW - Butter Pecan, to add a more nutty note, and the buttery part of that lends well with the ingredients you had. I think this is pretty good though as is, but needs more of a nutty ingredient to be called Buttery Nuts."
