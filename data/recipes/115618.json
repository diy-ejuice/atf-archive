  "description": "The INW - Yes, We Cheesecake is the best cheesecake flavor available and creates the base for the cheesecake trinity. Capella - New York Cheesecake is the first support flavor, bringing an additional note of caramelized sugar for the crust, adding some serious creaminess, and opening the bridge to vanilla flavors a bit more. Lastly, the TFA - Cheesecake (Graham Crust) completes the crusty undertone portion of the trinity and adds another hint of dairy. This trio can be used in any capacity to add an authentic and delicious cheesecake profile to a recipe. It's okay in a SNV, but I really suggest waiting about a week for it to come together. \r\n</lb>\r\nFull credit goes to ID10-T for the groundbreaking and delicious combination of strawberry flavors used in this. His description is more than sufficient: A unique strawberry syrup (INW Shisha Strawberry), a realistic freeze-dried strawberry (FA Red Touch), and a candy strawberry that puts CAP Sweet Strawberry to shame (JF Sweet Strawberry). This was used to create the semi-artificial strawberry topping for the cheesecake recipe. I decided to add some TFA Pie Crust to bring out the graham cracker crust a bit more, and deepen the profile to balance with the strawberry's tartness.",

      "text": "Alfred this is such a treat! It's brilliant! Off the shake the pie crust is very forward but after just 1-2 days steep it mellows out and makes way for the Graham notes and I taste a hint of coconut in there and I like it. All the reviews are 5-star for a reason with this one. It's a sweet, luscious and full strawberry flavour that tastes just like the picture looks. After a week I am finding it difficult to pick up the strawberry notes, due to either a) I'm a regular SB non-taster b) vaper's tongue or C) the SB has faded. I have heard non-SB tasters may have trouble with JF too, but it's such a good flavour! I may tried this with some of the OOO strawberries and see how it mixes up. But I've been vaping a fair bit of this, it's really, REALLY good. The cream whore inside me lusts for more more MORE but the reality is, it's a perfect recipe Mr. Pudding. A true work of art. Well done."

INW Yes we cheesecake has become my favorite cheesecake flavoring, although it lacks in the crust department, you fixed that with the cap ny cheesecake, pie crust and cheesecake graham crust. This has become adv for me, and I always have a bottle on hand when Im not sure what I want to vape. Great job!! Thanks for sharing"

      "text": "This is a really nicely developed mix. Most cheesecake recipes have too much or not enough crust element. The crust here sits nicely balanced in the mix. The cheesecake is pretty authentic and not overly rich letting the strawberries do their thing nicely right in the middle. My only criticisms are that I would lower the Yes We Cheesecake a little bit. It gets a little waxy for me much above 3% but that is strictly subjective. I might also raise the Shisha and Sweet Strawberry for a little more of a strawberry syrup direction. Again that's a subjective preference thing. All around this is a really great cheesecake mix that I'll definitely come back to and tweak the balance a bit to my personal preferences. Well done Alfred! "

Anyways, I seen the reddit post for this and immediately ordered the missing flavors, they came in the mail and I mixed it up. Right off the shake - its very strawberry forward, but you do get some cheesecake. After the week of steeping (I'd say it continues improving throughout the second week as well) that pie/graham crust scenario comes to the surface and really makes itself apparent, the cheesecakes do their thing, and the strawberries meld wonderfully as well (thanks ID10-T)- this is an ADV for me. Don't write this off because you think it's just another SnC variation - there is plenty of nuance here and puts the cheesecake trinity on grand display, covered with that semi-artificial strawberry goodness :) Keep it up Alfred.
