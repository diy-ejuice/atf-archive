    "description": "This is a spot on shoofly pie - so what is a Shoofly pie you ask ?  Shoofly pie  began as a crust-less molasses cake called Centennial cake in 1876, to celebrate the 100th anniversary of the signing of the Declaration of Independence in Philadelphia    The name comes from a particular brand of molasses, Shoofly Molasses\r\n\r\n. The dry-bottom version is baked until fully set and results in a more cake-like consistency throughout. The wet-bottom version is set like cake at the top where it was mixed in with the crumbs, but the very bottom is a stickier, gooier custard-like consistency\r\n\r\n As a  kid my family would vacation in Lancaster PA with a large amish community and they would sell wet bottom shoofly pie at road side stands, I love that pie !!!! \r\nfor this pie the Molasses and , butterscotch cream  pie  create the  main note .  The molasses is a brown sugar\/ maple syrup  and needs a a little body to support it  so the butterscotch cream  pie by WF,  along with the condensed milk to create that wet bottom of the pie. .  The recipe actually has a stick of butter  for the  crumble top hence the butter base by VT  combined with some of LB bakers touch to add a cinnamon for the crumble like texture.    The sugar cookie and cookie  are my go generic butter pie crust. and will also help with the crumble top .  This is an over the top sweet pie so it needed a touch a supersweet\r\n\r\nThis brought back some great memories for me - This is pretty much spot on  and  needs bout 2 - 3 days to really begin to come out and 5 days to get the deeper molasses notes \r\n\r\nLOOKING for a group to learn about  mixing your own juice check out these groups and your tube channels  \r\nhttps:\/\/www.facebook.com\/groups\/diydownunder\/\r\nhttps:\/\/www.diydownunder.com\/ \r\nhttps:\/\/www.youtube.com\/user\/frank1360\r\nhttps:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=-0xkeZFSG04",
