    "description": "Talking with Eric Buss (Squid Vapor LLC), he mentioned a savory custard tobacco, and that got me thinking of a brew. So this is my tribute to him for all he does for the community. \r\n\r\nLet this one steep 7 days minimum for the custard to settle into the mix.\r\n\r\n(Cap) Vanilla Custard - The main custard note.\r\n\r\n(TPA) Pecan - Added for that savory nutty note to compliment and take a little of the sweetness off of the RY4. I initially thought of using (TPA) Pistachio, but I thought that may make the recipe too much like Wayne Walker's Stacio-RY4-U with a hint of pipe tobacco added. \r\n\r\n(TPA) RY4 Double - Used here for that caramel tobacco note. I started at 3.25%, but it was too far forward. This version is dialed back to 2% with the (FE) Captain bumped up from 2.25% to 3.5%\r\n\r\n(FE) Captain - (Using ECX's description) sweet pipe tobacco flavor with hints of maple and coconut. I needed to round out the tobacco with a nice pipe blend, and I really enjoy FE Captain. \r\n\r\n(FE) Tobacco Absolute - Added to \"dirty\" up the tobacco and round off the edges of the coconut, maple and caramel notes from the Captain and RY4 Double.
