    "description": "This is my maple stone. It's rich and sweet and as authentic as it gets. Give it a week to grow and a couple more to be even more amazing. Maple flavorings need time to settle.\r\n\r\nIf you want something a little more pancake syrupy, you can sub TPA Brown Sugar for FA Butterscotch.\r\n\r\nThis is a stone, so it's not exactly made to vape on its own. Use this with baked goods, fried treats, cereals, and whenever you want that authentic sweetness without sweetener.\r\n\r\nEnjoy, be queer & vape on!\r\n\r\n[Photo Credits: William Allaway @ www.acadianmaple.com ]",

Question, is this scalable if I want to make maple primary and use other backround \/ top notes? Of course my next try will be another shot at French Dude.  Have to nail these remixes before they are pulled off the shelves.  Thank you for this. "
