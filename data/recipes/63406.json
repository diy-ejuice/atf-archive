    "name": "Berry Cobbler Ice Cream Situation Thing",
    "description": "Mixed Berry Cobbler with some Vanilla Ice Cream on top, and its kinda at that situation where the ice cream started to melt a wee bit.\r\n\r\n\r\nFW Wild Berry Cobbler - This is some seriously good stuff, but also incredibly linear. This is one half of the heart of the recipe (The other being LB Vanilla Ice Cream). Basically this is a bare bones cobbler with notes of blackberry and raspberry. In my opinion it lacks alot of body and fullness, which makes it a great flavoring to build upon.\r\n\r\n\r\nLB Vanilla Ice Cream - Most ice cream flavors either taste like the real deal or a basic cream to me. This one tastes like the ice cream as melted slightly and gives more of a milk\/dairy note. With VWC added, this makes a layer that is my go to for bakery creams. \r\n\r\n\r\nCAP Vanilla Whipped Cream - I went with this flavors mostly because it adds a subtle cream note, not that dissimilar to actual whipped cream, but also to give the recipe more thickness overall. It is a bakery after all, and bakery flavors should be thick tasting to reflect that. \r\n\r\n\r\nTFA Raspberry (sweet) - This bring the fruit notes more forward, since Wild Berry Cobbler's Fruit notes tend to fall off after a few days.\r\n\r\n\r\nFW Pie Crust - Acts similarly to how I used TFA Rasberry, however the bread notes dont fall as much as they get over powered by the creams. I find this flavoring prevents that. \r\n\r\n\r\nSuper Sweet is Optional, or you can sub for your preferred sweetener.\r\n\r\nTested with: Hadaly .25 ohm 22g kanthal, 42w, Smoant Charon.\r\nBest vaped warm, not hot, tight air.",
