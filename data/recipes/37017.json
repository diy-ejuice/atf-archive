    "description": "I've got a co-worker that vapes nothing but tobaccos. Problem is he found everything too sweet or it always had something extra, it was never just a straight tobacco. So one drunken night I whipped this up for him. Got lucky the first try and this has been his ADV since then. If you find yourself really craving the taste of a cancer stick or just have someone that is just wanting to get into vaping have them try this.\r\n\r\nThe Desert Ship and RY4 is what really makes the tobacco flavor that I think a lot of people miss, then with addition of the Flue Cured it gives it that slight ash flavor.",
