  "description": "Just had  Starbucks smoked butterscotch latte and thought I could make it better as of a vape. \r\n\r\nOakwood- slightly Smoky Woody flavoring Fantastic Four adding just a hint of smoke to the butterscotch along with boosting that butterscotch flavor.\r\n\r\nIrish Cream- just the perfect cream for this recipe,  very creamy and sweet Bailey's type flavoring just melds perfectly you with all of the other flavorings \r\n\r\nDulce de leche- if you follow me you know that I am in love with this flavor not only do you get a fantastic caramel note, it is also super dense and creamy.\r\n\r\nButterscotch- because she can't have smoked butterscotch without butterscotch ðŸ˜œðŸ˜œðŸ˜œ\r\n\r\n",

Im positive the original is awesome and one day I'll get the 2 missing flavors.  I subbed Brip and TFA Dulce at respective ratios.  The cream thats only coming the irish and in small part from the dulce is deep and that bscotch carries it well.  Massive flavor for a 10 percent mix with these flavors.  The oak wood sells the smoked part but for me adds like a subtle awesome back end spice that finishes the butterscotch.  I see you originally mixed this in 2017 and wish I would have found this back then.  Once I have the flavors you used I will mix that but for now this 30 isnt enuff!  Thanks for sharing!!!"
