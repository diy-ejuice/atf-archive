  "description": "Simple but nuanced cherry tobacco.\r\n\r\nHaving great expectations on Classic For Pipe Black Cherry (INW) as other Inawera tobaccos really stand out bold, a buddy and me where surpised to detect no tobacco! So I decided to add some, simply with:\r\nINW Classic For Pipe Captain Jack - a serious black tobacco with notes that resemble black licorish, but which blends with the cherry and steeps like a beast. Let it steep, it really comes out!\r\nINW Classic For Pipe Gold - bright, sweet tobacco to fill the gap between pipe darkness and the fruit\r\nINW Classic For Pipe Black Cherry - the dark, full cherry that gives some sense to it all\r\noh, and no Gingers where harmed during this recipe!",
