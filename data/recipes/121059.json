    "description": "Designed and formulated for drippers this lemonade has been my go to through the summer. Rereleasing because it somehow got deleted from my catalog of public recipes. Recommend this to any lemonade fans out there.\r\n\r\nINW Cactus: Typical reason for inclusion.. Beverage enhancing moisture.\r\n\r\nFA Forest Fruits: Can be subbed for CAP Harvest Berry. This ingredient contributes the fruit note to contrast the lemonade.\r\n\r\nFLV Lemonade: Country time sweet lemonade. Keeping it around the 3% mark avoids throat hit. Sweet and enjoyable.\r\n\r\nFA Lemon Sicily: Adds some oomph to the overall lemonade note.\r\n\r\nTPA Vanilla Swirl: Very enjoyable exhale component. Light on the mouthfeel, bit of a texturizer. Rounds off the berry notes.\r\n\r\nFLV Lime: Added for complexity. Contrasts nicely with the berries and lemon. Let it steep!\r\n\r\nCAP Super Sweet. Kept low to not overpower the rest of the mix. You can opt it out if you're trying to save your coils and prefer a cleaner experience.\r\n\r\n",
