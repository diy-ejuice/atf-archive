  "description": "After vaping Addy Tuney's pumpkin custard for frames janklin, I thought it would be a great base for an RY4. This strayed far from that inspiration, and turned into a spice cookie.\r\n\r\nI like using FLV Yam for a pumpkin, and Cap Gingerbread added the spice that I wanted. CAP Sugar Cookie added sweetness and backed up the bakery note.\r\n\r\nNext step was adding the tobacco and cream. Holy Holy Grail RY4 by DIYFS was my first choice for this recipe, as it isn't a strong tobacco, but does a great job adding a creamy caramel with some spice, but it did not give the richness I desired. After trying several cheesecakes, as I did not want to add another cream, I settled on INW Yes, We Cheesecake.\r\nThis is not a real sweet recipe, and you might want to add a little sweetener if you have a sweet tooth.\r\n\r\nI tested this in both an RDA and in the Zenith MTL tank with 0.8 coil, and I prefer this as a MTL vape.",
