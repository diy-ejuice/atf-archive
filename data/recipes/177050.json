    "description": "I really really like VT Mangosteen it\u2019s definitely easier to work with than FA Mangosteen which ends up tasting like some sort of body spray my fianc\u00e9 would use ... Vt Mangosteen is a floral fresh mangosteen (never had IRL) kinda like the mangosteen in that Snapple Drink , I took my base from Prickly Dragon and made some subs such as the JF Fugi and The VT Red Fuji Apple simply because I cant taste FA Fuji right now (Vapors Tongue Sucks) give this one 3-4 days and it really starts popping and getting refreshing but you can SNV Hope You Enjoy , Comments and Feedback is always appreciated.... Fuck any type of Vape Ban ",
