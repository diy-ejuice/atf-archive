  "description": "This was made for Mixin in the kichen red, white and Blue challenge \r\nthis taste very much like the OG bomb pops \r\nBLUE - The LB blue rasp with the cotton candy work for there blue rasp type of sweet and tart note \r\nRED - The grenadine is a a nice sweet pomegranate type syrup which I really like but it is sort of weak and is boosted a bit by the blue raspberry flavors. \r\nWHITE - the lemon lime soda and sorbet create that type of lemoade note - I really like WF lemon lime as it has bit more sweetness that I wanted then other lemon lime soda I have used \r\nRussian vodka is noted on the back end but it is very subtle as would be in a cock tail like this\r\nAdd sweetener if you like   - will bring out more  of the bright raspberry notes \r\n\r\nLOOKING for a group to learn about mixing your own juice check out these groups and youtube channels\r\nhttps://www.facebook.com/groups/diydownunder/\r\nhttps://www.diydownunder.com/ \r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/user/frank1360\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0xkeZFSG04\r\n\r\n",

I can't say it'd be an ADV but it is certainly nice for something different.  I do wish though that the sorbet base did not have cooling in it, Id prefer to add ws-23, as I don't care for the menthol-y note in that.  Could just be me though.  much thanks!"
