      "text": "Love this. I'm not sure that \"cantaloupe\" belongs in the description as I'm not picking it up at all under everything else going on here, at least not as a cantaloupe or even a generic melon, though I'm sure it's making a difference in the thick texture here. I'd knock off a star for missing cantaloupe if it were in the title, but can't be too mad about it only being in the description. I do get a blood orange and mango SORBET though - and that use of CAP Lemon Lime to make a sorbet out of it is working so much better than I imagined. VT Shisha Mango as a single flavor gives me a super ripe mango flavor that's kind of ruined by bit of a piney green peel note that I can see causing problems in a lot of recipes, but not this one. Here that green thing it seems to be covered well by the brighter citrus top notes or sort of folded in to the earthy sweetness that separates a blood orange from an orange, or both, or something like that. Whatever, it works. Tastes like a sorbet made out of a real, well-ripened mango. Nothing seems off about it even using flavors with notorious off notes. No waxiness from the Juicy Orange, for example. Some throat, but less that I'd expected from all the citrus in here. Terrific mix. I wonder how it would do with some coolant to really make it scream sorbet..."
