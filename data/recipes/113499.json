The ingredients give me pause and I don't think the recipe will create my newbie idea of 'buttah\" (fluffy, warm American definition of \"biscuit\" i.e. not a sweet cookie).  SNV gives me a cookie.  I'm steeping but I don't believe this is going to be a biscuit which is what I about the recipe would be if I went by the picture and the title. Obviously anybody with experience would know by the recipes that this is a Sweet Mix. So my comment are for new people like me"
