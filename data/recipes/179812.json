  "description": "This combination works as good as my strawberry basil recipe posted a few years ago, view it here:  https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/44489\r\n\r\nThe French Ice cream from Hangsen is absolute the top, combined with a little FLV Vanilla Pudding for some extra egg taste, and the combination of the different blueberries is rich and decadent, to finish a little FLV Basil adding that little spicy an cold feeling to the recipe. \r\n\r\nI understand that the Blueberry Cream RF/SC is no more available (some shops still have them) but it is essential to this mix.\r\n\r\nPlease remember that this recipe is been made to my liking.\r\nAs a mixer you should taste the recipe and adjust the quantity of aromas and sweetness to your liking. I just provide the necessary building blocks.\r\nEnjoy..",
