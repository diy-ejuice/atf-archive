Or is it something else ? \"You Galah\" ! , Pippa! lol\r\n\r\nWhat it is, is delicious AF. 17ml in 2 days since mixing it and not really allowing it to steep tells me I could be on to somesing. \r\n( I will steep the final 3 ml maybe lol)\r\n\r\nSeriously though, I wanted an Iced Vo VO in a vape. This is a simple yet delicious biscuit we enjoy downunder that is topped with marshmallow, jam & is dusted generously with desiccated coconut. Sounds simple enough right? This is a profile I have tried to do before but can never seem to hit the mark. I know many others who have tried as well and while may have come close have missed the mark as I have to. The challenges are the right biscuit flavor and texture, the right marshmallow, jam, & coconut while attempting to keep all flavors separated enough that you get the mouthfeel and nuances of each. \r\n\r\nThere are two heroes here that make this possible I think. \r\n\r\n1/ The WF shortbread Cookie teaming up with the JF Biscuit really work well together.\r\n\r\n2/ VT Desiccated Coconut  is brilliant in replicating that \"coconut between your teeth\" like experience.\r\n\r\nThe marshmallow was always going to be TFA as it offers a sweet similar texture to the real thing I find. \r\nThe combination to replicate the jammy stripe was a bit more challenging due to a non obvious jam flavour, however \r\npast single flavour testing has paid dividends to help me identify some similarities. The unlikely decision to use Purilum Raspberry \r\nlow at 0.5% was made by getting a final back note that is so reminiscent of the real thing on my pallet especially when combined with\r\nthe lovley Syrupy JF Sweet Strawberry & kisssed with VT Raspberry Jam. I will be interested to see how things meld over time here as I \r\nsuspect there may be some changes. However off the shake is very lovely!!\r\nGive it a go if you like & let me know what you think, am I a galah? Probably lol but I enjoyed mixing this! \r\nIf you mixed this let me know what you think, meanwhile keep mixing & love lots!!! \r\n\r\nLearn more about mixing here:\r\nfacebook - https://www.facebook.com/groups/diydownunder/\r\nDiscord - https://discord.gg/kH4Fqbc\r\nYoutube - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCTCwb7ULyfJALQlehomZZQA\r\nwebsite - https://www.diydownunder.com/\r\ninstagram:instagram.com/diydownunder",
