  "description": "This is a blue raspberry gummy. Modeled after the blue and white shark gummy candies. I went pretty heavy with the raspberries to cover up the red licorice the 27 fish brings along. The vanilla swirl I used to blend everything together and add some more gummy texture. Add sweetener if you don't find it sweet enough as it is. Doesn't really need a steep it was pretty tasty off the shake. Please rate and review if you mix.",
