    "description": "Beginner Blending Strawberry Cream Bull Shit Fuck You.\r\n\r\nI just wanted to stop vaping Smother U for a few days, and felt like something fruity for Monday's show. Another bullshit strawberries and cream. Mix it if you want, ignore it if you want, I don't really care. It's pretty alright, though. The Vanilla Whipped Cream and CAP Bav Cream is quite nice in here. Mouthfeel is a little strange so I might mess with that later, but for now, it's thick and sugary and the strawberries do come through pretty nicely.\r\n\r\n\"Fuck it.\" - Jerry aka DrunkLord aka BIGDICKMFER",
