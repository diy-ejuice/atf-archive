    "description": "Sweet Marshmallow ice cream with buttery clusters of cereal treats.\r\n\r\nIt's like cereal milk ice cream turned up to 11, has a thick buttery Vanilla marahmallow ice cream mouthfill with a soft a fluffy aftertaste, filled with grainy notes of rice krispies.\r\n\r\nFW VBIC + TPA Vanilla Custard + TPA Marahmallow : \r\nThis is our fluffy Marshmallow Ice cream. \r\nFW Vbic is just a fluffy vanilla cream, not much of an ice cream per se, and here comes pretty handy to turn it to a marshmallow ice cream.\r\nTPA Vanilla Custard adds butter, and thickness while TPA Marshmallow contributes with sweetness, stickiness and gives the marshmallow flavour.\r\n\r\nTPA Rice Crunchies + FA Pazzo Burlone:\r\nRice Crunchies are just Rice grainy cereal flavour from them we dont get much more ,but this gets even better with the addition of FA Pazzo Burlone, this one adds some extra bakery, milky notes that make an OK recipe turn into something really good.\r\n\r\nSuper sweet: with 0.5% and having marshmallow is enough but i use 0.75% as i want this heavy sweet taste like commercial juice has. Feel free to choose but marshmallow treat ice cream? This should be really sweet..",
