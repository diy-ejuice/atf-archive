    "description": "Profile: Banana with peanut butter and a dash of butterscotch\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nI landed (again) on CC Banana Yoghurt for this recipe, as the banana in this concentrate is seriously delicious! The yoghurt part adds a nice creamy and round taste. I find 3% just be just perfect for it.\r\n\r\nI found TFA DX Peanut Butter to go very well for it around 3% as well - although, it does need 3 days to sit as the peanut butter is very strong right after the first shake (but still taste good).\r\n\r\nFW Butterscotch at 2% has two jobs in this recipe. First of all - adding to the flavor of the profile obviously and secondly, it adds a nice creamy effect to the mix as well.\r\n\r\nFA Caramel at 0.75% is only there to boost the caramel flavor from the butterscotch a little.\r\n\r\nThe CAP Butter Cream adds two things as well to this mix - knowingly that it's one of those concentrates that tastes different from person to person.\r\nThe first job it has is to add a little bit of buttery effect to this mix, that'll help the TFA DX Peanut Butter to be a little bit more round in flavor.\r\nSecond job is to add a little bit of waxy texture to the mix for the mouthfeel.\r\n\r\nLastly, TFA Vanilla Swirl for a rounder flavor and to sharpen off the edges from the banana (plus adding a hint of vanilla in the mix)\r\n\r\nI recommend 3 days steep to make the TFA DX Peanut Butter and CC Banana Yoghurt to mainly blend in together as they are the main components.\r\n\r\nEnjoy and feel free to leave a review!",
