  "description": "Fresh, Creamy, Blueberry Yoghurt.\r\nUtilising Manson/Skiddlz' yogurt base, so credit to them for that!\r\n\r\nI was very sceptical about using 4% FLV GY, that stuff smells gank; but oh boy does it taste good! It's thick and luxurious, excellent mouthfeel. Coupled with the FA FC/Yogurt it makes one of the best full bodied yoghurts in vaping.\r\nAdded a solid combo of Blueberries, a touch of Sucralose to round any sour edges and boost the blueberries and voila!\r\nI prefer this as a S&V, the Bilberry isn't as strong off the bat in this recipe, but if you find it strong just let it sit for a couple of days. \r\nEnjoy x\r\n",
