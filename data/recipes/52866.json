    "description": "Similar to my raspberry cheesecake recipe just taken a step further. \r\n\r\nStrawberry ripe and sweet raspberry give that beautiful sweet raspberry flavor I can't seem to get enough of.\r\n\r\nBiscuit and sugar cookie offer up a nice sweet crust for the cheesecake to sit on.\r\n\r\nNy cheesecake is here for obvious reasons and yellow cake just adds a nice cake fluff to it if you will \r\n\r\nAlmond and coconut candy. The two that look the most out of place in this recipe. It never would have crossed my mind but before even trying to construct this recipe I looked up an actual baking recipe. Almond extract and coconut where two ingredients. I thought why the hell not it sounds good. In the first few testing days the coconut was way too forward. I almost scrapped the recipe and wanted to make a V2 leaving it out. But I was patient and to my surprise after about 7-10 days it fades somewhere into the distance just leaving a nice subtle coconut cream with a little nutty help from the almond. It's hard to explain until you experience it for yourself. \r\n\r\nI hope you guys enjoy this one as much as I have been. Give this one a solid week or more for everything to fall into it's comfort zone",
