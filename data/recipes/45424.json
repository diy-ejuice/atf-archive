  "description": "Morning Cup 2 is my go to recipe to have in the morning with a good coffee.\r\nIt's not too heavy, not harsh, not too sweet.. it's the thing which kickstarts your day without overpowering your coffee beverage.\r\n\r\nFA Up - well my go to coffee flavor, tastes like a good cup of dark beans straight out of my Bialetti Coffee Maker\r\nJF Burley tobacco - one of the lighter, slight creamy tobacco flavors, pairs well with the Butterscotch and UP\r\nJF Yellow Cake - boosts brightness, adds the cake into the vape\r\nFW Hazelnut - rounds out whats missing in Yellow Cake\r\nFW Butterscotch - acts as a sweetener, binds both the coffe and hazelnut together\r\n\r\nAdditional: \r\nAdd sweetener at 1% if you like \r\n1 drop per 10ml of Acetyl Pyrazine for this flakey bakery feel\r\n1 drop per 10ml Liquid Amber to expand the body of the vape",
