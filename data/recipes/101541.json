    "name": "Melons and Bubbles",
    "description": "While working on a refreshing melon blend for the summer, I ended up with not only a bold melon, but also a substantial bubblegum note- to my palate at least. This was an accident, and clearly a mistake born of experimenting with flavors I hadn't ever used before. That being said, I'm very much enjoying it as is.\r\n\r\nWorth noting- this is using TFA Honeydew 1. I have no idea how Honeydew 2 differs, and I strongly suspect that the honeydew in this recipe is what pushes it over the edge into bubblegum territory along with the cantaloupe and fuji apple. For this reason I recommend sticking to Honeydew 1. I also personally enjoy the high percentage of WS-23 30%, but it should be great at any percentage you like.",
