I wouldn't expect any substitutions to work very well \u2013 the three flavors here are fairly unique. FA Cinnamon Ceylon makes a nice addition if you like your cider spicier. Adding FA Brandy will give you a hard apple cider flavor. Play around!\r\n\r\nThe fundamental recipe is great example of building your recipes around base, heart, and top notes to form a cohesive flavor. Using only three flavors makes it simple to mix, and a great base on which to build your own personal adaptations.\"",
