    "name": "Perthshire Delight (Raspberry Latte)",
    "description": "We were doing coffees on SaturDIY'ing with Fresh03 & Friends and I've been working on fruity coffees for a friend so I figured I would tackle a raspberry latte first. This one is a winner, it turned out lovely and you can vary the darkness of the coffee without hurting the raspberry or the latte.\r\n\r\nINW Raspberry\/FLV Red Raspberry = my usual raspberry maneuver. It tastes like the real fruit and it holds its own.\r\n\r\nWF Brazilian Coffee = it's a gorgeous coffee flavor and the only one that I actually like. You can start at 0.25% and go up to 1% depending on how you like it, but beware it grows the longer it steeps.\r\n\r\nOOO Creamy Milky Undertone\/WF Smooth Cappuccino Cream = The latte and the froth, smooth and creamy. This will start quite milky and then steep into quite the coffee latte after a week and more.\r\n\r\nOOO Marshmallow (Vanilla)\/LB Vanilla Ice Cream = They're there for the mouthfeel, the buttery thickness and a touch of vanilla in your coffee.\r\n\r\nYou can absolutely shake and vape this recipe, but it will grow into more and more of a coffee vape the longer you let it steep.\r\n\r\nEnjoy, be queer & vape on !\r\n\r\n[ Photo Credits: www.nespresso.com ]",
