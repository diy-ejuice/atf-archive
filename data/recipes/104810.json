    "description": "A decadent orange cheesecake spritzed with a wedge of  fresh orange.\r\n\r\nThis is an adaptation of the Coop's Kiwi \"Cheesecake\" by @coop34 as posted by @ID10-T. \r\n\r\nI have enjoyed Coop's Kiwi \"Cheesecake\" for a very long time and wanted to combine the \"cheesecake\" base with something else. As I am not a strawberry fan, I tried a couple of fruit variants and finally settled on Orange. I used the original base and simply subbed with FW Blood Orange. Although this basic sub  turned out well, I tweaked it slightly to my liking, improving the overall vape experience vastly.\r\n\r\nFW Blood Orange is the undisputed king of oranges ant takes it rightful place as the star of the show here. HOWEVER it needed a little help to punch through the \"cheesecake\". In walks INW Shisha Orange... Just a smidgen is all that it takes to lift the orange profile, yet maintaining that unmissable, deep, Blood Orange flavor.  \r\n\r\nThe faux cheesecake is enhanced by a dash of cream and a smidgen of vanilla, which helps to fit the profile better. This simple adaptation works very well and lifts the original just so without detracting from its roots.\r\n\r\nThis does not need a very long steep and is good to go after 3 days.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
