  "description": "Was going for a clone of Crush Fruit's \"Sweet\" Eliquid. I'd say without the koolada it's dead on but I like the cool sensation koolada brings to the mix. The mix works great without koolada.\r\n\r\nObviously you'll want to use Lorann's Watermelon Clear.\r\n\r\nTPA Dragonfruit:\r\nUsed as a sweetener and blender to really pop out the candy watermelon.\r\n\r\nFLV Greek Yogurt:\r\nI spent alot of time over a few revisions trying to find the perfect concentrate to provide a slight tartness alongside a light cream to match Crush Fruit's Sweet Eliquid. It hit the mark for me at just a couple of drops.\r\n\r\nLA Watermelon (Clear):\r\nThe king candy watermelon (In my book), This is the shining light of the recipe.\r\n\r\nFLV Watermelon:\r\nA watermelon kick on the exhale was missing from the original mixes, After adding this as backup it completed the watermelon flavor throughout. It's a little bit candy (which helps in this mix) but is also a nice, sweet, rounded watermelon.\r\n\r\nCAP Jelly Candy:\r\nThis provides the mix with a candy texture. Any more and it would impart an unpleasant flavor. At 1% you get a nice texture with this ingredient.\r\n\r\nKoolada:\r\nOptional. I enjoy the cool sensation it provides, But the mix works well without it.\r\n\r\nI hope you enjoy it as much as I have been!",
