  "description": "This is a solid Popcorn recipe that is my husband and mine's favorite mix to vape right now. I recently ordered VT Popcorn and I may tweak the recipe a bit and try adding it in after I get it and see how it changes it but as is here, it's amazing. It is very much a true buttered popcorn but sweeter. If you like popcorn vapes of any kind I promise you will LOVE this one... You won\"t regret mixing it. No substitutions can be made for these flavors. If you don't have them, do yourself a favor and invest and order them. They are def worth the price tag. A little goes a long way... Mix, sit back and Enjoy THE MOVIE!",

It's a very rich and decadent vape that's really a bit too much to be an ADV but definitely worth going back to again and again.  "
