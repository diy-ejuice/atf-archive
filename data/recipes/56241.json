  "description": "Yes this has lots of flavors! Yes this has expensive flavors! But  guess what it is damn good. If you want a delicious blueberry pie then look no further.\r\n\r\nFresh Baked Blueberry pie filling:\r\nBlueberry muffin by Flavorah is the main link its a perfect cooked blueberry but it is a weaker of Flavorah flavors. That's why I had to go up to 3.5% with it and it still needed some extra blueberry love. So I used 2.5% of flavor west blueberry and 1% capella blueberry.  I know it seems like a lot but its really not. Then I added 1.5% of lemon Sicily to brighten up the blueberries.\r\n\r\nThe Pie Crust:\r\nApple pie by flavor art at 2% adds a good pie crust  without adding any apple flavor. I then used .75% of Flavorah cookie which is one of there more expensive flavors but for this pie crust it was the best match I tried flavor art cookie and it was good but not as good the Flavorah cookie gave it more of a cooked pie crust with a crispy edge if that makes any sense. I added .50% brown sugar and butter by tfa and .10% of Flavorah rich cinnamon to add that buttery cinnamon sugary goodness!! Rich cinnamon is expensive but if you don't have it you should have it because its the best cinnamon flavor and a 15ml bottle may last you 10 years if you keep it in a refrigerator lol.  The cupcake batter is more of an additive it helps the pie crust out and I think it also helps bind all the parts of this recipe together. I used 1% shisha vanilla because it works great in bakery flavor's and it just works.\r\n\r\nSweetener: \r\nI used .25% Flavorah sweetness because in my opinion its just a really good clean strong sweetener!!! But you can use whatever your favorite sweetener is and or no sweetener at all. The use of sweetener is a personal choice through and through.\r\n\r\nSteep Time: \r\nThis may vary person to person for me its perfect after an overnight rest but it definitely will get better and better with time. It seems like a lot of flavors but its really two parts the crust and the filling. The number of flavors just helps layer these two main parts into a delicious Blueberry Pie!!!! Mix up a bigger batch you won't be disappointed!!! Or at least I hope not lol....",
