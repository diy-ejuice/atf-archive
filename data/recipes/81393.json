  "description": "I’ve never tried SJM so I have no idea how close Wayne’s remix is to the original juice. I mixed it his recipe then added .5% RF Baked Bread because I wanted more of a toast note, which was gawd aweful. This is a strong pungent flavor that reminds me of stale malty beer. It was sensory overload,... The next day I mixed and immediately tasted that weird note again only not as strong.  Did some searching and found Shyndo’s bread stone, which uses Cereal 27 and baked bread at a 4:1 ratio with a dash of toasted marshmallow. I mixed another bottle  and added 1% cereal 27 and a few drops of toasted marshmallow that was good.\r\n\r\nI suspect the AP in cereal 27 calms down the funky notes in Baked Bread. With that in mind I mixed another bottle and this time added .6% FA Apple Pie.  You could probably use it between .5 - .75% depending on your taste. FA Apple Pie provides the much needed AP kick that rounds out the bread and adds subtle baked sweetness without the spice.  Of the versions I’ve made this is my favorite.\r\n\r\nIf you don’t have RF strawberry jam w/toast you could probably make it with a low % of Baked Bread and up the percentages strawberries.  This will be a work in progress, but at least I have something more enjoyable for my taste.  Thanks Wayne and Shyndo! Definitely a tough one to clone\r\n\r\n\r\n",
