  "description": "Losing sucks. But losing to someone you respect and forming a friendship out of it isn't such a bad thing. This is my tribute to Concrete River: The man, the myth, the mustache.  I set out two months ago to make something delicious that didn't taste like anything in existence. This is the concrete river way and also my penance. I don't think any singular recipe has given me as much trouble as this one. I had to don my Concrete River skinsuit and it took over two months of pivoting, tweeking, and crying in defeat. I have a newfound respect for the Concrete River mixing style.\r\n",

It reminds me of a blueberry remix of Fiestas and Fiascos (which is a GREAT THING)-- but it's the kind of remix that deconstructs and re-composes the elements around new ideas and makes something new and uniquely beautiful. Mixing up another batch soon, great work!"

The raspberry nestles in well alongside this, and that \"tropical\" guava/pink grapefruit that is the pink guava is there and helping things along. The hops...yeah, that just makes everything gel. &#xD;\n&#xD;\nThis is one of the best things i've ever tasted that has not existed until this moment.&#xD;\n&#xD;\nSeeing as this was my exact thoughts upon having Fiestas and Fiascos, I'd say you nailed the goal.&#xD;\n&#xD;\nBlueberry fans, fruit lovers, and people who dig what whole \"what the hell is this deliciousness that should have been a thing\" vibe? Mix this.&#xD;\n&#xD;\nAwesome stuff!"

The pink guava and raspberry give the blue berry a fragrant underripe note.  The hops give it a odd and tasty back note.  Very unique.  I would mix this again"

Now I can't put it down, it's become an ADV that I never tire of. This is a work of art that cannot be judged by the description or ingredients. Thank you Shyndo!"

      "text": "It's no Fiestas and Fiascos (by ConcreteRiver, one of my all time favorite recipes ever), but like F&amp;F, this is very different than anything else out there and also fun to vape. This truly unique recipe does taste like what I imagine eating a very underripe blueberry would taste like, but that's not necessarily a bad thing. As one of the judges who had to vape the recipe that he used to lose to ConcreteRiver in a head-to-head mixoff, I think Kyle has performed his penance admirably and is to be commented. Let us all rejoice that he can now shed his Rick suit and be Shyn again. "

This recipe is fantastic and completely different than anything I've tried in a long time. The ingredient list may look like Kyle drunkenly tripped and fell into his flavor stash and then tried to play it off like he meant to do it by grabbing a handful of bottles and yelling \"found em!\" but this recipe is somehow fruity, but not overly fruity.  Slightly sweet but also sour, and floral but not overbearing and still full bodied.&#xD;\n&#xD;\nThis hodgepodge of flavors reminds me of the spice girls. Without those five random singers a miracle never would have happened. A video of a topless Ginger Spice was leaked.&#xD;\n&#xD;\nThis recipe is Ginger Spices boobs."
