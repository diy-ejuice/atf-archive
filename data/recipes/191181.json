  "description": "\r\nhttps://youtu.be/DIOeo9azWU4\r\n\r\nThis recipe is soomething that i have been vaping off and on(MOSTLY ON) Since the beginning of all the covid stuff.  I am still not tired of it so thats something right?  Basically its a strawberry cream with some dark berrynotes and a little bakery with a light cream note.  Hope you enjoy!!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFW VANILLA ICE CREAM - Similar to liquid barns VIC it is sweet as expected from FW.  It is nto as eggy as LB and thats what i wanted here just a light creamy note to clean things up on the end of the vape\r\n\r\nFW BERRY COBBLER - TAMVAPES Turned me onto this flavor and i have to say i really like it...its a berry blend with some dark notes to it and a small amount of bakery on the tail.  For me it is a little harsh off the shake but steeps out nicely in about 4 days or so.\r\n\r\nSTRAWBERRIES -  The Juicy and Red Touch are a great combo IMO then i added the VT jam just to give some depth to the mix and bring some sweetness without needing to add sweetener to the mix.\r\n\r\nNOTE - Feel free to add sweetener if you want it  i have used it in this mix and its still good i just prefer it most of the time without.",
