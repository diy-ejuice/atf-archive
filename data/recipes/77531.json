  "description": "Simple yet good peach tea vape. SF testing JF Honey Peach I knew it only needed a nudge to make it tea, it has some herbal notes in the back ground leaning towards tea already. FLV Lemon Tea I picked up recently and hadn't really had time to SF test but I had high hopes and it worked out well. I did try laying a few flavors but its actually fairly complex as it is, JF Honey Peach has a lot going on without anything else added. \r\n\r\nIf you want to cool this off I suggest .5% FA Polar Blast or 1.5% Delosi Ice. WS-23 has an off note that gets weird here.\r\n\r\nOver night steep recommended. You can SNV but its a little bland at first.\r\n",
