            "text": "&#xD;\nIt is as promised, \u201cSoft cheesecake on top of a crispy graham crust with hints of strawberry and lemon.\u201d Also has a fairly prominent vanilla that wasn\u2019t mentioned. But it tastes good, some I\u2019m not really complaining. The strawberry and lemon are indeed just hints, like a small amount of lemon added to the cheesecake and maybe some strawberry puree added as well, or strawberry bits inside it, rather than a full-on strawberry topping. Has a lingering sweet finish that\u2019s very nice, even without sweetener. This isn\u2019t exactly what I personally want from a cheesecake, I\u2019d prefer a heavy amount of a distinct topping, but it\u2019s probably exactly what someone else wants, and I can\u2019t find anything wrong with it. It\u2019s a lighter, fluffier type of cheesecake but clearly a cheesecake, with a solid amount of crust, though the crust is a bit mixed in or emulsified, like a chewed up bite rather than tasting the layers separately, which also isn\u2019t a bad, since that crust can lend itself to a drier finish if it\u2019s separated while this is plenty moist throughout. &#xD;\n"
