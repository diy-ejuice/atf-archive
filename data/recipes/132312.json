  "description": "This mix is based on a commercial eliquid i had tried about a year ago,brought to me by a friend from U.S.A.Unfortunately,i can't purchase it due to regulations and restrictions about nic.At that time i had kept some notes that were left in a drawer,but that's all i had to work with.It needs steeping,not a snv by any means.After it has steeped,it reminds a dessert tobacco mix,although there is no tobacco flavor",
