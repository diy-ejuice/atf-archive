The first half dozen or so draws were marred by whatever that weird rubbing alcohol note is that I seem to get from every fresh redrip of anything with FLV Candy Roll in. After that it does taste like blue raspberry pixie sticks, but it was a little harsh. It does what it\u2019s supposed to do with just three ingredients and might be great for someone who doesn\u2019t have whatever bizarre issue I have with FLV Candy Roll, but even so it is a little light on the Blue Raz flavor and it seems like this could be done better with just two ingredients balanced just right, The WF Pixie Stick Candy and WF Sour Blue Raz Candy.
