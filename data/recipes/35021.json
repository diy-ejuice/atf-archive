    "description": "A nice desert tobacco vape, tobacco is more prevalent in this than the normal desert tobacco. I started this recipe years ago using NETs for the tobacco but here it is now in it's 100% artificial glorious-ness.\r\n\r\nNot much to notate on flavor usage here other than FLV Red Burley and FLV Cured Tobacco being two of the nicest artificial tobacco flavorings ever created!!!\r\n\r\nFW BS, CAP FV and TFA Marsh providing a different slant on the typical caramel and vanilla RY4 base.\r\n\r\nGood as a shake and vape, good as a mid steeper, good as a long steeper. Enjoy!",

Damn that's amazing!\" And those are mainly people who claim to dislike tobacco profiles \ud83d\ude09 This is a decadent, smooth, mouthgasm of a desert-y tobacco-y treat that you need to experience no matter your aversion to tobacco flavors. The cured and burley at those levels don't attribute too apparent a tobacco note, (if you're not searching for them) as much as they make you feel like you're eating a big bowl of baked, slightly caramellized, butterscotch pudding while sitting outside, in front of a blazing, aromatic hardwood fire. Excellent recipe, off to make a much bigger bottle!"
