  "name": "#REMIXMONTH - Twelve Monkeys - Harambae",
  "description": "This is my remix of Twelve Monkeys new liquid Harambae. \r\n\r\nTheir description of the profile is a tangy citrus unison of grapefruit highlights fused with lemon, lime, blood orange and refreshing guava undertones. \r\n\r\nThis was a relatively straightforward selection of flavours as the profile description is pretty detailed.\r\n\r\nI selected Ruby red grapefruit as I find this doesn't have a bad throat hit as some of the other grapefruit flavours and gives the sweet grapefruit flavour which I get from the original juice.\r\n\r\nI originally l tried flavor west blood orange as described in their profile description  but from testing the original I can smell cap juicy orange in their mix.\r\n\r\nThe Cap juicy Lemon gives a Tart lemon note with some zest from the Fa lemon Sicily.\r\n\r\nCap sweet guava and Fa lime Cold pressed pick themselves and I feel the percentages here just bend the grapefruit and orange flavours to get pretty close to the original. \r\n\r\nTPA dragonfruit is used just to help blend the flavours. \r\n\r\nThe original liquid seems to have quite a bit more sweetener than this so increase the Super Sweet to 1% to get closer to the original liquid.\r\n\r\nThis mix is good after a shake but best left a couple of days to reduce the inevitable throat hit from a citrus mix. \r\n\r\nHope you guys enjoy and any feedback or suggestions for improvements are welcome.
