  "description": "As mentioned in a recent episode of Noted.\r\n\r\nDIYFS Holy Vanilla and FA Cream Fresh put up a heavy vanilla base that's plenty creamy without coming across as eggy or too much like a custard. This creates a great framework to add florals as you like.\r\n\r\nFA Lavender and FA Violet: These two all star florals are present to boost the lavender and violet notes in INW Purple Rain.\r\n\r\nINW Purple Rain: Holy shit. This stuff is awesome, even standalone. A bright vanilla, with lavender and violet intertwined perfectly. At 1.5% it's the star of the show, and for good reason. \r\n\r\nThe goal of this recipe was to mimic Violet Pastille candies, which I think it excels at.",

I love florals in real life, I make teas out of them, I even cook with them but Im having a hard time finding florals I like to vape though.  Why does no one make a chamomile? that would be the perfect bedtime vape :)   milk and honey and chamomile zzzzz        thanks kopel for the recipe!"

I jumped right from using a little honeysuckle in this and that to this and it blew my mind. For me it needs a week or so to settle in. I am hooked on florals now and looking forward to trying more recipes from this floral genius!"
