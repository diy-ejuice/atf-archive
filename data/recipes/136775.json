    "description": "Rainforest is a sopping wet amalgamation of Juicy Guava, Honeysuckle, and Cactus. I get an absolutely saturated mouthfeel from this blend and I love it when i need a change of pace for a few days. It has seen a few different iterations with the three main ingredients at varying levels of dominance, but I felt this was the most well rounded and accessible. You can turn the Guava and Cactus down for a more honeysuckle dominant flavor that is pretty damn good too. \r\n\r\nThe addition of WS23 can add a whole other element to the mix and really transform it into a slushy type flavor instead of a more hard candy vibe that we get from the base recipe. I don't include it in the base recipe because it isn't for everyone. \r\n\r\nOur main note is the sticky sweet nectar that is CAP Sweet Guava, and it does its job of conducting the train of flavor well here. We get a lovely, wet, pink (heh) vibe from this at 3%.\r\n\r\nBackup comes from TPA Honeysuckle at 2%. This adds a sweet floral nuance to the whole mix without making this taste like sucking on flower petals. It bumps up the juiciness without imparting too much of a flavor to the blend. \r\n\r\nOur final bump of wet comes from none other than INW Cactus. The pink undertones play well with the Sweet Guava and at 0.5% it's really the little note that seals the deal and helps tie the Honeysuckle to the Guava. There is a noticeable difference if Cactus is omitted, not necessarily a bad difference, but a difference all the same.\r\n\r\nFinally a little CAP Super Sweet at 0.4% rounds some little edges and brightens up some odd notes that can arise after a few days of a steep, though to be fair I generally don't let the 60ml make it past about two days.",

It doesn't taste like what I expected it to, though when I see sweet guava anything I assume tropical and sweet and I guess in its own way its both of those thing, but at the same time transcends them as well. The cactus and honeysuckle work well together and tame the guava while elevating it into something entirely different. I don't really taste any one flavor in this, just something refreshing and delicious and with the heat being the way that it has lately I've really been enjoying it. Thank you !"

Maybe because im more of  a custard slut than anything, but this vape is a special taste bud opening masterpiece. My mouth waters just thinking about it.

The honeysuckle is just present enough to bump up the juiciness factor, but not be a very prominent note, and the cactus just makes it juicy and lush. A very excellent palate cleanser, and tasty as all get out."
