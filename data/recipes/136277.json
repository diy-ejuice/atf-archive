  "description": "I humbly present my first public recipie on ATF.\r\n\r\nThree flavors (really two)? No crazy layering or avant garde niche flavors? Yeah it's what I personally get from Burst Duo Guava Dragonfruit. \r\n\r\nThe OG undisputedly uses the sweet sweet god given nectar known as CAP Sweet Guava with 5% being just about right here. \r\n\r\nThe Dragonfruit aspect of the premium is a little more convoluted but most definitely contains TPA Dragonfruit at around 4%.  That's a bit high for this one in particular I know, but mix it up and see how well it works. \r\n\r\nCAP Super Sweet is of course optional but definitely adds to the candied sweetness aspect of the original. \r\n\r\nShake and vape certified and I have personally not noticed a whole hell of a lot of difference between a one day steep and a two week steep.",
