  "description": "Smoked Butterscotch Latte kind of what starbucks makes.\r\n\r\nVTA Coffee Milk Froth, Caffe Latte and Hard Crack Toffee each of them have subtle coffee notes; with them three we get that slight coffee note you get in this type of coffees.\r\nAlso each of of them add their own qualities, heavy delicious rich cream and caramel.\r\n\r\nFor the Butterscotch part 3% FW Butterscotch Ripple with 0.5% FLV Smoked Butterscotch and the added dark caramel/coffee notes from VTA's concenrates is all you need.\r\nNow our Smoked Butterscotch blend is ready.\r\n\r\nSweetness in this beverages is quite high so if you like sweet commercial style vapes as well as highly sweetened coffee drinks 0.75% super sweet also works really well, but i think 0.5% is enough.",
