  "description": "I never found a coffee / tobacco recipe I liked. They all were just a mess, either not enough coffee or not enough tobacco or just off in general. I found Connecticut Shade and knew it had to be the one. This is good S&V, gets even better after a couple weeks, but I'll say 10 days would be fine. \r\n\r\nConnecticut Shade:\r\n\r\nThis is a really interesting flavor to me. A slightly spiced, wet, and earthy tobacco, with a little cacao and bourbon. There is also some coffee here, and it meshes perfectly with dark bean. It's a little top heavy, but other stuff helps with that.\r\n\r\nRed Burley / Kentucky Blend:\r\n\r\nA perfect combo to give a little more tobacco, round out the Shade, and dry things out a bit.\r\n\r\nDark Bean:\r\n\r\nNot much to say. I started with this at .4, but it seemed to fade into / blend into the Shade too much, so I bumped it up. Nice bit of coffee without that awful burned popcorn.\r\n\r\nBourbon:\r\n\r\nThis is the bridge between the Shade and everything else. Shade can really take over a mix, and is hard to get into the middle. Bourbon does this really well, and adds a little warmth and bourbon for you boozehounds putting liquor in your coffee.\r\n\r\nDesert Ship:\r\n\r\nI like this stuff as an accent. Hell I even like it more as a main note. Here it adds just a little to the shades spices, and makes the bourbon not so bourbon-y. I know a lot of people don't like it, leave it out if you want, but it's quite nice here.\r\n\r\nEnjoy!",
