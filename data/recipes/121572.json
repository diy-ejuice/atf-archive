    "description": "This is my strawberry grape soda mix, I really enjoy this simple recipe - and after all the mixes I test and compare, I eventually come right back to this one, almost just like good old missionary - just kidding.  This is a shake and vape, you will find it starts off a bit more Grape forward, but then as time goes by you will taste the strawberry coming through. These two fruits just \"jel\" well together - I wont call it blending ;)\r\n\r\nThis is a sweet sugary soda...... yeah, I have a crazy sweet tooth. \r\n\r\nTFA Strawberry Ripe & CAP Strawberry Sweet &  TFA Strawberry = My syrupy strawberry stone\r\n\r\nCAP Jelly Candy = Adds a bit of texture, also adds some candy vibes to the soda. \r\n\r\nWS23 = Closest thing to a cold fizz you going to get.  (I used a 20% dilution in my mix)",

            "text": "I should have given this a review while back, mixed this like 4-5x now(Ialways have a bottle laying around). When I am looking for a sweet soda type soda, this is great, simple flavors most of us probably all have. I found an older bottle I  thought I lost must have been couple months old, and what I did find, the flavors are not as intense as snv or fairly fresh, is it turns into a nice grapey\/strawberry gum, and that\"s not a bad thing :). Need to start a new trend, as we have the trinities now, well, we could call this 2in1 vape, nice soda, then eventually turns into a gum(not sure when it did that as have vaped it upto 3 weeks before and wasn't like that, so guessing monthish maybe?. anyhow, thanks for the share and nice recipe"
