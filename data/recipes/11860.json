  "description": "This recipe was inspired by Cinnaps by Tear Drip e-liquid.\r\nI wasn't trying to clone it perse just really liked the profile of the e liquid the original is very bland and lacking boldness.\r\n\r\nThe profile is Apple cinnamon parfait.\r\nOn the inhale you get the strong apple flavor that stays through out the vape. In the middle the creamy yogurt and grain comes through, with the cinnamon coming on the back end.\r\n(Cap) creamy yogurt (Fa) meringue  (Tpa) whipped cream for the yogurt base,\r\n (Cap) creamy yogurt to get the yogurt started (Fa)  meringue to add a little body and sweetness (Tpa) whipped cream to round it .\r\n(Tpa) Apple and (FA) Fuji for the apple profile. I use (tpa) apple to get a red apple and (fa) apple to boost that apple flavor.\r\n(Cap) Sugar cookie and  (Cap) Cinnamon Danish Swirl for the grain aspect or crunch as it were in the parfait, I  used (cap) sugar because I didn't want an an over powering crunch, more a nice soft sweet cookie, but by its self there wasn't enough grain to it hence the cinnamon Danish Swirl to up the grain and to introduce the cinnamon into it. \r\nAnd finally FLV rich cinnamon this was added simply to give it a touch more cinnamon. As far as sweetner goes this is to simply lift up the yogurt without it, it's a little tart not horrible but it is noticeable\r\n",
