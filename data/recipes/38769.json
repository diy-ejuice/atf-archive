  "description": "This is the ice cream flavour i have been looking for the way the floral notes of the boysenberry bounces off the strawberry is something to put a smile on your face!\r\n\r\nIce cream base\r\nThe mixture of vbic/marshmallow/meringue/custard is something i have been looking for! I used to just use high percentages of vbic and it was always harsh on inhale and never really had the taste that i want in an ice cream the marshmallow helps thicken it up and helps mellow everything out\r\n\r\nFruit mix\r\nI have always had a problem with tpa boysenberry (bought it by mistake thinking it was the same as flv boysenberry, wrong!!) it has always overpowered everything so i decided to reduce everything down and its amazing especially when it plays off the earthy tones of the shisha strawberry really helps it along\r\n\r\nI have tried this as a shake and vape and its so good but i think its really going to come to life after a good steep for a week or so",

It’s still a strawberry, but it’s a mysteriously interesting strawberry, not quite a wild strawberry but a strawberry with a wild side. A lady in the streets freak in the sheets kind of strawberry. I’m not a huge fan of this ice cream base, though, as it comes across a little cheesy/overchurned. On the upside though, I got a couple of comments about how nice of a room note this one has.  "
