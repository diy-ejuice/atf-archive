  "description": "This is a cream coffee moose with a thin layer of cookie crisp bottom and a little bit of chocolate shavings on top and a chocolate cookie bottom. Using Cap vanilla custard FLV pudding  I build the moose/pudding type base. FA Cappuccino bring a sweet creamy coffee note and flv coffee adds a slight bitter coffee bean note. I used VTA Coffee milk froth to accent the cream note in the coffee part of the mix. Sugar cookie adds just a touch of a bakery note for the bottom layer of the pudding. I layered in just a little bit of Fa Chocolate glazed doughnut to add cocoa notes and the Cookie Crisp at the bottom in the moose/pudding mix & representing the few chocolate shavings on the top. Finally I added a touch of sour wizard to the mix because I like to add that sour note to chocolate in order to make it pop. The sour Wizard is optional but it lends for a good accent to  this mix and sour Wizard can be used at a higher % optionally to 0.50% and the sour note can be subbed with LA Tart and Sour if you don’t have FA sour Wizard. Tart and Sour has a different component as far as sour notes go but at this % it’s there as an enhancer rather than as a flavor note. \r\nI recommend 5 day steep but it’s pretty good with an overnight sit. \r\n",
