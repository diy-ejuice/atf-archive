On topic though, this is good but I wonder if it can be deconstructed a bit. I'm thinking dropping TPA's Pineapple and subbing TPA Reg Coconut for FLV's Sweet Coconut along with a low % of toasted marshmallow and possibly FLV cream instead of Cream Fresh."

Very well balanced pineapple kick with a little coconut and best of all, it doesn't taste like suntan lotion! (Although the smell is reminiscent in a very good way)&#xD;\n&#xD;\nI will definitely make this one again, and I'm glad I got 30s of INW Pineapple and FA Coconut.  If you don't have FA Coconut, get plenty.  It's a decently versatile ingredient that can be used in many popular recipes."

I am sensitive to coconut flavors getting peppery and this is smooth in there.  The pineapple is forward and the other notes blend in well behind it.  I have not drank in a long time so I was a little worried the alcohol note would be too forward, but it blends in fantastic and completes this recipe.  Spot on.  "

St. Louis better get ready for a whirlwind of absolute mayhem because I'm pounding back some PiÃ±a Coladas again. Well, I could have sworn I was. This stuff is as accurate as you can get in a vape. This is the real deal. The pineapple juice is perfection. The coconut is sweet and present, but where's the lotion?? Where is it?? It isn't here! Oh, right, it isn't supposed to be. I thought that was impossible, but leave it to ID to prove me wrong. The Rum comes through right where I liked it in the real stuff.. A good pour, but not enough to kick you in the teeth. That's what Old Crow and other miserably cheap whiskey is for, or so I was lead to believe. This has a smooth and creamy mouthfeel like it was blended by a professional alcoholic. This is great for the spring and summer. It's refreshing and bright. Mix it up. Why wouldn't you? This page of reviews might as well be the night sky. Cheers!"

The combination of TFA Coconut Candy, FA Coco and TFA Coconut hit your palate on the inhale and is without a doubt the right choice for this profile, giving the coconut the creamy smoothness without pushing it too close to the lotion boundary. The pineapple concentrates and the FA Jamaican Special do something wonderful with the exhale, imparting a boozy pineapple, that has both the sweetness and a slight bite you'd expect from a ripened pineapple, with slight rum undertones. The rum undertones do tend to linger on the tongue, but aren't unpleasant by any means. "
