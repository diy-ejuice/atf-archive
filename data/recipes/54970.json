    "description": "This is something i threw together really quick but it turned out really tasty and i am happy with the result.\r\n\r\nLA Lemonade: What else could you use for a straight lemonade base?It's nothing more or less and gets the job done really well.At 4% you can taste everything you need but still leave room for other flavors to come through\r\nINW Anton Apple\/JF Apple: Anton Apple is a really tart and green apple which helps out JF's Apple at the top end,while JF's Apple does great being the base\r\nFA Lemon Sicily: What would a Lemonade be without a hint of Lemon?Boring,right.It makes it pop even more.\r\nWS-23\/Koolada:It helps the authenticity being a cold fresh Lemonade coming out right of the fridge",
