  "description": "This is a the conclusion to a long hard fought battle in getting a 1-1 Mothers Milk clone.. enjoy.. \r\nThis is my unicorn clone and I've captured it baby!! This was nearly three years going back to it over and over till I got it down to vanilla custard graham cracker and sweet strawberry, but it was missing so much actual marzipan flavor.. The profile is more of a realistic strawberry marzipan than a custard to me, like the one from Ikea..\r\n\r\n*Please MIX IT AS DIRECTED make it 80/20 VG/PG\r\n\r\n\r\nMASTER LEVEL!!",

It's layered, proportionate, and subtly complex. The strawberry blends right into the custard creating this decadent and sweet treat with a little textured graham note on the bottom. It's all working in sync, and even the numbers make me happy. An absolute joy to vape. ADV recipe here. I faved it. Have you?"

But such a happy day because I can now make as much mother's milk in my own home. After looking at this recipe it all makes sense too. I went up and got a bottle of mother's milk and after a two day steep this recipe is so damn close I'll even say pretty much exact. Awesome freakin job man!!! "
