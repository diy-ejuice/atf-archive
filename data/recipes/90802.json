I hope she doesn't have an all the flavors account to see her fruit mixes name lmao!\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude08 Anyway all jokes a side this is a delicious simple bright fruit mix. Its great on a shake but perfect after a 24 hour rest. Nothing mind blowing here just a delicois mix that's not overly complex and a great shake and Vape!!! I used .25% Flavorah sweetness feel free to use a sweetener of your choice. This is not a mix that requires sweetener to taste good so totally a personal preference.",
