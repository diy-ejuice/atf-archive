    "description": "Deep fried banana slices, butterscotch and graham cracker.\r\n\r\nThis recipe is inspired by one of my friends favourite eliquid which is Fryd Bananas.\r\nI wanted to create one myself and not remixing the original but being close to the profile.\r\n\r\nDeep Fried Banana Slices :\r\nWF Deep Fried plantain is a semi cooked banana flavour with brown sugar and some spice but is a quite weak on the banana flavour and needs some more additions to be great. \r\nBut one thing i like is that after 2 weeks steep has some fried and bready tasting that is really accurate to the profile.\r\n\r\nSo to complete the Banana i added :\r\nTPA Banana Cream as its my favourite and also adds a good amount of creamy banana sweetness.\r\nAnd FA Ban\u00f3 to give more \"freshness\" to the banana mix as it is a greener kind of banana. \r\n\r\nWith this 3 we have our Sweet Banana Slices cooked in brown sugar. A bit raw a bit cooked, makes the banana closer to the real thing.\r\n\r\nFW Butterscotch Ripple: is my go to as its creamy, easy to use.. was obvious for me to choose this one.\r\n\r\nThe original FRYED on its description says : \" buttery cream\" but i prefered to use CAP Golden Butter to create that Deep Fried Buttery Banana.\r\n\r\nThe spice on WF DFPlantain is a bit non descript so to make it better the profile called for FLV Rich Cinnamon which is awsame, sweet , warm, strong .. its perfect.\r\n\r\nFW Graham Cracker: Bananas get better with graham cracker specially on the exhale,  it just makes them better, and here has a double duty, making bananas better and suporting  the fried, bready texture as well as giving a nice graham cracker after taste.\r\n\r\nYo can SNV it as its pretty tasty but its better when rich cinnamon calms down a bit after 3 days and waaay better after 10 days.",
