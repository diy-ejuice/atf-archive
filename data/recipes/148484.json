    "description": "Queen's Tea. A simple, yet complex and refreshing all Flavorah recipe.  This recipe shows what you can do with only 3 flavorings from one vendor.  Don't let the low percentages fool you, it's very flavorful.  There's not much to describe here except to say it's a green tea with hints of honey with a bit of milk and bright citrus tangerine.  \r\n\r\nThis can be a shake and vape but it's best to steep it for 2-5 days.\r\n\r\nI hope you will mix, comment, and or rate, it make us all better mixers. :)\r\n\r\nVisit Freedom To Mix on Discord https:\/\/discord.gg\/cMUjtPf\r\nJoin our Freedom To Mix FaceBook group https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/groups\/415341418920740\/ \r\nVisit https:\/\/freedomtomix.com\/ for resources and information on DIY mixing! \r\n\r\nFollow me on Instagram https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/folkart2000\/\r\n\r\nAlso, check out DEVELOPED!
