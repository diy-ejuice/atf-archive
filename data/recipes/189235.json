  "description": "Profile: A simple, and sweet peach soda. \r\n\r\nThe aim here was to make something tasty, but simple with the flavors that were in Puck & Iâ€™s Arsenal. FLV Peach + FA White Peach are the stars of this recipe, with the FA Armenia providing some support. For the soda I went with a typical soda base, or at least the one I use for most of my sodas. This mix does great with some WS23, really adding to that soda feel. While this mix is great without it, I personally add a bit of WS-23. This was a collaboration between @HumanPuck & @Ginko in live-mixing.\r\n\r\nJoin the discord https://discord.gg/ufVTyAQ\r\n",
