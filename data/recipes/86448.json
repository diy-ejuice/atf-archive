  "description": "This was the recipe that has kept me and my lovely wife off the stinkies for years now.  When I  first started vaping I wanted a flavor that tasted like a cigarette not a Strawberry, It's been 4 years and I now enjoy all types of juice, but you still have to have something to pair with the morning coffee and this Tobacco recipe can stand it's ground with any coffee.
