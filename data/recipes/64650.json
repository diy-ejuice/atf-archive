      "text": "Where to start...I've always considered recipes with more than 9 ingredients to be pretentious stabs at something complex by a mixer who didn't know how to properly use their flavors.  Then I mixed this up because it looked interesting, and there didn't appear to be a lot of overlap in the concentrates that were used.  Having said that, here's a simple review of a complex recipe:  It's delicious, it's vibrant, and it's well worth the time to sit and blend 12 concentrates together even if you hate spending that much time on one mix.  I love this, and I'll mix it again."
