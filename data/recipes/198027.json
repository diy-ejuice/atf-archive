  "description": "Think I might be on to something here . . . only problem is it needs at least 3 weeks of steeping time (set aside and just found it again, so that's why I'm saying at least 3 weeks . . . it could be great after 2 . . . not sure).  It's a lot going on percentage-wise and number of concentrates.  The result is a soft, natural oatmeal cookie dotted with chewy globs of strawberry jam and slightly spiced with cinnamon.  Careful with the granola and molasses . . . a little goes a long way.\r\n\r\nEdit:  Forgot to mention, both cookies (JF and FA) were an accident in putting the recipe into ATF.  I just went with it when I mixed and am chalking it up to a happy accident.",
