It was all a scam to get attention to his recipe. https://youtu.be/Bqrqntx-pnc?t=1h26m20s  Here is Enyawrecklaw explaining it all. I have it right where he begins to talk about cuttwood spy. With that said, it's still a banging recipe. UPDATE- I mixed this, and something tastes off. I have to figure out what it is."
