    "description": "There isn't anything too complicated here, it's a nice watermelon candy with a kiss of cherry. \r\n\r\nMB Red Cherry is pretty amazing, it doesn't have any of the weirdness that most cherries have. It's not a black cherry, it's a sweet red cherry as described in it's name. It does have some candy properties, but it will work well in a juice or anything else that calls for a bright cherry. Best of all there's no medicinal qualities. If you're a fan of cherry, you should definitely have this. \r\n\r\nThe watermelon is simple enough, the new CAP watermelon candy reminds me of watermelon bubble gum on it's own. I don't exactly want the gum, just that candied watermelon it does well. Adding some PUR watermelon helps push that candied note further to the top.\r\n\r\nThe TFA strawberry here doesn't lend any flavor. It's only used to help drive the candy home and give that cherry a boost. It helps the cherry linger on the back end of the vape so this is what remains after the exhale. \r\n\r\nIts solid right after the shake, but I always prefer at least an overnight steep. The sweetener isn't mandatory, but it's a candy profile so I highly suggest some. FW at 1% was perfect for me. \r\nEnjoy!",
