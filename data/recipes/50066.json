  "description": "I have never had this e-liquid but a friend of mine asked me to clone/remix it from just his flavor profile description. Yes it is actually called F⭐CK ISIS.  The description I received was a not real sweet strawberry, peach with a slight bit of cream and this is how I interpreted it. I don't what the original tastes like and unfortunately my friend still hasn't been able to try this remix ($hipping to Canada from the state's is expensive af) but this combo was delicious. Shout out Kevin Rosa from DIY Traders FB group who makes some dope ass coils by the way. Mix it up its a great profile.",
