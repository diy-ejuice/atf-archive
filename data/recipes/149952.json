  "description": "Ok, a lot of people enjoy my lemon meringue PIE so I thought why not build on that with a sequel... summer pie, a mixed berry meringue pie.\r\n\r\nThe base comes from my already tried and tested “lemon meringue pie - the best yet” the WF flapper pie and VTA LMT lay the base, I’ve used the tart at a lower percentage as to not get too much lemon, FA biscotto aids the base and then the berries consist of FLV jammy berry and FLV berry blend both of these combine to give you a sticky syrupy filling, because the tart has been used lower I needed something to boost that curd so I used FA premium custard, but only at 0.5% because I didn’t  want too much vanilla and it’s just the right amount to help the curd out. The Vta lemon tart already contains sucralose so drop the super sweet if you wish :)\r\n\r\nIf you like what I do and this recipe then please rate and review :)",
