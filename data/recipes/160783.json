  "description": "The goal here is to emulate a thick bready peach cobbler using only LB flavors. I feel I'm on the right track but I feel like something is missing. That being said, this mix is in my daily rotation and enjoyed by friends and family. I hope you enjoy and feel free to leave any suggestions if you have any.",
