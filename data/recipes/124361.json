  "description": "Trying to clone treat factory lemon glaze. 2nd attempt\r\n\r\nWhile my first attempt was tasty, it was off.\r\n\r\nCAP juicy lemon: 90% sure this is the right lemon\r\n\r\nTFA Meringue : This is what makes up the \"glaze\" I think this concentrate most closely resembles that glaze flavor I get in the original. \r\n\r\nTFA Marshmallow: Helps that glaze flavor. Sugary sweetness\r\n\r\nFA Custard: I don't know if there's any kind of custard element to this juice. But this helps add body and  helps bring out that slight vanilla flavor to the glaze\r\n\r\nCAP Super sweet: I've got this at 2% which is really high, but the commercial juice is SWEET. Omit if you don't like sweetener.\r\n\r\nV3 notes:\r\n\r\nAdded some FA meringue and cap sugar cookie. Theres a bakery element I think but its light and sweet. I think cap sug cookie could work. Going to give this for a spin and see if I'm closer\r\n\r\nIf the idea of lemon sugar goo sounds appealing to you give this a try. \r\n\r\n\r\nOff the shake this attempt seems closer to the original. Gonna let it steep and test along the way.\r\n\r\n",
