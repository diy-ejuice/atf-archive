  "name": "Cranberry crumble with ry4",
  "description": "I wanted to make something with a bite in it with ry4 as it always seems so cloying to me.  So added pomegranite and cranberry and then for a base creme and merengue and biscuit and pie crust and then added some toasted almond to make it more interesting and lemonade cookie because I figure cranberry needs a citrus with it but nothing necessarily strong.  I think this probably is going to be too sweet for me and now I'm wondering why I needed to put cremes in this LOL  Those might be cloying on their own.  I think I will start over - but this is where I keep my recipes and who knows maybe this will be great.  ",
