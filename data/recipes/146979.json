  "name": "Linzer Cookie (Raspberry Jam Almond Cookie)",
  "description": "Linzer cookies used to be one of my favorite after school snack from the bakery when I was a kid. Fresh wanted to have a trip down memory lane and this was what came to me.\r\n\r\nWF Almond Cookie/CAP Sugar Cookie/CAP Cinnamon Sugar = Gives the nice brown almond buttery cookie. Sugar cookie is the buttery base, Almond Cookie is authentic and forward, so Cinnamon Sugar and works nicely here.\r\n\r\nVT Raspberry Jam/INW Raspberry/FA JAmmy/Candy Wizzard = Pretty forward, the jam is dark and sweet, and INW Raspberry brightens it up nicely.\r\n\r\nFA Meringue = For sweetness, texture, and that little powdered sugar on top.\r\n\r\nAnd there you have it !\r\n\r\nEnjoy, be queer & vape on !!\r\n\r\n\r\n[ Photo credit: http://wannacomewith.com ]",
