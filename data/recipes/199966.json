  "name": "Boysenberry Cheesecake",
  "description": "FLV Boysenberry is a dark, slightly acidic, syrupy berry. It doesn't have many off notes and its easy to pick it out in a mix. It makes a really nice fruit topping/compote for this cheesecake recipe.\r\n\r\nINW Yes, We Cheesecake has a really good balance of both the graham crust and cheesecake notes. It's the most accurate cheesecake flavor available. It makes a really nice base for any cheesecake recipe. It needs a moderate amount of steeping for the flavor to develop. \r\n\r\nTPA Cheesecake Graham Crust doesn't have much cheesecake but it a really nice buttery graham crust. I like ALOT of graham in my cheesecake so feel free to drop this down to 0-2% if you're not in to that. \r\n\r\nFW Bavarian Cream is rich and buttery smooth. For me the dairy note is perfect for a cheesecake. It also has a really pleasant light vanilla note that i just love. \r\n\r\nFW Sweetener is perfect for cheesecakes imo as you get alot of the sweetness from the exhale. 1% is fairly sweet so feel free to adjust to taste.
