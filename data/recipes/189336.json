  "description": "The fried cake base here uses FW White cake with fw cake batter dip.\r\nI added LB bakers touch to help out with the pastry as well as add a little cinnamon as the first version was pretty blah.. it just needed something.\r\nOoo powdered sugar for on top and the Swirl to smooth it out and bring everything together.\r\nIâ€™m pretty sure funnel cake does not usually have a cinnamon note, but IMO this recipe profile needed a little more character for it to be enjoyable to me.\r\n\r\nThank you for all you do Vixens. Hope you are all staying sane and healthy!",
