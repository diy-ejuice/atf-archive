I tried this mix side by side with the Puckenade combo LA/FLV/Lem sicily combo. i liked them both but this one by kindground was a bit more about the flavor than the lemonade experience. Definitely tarter and gave me the room to add fruits to it to naturally sweeten it whereas the other combos were sweeter and got me thinking of how to add tart to bring it back down. This is great combo, kindground, and an excellent base for those who like their lemonades more tart than sweet with potential for add ons nand room for balance."

Zero harshness, zero floor cleaner. It tastes like a Country Time lemonade - fake lemonade made from powder mix - but with a couple of real lemon slices floating in it to make it fancy. My favorite thing about it is the way that lemony goodness lingers in my senses, kinda like having lemonade moustache. "
