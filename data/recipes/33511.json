  "description": "A sherbet lemon recipe I created while trying to replicate element pink lemonade it's pretty close but still playing around with it. It needs 30 mins with the top off after a shake \r\nLa lemonade was used as the main note but on its own it's a bit flat so I added a bit of fa lemon Sicily to sharpen it up a bit then I added the fa blackcurrant to bring them both together I added the marshmallow to thicken it up just a touch and take a bit of the edge off, sweetener to add a bit more sweetness along with the strawberry. If you like a bit more tang just drop the marshmallow it doesn't really need it but I wanted to create that thickness that comes with carbonated lemonade fizz that you get with the sherbet  ",
