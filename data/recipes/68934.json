Now, I have not tried any of the other ultra portables such as the limitless or plyrock so this recipe may work for them just fine, however, out of the breeze this tastes like absolutely nothing. Its a bit better with the mango at 7% and juicy peach at 3.5% Anyways I wont be rating this one today, but I do like a lot of your other recipes and they are all 4 and 5 stars so far. Keep up the good work."
