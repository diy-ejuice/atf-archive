  "description": "I stumbled upon the idea of making this recipe because someone asked me to make them a Strawberry with White Chocolate or a Blueberry Cobbler. Fortunately for me I did not hear the \"or blueberry\" part, so I set off to create a Strawberry White Chocolate Cobbler. I have never been so glad that I am hard of hearing because this combination transfered to vape form so deliciously.\r\nAt first I thought well this is gonna be hard because I had yet to find a white chocolate concentrate that did what I wanted it to do without tasting like wax. I had recently picked up Real Flavors White Chocolate and although it needs to be used at a fairly high percentage. The notes that I wanted are there and it has zero waxy flavor and the addition of FW Malt helps to boost the white chocolate note. Once I had that figured out the rest was pretty straight forward. I used the INW Shisha Strawberry and LB Strawberry to get the exact notes one would expect to have in their strawberry desserts. I created my cobbler base/bakery notes by using the combination of JF Biscuit, LB Baker's Touch, and CAP Vanilla Custard. That slight percentage of CAP Vanilla Custard brings in that concentrated gooey feel that we know and love in our cobblers. Then adding just little bit of CAP Super Sweet brings the entire recipe to a level of sweetness that I personally find perfect. If you like your dessert recipes sweeter or less sweet feel free to adjust it, as it will not effect the overall recipe. Right off of a shake the FW Malt is fairly forward but as it steeps it falls right into place. This recipe is definitely banger status in my opinion but wtf do I know hahahaha. So mix that shit, vape that shit, and rate that shit. Thanks peeps, enjoy. KRUCIAL outty.",
