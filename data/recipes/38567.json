    "description": "One of my co-workers asked me to try his bottle of \"Hulk Tears\" he had bought at a local B&M. Very nice vape... Tasted Watermelon right off the bat, followed by something a little \"green\" and sour which I felt may have been Apple or possibly Kiwi, then a subtle smooth vanilla creaminess, and just a hint of something else hidden in there adding a little berry color to the mix. \r\n\r\nThis is my inspired first attempt at what I tasted that day. It is by no means a clone recipe (maybe vanilla whipped cream instead of vanilla swirl), but it's close on the flavor profile, very smooth, and passes the test of \"Is it a good vape?\" with flying colors (I think). 30 days and 240ml gone, the guys at work are asking for more... Hope you enjoy!",
