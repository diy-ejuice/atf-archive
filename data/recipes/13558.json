    "description": "A remixed version of \"Claim Your Throne\" by King's Crown aka Suicide Bunny... This is another that is widely posted by bunches of mixers across the interwebs, so I don't know where to give original credit to... \r\n\r\nDefinitely don't think it's a real clone, but it's a tasty remix... Enjoy!",
