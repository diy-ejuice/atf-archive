  "description": "This recipe is a 7.1% recipe and does require steep. I am a very picky cream person and I have a hard time with Straight cream, but If I add a little pizzazz it works well for me. Eggnog was that perfect spice i was looking for in this mix because i wanted a little nutmeg. I used TFA Vanilla Custard and I'll go ahead and apologize upfront to those that get pepper from TFA custard I am not one of those people. I enjoy TFA Vanilla custard because it doesn't have a lot of that fake vanilla note like other custards and I find it has a very nice eggy note that steeps in nicely.  I used FLV cream to add a heavy cream without adding extra sweetness to my milk tart. For the outer layer of the tart I used a combination of FA cookie and FA breakfast cereal. FA cookie is my favorite cookie to build a crust and FA breakfast cereal has a very nice granny crunchy note that pairs well with the cookie when making a crunchy crust. FA caramel is there to accent the crust more than the cream but I find it to be what binds both of the layers. I hope you enjoy and please leave me some comments if you mix it. :)  \r\nThis recipe does require steep for all the flavors to meld together if your patient you wont be sorry that you waited. ",
