    "description": "This is an attempt to remix the very popular YOGI Granola Bar.  Folkart purchased this e-liquid and had a lot of good things to say about it, although he didn't think it was a true \"Granola\" flavor.  Having said that, he did really like it.  \r\n\r\nA huge shoutout to groceryboy_jr for his inspiration to tackle this profile. Check out his version at https:\/\/alltheflavors.com\/recipes\/206012#granola_nut_v_5_by_groceryboy_jr .\r\n\r\nDEVELOPED tackled this profile by going by what Folkart tasted in the original e-liquid and describing what he tasted to Nachef and MaxSavage, hence, BLIND REMIX. So, instead of trying to guess what \"oat\" flavoring might be in the original, the recipe was based on blind taste.  This is not a clone, but we think if you like the original, this will satisfy that same craving.  Mix it, build upon it, and make it your own!
