  "description": "This started with a picture and recipe provided by my friend Modivin in the DIY eJuice discord from BBC food recipes.  We decided to make sweet rice the star as this is a rice pudding.  The VT Yoghurt drink makes adds a citrus cream to the rice and the bavarian cream gives it some thickness and mouthfeel.  Next up was the accents.  Needed a hint of vanilla, pistachio and cinnamon so I used those recipes a bit low for what they offer.",

Pistachio gets enhanced by the nuttiness of the rice and seems to be more than just a hint. It’s coming across as one of the main flavors to me, along with the rice and sweet apricot, but it’s lovely. &#xD;\n"
