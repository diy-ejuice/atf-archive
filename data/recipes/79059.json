  "description": "A bowl of taro sticky rice, with shaved taro, topped with a coconut cream.\r\n\r\nI figured I would just derive this from @Shyndo and his Mango Sticky Rice recipe, mainly because it is already very similar. It didn't actually come from him, but after working on the recipe, its so similar, I might as well right? This is a mix you want to let and sit for about a day or so and then vape. The sticky rice does get starchy if you let it steep a too long. I still enjoyed the mix, but I felt it was much better early on. My findings also fit @Shyndo and his assessment on that as well. FLV Cream is used, to meld the mix together, while bringing only a neutral cream and mouthfeel. The coconuts that are used, are both creamy and sweet as well. TFA Coconut is not used because it is a little more natural, which is no what I was aiming for in a coconut cream.",

To me it tastes like something found in the bottom of a teenage boy's gym bag &amp; definitely not something that should be eaten or vaped lol.....must be my palate, I dunno....If you do enjoy taro, you'd probably like this, it IS a well crafted recipe though, without the taro, its just creamy coconut rice.  I can see it being nice with other fruits added"
