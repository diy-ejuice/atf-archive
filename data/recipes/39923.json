    "description": "A lemon meringue Oreo inside of Danish pastry crust with a cinnamon coating.\r\n\r\nRemix of Electric Liquid's \"Frequency\"\r\n\r\nFlavor Notes:\r\n\r\nCAP Lemon Meringue Pie is the backbone of the recipe. This is a pretty full flavor that doesn't need much emphasizing or influencing. 8% gives us a citrusy lemon filling that stands up to the chocolate crust.\r\n\r\nRF Cookies & Cream SC is straight up Oreos. I loved the VG version, and the SC is basically identical as far as I can tell. It's a lovely chocolate flavor to contrast with our filling. You got your freebie from the fine folks at RF, so why don't you put it to use?\r\n\r\nCAP Cinnamon Danish Swirl acts as our cinnamon dusting and doughy pastry part of the crust. The cinnamon plays well with Lemon Meringue Pie. Rich Cinnamon was a little too bold here. CDS left more room for all of the other stuff going on. 1% is all we need; any more and that weird Capella cinnamon becomes too much.\r\n\r\nFA Meringue is filling out the Lemon Meringue Pie and emphasizing that thick layer of cream on top. 1% soaks up the cinnamon and keeps that metallic taste at bay. Meringue doesn't seem to dampen the texture of bakeries and cereals as much as some other creams. That's good because it's tough striking a balance here between crunchy crust and creamy filling.\r\n\r\nINW Biscuit is just helping the RF C&C with a little texture. 0.5% pushes that cookie crunch of the crust a little bit more without interfering in the rest of the pie. (I would probably replace this with 1% JF Biscuit nowadays.)\r\n\r\n1% FE Lemon is bolstering the lemon meringue and helping push it through the Oreo crust.\r\n\r\nThis makes a really good shake and vape. Give the Super Concentrate a few days to settle though, and things really come together. This stuff ages like wine; squirrel a little bit away for a rainy day.\r\n\r\nHappy mixing. \ud83d\udc7d",
