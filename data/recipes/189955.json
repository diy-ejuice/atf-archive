  "description": "I love trying to replicate actual desserts. This worked out to be a Nilla Wafer and I’m super stoked with it. I put a good amount of cookie in this to dry is out and replicate the actual wafer. I used TPA DX milk (not listed as a flavor on atf) instead of dairy milk, however I’m sure dairy milk would work well. I needed that powdered milk taste to pop and calm down the butter cream from cap so it comes thru very lightly. The French vanilla deluxe comes in very subtle and just ties is all together. This is a drier e juice meant to replicate the actual cookie.",
