It works as well, but slightly different mango accent. It is not the boba I get in my country or my travels, but it is a well balanced, milky and amazing recipe.  And I just love the Green tea accent. "

      "text": "This is a little remix because I'm out of vanilla swirl and to get around the aforementioned 10 day steep time for the rice to become tapioca, so what I did was lower the FE Sweet Rice to 3% and add 1% CAP French Vanilla and 1% CAP Whipped Cream. Super fuckin tasty off the snv and if I'm not happy with the boba note in a few days I can always add more sweet rice. A banging original flavor, the mango is nice and realistic and definitely has that pulverized mango vibe, excited to see how the steep goes. "

      "text": "I found this to be a very tasty (hence the 5-stars) recipe, as well as an interesting take on boba tea and creative use of FE Sweet Rice. But, not without issues. I gave it a drip after the recommended 5 days and again the next day and what I got was not \"the starchy flavor of the bubbles\" - it was very distinctly rice-y, tasted like a bowl of rice with mango milk tea poured all over it. Definitely not unpleasant, but a bit weird and not accurate to the description. On the 6th day, I filled up a sub-ohm tank with it and got the same thing, minus some nuance. It wasn't until the morning of the 7th day, when I vaped the juice that had been sitting in the tank overnight, that it became more of a generic starchy note like those wonderful chewy tapioca balls, rather than a weird yet entirely pleasant bowl of rice. Unfortunately, tank-steeping made the mango fade quite a bit. Refilled the tank and we're back to rice again. It wasn't until day 10 that it the rice finally faded enough to lend the starchy flavor without specifically tasting of rice, and without too much mango note loss, so I could at last truly enjoy a better mango boba. &#xD;\n&#xD;\nTLDR; wonderful recipe, I think the recommended steep time should be doubled. Maybe things steep faster in Skiddlzland or my scale misread how much Sweet Rice went in there. "

      "text": "Phenomenal recipe!  &#xD;\n&#xD;\nMango done right.  The back notes many do not like with mango are greatly reduced in this recipe.  In full disclosure, I dropped the mango percentage to 1.5% for that very fear.  It is replaced with the slightest green tea hint, and it works extremely well here.  The sweetness of the rice is combined perfectly with the FE mango, and as Skiddlz says in his Reddit write up, cannot be replaced with another.  Fresh Cream brings it all together with vanilla swirl noticeable at the end.  Bangin' recipe, and a spot on creation.  Going into the daily rotation.  &#xD;\n"
