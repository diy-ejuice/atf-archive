  "description": "A sweet pineapple candy with a nice chewy texture, similar to those tasty, chewy candy cubes that are coated with sugar (like in the thumbnail). I wanted a very pineapple forward candy and I think this accomplishes that. \r\n\r\nPineapple - CAP Golden Pineapple for a sweet candy pineapple and FLV Pineapple for more of a realistic note but still candy enough to work here. TPA Dragonfruit just to fill in some gaps and still add a hint of Pineapple gummy.\r\n\r\nCandy - CAP 27 Bears is a great flavour, and seems to lean towards pineapple so I thought it would be a good match. FA Candy Wizard to add the gummy mouth feel and a great texture.\r\n\r\nI added a fair bit of sweetener here with .75%. I actually upped it to 1% early on in the batches but it felt a bit too sweet for my tastes. But, people who have tried it, liked it with the higher amount.",

No off-flavours that I can detect and none of that smelly sock vibes you can sometimes get from pineapple. &#xD;\nI sometimes skip the super sweet, but I like my mixes a bit more fruity and a little less candy."

      "text": "Delicious! And very close to those sugar-coated pineapple cubes, but just a bit too much FLV Pineapple. I’m still getting some of the more complex and odd notes from that flavor, hints of oranges and underripe banana, that don’t taste bad at all, but throw it off target. Maybe just a little less FLV Pineapple? And then another pineapple or dragonfruit flavor to make up the difference, if needed. Or just mix it as is, since it’s already so tasty. "

No i didnt buy them for your recipe but because I was getting tired of everthing else I had. So when i got them didnt know what to do with them. So I did a search and found this recipe. Its not a in your face recipe which is nice every now and then. I see myself vaping this on a hot sunny day when backeries would drag ya down. I know you have one day steep but I steeped 10 days cause I forgot about it. hehe. its nice smooth and mellow. I can see myself mixing it again. For that 5 stars."

      "text": "I didn't have FLV Pineapple, but used INW Pineapple instead, and it still tastes fantastic for anyone who may have my same predicament. Really nice and sweet, but not super overpowering that I would get sick of it quickly. I would give it a 4 stars with INW Pineapple just cause it got a smidge syrupy to me, but it's making me want to get FLV Pineapple. So I'll give it 5 stars. Nice take on a simplistic concept!"
