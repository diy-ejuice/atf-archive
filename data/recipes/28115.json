Halved the percentages, but I still get a sharp vanillin overdose (or something like that).  I'll let it sit a few more days and will try again. Maybe dilute it some more.  Smells delicious though.  Update:  Halving made it digestible.  Will reduce a little further though."

Not much rice coming through after a few days, mostly soft vanilla, milk, and a hint of spice and nuttiness. Simple enough to make the most of the two ingredients and the amounts are just right. Goes well with beer."
