  "description": "The popsicle that was made popular by the ice cream trucks all over the globe. They also go by the name Rocket Pops and Firecrackers, and I'm sure there's a few more names for them as well. These popsicles had a lemon/cherry/blue raspberry flavour, which i'm sure most have enjoyed at least once in their lives. I know Flavor Art has this specific flavour called Booom, but I feel that this is more realistic and layered. Please give it a try and let me know if this hits the profile. I am still going to try and get it closer, but I think it's close enough and I want to move on to something different. \r\n\r\nLemon Flavour - LA Lemonade / FA Lemon Sicily - The lemon from the BombPop gives me the taste of  lemonade so I went with this combo.\r\nCherry - FA Black Cherry - Not a huge fan of any cherry flavour available ATM, but I feel that this seems to work best.\r\nBlue Raspberry - CAP Raspberry / CAP Juicy Peach - This combo tastes like a blue raspberry to me, and apparently others feel the same.\r\n\r\nAdd WS-23 if you'd like, but you can leave it out if you wish or don't have in your arsenal.\r\n",
