I get a bad after taste and those two paired always taste the same to me and over run the mix with a \"generic\" taste again, just my palette. Defiantly worth a mix and a good one to play with and make your own!!"

      "text": "I've tried this with the chocolate and without. They're both good, but I prefer without. It's a thick, buttery ice cream with just the right amount of strawberry. The strawberry is bright and sweet, and it blends right into the ice cream. There's the slightest tang that doesn't come from the berries, and I think it's the Sweet Cream. That's the only thing that comes across off to me, but it isn't very noticeable. After all, I am a little sensitive to that flavor. I mixed 60ml and let it steep 4 weeks before trying. Really nice vape at that point. I'll likely mix this again and would recommend it to someone looking for this profile."

Wayne put a note up somewhere just not here. Very sweet and Gunks up my coils fairly fast,but i enjpy it regularly for the sweet tooth fix. Neapolitan icecream at the bottom after it mixes all up."

I got a very slight head ache from this, I personally just need isolate which ingredient it was going forward, probably the sweetener.&#xD;\n&#xD;\nThanks for the enthusiastic youtube channel"
