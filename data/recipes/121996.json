  "description": "So this is inspired by @TamVavpes   her goo in my butter cake.  https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/119884#goo_in_my_butter_cake_by_tamvapes\r\n\r\nI wanted to make an over  the top  cake that  I would love to eat  for REALS\r\n\r\n**FW sponge cake and JF yellow cake** combine to create a sweet  dense yellow cake base for this   mix\r\n\r\n**FA Custard premium and   JF dulce de leche**  combine to create a thick creamy  vanilla caramel dairy filling for this cake.  TPA  dulce  can work but JF just has more body,  flavor and no off noes it is just   easier to work with .  FW is a watered down  light  caramel with little to no body or dairy notes.     FA preium custard is  a short steep  caramel vanilla - ish custard.  (it does have dicetyl  so   FYI)    ISome get egg notes,  I cant say it is a very prominent and not something I can pick up  in a mix   \r\n\r\n**FW  Butter pecan and FW butterscotch ripple**  combine to create a creamy butterscotch topping for the cake\r\n\r\nThis is a little  bit of a steeper  the longer the better  but starts to come alive at 7 days   best at  2 weeks    \r\n\r\nAdditions: this is a pretty sweet cake and really does not need any sweetner.  VTA has a desiccated coconut that would work really well as a top  note  and is yummy.  VT honey comb is also a nice texturing addition to this mix and has a slight chocolate note \r\n. \"Learn more about mixing here:\r\nhttps://www.facebook.com/groups/diydownunder/\r\nhttps://discord.gg/kH4Fqbc\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCTCwb7ULyfJALQlehomZZQA\r\nhttps://www.diydownunder.com/",

I did not have FA Custard Premium so I used Capella Vanilla Custard and I did not have JF Yellow Cake so I used FW Yellow Cake and didn't have JF DulceDeLeche so I used FW Tres Leches...so I don't know if it will be exactly what you mixed but it is good for sure.  I will get back after the steep but I am already loving it.  Thanks for the Recipe   OK Steeped for 2 WEEKS and came back to it and I would say the recipe is EXCELLENT...oh yum..wish i had mixed more than 30ml but this should give me enough time to mix more now and give it another 2 weeks.  You really need the steep to smooth out the Butter Pecan, it can be harsh at first but it really becomes fully integrated and smooth over time.  Thanks so much for sharing this I would recommend this to anyone who loves a rich silky CAKE"
