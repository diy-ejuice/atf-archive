    "description": "March 2018 Mixers Club Submission\r\n\r\nPeach tobacco. This quickly became one of my favorite creations.  It is a top shelf Peach Cigar as @ID10-T described it. I was going to tinker with this some more but i love it the way it is. Going to start working on a v2 that isn\u2019t as heavy on the tobacco. But for me this is perfect where it is currently on my 3rd 60 ML bottle \r\n\r\nI loved Native & Cured by themselves when I sf tested them but I noticed that both faded rather quickly unless you pair them together or with other tobaccos. Red Burley the tobacco in it reminds me of Cured also get some woodiness from it. Virginia I get a good amount of spice from it. That and the wood from the RB go nicely in here to help the tobaccos stand up against the peaches. Went with FA Peach & CAP Yellow Peach because that is my favorite peach combo were the peach doesn't taste too candied.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

            "text": "Sure, there are a lot of different directions this could be taken in. Some vanilla might be nice. Some ginger or cinnamon to complement both the peaches and the Virginia. Something to make it a little more moist. But I also like it just the way it is. I like how the peach is both subtle and natural. Though it tastes like a fruity cigar, it tastes like a fancy fruity cigar and not some bottom-shelf blunt. Every time I try something new I learn something new and this was no exception.I had no idea CAP Yellow Peach was such a great flavor or could be used to make such a fine recipe. "
