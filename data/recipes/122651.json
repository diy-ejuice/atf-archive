  "description": "[Inspiration: Black Phillip by RuntDastardly](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/41466#black_phillip_by_runtdastardly).\r\n\r\nThis is Black Phillip's softer, more gentle, younger brother.  The shift to fall weather, the Halloween season, and the arrival of FLV Smoked Butterscotch necessitated the creation of this remix. \r\n\r\nThis is a smoky, fall custard.  In place of FA Black Fire, I used the much more forgiving FLV Smoked Butterscotch.  The result is a butterscotch custard kissed by tobacco and smoke.  Works as a SNV, but give it a few days and the flavors really come together.  Enjoy.",
