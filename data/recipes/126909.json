  "description": "Week 45 (The year of mixing) - Sweet and mellow coffee flavor with rich tones of buttery caramel drizzle, flavored with smooth hazelnut and light coconut notes, and topped with a dollop of whipped cream.  There's a bit of sweetness used here, you don't have to - it's optional - or you could replace it with whatever sweetener you prefer if you like your coffee's really sweet like I do.  If you're more of a black coffee drinker, you may need to add in something like FA Cappuccino at 0.25% or Tiramisu to bump the dark coffee notes up some, but this is far more a light and sweet coffee flavor.
