    "description": "\/\/ Grape Frozen Yogurt \/\/\r\n\r\nThis recipe was made for the DIY Subreddit posted by ID10-T about Grape recipes and improved from the original version based on the reviews.\r\n\r\nThis recipe is very straightforward and take ideas from a lot of already proven bases and formulas, but that once put together creates a delicious creamy frozen yogurt.\r\n\r\nWhile most yogurt recipes uses a mix of Creamy Yogurt and Greek Yogurt to get an authentic flavor, I went for the one that matches better with VBIC. Those two plus the Meringue makes a dense sweet yogurt ice cream with body and volume.\r\n\r\nFor the grape, TFA Grape Juice is not the more \"real\" and for my is more like a candy type of flavor, which is great but I use the kiwi to add a more juicy and less synthetic flavor from it.\r\n\r\nI hope you enjoy it and feel free to play with it and give your most honest opinion and suggestions!!\r\n\r\nv2: +1% VBIC \/ -0.5% Grape Juice \/ +0.25% Koolada\r\n\r\n(English is not my mother tongue; please excuse any errors on my part)",

            "text": "Something strange is going on here. 2% CAP Creamy Yogurt doesn't sound like much yogurt and 4% of that weak TFA Grape Juice doesn't sound like much grape. And yet, this is both yogurty (to a fault, IMO) and super grapey. My only problem with it is that I'm not getting \"sweet yogurt ice cream\" or frozen yogurt that's more like ice cream than yogurt, I'm getting a full-on grape yogurt with emphasis on the 'gurt. That's a little off-putting when you're expecting grape fro-yo and you get grape go-gurt. On the other hand, adding Kiwi to get better grape out of TFA Grape Juice? Genius. This is a recipe that has a lot of potential, and maybe just needs some adjustment in that 2\/2 Creamy Yogurt\/Vanilla Ice Cream base for more ice cream, less yogurt.  If it can be added without bringing along icky off notes, some cooling additive might be welcome here as well.  "
