      "text": "Edible's fuzzy faux peen is a soft and gentle counterpart to sharper strap-on renditions. It tastes like he was asked to make a juice that tastes like the end of a sweet Southern summer and completely arose to the occasion. Even at only 1%, INW Peach steals the show, but the watermelon and strawberry behind it give it a the flavor of a peach-forward summer fruit punch at first, and then Fuji hauls the peach on its back, carrying it further that it could go on its own and leaving a lingering Peach Apple Juicy Juice flavor that makes me want more and inspires me to explore a Fuji/Peach pairing with other additions in the future. Thanks for this deliciousness! "
