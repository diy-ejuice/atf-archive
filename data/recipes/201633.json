  "description": "Why be a Millionaire when you can be a Trillionaire?.  This is a recipe MaxSavage suggested based on a Miliionaire's Shortbread which is a shortbread cookie, layered with thick creamy caramel, and topped with a chocolate glaze.  It was a bit bitter off the shake, but let it steep for a about a week and it transforms into a nice chewy caramel, with a soft cookie base, with hits of chocolate.
