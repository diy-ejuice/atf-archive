  "description": "This is my entry for the Developed Flavorah contest.\r\nOff the shake this reminds me on smoking a cigarette during christmas time. It’s warm and cozy with some desserty cinnamon flavor and just a touch of apple.\r\n\r\nRicher after 3 days of steeping, I already see this as my afternoon vape during the upcoming cold season.\r\nWe all know the Flavorah Tobaccos. They seem to fade a bit after the first days, I‘m very curious about how they’ll come back after two weeks!\r\n\r\nI love the combination of Red Burley and Kentucky Blend to get a cigarette style tobacco taste.\r\nThe nutty rice-milk taste of FLV Horchata builds a great bridge to the tobaccos while its strong cinnamon flavor pairs perfectly with the cinnamon side of Flavorahs Apple Filling.\r\nVanilla Pudding smoothes out the edges of the recipe and adds some more body to the whole vape.\r\nI am really happy how this turned out, please leave some feedback if you try it.\r\n\r\nTested MTL on my Vapefly Holic RDA",
