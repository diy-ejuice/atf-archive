  "description": "Made for fresh 03  Saturday show    - the challenge is to  make an ADV using one  flavor line   - i choose  Wonder flavors line - and a variation of a strawberry cream mix \r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xofRrq0y-uU\r\n\r\n**NOTE LB strawberry Cheese cake is a  MARKER for   WF strawberry Cheesecake**   which is new WF flavor not listed in the  ALL  the flavors\r\n\r\n**WF strawberry Cheesecake** is a great balance of strawberry and  cheesecake   and does not really need a lot of help taking it to  the 4%  on its own  -  There is not a lot of crust  but it  is noted on the back end,  of the shake the strawberry is very front end and takes  a steep for the  cheesecake to come forward.     \r\n\r\nYou get the bright syrupy strawberry on the front   that transitions to the creamy cheesecake with a  buttery bakery finish   \r\n\r\n",
