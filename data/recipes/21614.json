  "description": "Not my original recipe; I'm sharing this with the blessing of its creator, /u/Coop34 of Reddit. It's a simple, beautiful balance of tart, sweet, and boozy and it is very dangerously addictive. Sharing because, when someone searches ATF for recipes using FA Kiwi, TFA Kentucky Bourbon, or TFA Toasted Marshmallow, this NEEDS to be in the search results.  ",

I've mixed it up twice, but both times gave my steeping bottles away to people I was trying to help quit smoking. I don't know what to say other than I just bought larger bottles of all three flavors, and I have a few versions steeping using other fruits. I'm also dying to know what the TFA KB &amp; TFA TM will do to tobaccos. Just beautiful. Thank you for this, Coop. This'll be in my rotation forever."

VG/PG 70/30 with 1.5mg/ml nic. &#xD;\n&#xD;\nSetup: Sigelei Fuchai Glo+Cleito Exo W/ .2ohm coils @ 60-70W.&#xD;\nDay 1: &#xD;\n&#xD;\nSmells fruity, a bit floral. Very green. Strong whiff of bourbon. The fruit is quite bright; I get gooseberries, grape skin, unripe plums and a hint of kiwi. The bourbon element is right up there, like hovering over a glass of bourbon and inhaling the fumes. Ever so slight heat and tingle on the inhale. Unlike any DIY liquid I've tried. Very promising.&#xD;\n&#xD;\nDay 3: The green, bright edges have rounded off considerably on the fruit side of things. The sharp grape skin/unripe plum/gooseberry flavours have dulled, leaving much more of a green fruit flesh flavour. I get grape and kiwi flesh, with a much more sugary sweet taste. The fruit flavour has dulled a bit, which always seems to happen with fruits after a few days, but the bourbon has warmed up and blended with the fruit and really helps give this recipe a backbone as the fruits mellow. The bourbon is warming and luscious, a really great accompaniment to what I feel could be cloying sweetness, had the kiwi been used alone. &#xD;\nInhale and first taste is all fruit, with the bourbon coming in and providing substance, heat and body towards the middle and throughout the exhale. &#xD;\n&#xD;\nThis is a wonderful recipe that I would heartily recommend you mix up, find a log fire to sit by and enjoy with a glass of Woodford Reserve or whatever your favourite bourbon is. It's Novembe, and this mix is perfect for those cold wintery days. I think I will be mixing this until Christmas and beyond. Thanks Coop!&#xD;\n"

It's worth trying simply for inspiration even if you think you won't like it. (It is amazing, btw)  Shout out to coop34 for this creation.  Thanks for the share ID10-T."
