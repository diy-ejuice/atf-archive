    "description": "This simple recipe is meant for low wattage MTL devices like the Juul and Suorin Air\/Drop.\r\n\r\nDon't be afraid of the high percentages of flavoring. These devices need triple to quadruple the amount you'd use for a typical RDA. This is a very accessible recipe as most people already have these flavors in their stash. \r\n\r\nAfter 5-6 iterations I really like this mix. I tried INW Pineapple and FLV Mango but when I pushed them high enough to saturate the flavor it wasn't what I was looking for. The Capella Golden Pineapple and Sweet Mango can go pretty high without getting all weird. \r\n\r\nI was still missing some depth, so I went searching other mango recipes. It seemed that people were using peach to brighten things up a little and fill out the profile. So I went with all Capella and used Juicy Peach. You can't taste it much but it rounds out the profile well. \r\n",
