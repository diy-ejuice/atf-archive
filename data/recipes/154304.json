  "description": "Labor of love this recipe turned out to be.. The percentages took some time to play around with inbetween each steep time for each batch.. I never look up other peoples recipes to see how they are doing with thier own for this type of recipe.. I prefer to play around on my own and if I am close to someone else that would be my bad. This recipe has been on my ELR for sometime before I decided to release the recipe over here on ATF.. Huge shout out to Daytime Frank as well as Tam Vapes for all the support they give to the communities..\r\n##You can catch Mixing in the Kitchen Sundays - https://www.youtube.com/user/frank1360/featured##\r\n##You can also watch Ohm Grown Alchemy Every Saturday 3:45pm EST \r\n##https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCDi_UubimriLWjel5Hr0pIA##\r\n\r\nVT Bourbon with Chocolate of any type is so good and adds a very slight boozie note to the mix.\r\nWF Coconut Custard is a huge versitile flavor to use and I like the coconut as it seems like coconut flakes and not a cooked type of coconut and not the sunscreen type of coconut.\r\nTPA White Chocolate is always needed with all chocolates to give back the coco butter to the mix and creams it up and takes off the shapeness of all chocolates.\r\nOOO Sweet Cream is a must with this type of mix to add the extra sweet creamy notes to not have a dry hit from the vape.\r\nHS Australian Chocolate along with the fluffiness of the VTA Chocolate Mousse great pairing and you need to try it for yourself to see what I mean.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
