  "description": "A blackberry Greek Yogurt with a little sweetness. \r\n\r\nI used to vape a Blackberry Yogurt from a company called Dead Shriners, pretty good stuff, but not Yogurt-y enough. So Since I started doing DIY I decided to make my own Blackberry Yogurt. \r\n\r\nMy idea with this was to make a nice Yogurt base, FLV Greek for the Greek Yogurt part, FA Yogurt to mellow it out a little and add some sweet creaminess and FLV Cream for even more sweetness and creaminess.\r\n\r\nThen add in my Blackberry, I went with Cap Black Raspberry after trying out a few others and not getting the taste I was looking for. \r\n\r\nThis Is my first recipe, I mean I like it, but you'll have to make up your own mind.",
