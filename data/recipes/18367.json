    "description": "Strawberry Applesauce (A Fluffy Vanilla Cinnamon Spiced Strawberry Applesauce).\r\n\r\nMy recipe for the DIYorDIE Mixxed! (Round 1)\r\n\r\nCinnamon Danish Swirl (CAP): at this percentage, the flavoring is used to provide the cinnamon spice to the applesauce.\r\n\r\nDragonfruit (TPA): this flavoring is the emulsifier in the recipe.  Simply put, it will work to bind all the ingredients together.  It complements Fuji (FA) very nicely and enhances the Strawberry Ripe (TPA) so that it is not easily overrun.  It will also tone down acidity while enhancing juiciness and retaining the tart element.\r\n\r\nLiquid Amber (FA): a touch of Liquid Amber will cook the applesauce and, along with the Dragonfruit, it will help to keep the juice tart.\r\n\r\nStrawberry Ripe (TPA): This flavoring is pretty weak even at higher percentages and especially when mixed with stronger flavors such as the ones in this recipe, it really needs help so I used Dragonfruit (TPA) to brighten it.  Its Ethyl Maltol content adds enough sweetness to the entire mix so no additional sweetener is required.\r\n\r\nVanilla Swirl (TPA): I did not want to weigh the overall recipe down with the use of a custard or a cream since applesauce does not normally have dairy in it so, I opted for Vanilla Swirl...because...it provides a beautiful fluffy base, a delicious vanilla note and soft mouthfeel.\r\n\r\nSteep Time: 5+ days\r\n\r\nIs it good?  While it's all subjective, I have been enjoying this regularly. While I am new to mixing and my recipe may not be perfect, I hope that my efforts won't go unnoticed.  I think the judges will like my idea. I do not have a ton of ingredients but I feel that I utilized them to the best of my abilities.\r\n\r\n",
