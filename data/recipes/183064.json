I need to taste freshly cut, sugared strawberries and whipped cream  in a Strawberry Shortcake.  As a Strawberry jam on cake it'd be 5 stars.  But, for me, this isn't a Strawberry Shortcake. "

This right here is an awesome strawberry shortcake. I get alot of cake up front (which was my favorite part, and is always missing from others) and then i get a really fresh but jammy strawberry that is really unfamiliar tasting to me (being that these are newer strawberries) that isnt completely in your face but is present enough. Doesn't take away from any other part of the profile. And then it leaves a very heavy cream taste on the tail end. This is delicious, thank you for another banger!"
