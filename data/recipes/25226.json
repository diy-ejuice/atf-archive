    "description": "GOOD GOOGLY MOOGLY!\r\n\r\nThis was the first recipe that I ever shared, it was on my ELR profile but decided to port over to ATF after mixing it up and remembering how damn tasty it is. It's a straight up milk chocolate. I can appreciate the % is a little high on the flavour side but it's not too harsh on the coils and is just a smooth, sweet milk chocolate. Originally made with 3% TFA Pistachio in there but figured it wasn't adding too much, but there is a difference with it so by all means add it in there, it's definitely tasty.\r\n\r\nI was originally going for a Chocolate Cheesecake \/ Mudpie but it didn't really turn out that way. I've played with a few different %'s and dropping flavours in and out and this is what happened. I must say it's more of a fluke than it is me being a DIY Ninja. But damn it's pretty good.\r\n\r\nTastes best after a 7+ day steep. Doesn't taste anywhere near as good straight from the bottle so don't be disappointed if you don't have the patience, it's not a shake and vape.\r\n\r\n",
