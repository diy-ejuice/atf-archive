    "description": "I was, once again, perusing Pinterest for recipes.....and I stumbled on this. The picture was soooo beautiful.....I had to find a way to vape it. \r\n\r\nI was also looking for a good use for WF Marscapone.....and I found it. It works perfectly here....twangy and thick, bolstered by the VT sweet cream. The cake was white in the picture so I choseWF Fluffy White Cake over FW White Cake because it\u2019s just so much better. Bumbleberry is perfect for me, but I can imagine you can sub it with another mixed berry at the appropriate percentage. \r\n\r\nI hope you mix it and enjoy!",
