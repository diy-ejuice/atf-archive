  "description": "My take on this overdone profile.\r\nSimply and accurate.\r\nBlue razz is hard.. at the time wf is the most almost there blue raspberry Iâ€™ve tried.\r\nThe addition of inw ras helps to bump up the blue raz in conjunction with the boyz preserves giving more flavor and some depth complexity.\r\nCap gahc provides the candy and a little sourness impression the juice needs.\r\nTpa vs gives the hint of vanilla and some body to the mix. Cap sweet candy  assist with the candy sweetness finish.\r\nLet this baby steep 4-5 days and it is ready to go.\r\nHope you like it.\r\nTo me it is very close to what I was looking for.\r\nThe picture speaks by it self I think.\r\n",
