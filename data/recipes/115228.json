  "description": "The inspiration of this flavour is an all time favourite of mine from the bakery, A scrumptious morning tea treat that is the Bee Sting.\r\n\r\nSo far i think I've gotten the creamy filling worked out and the sweetness of the topping but i'm lacking the roasted nut top.\r\nI've found that RF Baked bread has given this mix that baked note and parted a slight breadiness to it. \r\nThe TFA Brown Sugar gives a nice caramelised sugar sweetness that i'm enjoying.\r\nI've used Cap Sweet Cream and Golden Butter to try and create that thick creaminess of the filling and the addition of TFA Honey imparts a nice floral note.\r\n\r\ni will be continuing to develop this further as i'm able to, in the hope i can create something magical.\r\n\r\nthis mix will need 2 maybe even 3 weeks steep for the flavours to come through just right",
