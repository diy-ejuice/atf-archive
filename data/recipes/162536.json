    "description": "Profile: Sour melon candy!\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nThis is my pod version, of the original My Melon Balls that I made.\r\nIt's not quite as strong as the original, as that one is made for high powered devices, but it works tremendously in a pod!\r\n\r\nI took out the CAP Sweet Guava as the original has, as it didn't really come through in the pod at all.\r\nI upped the melons and the powdered sugar a tad to boost them for the flavor in a low powered device, and at the same down taking the WF Sour Vall Candy SC down a little, to not dominate the melons too much.\r\n\r\nAll in all, this tastes amazing in a pod device!\r\n\r\nFeel free to check out the original for high powered devices.\r\n\r\nEnjoy!",

            "text": "Hell yes! I've never had a sour melon ball candy but I imagine this is exactly what one would taste like. Mixed at 25mg salt nic 50\/50 VG\/PG for my Caliburn. Plenty of tangy-sweet, satisfying melon flavor with a candied base, which is hard to do in this dinky little device. Surprisingly sweet without sweetener, especially in this set-up, which is great, because (presumably) it won't tank by pod so fast and things that rely on Super Sweet. It really does taste amazing. I needed a break from my own failed attempts at pod recipes so I gave this a try and I'm so glad I did. "
