  "name": "Spearing Mint, Creamy Concoction",
  "description": "I wanted a slight spearmint note with a sweetened heavy cream.  This is my attempt at it, and really my first attempt at making my own recipe period.  I really dig this.  It is great right off the shake, in fact, I almost prefer it right off the shake as you get a little bit more of the New York Cheesecake.  Delicious.  It steeps nicely and the mint does fade, but I still find it an enjoyable all day vape.  \r\n\r\nI wish I could give you more information about why I choose this flavor for this reason, but I'm really not into single flavor tasting.  I just used the flavors that I have acquired from research. . . and recipes I've bought for.  Watching Noted in particular and listening to what flavors ranked and what they could do brought me to this list for this recipe.  I had intended to take the long road and alter percentages and try alternative flavors, but to be honest. . . . I really like this as it stands.\r\n\r\nThe one thing I can say is that the mint is mild in this.  I might bump it up a .25% when I mix it next, but for the most part I think these are spot on for my taste and what I was going for.\r\n\r\nIf you do indeed try this recipe out, I encourage you to try it as it steeps.  The changes in flavor are quite nice and really change from day to day.",
