    "description": "Boba  teas  (also known as  Bubble tea, or Boba milk, boba slushie)   is a  sweet milk, juice or tea based beverage  that has tapioca balls.  Tapioca balls (boba) are the prevailing chewy tidbits in bubble tea, but a wide range of other options can be used to add similar starchy texture to the drink.     Popping Boba are sphere-shaped and have fruit juices or syrups inside of them.  This is a spot on boba milk  to me -\r\n**if you want to add  tea  I would recommend FLV  black tea from 1% - 1.2%   for a darker base note or FLV green tea at .75%  to 1.00% for a lighter tea note**\r\n\r\n**VT mango juice and VT Passion**   are a great combo for this  beverage ,  it creates a thick juicy syrup that is typical of  Boba milk. beverage.   and the VT Mango Juice  flavor increases over 3 - 7 days  ( you can sub for FLV mango but it does not have some of the syrup flavor notes that Juice Mango)\r\n**pur  condensed milk** Boba teas will often use a condensed milk to add body and sweetness to  the beverage  and pur condensed milk is  perfect for this  (and it really cant not be subed  in this mix)  **FLV sweet coconut**  adds some additional  tropical notes that  helped bridge the bright fruit to some of the dairy  flavors in this mix ,and acts like a bit of an emulsifier \r\n**VT Rice Base**  is  ideal to add some texture and  starch notes to this mix that is  similar to   what tapioca  will provide in a boba tea  \r\n**INW shisha vanilla**    adds some bright vanilla top notes and additional creamy body\r\nADD sweetner to your taste I used FLV sweetness @ .30   \r\n\r\n\"Learn more about mixing here:\r\nhttps:\/\/www.facebook.com\/groups\/diydownunder\/\r\nhttps:\/\/discord.gg\/kH4Fqbc\r\nhttps:\/\/www.youtube.com\/channel\/UCTCwb7ULyfJALQlehomZZQA\r\nhttps:\/\/www.diydownunder.com\/\r\nHave you tried this recipe?!\r\nPlease rate this recipe and comment below!
