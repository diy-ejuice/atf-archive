  "description": "#####**Description & Setup**\r\nI've been vaping a lot of blue lately. Blue Raspberries, Blueberries, Blue Everything! I decided I wanted to stray from that and make something for my pasito that reminded me of summertime and felt refreshing, so here's my peach lemonade! Sweet, cool lemonade on inhale with a nice peach on exhale. SnV Certified\r\n\r\nTested on a Smoant Pasito RBA Deck, 6 wraps 28g SS round wire, 20w @ 25mg/mL\r\n\r\n#####**Notes**\r\n**LA Lemonade** - My all-time favourite lemonade to use in mixes. I find it to be really reminiscent of country time lemonade, and it works perfectly for making a sweeter lemonade. I found it to be perfect in MTL systems at 6% in this recipe. \r\n\r\n**INW Lemon Mix** - This really helps support LA Lemonade and puts in the tang that is missing. It rounds out the whole lemonade base and is one of the best lemonade combinations I've tried hands down. I used this at 0.5% because all I want it to do is accent LA Lemonade.\r\n\r\n**JF Honey Peach** - One of my favourite peaches, its a somewhat fleshy, ripe, and juicy peach. It's slightly sweet but has a tartness to it that really sell the peach flavour overall. I used this at 2.5% because this is where I found the peach notes really came through on my pasito. \r\n\r\n**FA Peach White** - This is the perfect additive to add onto JF Honey Peach. It rounds out the whole peach and makes it more believable. This concentrate is another peach that is juice and ripe, but also is a tad more sweet to me. I use this at 1% as this is where I found it assisted JF Honey Peach the best.\r\n\r\n**WS-23** - Lemonade needs to be cold! You can adjust the % of this if you want, but I found 0.75% in my pasito was enough for me. \r\n\r\nHope you enjoy! Please leave a review if you try out the recipe :)",

      "text": "Really good peach lemonade, especially for use in pod devices! Everything comes through pretty well which I was a little worried about. The only reason this gets 4 stars instead of 5 is because the lemonade seems to fade after a a few days, which LA Lemonade is known to do and is an issue when the juice is designed for a pod. Might be able to fix this by adding a bit of something like FLV Lemonade. "
