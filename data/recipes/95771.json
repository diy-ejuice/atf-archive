  "description": "This simple mix is addictive AF, hence the name, Cookie Crack.\r\n\r\nBasically,  1% FLV Cookie Dough and 4% CAP Sugar Cookie make up the cookie base. I find Sugar Cookie intolerable over 4% (too spicy) but it blends in nicely with FLV Cookie Dough here. \r\n\r\nNow for the crack part. FW Butter Pecan has that cinema popcorn butter flavour I love. It also has hints of nutty pecan which is highly addictive;  you keep wanting more. At 3% it tames the Sugar Cookie and backgrounds the whole mix, bathes it in nutty buterry goodness. FW Hazelnut enhances the mix ( it should always be mixed with Cookie Dough IMO as it brings out its slight chocolate notes). Finally 1.5% Vanilla Custard is the blending cream but also keeps the mix buttery and moist to give you that satisfying mouthfeel as you exhale.\r\n\r\n0.35% FLV Sweetness \r\nSweetener is essential for this recipe as I find Cookie Dough and Sugar Cookie need a sweetness boost to excel in any recipe. \r\n\r\nThis is nice as a S& V but it really takes 5 days for the cookie dough to blend in and peep through.\r\n",
