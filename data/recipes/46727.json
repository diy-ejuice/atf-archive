  "description": "In this recipe, I needed to create 3 layers: A cream to boost the spongeyness and frosting feeling of the cake, a cake layer, and the citrus layer.\r\nFor the cream layer, I use Bavarian cream to add density and complexity to the texture of the cake, and whipped cream to add the frosting-feel.\r\nFor the cake, I use Pound cake for the sweetness and authenticity it has, and the FA Pandoro because I think it has a slight citrus taste that really works well with the lemon.\r\nIn the citrus base I use lemon sicily for the bulk of the flavor, blood orange to alter the lemon a little and make it less \"lemonade\" tasting.",

This is pretty authentic to a lemon poundcake that grandma would have made back in the day."
