The cookie dough in it might be a bit polarizing depending upon your tastes but it does really need to steep a bit. \r\n\r\nI didn't want to make \"toppings\" as Wayne suggests. Instead I wanted to push the envelope on it's profile a little further and make it more rich and decadent. Deeper and richer. I'm a big fan of the deep caramel and rich bakery notes that Obsidian has already and I wanted to push it a bit further without mucking up the caramel and brown sugar notes that were already there. I turned to fruits that fit to try and accomplish that. Ones with juiciness and dark sweetness. They may seem like toppings in the recipe but once you taste it you realize they snuggle right in pretty well.\r\n\r\nFor flavor notes I'm only going to comment on the concentrates I've added to the Obsidian base for this recipe.\r\n\r\nFLV Fig - I've been messing with figs since I started DIY. I love this fig. It's what I expect from a fig. It has a cooked(ish) fig flavor that's really rich and dark. It brings a bit of natural sweetness and serves to deepen and sweeten the caramel/brown sugar notes in the TPA RY4 Double/Pie Crust. It also reinforces a little bit of earthiness in the tobacco perfectly. I feel like it makes it that much more rich and luxurious.  This IS the fig I've been looking  a long time for.\r\n\r\nINW Cherries - I've only used enough here to lend a hand to the fig and keep it away from getting too earthy and muddy. Keeping it low here helps brighten up the dark sweetness of the fig a bit without getting a medicinal cherry note.\r\n\r\nFA Pear - This ingredient completes what I consider to be the \"hat trick\" that makes these 3 additions to the mix work.  This particular pear has some juiciness that blends with the caramel to get sweet and a bit sticky on the end of the tongue. It also helped to brighten the fig a bit more. It blends here very well. You don't really taste pear, but it's there doing its job.\r\n\r\nSweetener - I've left out the sweetener. I'm not a big fan of it and more than a few drops per 30ml takes over a mix for me. Feel free to sweeten for your own palate but I find it sweet enough already.\r\n\r\nI have to give thanks to Wayne of course for the Obsidian base. It's a pretty stellar base to build upon. It's very rich and has a lot of depth. I'm not a huge fan of many of his recipes but this one I definitely like and can get behind. I'm actually a bit surprised that I haven't seen many recipes building upon it yet. It's really just begging for it.\r\n\r\nGive this a mix and let me know what you Think. Feel free to make adjustments to the fig/cherries/pear combo. Turn up the fig, turn up the cherry, whatever you want to your liking, but I think the pear should stay where it is.  You can shake and vape this pretty much but it's going to blend together a bit better after a few days. Wayne suggested 7 days for Obsidian but I think it's pretty good at 3 or 4. Cookie dough can be a little weird and soft/airy when it's fresh. If you're getting that, let it steep for a few days and come back to it.\r\n\r\nYou can try subs for this recipe but it will surely end up far from its intended results.\r\n\r\n www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/6ktjaa/z/djpkljx",
