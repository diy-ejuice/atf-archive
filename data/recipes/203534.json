    "description": "Fruit from the Stars series is back and my god is this Sirius. A simple, but bold and delicious blend of red and black current with a raspberry to fill it all in. \r\n\r\nI hope you all do enjoy this three flavor recipe. I do believe this recipe is finished to my liking, but I\u2019m always open to suggestions and obstructive criticism. This helps me improve not only my recipe, but my skills as a mixer in general.\r\n\r\nPlease leave a review no matter how you feel about if you do plan to mix this!\r\n\r\n***also, if you\u2019re wondering about which sweetener I use, it\u2019s from ecigexpress. I\u2019m not sure of the dilution ratio as I couldn\u2019t find any information on it. That is why you see \u201cother\u201d as the brand.",
