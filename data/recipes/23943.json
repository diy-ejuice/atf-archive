Turned out very nice actually. I actually love eating banana pudding and was hoping for that obvious pudding flavor but it's more like a rich banana cream. The wafer part worked out very nicely, and is well balanced with the banana cream. I may have to try this again but will add 1-2% of vanilla pudding(flv) in hopes of achieving that authentic banana pudding flavor. All in all this is a great recipe and worth a mix whether you love banana vapes or not."

      "text": "i love this recipe. i chose to split the banana cream percentage with half banana nut bread because i feel like those two tpa flavors work well together to create a less runty version of banana for me. either way, i opted to use this recipe instead of vurve's because i liked the heavier emphasis on the nilla wafer- it hits the profile for sure, like the sort of soggy (in a lovely way) nilla wafers at the bottom of casserole dish layered style banana pudding that's been sitting in the fridge over night. delicious.
