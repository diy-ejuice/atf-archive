  "description": "KIng / RE PAZZO by FlavourArt is the real star of this show. It's a fairly thin candied/gummy black currant flavor so it makes an AWESOME base for a juicy soda profile. I don't get much gummy candy from this one but others seem to. \r\n\r\nAdding the combo of FA Fuji Apple and FA Pear does a ton of work to make this more of a beverage. They fill out the bottom notes of the mix and add a lot of juiciness. The apple and the pear compliment each other really nicely to get a full fruit profile with texture and mouth feel. \r\n\r\nLast, VT Fizzy Sherbet adds just the slightest hint of creamy bubbles and a really pleasant citrus note that finishes off the exhale . \r\n\r\nI use 0.5% CAP super sweet in this. \r\n\r\nSweeten to Taste. \r\n\r\nThis is a recipe that could benefit from cooling (WS23) or menthol if that's your sort of thing. \r\n\r\nWatch the Video Here:\r\n\r\nhttps://youtu.be/YQ7i4pjh1iA",
