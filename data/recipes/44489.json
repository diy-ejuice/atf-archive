  "description": "The building blocks:\r\n\r\nFlavorah Basil, the crown, the secret, the missing link.\r\nOn opening the bottle i experienced a freshly cut basil. I think it's more of an asian basil type than european, a ripe basil leaf aroma with a slight aniseed, fennel taste and with light earthy notes. \r\nFlavorah Basil is fairly strong so i used .25% which is about perfect to give that basil feel and taste to the recipe and perfect to infuse my strawberry mix.\r\n\r\nJF Strawberry Sweet and RF Strawberry SC, the perfect combination for me, adding a pinch of FA Black Cherry is like opening the gates of fruit heaven, it's like strawberries on steroids.\r\n\r\nTahitian Vanilla Cream 2% gives a nice creamy structure to the ice cream mix and adding the vanilla spices i was looking for. All that combined with 3% of my preferred vanilla ice cream from LB and you get the perfect ice cream.\r\n\r\nFlavorah Cream 0.50% and FA Marshmallow 0.25% thickens the whole mixture even more.\r\n\r\nThe result:\r\n\r\nWhat you get after a short steep of 3 days?\r\nA fresh made and delicious creamy strawberry mix with lovely basil notes. \r\nOn inhale you immediately sense the basil with some minty notes and rich strawberries with a touch of black cherry.\r\n\r\nOn exhale the vanilla ice cream fills your mouth perfectly in balance with the rich and tropical vanilla aroma from the WFTahitian Vanilla Cream.\r\n\r\nFinally, a strawberry combination that works for me.\r\n(I am one of those people that can't hardly taste strawberries in recipes but can smell them perfectly. In fact i smell and recognize strawberries into all their facets.)\r\nMakes it difficult to mix? Not at all\r\n\r\nS/V sit for 24 hours but better or perfect when basil flavor get into the mix after 3 days,\r\n\r\nShare and rate this if you like it.\r\n",

      "text": "I get a flawless strawberry ice cream with just a hint of sweet basil... it tastes just like the picture! While the basil makes it fancy restaurant style and undoubtedly more interesting than just another strawberry ice cream, I think the real star is the FA Black Cherry. I'm not usually a huge fan of that flavor, but here it truly takes the strawberry over the top without tasting like cherry or any cherry-related off-notes. It's 12/2/18 and this is the tastiest strawberry ice cream juice I've tasted to date.  "
