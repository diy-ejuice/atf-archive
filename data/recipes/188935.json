  "description": "This is my first attempt at a clone/remix. I've tried this next to the original in identical setups and they are pretty close. My version is a little more forward with the blueberry, but I like it that way. While I don't believe LB Greek Yogurt is is in the original, it's what I had on hand and it does the job nicely. FW Yogurt is was an obvious choice and FW Blueberry is king. To add the granola in this parfait recipe I used CAP Cereal 27. Off the shake it is good but after about a week, it really comes together. I chose not to use sweetener (it really doesn't need it) but feel free to add to taste.",
