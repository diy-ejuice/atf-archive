  "name": "Peach Foster Pudding Parfait  FLV",
  "description": "This is a twist on the classic Banana Foster.  This is a a booze free version, so feel free to add your favorite rum if you like. \r\nFlavorah Peach is the star of this recipe, and the apricot just adds a little extra boost to the flavor of the peach.  The Milk & Honey is just perfect to add  to help with the cooked aspect of the peach.  And what can I say about FLV Vanilla Pudding, it is delicious, and FLV Marshmallow Vanilla just adds a delicious touch to boost texture and fluffiness of parfait.  Tested on Asmodus C4 RDA .25 Î©hm 50 watts.  \r\nEnjoy\r\n check out\r\n https://www.youtube.com/c/OGADIY\r\nhttps://www.diyflavorchaser.com/tam-vapes",
