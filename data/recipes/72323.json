    "description": "Simple Vanilla Swirl Ice cream with a Caramel topping, nothing fancy but very yummy.\r\nI was aiming for the Caramel Ice Cream from KFC it has fudge bits at the bottom and when you bite into them you get this yummy Butterscotch Caramel and Toffee taste mixed with the Vanilla Ice Cream, mixing TFA Vanilla Swirl, FA Caramel and TFA VBIC gave me the Butterscotch note i was after, i used FA Caramel for the soft cracked sauce and it worked great.\r\n\r\n",

Although i enjoy it. I get more vanilla than caramel just as picture would be. I read down the reviews and some say to add sweetner. It may make things pop more but I think its already sticky sweet. I give it 5 stars"
