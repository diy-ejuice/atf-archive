Definitely a 5 star recipe I highly recommend this to any peanut butter lovers ü§é"

My only problem is that i cant handle vaping tpa RY4 for too long as it messes with my throat for some reason. Delicious flavor, but had to stop using it. Swapped with JF ry4 and this recipe is just as good. I got lucky there. Thanks again guys!"

      "text": "Funny to me reading fadedjay1's review.  I tried this at low wattage, and I wasn't too happy, as the flavor seemed too weak.  I put it in a higher wattage atomizer, and I like it.  Definitely multiple layers of flavor.  The inhale is much lighter than I expected, and the exhale is deep and nutty, and the lingering taste is outstanding.  This is not a sweet vape, like many cookie mixes, more shortbread than sugar cookie, but feels buttery in the mouth.  Very nice mix guys."

Picking up well balanced peanuts butter cookie with tobacco notes (specifically light leafy dessert tobacco(ry4)). I don‚Äôt get coconut at all but I get the sense it blends the mix and sweetens it at the watts I‚Äôm at. Perfect for fall. "
