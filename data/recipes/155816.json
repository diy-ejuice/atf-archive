  "description": "Inspired by Mixin Vixens challenge week 23\r\n\r\nI wanted to move away from the expected with this recipe, and I was intrigued by a recipe on a cocktail recipe site that used almond and stone fruit liquor with pineapple juice, a flavor combo I have never tried in real life.  It is much less expensive to try it in a vape first, and it really works!  Not too sweet and a real change of pace from the typical pineapple vape.\r\n\r\nI used VT Creaming Soda as the beverage base and punched it up with two pineapples, FLV and INW.  I tried several almond flavors, and settled on the clean FA Almond.  I did not want to add more brightness with the stone fruits, so I chose FA Apricot.\r\n\r\nTested on a Pixie, 0.38 ohm, 40 watts",
