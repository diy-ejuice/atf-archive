  "description": "Still in the process of perfecting this profile. \r\nThis is v2 of strawberry custard?\r\nIn strawberry custard original I had planned to make.............a strawberry custard until after I mix and reliezed the 0.75-1 tpa carm original with 2-3fa custard. Taste EXACTLY like flan and more especially the wet caramel sauce... long start short it changed my goal. \r\nThis version is significantly closer to my goal but one this still remains. I can't get the strawberry right. In the og. I can only taste strawberry.a little.  And same here Im thinking this mix would be done with an additional 4%tpa strawberry not ripe. \r\nBut I'm still steeping this mix so we will see. In the mean time. I'm gonna drop this here because its pretty fucking good imo.....\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd ill post real notes mabey when im done... but \r\n\r\nTpa carm og. 0.75-1\r\nFa custard  2-3\r\nTaste like custard with wet caremel sauce really nothing more to see here mix this and keep moving along",
