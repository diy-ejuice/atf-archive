  "description": "If you have not tried @Fear Cardinal recipe, please do yourself a favor and mix it.  It is delish.  Summer and Fall of 2017, I kept at least 500ml of this ready to vape all the time.  I have a problem with peaches, I love them.  So, I thought what would Cardinal be like with Peach?  So, I tried it and came up with **GA Cardinal**.  Why not Peach Cardinal?  Well, have you seen a Peach Cardinal?  \r\nSo, I kept the base recipe the same.  I added **FA White Peach** and **FA Apricot**.  What comes out of this, is a delicious RY4 tobacco with a caramelized Peach on the exhale.  I am in love.  \r\nEnjoy\r\n",
