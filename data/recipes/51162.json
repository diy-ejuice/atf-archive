  "description": "About a week ago, I came across a thread on the DIY subreddit where a user was asking if there were any good remixes of one of my very first DIY recipes, Nebula. I realized that I hadn't worked on, vaped, or even thought about that recipe in probably a year, so I went ahead and mixed up a bottle of my final iteration of it. While it wasn't necessarily bad, I felt as though it had a lot of room for improvement. So here it is, a reimagining of one of the first mixes I had ever put together. What started out as a clone attempt of Habu Vapor's Stargazer (a strawberry/pineapple mix with a cold exhale), has evolved into something nice that I am quite happy with.\r\n\r\nThis is nebulæ, something nice and refreshing for the unbearable heat of the summer.\r\n\r\nCAP Sweet Strawberry / FA Red Touch - this combination is simply perfect. The CAP Sweet Strawberry brings about some really tasty notes of candied strawberry syrup. I used to dislike this concentrate until I was informed that I was essentially just using it wrong. This one has some really nice flavour when pushed to higher percentages. It does require a small steep in order to mellow out, but after that, we're just left with some very sticky and bloody red strawberry syrup. The FA Red Touch is used in here to bring back some authenticity to the mix, and remind us that we're not vaping on some sugary ice cream topping, but just a very sweet and overripe strawberry. Red Touch has the accurate and slightly seedy notes, while Sweet Strawberry brings the candy.\r\n\r\nTPA Pineapple / TPA Dragonfruit - While I believe CAP Golden Pineapple is an objectively better concentrate all around, I think TPA's option is utilized best here. The bright tartness of TPA Pineapple helps cut into the thick sweetness of the strawberries. TPA Dragonfruit shares almost the same volatile structure as most pineapple concentrates available, but helps round out the fairly one-dimensional offering from TPA Pineapple. The dragonfruit helps add some sweetness, while also bringing some slight tropical undertones.\r\n\r\nFA Apricot - I've said it a million times, but this is easily one of my favourite concentrates. It's potent, vibrant, and is the perfect replacement for any peach concentrate I have. In the original recipe for Nebula, I was using TPA Juicy Peach, which is like vaping razorblades. Then I moved to FA White Peach, which is significantly nicer to my throat, but still just wasn't right. I wanted the peach notes in here to bring some wetness and added tart brightness to an otherwise deeply sweet mix. As soon as I came back to this recipe, I knew FA Apricot was the best option.\r\n\r\nINW Cactus / FA Polar Blast - the cactus is here to add some more \"juicy wetness\" to the recipe. The subtle aloe notes aren't really noticeable at lower percentages, but every so often I'll pick up just the slightest little hint of it on the back end. I'm tempted to push this higher into the mix to accentuate that aloe note just a bit, because it does seem to play around nicely with the tropical notes from the pineapple and dragonfruit. Finally, Polar Blast. I like my fruit mixes cold, and Polar Blast is just infinitely better than Koolada.\r\n\r\nSteep Time - this one is a quick steep. Shake and vape is still going to yield an enjoyable experience, but give it about two days, and the off notes from CAP Sweet Strawberry fade away to let all the other flavours get to know each other just a little better.\r\n\r\nThere it is, a reimagining of one of the first recipes I ever produced. I hope you enjoy.",

This is my first mix with FA Apricot and I've gotta say it's very pleasant. Also my first mix with FA Polar Blast and I was pleasantly surprised that at 1.75% it was not ridiculously cold, just a tad bit like a real drink. This is very well thought out and very well put together and I'm hitting myself on the head for waiting until the beginning of fall to have just now mixed this up. This is a stellar juice, thanks for the recipe brother!"

I wonder if the cactus might be a little too far forward in the mix if we take the polar blast out?  Either way, I'm making more of this and playing around with the recipe some as well."
