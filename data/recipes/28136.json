  "description": "I am super proud of this recipe. \r\nTook me a while to get this one to this level, and well, I think its perfect.\r\nThis is like taking a bite right out of the middle of a fresh jam filled cinnamon doughnut.\r\n\r\nThe main profile is the strawberry, and here the high percentages of Ripe and Sweet work really well together at 5 and 6%.\r\nTo form the thick jammy filling, the Jelly Candy and Cream Cheese Icing add to the strawberry. The Raspberry adds a \"tang\" at only 0.5% to give that authentic bakery jam flavour.\r\nNote - its INW Raspberry Konkentrat (Malina) used here, but the database did have it as an option. \r\n\r\nThe doughnut is achieved solely with the Cinnamon Danish Swirl (with a touch of Joy, but in honesty you could leave it out) which works with the there components to give a warm cinnamon doughnut on the inhale, that lingers with a strong strawberry jam on the exhale.\r\n\r\nTwo weeks steep time, but you will see it develop even further up to four weeks.",
