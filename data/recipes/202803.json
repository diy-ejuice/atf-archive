  "description": "Ooofff I had so much fun creating this one!\r\nIâ€™m a weirdo that enjoys a complex tobacco tobacco with hints of sweet notes and layers.\r\nThe following combinations created my cigarrillo\r\nMax blend for the darker tobacco notes\r\nDesert Ship has spicy notes and has a dryer yellow tobacco note\r\nDK Tab brings a nutty aspect with sweet tobacco notes\r\nClove is a my separator and dances around all the other flavors\r\nOut of all the bourbons out there I picked aged bourbon cream because it serves dual purpose it brings bourbon to the party while emulsifying the tobaccos and blending really nicely with the Honeybee I used for the touch of honey note. Sweet Fig is that surprise flavor I placed smack in the middle of this mix that makes vaping this tobacco quite a unique experience because in this mix it almost taste like a plumb note.\r\nTo round out the recipe I finished it off with sweet and smokey tobacco it does exactly what is expected adds a smokey sweet finish.",
