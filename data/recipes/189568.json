    "description": "When used at 4% NF Almond is a thick cooked cherry, very realistic too.\r\nSA VCN does all of the heavy lifting for the custard all by itself.\r\nSimple and delicious. \r\n\r\nUpdate: so my bad, I dumped the 2 testers together to create this and its been pointed out to me that these % should have been cut in half. I'm altering the recipe now to reflect the change.",
