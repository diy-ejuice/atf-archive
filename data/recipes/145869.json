  "description": "Lets face it, blondes have more fun. This is my take on a blonde s'more. While I don't have any marshmallow flavor in here, the vanilla and smoked butterscotch provide that toasty fluffiness you want. Pair that with the delicious fw butterscotch and fa graham crust and you have a delicious blonde s'more. I know a lot of people prefer fw graham cracker and I was one of them, but fa graham crust provides a cleaner more authentic flavor. ",
