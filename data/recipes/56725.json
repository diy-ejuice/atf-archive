  "description": "// Amaretto Summer Cocktail //\r\n\r\nThis recipe was made for the DIY Subreddit FOTW posted by ID10-T about Amaretto recipes.\r\n\r\nThis is not a recipe with many differential layers where you have a base, top note, etc. Instead, all the flavors work toghether with each other to enhance the best they have to offer to the final product.\r\n\r\nThe Pink Lemonade with the Black Tea makes a syrupy sweet drink base, where the Black Tea act as Dragonfruit or Cactus does in other cases, adding that wet and sweet feeling without earthy notes or blending too much the mix. \r\n\r\nFW Almond Amaretto is for me very similar to the liqueur with no alcoholic note and more in the citric side with a subtle almond in the back. The Blood Orange and Peach Juicy pairs with that citric note and adds some sweet fruit to the cocktail. \r\n\r\nI hope you enjoy it and feel free to play with it and give your most honest opinion and suggestions!!\r\n\r\n(English is not my mother tongue; please excuse any errors on my part)",
