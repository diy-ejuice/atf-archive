    "description": "Banana bread RY4, if you like faint tobacco mixes and you like banana bread I can\u2019t see you not liking this one, DIYFS banana bread is by far the best banana bread so thanks for pointing that out karl.\r\n\r\nI\u2019m not going to go into detail here as all the flavours do what I intend them to do the only thing I will say is that VTA raw sugar works beautifully in RY4 mixes so that had to be there, nothing is overpowering here, just as much banana bread as there is nuts and RY4 elements.\r\n\r\nSuper sweet is subjective and can be dropped out if you wish.\r\n\r\nIf you like this recipe and what I do then please rate and review accordingly \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb",

It may just be me being sensitive to that particular concentrate. The overall flavour on this recipe is very good though,I think if I mix this again I\u2019ll use 4% DFS and 2.5% TPA. Thanks for the recipe matey. Happy new year \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb"
