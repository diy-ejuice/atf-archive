So it is funny, because you guys are friends.  As I look at the ingredients, I realize, you created a Lemon Meringue Pie without using a Lemon Meringue Pie or tart concentrate, So with that being said, you definitely deserve 5 stars for that.  The crust and the creams are present, and on point.  The lemon (which is not my everyday profile) is beautiful on the inhale.  The only suggestion, I have, and it may be my palette, is to lower the sour lemon a bit, perhaps to 1%.  Other than that, this is a beautiful Lemon Meringue Pie.  I am giving you 5 stars, if I could do 4.5, I would only because of the extra strong tart note left on the exhale.  Well done, Luke, and like I said, maybe it is my palette.  Let me know your thoughts on this.  :) "
