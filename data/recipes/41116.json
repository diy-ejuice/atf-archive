    "description": "What can make a morning blaze even better? A nice big bowl of crunch berry cereal in milk, and that's exactly what this recipe is. \r\n\r\nFW Capt. Crunch berry is the main cereal note and provides a nice grain-like texture and body for the vape, but the fruit notes in it got flattened when paired with any creams. That's where FW Blueberry and TPA Strawberry come in and strengthen those notes in FW CCB. \r\n\r\nThe milk note is the tried and true FA Meringue and FW Hazelnut which provides a slightly sugary milk flavor. It manages to play with the cereal and make it taste likes its been soaked in it a bit too, which I absolutely love. \r\n\r\nI just wanted a simple cereal and milk mix and ended up with this delicious result on my first try, so I wanted to share it with the community. Hope you enjoy!",
