  "description": "steep for 3 weeks \r\n\r\nThe cantaloupe twist a dance of bakeries fruits and creams.\r\nI made about 7 versions of the bakery and cream aspect and to be honest try this with out the cantaloupe dragon fruit and peach and that is also a good vape. The main ingredient i wanted to work with was the cinnamon danish swirl that is a great flavour but i find a bit tricky to work with sometimes. Adding the cheese cake graham cracker really helps it out in a big way and the custard and ice cream help smooth out the bakery profile and some off notes i get from the danish swirl.\r\n\r\nI added the cantaloupe because i love it lol and helped it out with some peach if you want more of a peach profile go .75% peach and .25% cantaloupe.\r\nThis was a great learning curve for me and i learnt alot about these flavours through trial and error. there are so many things i wanted to add but Sydney vapour don't have unfortunately. but all these flavours are staple flavours for your mixing.\r\n#DIYDOWNUNDERMAYCHALLENGE",
