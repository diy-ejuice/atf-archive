    "description": "It\u2019s a cigarette with a pinch of lime. Sounds weird, right? I thought so too when ID10-T told me I should try to make a Camel Twista Lime recipe for Mixers Club. Over the month of trying out various different versions of this, it kind of grew on me and started to make sense. Day drinking some beer in the summer is better with two things: cigarettes and a slice of lime. Why not put them together in a recipe?\r\n\r\nMost of the recipe is focusing on the cigarette aspect, but I wanted it to be the kind of tobacco that would take on the lime without too much clashing. The 7 Leaves and Classic Cigarette are the big players for that. They are brighter Tobaccos that bridge the gap between the darker, spicier notes of the Desert Ship and Turkish. The Royal I am not really using for any tobacco taste, because it doesn\u2019t really have any. It does, however, have a little hint of cooling with some fruity notes to it. Really helps keep this thing refreshing. \r\n\r\nI picked up two different lime flavors to play with, and didn\u2019t test any further than INW Shisha Lime. It just felt right, so it was the only one I bothered playing with. \r\n\r\n",

            "text": "This is a beauty of a tobacco. Very spot on to a Camel Twista Lime. Hits all the right flavors to scream Camel, but oh holy hell, that lime...Throughout the first 50 ml, it was a nice underlying note, paired up beautifully with that Camel...the last 10 ml tho...it was a sweet lime and citrus slurry with a hint of tobacco. Absolutely bizarre shift, but still brilliantly tasty. Absolutely worthy of a mix, cos this was an ADV for about 2 weeks, and enjoyable the whole way through."
