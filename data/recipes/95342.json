  "description": "Foreword: This is a continuation in my efforts to create the BEST Peanut butter Cream/Custard.\r\n\r\nReview step 1: I mixed this, shook it, filled my RDTA and ran out the door for a weekend that I knew was going to blow... Detox. Yes folks, I too am an addict. I needed to go get right and I achieved that goal. Now as I push forward one day at a time, I am slowly finding my mixing legs again. \r\nI'm pleased to say that I don't think I will be making changes on this one. Unless it doesn't steep that well, then I think I might go back and tweak a couple components. \r\n\r\nGive this a shot and see if you think it's up to snuff for a weekend in a locked unit. ;)",
