  "description": "This is a clone of Adirondack Vapor's Sagamore.  This was my intro to Tobacco vapes.  I was hesitant to try but it's so rich, creamy, and delicious.  Not overly sweet.\r\n\r\nFrom their description:\r\n\r\n\"An RY4 (Vanilla, Caramel, Tobacco) shines in Sagamore, but is followed up with notes of bakery cinnamon, and a bit of cake and cream to give you a satisfying, full flavored experience.\"\r\n\r\nTFA RY4: Obvious choice here.  Delicious vanilla-y creamy tobacco.\r\n\r\nTFA VBIC: This flavor is so versatile and delicious.  It was pretty well detectable in Sagamore to me.\r\n\r\nCAP Cinnamon Danish Swirl: A solid bakery cinnamon pastry.  Fits well in this flavor profile and seemed to me to be the exact cinnamon note used.\r\n\r\nTFA Vanilla Cupcake:  This was my last addition that really brought the recipe together.  The picture and description really clued me in that there was some sort of cake ingredient, and after trying a few others, this was the closest.  It's *possible* they use FW Yellow Cake but I know that's a no-no in DIY for many.\r\n\r\nCAP Sugar Cookie: For that unmistakeably awesome mouthfeel and bakery richness that it brings.\r\n\r\nFW Butterscotch Ripple:  This one just adds to the depth of the RY4 and compliments and accentuates the Caramel.\r\n\r\nFA Soho: In my first iterations I found RY4 not to deliver enough of a tobacco note, and boosting it with a comparable counterpart did it some good.  \r\n\r\nCAP Butter Cream:  Adirondack juices are all so rich and creamy, and this really brought it all together with that wonderful aftertaste in the mouth of sweet buttery cream.",
