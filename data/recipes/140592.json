    "description": "This is a champagne cocktail with cantaloupe and honeydew, decorated with a cucumber ribbon. Since the fruit is not blended in the picture, I tried to make enphasis in the champagne flavor and have the sweetness and fresh green aspects of the fruit.\r\n\r\nIt took me a couple of tries to nail the champagne but it is freaking delicious! The 2 - 1 ratio between WF and FLV brings toghether the sweet fake sparkling champagne flavor of the first one with the incredibly well represented white wine of flavorah.\r\n\r\nFLV Cantaloupe and CAP Honeydew were chossen , not only for the flavor but also because how they complement each other. CAP Double Apple works both ways, helping to the authenticity of the champagne and adding texture to the fruit. WS-23 is there just to help the bubbling effect.\r\n\r\nSorry for my bad english and enjoy! Salud!",
