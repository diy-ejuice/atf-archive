  "description": "This recipe was featured on DEVELOPED LIVE: Blind Remix Ep.2.  Full recipe notes at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6lbDGKduU8 .  Our goal was to improve upon the original and try to come as close as we could.  We let this steep for about a week to determine if it was ready to be released and we think that it is.  After revisiting the original and also hearing from the viewers, we determined that there was a possible banana note in the original.  So, we made another version utilizing this recipe but adding TPA Banana Cream at 1%.  So if that's what you taste in the original, by all means add that flavoring.\r\n\r\nThis is a collaborative creation by DEVELOPED: NaChef, Max Savage, and Folkart.\r\nOur weekly episodes are released at 6:00pm EST every other Tuesday, and catch our live shows every Thursday at 6pm EST.\r\n\r\nCheck out our website at https://www.DevelopedDIY.com - We now have Merch!\r\nFind us on YouTube https://www.youtube.com/c/DevelopedDIY\r\nFollow us on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/developeddiy/\r\nCheck out our FaceBook Page at https://www.facebook.com/developeddiy/\r\n\r\n![Legacy](https://i.imgur.com/97yskRE.png)\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you would like to support DEVELOPED, the best way is to check out our LEGACY one shot line at https://www.DIYFlavorChaser.com/developed",
