  "name": "1-2-3 Apple Mango",
  "description": "The inspiration for this one came from trying an Apple and Mango juice I’d picked up from a supermarket. It was the first time trying the Apple/Mango pairing and I can say for sure that it’s not the last time. They go so well together.\r\n\r\nFA Fuji and FLV Mango were no-brainers for me. They are two of my favourite concentrates. Very authentic tasting! I used FA Pear to sweeten and juice up the mix a little more. It’s such a light flavour, that it doesn't take away from the goal profile, but supports it. Sweetener and coolant to taste, if desired.\r\n\r\nIt’s another simple 1-2-3 recipe and I hope you enjoy it.",
