  "description": "Ever wanted to dip a nice cigar in a chocolate fountain and light it up? Me neither.\r\n\r\nThis is a dessert tobacco that isn't too sweet. Tobacco Dark Chocolate, TA Cuban Cigar and DNB combine to make a cigar-like tobacco with hints of chocolate. I added the Double Chocolate (clear) to let you really know it has chocolate. I get notes of cocoa powder, Hershey's syrup and regular chocolate. Let me know if this recipe helps you win over the Michelle Pfeiffer in your life.\r\n\r\n",
