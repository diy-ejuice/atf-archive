  "name": "Apricot cream tobacco",
  "description": "Taste great but my effort to make a all flavorah reciep failled. I was almost there but wanted another layer of apricot. Needs 4-5 days steep. Light cream, nice balanced apricot, and a nice tobacco note. \r\nPretty simple break down, Apricots, creams, tobaccos.\r\nFLV and FA Apricot make up a nice apricot, sorta sweet. FLV apricot brings the top end and FA brings more body.\r\nFLV Milk & honey and FLV Cream create a nice light cream thats subtle but there and placed well in the mix.\r\nFlv Kentucky Blend and FLV Red burley bring in a earthy dark notes. Red burley is just a tobacco i always come back to and enjoy every time.\r\n\r\nTested in Kayfun 5 MTL. \r\n",

It’s rich and satisfying, with thick, dark, brown sugar-like sweet cream blending with the tobacco and fruit notes. I’ve tried a few peach tobaccos that I’ve liked and even created one, but I like this one even more.  "
