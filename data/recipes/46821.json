  "description": "This recipe is designed with menthol flavor in mind. It can be vaped without it but i don't think it is as good. I didn't test it with just mint (i don't have any), that could work too.\r\nIt is meant to be refreshing for the hot summertime.\r\nIf you like it, please leave a rating.\r\n\r\nCAP Cucumber has a nice fresh cucumber salad flavor which is refreshing on it's own. same goes for\r\nTPA Watermelon. it's not a candy like watermelon but a more authentic and fresh one\r\nGolden Pineapple is meant to enhance the freshness and juicyness. I tried different things here but liked this the most. you can switch it for FA Fuji @ 0.5% which works well also (but of course a little different).\r\n\r\nEdit New Version: I added a little Flavorahs Cucumber and Wild melon to boost the flavors without making it much drier. To make up for it i raised Golden Pineapple.\r\n\r\n\r\nOld Recipe:\r\nCAP Cucumber 5%\r\nTPA Watermelon 2.5%\r\nCAP Golden Pineapple 0.75%\r\nMenthol: 0.33%",
