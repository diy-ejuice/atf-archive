    "description": "This is a bit of a weird one for sure. \r\nFor me 9 times out of 10 I get off to chase a profile based on things I crave to eat but can't eat at least on a regular basis, so this one came about do to the fact my family is ALWAYS cooking buttered biscuits and serving them with honey butter. One day I walked into the house after getting off work and right as I opened the door the smell just knocked me over, the entire house smelled like homestyle buttery biscuits fresh out of the oven and that's when I decided I wanted to try in recreate that as a vape.\r\nThis tows the line of savory and sweet, and it's not an ADV for sure, at least not for me. But something about it makes it nice when you want something different that your normal fruits and creams or such.\r\n\r\nJF Biscuit\/TFA Pie crust\/FLV Sweet dough\/FLV fried dough\/CAP cereal 27\r\nUnsurpringly these make up the biscuit. JF Biscuit is a great flavor, very buttery but seems more like a cracker style \"biscuit\" than a homestyle biscuit, but the combo of the TFA Pie crust and FLV sweet dough add body and layers to it, turning it more to a soft, raised, doughy biscuit, the FLV Fried dough and CAP cereal 27 add the crisped, browned top and bottom of the biscuit taking it to a fully baked biscuit instead raw\/semi cooked dough. Keep in mind the FLV Fried dough is stupid strong and you're looking at around 1 drop per 10 ml's.\r\n\r\nFLV Milk & honey\/FA honey\/TFA butter\r\nThese three make the honey butter, TFA butter and FA honey is pretty obvious, but they don't work without the Milk & Honey. M&H works as a emulsifier of the to, toning down some of the floral notes of FA honey and softing the in you face buttery taste of TFA butter, melding them together into a compound honey butter that's melted over top of the biscuits.\r\n\r\nThis one is a steeper for sure. Don't even try it till for at least 7 days please, the FA honey still stands out way to much and get's weird, plus the yeast flavor from FLV fried dough won't fully sit down and those two together aren't pleasant. But at the 2 week mark it really starts to simmer down and come together. 3 weeks is it's best, but 2 weeks is doable if you really want. \r\n\r\nI know the the FLV dough's aren't going to be super popular flavors, so if anyone is curious to try them out I would suggest www.diyvaporsupply.com for them, they sell 10ml bottles for a bit less than the typical 15ml FLV bottle price. Sweet dough can be used higher so 10ml won't last as long but Fried dough is super potent and I'd suggest making a 10% dilution of it to make it easier to work with so that one will last forever.",
