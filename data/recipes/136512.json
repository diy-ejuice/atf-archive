  "description": "Ah the memories, they come flooding back when I think of this recipe. This was the very first 'original' mix I ever created without outside influence from YouTube or Reddit. I originally posted this on a thread I made about simple mixes on Reddit a while back, and though I would \"import' them over here on ATF for all of my homies. \r\n\r\nThis mix is by no means luxurious or complex, it will not win any awards, it will not go down in history as one of the greatest ever concocted with surgical pinpoint accuracy, and it's not supposed to. This however may be the very first thing that someone mixes and tries and has a \"holy-shit-I-made-something-mostly-vapeable\" moment and inspire them to keep experimenting, that's what happened to me with this recipe and that's my overall goal here. \r\n \r\nThis is absolutely a shake and vape mix if I've ever had one. Literally shake well and wait for the bubbles to dissipate and it should be set to rock.",
