Been vaping all day today and gotta say, this is the first chocolate vape that I've really enjoyed since the first time I tried Golden Ticket. Well done CCC. I had tried INW Milk Chocolate in several recipes and couldn't understand what everyone saw in it, but I think the addition of the HS Australian Chocolate really helps it out."
