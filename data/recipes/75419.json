  "name": "The Prince of the Great Plains",
  "description": "Inspired by Fear's Cardinal (a cardinal is a Prince of the Church) crossed with Bigglesworth's Prairie/Grizzly Vapes' Nanner Bear (prairie = the Great Plains).  Throw in a little FLV Tatanka Tobacco (tatanka is a Lakota, a Great Plains Native American tribe, word referring to the buffalo) mixed with some creamy, custard, and we have The Prince of the Great Plains.\r\n\r\nThe Cardinal inspiration - DFS Holy Grail RY4 (4%) and FLV Red Burley (0.5%).  The original Cardinal (https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/24962#cardinal_by_fear . . . which is outstanding) was 8% Holy Grail RY4 and 0.75% Red Burley with 0.25% FLV Kentucky Blend.  I cut the Holy Grail in half to make room for DK Tobacco from Prairie . . . lowered Red Burley to 0.5% and switched Kentucky Blend out with Tatanka (bumping the percentage up to 0.5%)  Tatanka really adds to the nutty, caramel vibe, which steers this even father away from a tobacco and more towards a dessert.\r\n\r\nThe Prairie/Nanner Bear inspiration - /u/project_twenty5oh1's Nanner Bear clone, which became Prairie (see edit below) was a revelation when I first tried it.  So earthy and different from most of the other commercial juices I'd tried (with the exception of Grizzly's Nanner Bear).  I subbed out TFA Peanut Butter in favor of TFA Toasted Almond (1%) for the nutty aspect of Prairie.  I kept TFA Banana Cream and Banana Nut Bread but dropped them to 1% each (as opposed to the original percentages 5 and 3, respectively).  The flavor that really sets Prairie (and I assume Nanner Bear not knowing the recipe) apart is TFA DK Tobacco Base.  It's odd and earthy but not necessarily what I think of when I think of tobacco.  However, it is delicious nonetheless and necessary, in my opinion.  I dropped it from 6% to 3% to make room for the Holy Grail RY4.\r\n\r\nBecause this is a dessert, I wanted to wrap it all up with a custard.  I went with CC Devon Cream (1%) and INW Custard (1.5%) to smooth out the base of the custard.  The TFA Banana Cream also plays nice with the custards/creams.  INW Custard is an instantly vapable custard, but I'm intersted to see how/if this changes with a steep.\r\n\r\nWith that being said, I mixed up a 10mL tester of this at 60vg40pg and have plowed through about half of the bottle dripping it in my Hadaly clone . . . so it is definitely a SNV.  It checks all of the boxes I was hoping for:  a creamy, nutty caramel custard with notes of banana and the earthiness of tobacco floating around in it.  When I finish this bottle, I plan on throwing some FA Polar Blast at it and, possibly, a drop or two of Axiom's Icicles to complete that ode to Bigglesworth/Grizzly Vapes.  I think it will play well with the caramel aspect based on how much I loved BDY's K2, a Canadian juice that was a caramel-vanilla tobacco with a kiss of icy menthol.  I'll also mix up a larger batch of this recipe by itself and see how it steeps, as this tester will not see tomorrow.  I will update when I figure it all out.\r\n\r\nEdit -  try this url for twenty5oh1's original post:  https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/2luk9u/project_twenty5oh1s_nannerpolar_bear_clone_xpost/\r\n",
