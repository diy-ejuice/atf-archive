  "description": "My attempt at a peach moonshine. The LB peach is not my favorite, but it sits nice with the whiskey flavorings in this recipe and it adds a depth to the TFA juicy peach that gave me the idea for this recipe. Several drops of TFA Kentucky Bourbon and a couple of drops of FA Whisky later I had a smile on my face. Kick up the LB Peach to 4% and you get a very pronounced \"baked in whiskey\" peach flavor. I've been vaping this in my Mjolnir with a .25 ohm N80 fused clapton and in my Apocalypse  25 with a .15 ohm N80 fused clapton setup. Enjoy.",
