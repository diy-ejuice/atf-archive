  "description": "Tres Leches, meaning 3 milks, is a soft white cake infused with whole milk, condensed milk, and topped with a whipped cream frosting.  This is a recipe where MaxSavage and Folkart had never had the real thing, so Nachef was our guide into this wonderful dessert.  The FA Milk at 2.5% off the shake is a bit forward as a top note, but let it steep for a few days and it begins to blend well with the mix.  Full recipe notes at https://youtu.be/sW1fA-An8ws  .  \r\n\r\nThis is a collaborative creation by DEVELOPED: NaChef, Max Savage, and Folkart.\r\nOur weekly episodes are released at 6:00pm EST every other Tuesday, and catch our live shows every Thursday at 6pm EST.\r\n\r\nCheck out our website at https://www.DevelopedDIY.com - We now have Merch!\r\nFind us on YouTube https://www.youtube.com/c/DevelopedDIY\r\nFollow us on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/developeddiy/\r\nCheck out our FaceBook Page at https://www.facebook.com/developeddiy/\r\n\r\n![Legacy](https://i.imgur.com/97yskRE.png)\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you would like to support DEVELOPED, the best way is to check out our LEGACY one shot line at https://www.DIYFlavorChaser.com/developed",
