  "description": "Strawberry Milk (sure, it's a S&C, not very original but sometimes I enjoy going back to this old school profile)\r\n\r\n*** EDIT *** For the folks who prefer CAP Sweet Strawberry, you can sub it in place of the FA Juicy Strawberry at same percentage for a brighter top note.\r\n\r\nTPA Strawberry Ripe: the top note strawberry flavoring (new version).\r\nFA Red Touch Strawberry / FA Juicy Strawberry:  the Red Touch adds a slight jamminess while the Juicy Strawberry adds a bit more brightness to the top note strawberry - best used in small percentages in creams.\r\nFA Cream Fresh / FLV Cream: this combo in equal parts is perfect for milk.  The Cream Fresh provides the dairy notes and the FLV cream helps create a thicker body.\r\nCAP Vanilla Whipped Cream: adds a light fluff and vanilla to the dairy body without compromising overall vape density.\r\nFA Meringue: more dairy, sweetness and creaminess in a S&C... is it a bad thing?\r\nFLV Sweetness: obviously optional but I find it best used low in this mix.\r\n\r\nSteep & Enjoy.",

I can taste the strawberry for sure with a very thick cream base. The creams are layered very nicely. I might bump up the juicy and red touch a bit. Overall it's really good!"
