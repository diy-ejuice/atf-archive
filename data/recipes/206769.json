  "description": "What was I thinking! I actually put a lot of thought into this and decided upon something that would fit the season, but would be just as tasty served ice cold. After a lot of brainstorming, I chose a delicious creamy yam and avocado smoothie with a touch of citrus, dusted with cinnamon.\r\n\r\nMy first step was to make a rich and creamy citrusy smoothie base. My obvious first choice was FLV Smoothie Base as it brings just the right amount of citrus with it. To thicken it up some, increase the richness and support the citrus note, I added FLV Avocado. Something was still missing, a bit of sweetness and a twist of flavor, which is why I added FLV Sweet Coconut to my smoothie base. After a nice steep (14 days), it‘s really a mouthful!\r\n\r\nNow on to the yam, the star of the smoothie. It obviously had to be FLV Yam. I hadn’t worked with it beforehand, but I‘m glad I finally did. It has a very natural sweet taste to me and I wanted to soften it up some, kind of like that pumpkin goo that comes in cans. I (think) I achieved this by adding FLV Marshmallow and FLV Cream (inspired by kindground‘s cooked yam). Last, but not least, the slightest touch of FLV Rich Cinnamon was added to act as a spicy counterpart to the citrus note.\r\n\r\nAll in all, I really enjoy it as does my SO. It plays very well with clove, nutmeg and ginger variations. I‘m thinking of maybe introducing a fruit like fig or persimmon, but that lies in the future.\r\n\r\nTested on a Nudge 22mm, 3mm - 0,25 Ohm Ni80 - Flapton, 50 Watts.\r\n\r\nA shout out goes to the beautiful Gloria Gaynor, whose music inspired this title and served as a wonderful companion growing up. Every Saturday, you‘d find me hanging out at the roller rink with friends, skating, playing air hockey and asteroids and listening to tunes of the 70‘s and 80‘s.\r\n\r\nA second shout out goes to our great DIY community, without whom I would have never come this far. You are the best!\r\n\r\nIf you happen to have the flavors in your stash, I‘d be happy if you‘d give it a try. \r\n\r\nPi2 aka QueenBuzyBee",
