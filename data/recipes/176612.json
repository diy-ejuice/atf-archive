  "description": "Just a remix of all the (non citrusy) “Frosted Flakes swimming on milk” recipes I’ve ever seen around here and there. \r\nHere i really taste the corn cereal and a creamy milk 🥛 \r\n\r\nThe first that got my attention was from @ENYAWREKLAW so, desserves some credits. \r\n\r\n\r\nPs: QUITE vapeable after a week, but MUCH more delicious after 2 (if your not an anxious person, give it a month. Won’t regret it) -_-\r\n\r\nHope you enjoy! \r\nLots of love and flavor <3",
