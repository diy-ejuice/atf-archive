  "description": "Sweet creamy raspberry inhale that carries over to a bubblegum exhale \r\n\r\nGrowing up as a kid in the 80s, my favorite gum was raspberry \"Bubblicious\" bubblegum. This is my attempt to recreate this taste from memory, considering this flavor has been discontinued for over 20 years....damn I'm old lol.\r\n\r\nGood as a shake and vape and really comes together after a 24 steep. \r\n\r\nFeel free to tweek and any feedback would be appreciated.
