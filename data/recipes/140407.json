  "description": "How about them Molinberry flavours...\r\nShape Up Pear and Blueberry are one of their best in my opinion and they pair up nicely too.\r\nThe idea for this profile came to me from the Arizona drink Blueberry White Tea, while skipping the tea part here.\r\nI just wanted a fresh & sweet fruity vape for this one.\r\nI did layer in some other blueberries (HS&FW) because I needed it to be more pungeant. Also adding some (FA) Pear for juiciness and that fruity sweetness.\r\n(TPA) Sour is added to lift up the whole recipy and make it fresher overall.\r\nSuper Sweet is entirely up to your liking, but I would say 0.25% is a minimum for these fruity vapes.\r\nDo enjoy and all the best ;)\r\nScrewdriver",
