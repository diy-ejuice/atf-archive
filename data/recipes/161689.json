    "description": "Salted caramel popcorn milk\r\n\r\nStarting with the milk... FA milk, VTA love and FA fresh cream combine to make a nice sweet silky milk, the white chocolate in VTA love just sits in the back and gives it a creamy sweet edge as to not get overpowered by the caramel, the FLV popcorn is a huge star here and provides a toffee note which compliments the caramel really well. FA corn (make sure to dilute to 10% before adding it at 0.15) penetrates the milk and combined with the FLV popcorn gives a very slight corn residue flavour as if the popcorn has been steeping in the milk \ud83d\ude0b the Cereal 27 adds just a touch of AP for the fistful of popcorn that sits on the top.\r\n\r\nIf you like this recipe and what I do then please rate and review accordingly :)\r\n\r\n*FA corn should be diluted to 10% before use, ATF does not have the 10% dilution option in the database so make sure to adjust that accordingly*",
