  "name": "Grape that Lychee (Galago Remix)",
  "description": "If you love Galago by Twelve Monkeys you should check this one out.\r\n\r\nI combined FLV Lychee with FA Grape Concord cuz it was the closest I could get to Galago.\r\nI added .25% of FA's Bergamot to bend the Lychee flavor a little bit and make it less overpowering to the Grape.\r\nI threw a little bit of LA Tart and Sour in it to help the grape come forward.\r\nSuper Sweet is optional and I like it at .25%. If you wonna get closer to the Galago juice you might wonna bump it up to .50%\r\n\r\nI'm mixing for a few years now. Most of my mixes are based on premium juice profiles.\r\nMy recipes are remixes and not clones. In my attempts to remix these juices I'm always trying to make\r\nit as good as, or even better than the commercial juice without the loads of sweetener these companies throw in.\r\n\r\nGive it a try and enjoy................",
