  "description": "I wanted to make an awesome mix from the \"Awesome Box\" that would help me win the competition. I started out with the idea of doing a Strawberry/Whipped Cream topping on a waffle, but one look at all the flavors and that had to change as 90% of the recipes were one way or another that. Then I realized one of my favorite vapes are always the simplest things. So this mix is simply put a Strawberry Vanilla mix. It took me about a month to perfect it, but these percentages are by far the best outcome. Hope you like it! Let me know any suggestions or comments please. Thanks!!",
