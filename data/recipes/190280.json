  "description": "I wanted to make a tropical and floral sweet green tea and I think the combination of guanabana, mango and rose essence is just right to bring the floral/tropical vibe that I wanted. The green tea is a little bit overpowering if you SnV , but if you allowed 36 to 48 hours for the flavors to blend together you will get a nice vape....hope you like it as much as I do! Sweetener is a must for this recipe in my opinion, I used  flv sweetness but you can sub for your sweetener of choice. Enjoy!",

Got this one steeping for 13 days and it is a perfect blend of sweet green tea and Guanabana and mango with a hint of floral rose in end. I really cant say anything bad about this. Great job on this one!üëå &#xD;\n&#xD;\nVaping this on my Citadel single coil 0.19 and 35 watts üëç"
