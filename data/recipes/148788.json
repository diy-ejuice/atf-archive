    "description": "Ugh so annoying, lost my description.  Here we go again.  The profile I was going for was a dark berry forward yogurt smoothie with a hint of lemon.  The VT Yoghurt drink takes care of the yogurt with the hint of lemon, but it's not thick enough on its own for a smoothie and FW yogurt provides that thickness without making it overly creamy.  I wanted to make sure the Forrest Fruit didn't get overpowered by the yogurtness of this mix so I boosted all the dark berries.  The FA black currant adds that syrupy sweetness and the FA Bilberry gives it an additional fresh blueberry vibe.  TFA Blackberry is notoriously strong and I didn't want it to overpower the mix, but it just belonged in the dark berry mix.  This started as a collab on the DIY_eJuice Discord with @isuamadog, but we veered in different directions as he wanted to bring the yogurt to the front.   As always fun times on the discord and delicious recipes.",
