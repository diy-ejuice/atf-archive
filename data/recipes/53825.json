    "description": "This a tribute to the song, Old Dogs, Children. and Watermelon Wine, written and recorded by Tom T Hall.\r\n\r\n\"Ain't but three things in this world that's worth a solitary dime,\r\nBut old dogs and children and watermelon wine.\"\r\n\"Old dogs care about you even when you make mistakes;\r\nGod bless little children while they're still too young to hate.\"\r\n\r\nHe doesn't go on in the lyrics to tell you why watermelon wine is worth a solitary dime.  My thoughts, since this is a southern song,   We grow watermelons in the south, at least we did when I was a kid, And if it were made into a wine, well damn!  That would be worth a solitary dime.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
