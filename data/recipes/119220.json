  "description": "This is just a cookie dough with nothing else in it. It is really good alone but it could also be used to add too. You could add a chocolate to make chocolate cookie dough. I was aiming for “Dat Cookie Doe” but it is nothing like it. There is a strong cookie dough and a vanilla cream undertone. This is my first recipe ever. I would really like some feedback. ",
