Ever since I started doing DIY I've been chasing a quality, well balanced donut recipe that doesn't need a long steep but has enough going on that I can vape it all day without getting bored. Several years later, I think I've found The One. Big ups to you RUG_ly! Looking forward to trying some of your other recipes soon."
