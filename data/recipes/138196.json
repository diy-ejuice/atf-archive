  "description": "VT Cookies and Cream is a really good flavor imo but it needs help in the texture department.Cap sugar cookie comes in to give the cookie more of a bready consistency. I picked VT Sweet Cream to help boost the cream in VT Cookies and Cream because I felt it needed some density as it is, although a good cream flavor, lacking in texture. It is more like a whipped cream. VT Sweet Cream is a very good cream. It reminds me of frosting or the cream in a twinkie, sort of. Sweetener is always optional, go crazy. This profile had been done and done well, I just wanted to do it with some of the VT flavors that weren't around a few years ago when Chris DVR and ID10-T knocked this profile out of the park. ",
