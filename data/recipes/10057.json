            "text": "Well let me start by saying I may have cheated a little bit. I had a nice large batch of Sugar Cookies and Cream (300ml) sitting around that has been steeping for at least 90 days. That being said, I looked over the differences and the only real change I saw was the addition of the Dark Bean, and a small percentage of Bavarian Cream.. so why not just add it to a 60ml bottle and see what happens. I did just that and let me tell you the results were absolutely spot on for me. I am talking about a 1 day extra steep and the coffee is there, but not overwhelming at all. The added cream I am guessing will continue to come to the top as it sits a little longer. So far after however I am definitely in love with this one. Thanks Chrisdvr1 for the work on this one it is definitely going into my rotation from this point forward. I am using it in a TFV8 with the T10 coils at 140w. I have also tried it on my Temple with dual claptons at .21 at around 100w and it was great there too."
