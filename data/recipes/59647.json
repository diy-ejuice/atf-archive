  "description": "A good ole fashioned Blueberry Cheesecake, still working on it but its getting close if not there already! This is gonna need its full steeping time to come together.\r\n\r\nUpdate: Added FLV Cream to help the cream a little more since this BB seems to be a little potent and to help balance things out. Also kicked up the FLV Cheesecake .5% and took the TFA Cheesecake (GC) down .5% to balance out things a little further\r\n\r\n***If you mix this, please leave a review and let me know what you think or if you think there is something that could be changed to make it better!***",
