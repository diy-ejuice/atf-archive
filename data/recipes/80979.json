    "description": "This is my remix based on the new Dinner Lady Orange Tart profile.\r\n\r\nCredit goes to Daz Cole for inspiration on the pastry Tart base from his excellent lemon Tart remix. \r\n\r\nI find the mix of FA Pandoro, INA biscuit, Cap graham cracker and AP gets as close as I can get to the pastry base used in the original liquids.\r\n\r\nPandoro is essential to this recipe but unfortunately is difficult to get hold of  in the UK so I have had to have it shipped from ecig express in the US or from FA in Italy.\r\n\r\nFlavour Notes:\r\n\r\nThe pastry base:\r\n\r\nINA biscuit, Cap Graham Cracker and FA Pandoro combine to create the pastry base, I definitely taste INA biscuit in the original and when mixed with the wafer note in the graham cracker and the light buttery cake flavour from Pandoro,  I feel this creates an authentic pastry which sits nicely as the base in this recipe.\r\n\r\nI originally used this base without AP and after tasting it in the original liquid I was surprised at what a difference this made when added to the mix. It really helps to bring out the grainy notes in the pastry and helps to keep the layers separate.\r\n\r\nThe Orange Cream layer:\r\n\r\nTpa bavarian Cream and FA meringue are used to help bring the mix together and to also add to the creamy orange I get from the original liquid.\r\n\r\nI think Tpa orange cream is used in the original as I get more of a creamy orange than a straight up Tart citrus flavour . At 3.5% it is prominent in the recipe however I have found it needs a lift to help keep the orange as the top note.  \r\n\r\nFA Royal Orange Juice has been added to help with this. I don't think this is in the original as this flavour has only recently been released but I like the sweet juicy orange which this flavour brings.\r\n\r\nI like Cap super sweet at 0.6% for my recipes but this can be adapted to suit your taste.\r\n\r\nHope you guys enjoy and any feedback would be welcome if you mix this up.
