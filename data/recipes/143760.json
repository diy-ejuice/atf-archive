  "description": "This is a simple passion fruit vape  that just tastes darn good!   on the inhale you get a sweet bright vibrant  passion fruit with  a  slightly floral and orange finish . \r\n Good off the shake better  3 days -   tested and developed on an reload RDA at 55W \r\n\r\nSo you may be thinking WHY OH WHY  did I add   back bar bitters to this .  Well the back bar bitters by FLv seems to me  like an  orange bitters ,  which traditionally have  made from the peels of Seville oranges, cardamom, caraway seed, coriander and burnt sugar in an alcohol base., and create a  unique pairing against the bright tropical notes of the passion fruit.      \r\n\r\nThe combination of  **passion fruit and yellow passion fruit**create  a lovely authentic passion fruit .   I wanted some more of the orange note I get from the  passion fruit so I used that higher but you can use it as a 50/50 .  The yellow passion fruit provides more of a tart finish  that I used at a slightly lower percent\r\n\r\n**Coconut**was used  for some body and creamy notes, to help blend the mix rather then a  dairy cream \r\n\r\n**Back bar bitters** are used for that  bitter orange note that picks up on the orange from the  passion fruit.   It also adds  some darker spices that  get the tropical fruit to pop .  it is noticeable in the exhale and make for a really interesting finish   \r\n\r\nAdd sweetner to your liking I added .5%  of  FLV sweetness   to mine ",
