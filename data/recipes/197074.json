  "description": "This was my go to recipe before I discovered I could no longer vape cinnamon.  For those that can indulge (let me say how jealous I am) this is one of those recipes that I vaped until every last drop in the bottle was gone.  My husband still vapes this in a MTL tank and I seriously think he does it to make me jealous, but enough about that.  It was a sweet, fulfilling flavor with a great balance of cinnamon, cream, and dark undertones.  If you try it make sure to let me know so I can be jealous of you too.",
