  "name": "Killa Kustard Remix v1",
  "description": "This is a remix/clone of Vapetasia's Killa Kustard\r\n\r\nIt might seem simple, but that's kinda the point. Closest I've gotten to the flavor just by keeping it simple. \r\n\r\nNeeds a pretty long steep, offnotes present at first. Might double percentages, and then steep for 3 weeks see what happens. \r\n\r\nIdk, check it out. It's good. \r\n\r\n--- DIYORDIEVAPING.COM THE LEADER IN DIY E-LIQUID DEVELOPMENT AND CONSULTATION. ---",
