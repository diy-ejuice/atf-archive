      "text": "This is a fascinating recipe. All of the goodness that is Lucky Shot, but amplified. The graham cracker is nudged along with the zeppola and sugar cookie, adding sweetness and extra texture. The fresh cream and whipped cream blend together to bolster the vanilla, and add a dollop of creamy goodness on top. The caramel note holds its own, and the injection of flue cured tobacco adds something a touch sweet, yet savory and smoky to the mix, enhancing it overall. It goes from a good dessert to something just flat out decadent. I could see a variety of other tobaccos working out in here as well, but as it stands, this is stellar."
