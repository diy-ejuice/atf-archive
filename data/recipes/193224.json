    "description": "This is a simple yet delectable Strawberry cheesecake!\r\n\r\nWF Strawberry Cheesecake- a very very good cheesecake flavor. Complete, with creaminess, graininess and a perfect, realistic \u201ccheesy\u201d note as you would expect from a cheesecake.\r\n \r\nJF Strawberry Sweet- punches the fruit flavor from the WF Strawberry Cheesecake with a bright, sweet blast of additional strawberry.\r\n\r\nFA Graham Crust- enhances the crust note of the cheesecake. I chose FA, because to me it is the lightest of the Graham\u2019s in flavor and I\u2019m using it to enhance a crust and not introduce a new one. It adds a bit of AP that I think the WF is missing in the mix, and understandably so, being a complete cheesecake concentrate. \r\n\r\nAny and all feedback is welcomed! Enjoy!",
