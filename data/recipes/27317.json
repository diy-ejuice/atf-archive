  "description": "A super juicy, fruity mix that has ended up being an ADV of mine for nearly a year. \r\n\r\nI started trying to clone Strawberry Astronaut, but then kept tweaking and adding until it strayed from the original idea. \r\n\r\nThe two types of strawberry as a base shouldn't need an explanation, but everyone loves strawberry and these are the go-tos.\r\nMy favorite fruit is raspberry, and I Love Razzleberry pie, so I thought the razzleberry from Flavor west would add a nice mixed berry flavor.\r\nThe Mango and Apricot from Inawera are there from the Strawberry Astronaut attempt, but i had switched from TPA to INW because I liked the fresher sweeter fruit flavors found in the INW.\r\nA little bit of INW Cactus was added to add a nice juiciness to the recipe.\r\nThe FLV Guanabana is OPTIONAL, as it is only in my final revision. I just got it and thought it would  help the fruits pop a bit, but my previous versions didn't have it in at all.",
