  "description": "Created for Week 5 of the Mixin Vixens Youtube show.  \r\n\r\nI don't think I really want to play with this flavor any more.  It was sort of a test recipe to see how the flavors work together.  It was surprisingly good.  \r\n\r\nThe Eisai tea has a light floral herbal tea flavor that creates the base of the recipe. \r\n\r\nThe Red Cherry from Molinberry is to me a toned down version of FLV's discontinued Bing Cherry.  In fact during the episode I compare the two out of the bottle and they certain smell very similar.  Juicy Strawberry and Raspberry are only supporting flavors adding to the red notes of the overall flavor.  ",
