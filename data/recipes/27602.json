At the time, I thought it was interesting, but now I've come to realise it's just a mish mash of various flavours, none of which get close to replicating the real thing. The result is just a heavily muted and somewhat boring recipe, with nothing worth remembering. I'm not really sure this deserves to be replicated here, as it's nowhere near the standards set by the majority of recipes on this site. "
