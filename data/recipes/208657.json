  "description": "A delicious blend of fruits perfect for lower wattage/mtl/pod set ups. \r\n\r\nLA Watermelon is a nice sweet candied type watermelon flavor. It's a little thin and weak so it pairs nicely with other fruits. Gonna make this one a little bit tropical with WF Island Mango. Island Mango is a decent artificial mango flavor. There's not too much funk to make this one weird. It goes nicely with watermelon. Of course I like to add a little FA Pear to most of my fruit mixes to make them nice and juicy. It gives those fruits lots of moisture and texture. \r\n\r\nSweeten to taste. \r\n\r\nWatch the Video here: \r\n\r\nhttps://youtu.be/RPeeF0o9IRM",
