    "description": "\r\n\r\n**DESCRIPTION:**\r\n  \r\nA relaxing vanilla tobacco vape with a light butterscotch note and woody bite. Vanilla-forward tobacco.\r\n  \r\n**NOTES:**\r\n  \r\nI've always been a sucker for a good NET and Stixx Mixx makes the best! I use SM Havana Prime here at 5%. TFA Red Oak is added to give it a nice woody kick and a hint of smokiness. FW Butterscotch Natural lends a nice contrast at its' position in the recipe. The butterscotch isn't meant to be in your face in this recipe--it's just there to complement the tobacco.\r\n  \r\nThe vanilla\/creamy part of this was formed with LA Cream Cheese Icing(which you can actually drop to 2% if it's too much for your liking), Vanilla Swirl, and a smidgen of CAP Vanilla Custard. \r\n  \r\nFW Hazelnut of course, provides dairy creaminess and a touch of nuttiness that this recipe needed.\r\n\r\n**Good as a SNV, but surely begins to pop the longer it will sit.**\r\n  \r\n**60\/40 ratio recommended**\r\n\r\n **Do not take it upon yourself to copy and publish this recipe over to ELR. THIS ACTION IS STRICTLY FORBIDDEN.** \r\nRespect mixers, they are not your ticket to success...They are your friends.\r\n\r\n#EJUICEMAKERS",
