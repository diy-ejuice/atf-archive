  "description": "I've been working on this recipe since first trying TFA Banana Nut Bread awhile back and I finally have something that I enjoy quite a bit and I feel others will as well.  \r\n\r\nTFA Banana Nut Bread/WF Banana Puree - The base of this recipe is obviously the TFA BNB but I wanted to boost the banana flavor so I originally started out with TFA Banana Ripe but there was a weird off-note and I just really didn't like that banana flavor at all.  After getting some advice from others I settled on WF Banana Puree as a replacement which is worlds better than Banana Ripe.\r\n\r\nINW Custard/LA Cream Cheese Icing - My early attempts at this recipe were sort of dead/bland on the exhale and it was really annoying me.  During this time I experienced INW Custard for the first time in Mr Burgundy's St Louie Butter Cake recipe, which also included the CCI though I had used it before,  and I knew right away that this is what I needed in my Banana Nut recipe.  The combination of these two flavors add a nice richness with some nice mouthfeel and a buttery sweet banana exhale that is very pleasing.  This really boosts the overall vape experience and I'm very happy with it.\r\n\r\nFW Butter Pecan -  I chose to add this to help accent the nut flavor in the Banana Nut Bread.  It's very subtle but you definitely get the hints of Pecan flavor throughout the vape experience.\r\n\r\nCAP Super Sweet - This was just added for a touch more sweetness.  It's such a small quantity that it can be left out if you choose but I wanted that little extra touch of sweetness so I included it in the recipe.  \r\n\r\nThis is actually quite good as a SNV but it really needs a good week for the Custard and CCI to work their magic.",
