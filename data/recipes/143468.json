  "description": "Original Idea: Churros with ice cream\r\n\r\nProcess: Worked on in the diy_ejuice discord by members who were present. We tried a few different approaches. There was the CDS/idea and the FLV Cinnamon Crunch/AP route. Eventually the CC route was explored and we came up with this recipe with a ton of help along the way. An earlier version will get released soon that was just churro with some slight differences. Keep an eye out for that! Pretty straightforward mix, I'm guessing you are going to be able to figure out what everything is doing here in this mix, so we'll let you have at it. Mix it up!\r\n\r\nDescription: Cinnamon sugar coated fried dough with a thick rich ice cream base\r\n\r\nResult: This mix recreates the sensation of biting into a sugar coated fried dough, well known as a churro, with a smooth rich ice cream. Delivers as promised.\r\n\r\nJoin the discord and share your ideas! https://discord.gg/ufVTyAQ\r\n\r\n3/9/20 Edit: Steep time has been extended due to feedback from folks (annoying ID10-T *cough*) who said he got playdough off the shake. I'm happy off the shake but you may like it more after the funnel cake steeps for a bit longer. :)",

I can tell there's something approximating the churro here, but it isn't quite clicking for me. might be that the texture isn't distinct from the ice cream, sorta like you found a little orphaned bit of churro in the bottom of the dish that's been sitting under the ice cream for 15 minutes and is fully saturated with ice creamy goodness.&#xD;\n&#xD;\nThere's nothing here I actually dislike, and now I kinda want a churro. That's probably a good sign"

I think i can see the play-doughyness that Dave is talking about but I don’t get a whole ton of it. In fact I almost kinda like that little bit that’s in there because it reminds me of the middle of a churro when it’s sometimes soft and almost a tad gooey. I was there to witness the development of this recipe but other than maybe tossing a few ideas around I didn’t take part in it and it’s awesome to finally be able to taste this and see how great it turned out."

      "text": "I did not get any of the play-dough from CAP Funnel Cake that ID10-T talked about. But, I also have not tried it on its own, so I didn't know that CAP Funnel Cakehad a play-dough taste to it and I may have just overlooked it due to it being deliciously covered up with everything else. As always, the ice cream trinity rocks. It is hard to imagine anything using an ice cream base and not using the trinity at this point. The combination of all of the cinnamon flavors, mixed with JF Biscuit, really provides a solid churro flavor and mouthfeel. Great mix!"

      "text": "I'm starting to think anything with the Ice Cream Trinity in it is going to be, at a minimum, pretty tasty. This is that. The only issue I could find with it is that the first time I tried it, I got a little too much of that play-doughy business from the CAP Churro. Recipe says S&amp;V but if it tastes play-doughy to you a day or a week after mixing, give it another week. That goes away. To make this shake &amp; vape for me I'm assuming CAP Churro would have to be replaced with another ingredient, but most of the contenders I could imagine have their own issues. Just wait. It's worth the wait. "
