    "description": "Whilst experimenting, I accidentally managed to come up with a pretty convincing Lilt!\r\n\r\nTo those of you not from the UK, Lilt is a delicious, fizzy pineapple and grapefruit drink made by the coca cola company: \r\n\r\nhttps:\/\/en.m.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Lilt?wprov=sfla1\r\n\r\nI haven't had any for a long time and thought it was discontinued, but apparently you can still buy it (for that 'totally tropical taste'). \r\n\r\nUsing a variation of the lemonade base I posted here:  https:\/\/alltheflavors.com\/recipes\/131996#nice_raspberry_and_grapefruit_lemonade_by_harrynice\r\n\r\nI added FA cold pressed lime and TPA champagne rather than FW lemonade so that it was light and the refreshing sharpness of the drink would come through. \r\n\r\nThen I added the key ingredients (pineapple and grapefruit), gave it a mix and was very pleasantly surprised by just how much it tasted like the real thing... \r\n\r\nThis is good to go as S&V, but give it a week and it should settle into something magical!
