It is Flavor Monks Sweet Betsy Blueberry,,, ATF does Not have The Sweet Betsy Blueberry in the Archive yet at the time this recipe was posted!!!!*******\r\n\r\nTrying a not so complex recipe style today ...\r\nThe Flavor Monks Sweet Betsy Blueberry is awesome , Sweet and has a candy blueberriness paired with HS Blueberry for a slight bit of depth and tartness I also chose to layer in some FLV Blueberry muffin to help the WF fluffy white cake SC. \r\nI chose Wonder Flavors fluffy white cake for this mix simply because i havent used it yet ... so i hope all enjoy ..i will come back and update all my notes after a week ..",
