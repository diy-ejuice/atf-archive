    "description": "I know: There are many pistachio ice cream recipes out there. This is just the way I like it. \r\n\r\nI was disappointed with most I've tried and decided to make my own version. No big notes here on the flavors used, because it's mostly self explanatory, I think. Just 3 little things I want to talk about: \r\n\r\nUsed TPA Sweetener instead of, for example, CAP Super Sweet, because I don't want too much sweetness and the ethyl maltol portion of the TPA Sweetener is doing wonders here. I also love FA's Honey in most creamy profiles, and it fits really well here too. I think the WS-23 is necessary, because, you know, it's an ice cream after all.\r\n\r\nHope you enjoy and have a nice vape!",
