  "description": "8/12/2017 - I have grown to love this Recipe, it is one of my ADV's.  It has changed a lot over the months.  It is Very creamy and that is what I like.  It is good right after mixing but gets better with age.  I always mix a large 250 ml bottle and it lasts about 45 days and after a month it is PERFECTION but still good as a shake and vape.   The flavor % is high, like 25%, I am going to experiment with cutting that back a bit, see if all the flavors are truly needed, but now it is really delicious to me....I hope you mix and enjoy.  Please leave a Comment if you try it, it would be so appreciated....Love to all...Kitten\r\n\r\n4/2017  - Original Idea for this Recipe came from https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/35647#momma_slap_cheesecake_v2_by_folkart  , I made it with what I had on hand and it was good.  Then I thought of ways it could be better...for me...and here it is.  I hope you enjoy, I love it.  I steeped it for 8 days and it became so creamy smooth it was wonderful and delicious.  It did lose a little Strawberry flavor so the last three days I added a few drops of Strawberry Ripe (TFA), then let it set a few more days and it was great.  If you like it sweeter three drops of Sucralose per 10 ML is really good too. .....Love to all...Kitten",
