      "text": "This is pure heaven as snv, but I'm letting it steep as suggested.  This is  a creamy banana taste and mouthfeel. Enough to make you roll your eyes with pleasure! I'm not getting much crust but I didn't have the FLV Graham Cracker so subbed TFA Cheesecake (Graham Crust) at the same percentage.  Also missing TFA Whipped Cream.  Subbed (CAP) Vanilla Whipped Cream V2 at same percentage, and I taste that vanilla just a bit.  Not strong in vanilla flavor, but it's good on top of that rich banana cream!  I wish I'd had all the flavors, but I love what's going on so far!&#xD;\nDamned if this isn't the best banana cream anything I have ever tasted!&#xD;\nThis was my favorite recipe I've mixed so far!  It held up throughout the rest of December with no nasty changes or fading of flavor over time!  I love this and I get my new concentrates on Saturday, but I'll be mixing this up b4 they arrive, using what I already had on hand with my first try!  It's too good to wait!  I'm never going to be without this delicious Vape! mmmm..&#xD;\nJust finished my 3rd bottle of this, using the flavors listed in the recipe now, and I think it only gets better with time.  Absolutely delicious, true banana cream.  I'm not getting much crust or caramel but I don't care.  This is all that and then some.  In my daily rotation.  "
