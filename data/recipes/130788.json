  "description": "A bright Raspberry recipe with plenty of mouth feel. Although a dark fruit, it's brightened by a touch of lemon lime and (optional) sweetener. Just a taste of black currant to darken the berry notes without taking the whole recipe over. It's great off the shake, but I recommend giving it a day or two, optimally three days for everything to congeal appropriately. I squonk alot lately, so I've recommended a 65% VG mixture, but the flavor will withstand max VG for those of you who are so inclined. \r\n\r\nIt's a simple recipe and should give a good representation on an easy method to brighten darker fruits, allowing more flavor and depth to be uncovered in any device. I've tested with single coil, dual coil and tanks and it holds up well. Crystal clear and not bad on the coils. I hope you enjoy it. I've also tried it with a number of cooling concentrates with good success. I prefer Flavorah's cool menthol @ .5 and FW Extreme Ice @ 1%, but surely any ws-23/koolada clone would work, but beware of some slight muting. \r\n\r\nThroughout development of this recipe, I had written RA on the side of my bottles, indicating Raspberry. Over time I just started calling it Ra. On a whim, it's been dubbed Amun Ra, after the egyptian god. ",
