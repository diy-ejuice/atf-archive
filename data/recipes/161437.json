My loooonnnnngggg search for one of the most unattainable profiles in DYI has finally been realized - a true coffee with no skunky, rubbery, burnt or chemical vibes....\r\nVT Arabica coffee is a phenomenal coffee flavor and accurately expresses all that is the magnificence of coffee = balanced aroma, lively acidity and full body. Period.\r\n\r\nThe ultra creamy coffee milk froth is a thing of beauty and then some... The best way to describe it is when you use your spoon or finger (my favorite utensil ) to scoop the last delectable milk froth remains from the side of your cappuccino cup and after you dispensed of your (overpriced) cappuccino. The rich, naturally sweet textured milk has just a touch of espresso and it is so good that you are tempted to order another just to lick the froth from the cup! \r\n\r\nSweetened with a touch of caramel toffee, this is my favorite coffee combo to date. \r\n\r\nThis baby needs 7 days or so for the coffee to extract to perfection.\r\n\r\n",
