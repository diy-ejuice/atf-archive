  "description": "I've been craving a cinnamon vape for a while and wanted a change from my usual custards and desserts, I thought a Cinnamon Cereal with milk would satisfy this, this turned out exactly how I wanted and is delicious. Based on Golden Graham Cereal a UK cereal a little like Cinnamon Toast Crunch. You can SnV but for me this needs at least 3 weeks for the milk element to come through properly\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTested on a Profile 1.5 @ 0.2ohm and 75w.\r\n\r\nThe main cereal is FLV Cinnamon Crunch @ 2% for a light dusting of cinnamon and the main textute of this cereal, CAP Sugar Cookie @3% blends with the Cinnamon crunch and further enhances that texture, FA Graham Crust at 0.5% adds a little butter to the mix adding the golden element as well as providing a little more texture.\r\n\r\nThe milk base is FA Milk at 1.25% for that whole milk taste, CAP Sweet Cream added at 1% to sweeten the milk a little and enhance the mouthfeel, these together give a pleasant full fat milk with a creamy mouthfeel\r\nFinally 0.25% CAP SS added to enhance the sweetness of the mix bringing it more inline with the sweetness of most breakfast cereals",
