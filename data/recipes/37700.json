    "description": "There are a few twister ice cream recipes out there some good some not so good, but every one I have tried I have always thought it could be better so this is mine and I hope you enjoy it as much as I do. With spring now appearing and the promise of summer on the horizon this is the perfect summer time vape.\r\n\r\nTPA VBIC 3.5% \/ CC Devon cream 1.5%\r\nThis is a thick and creamy ice cream base for all the other flavours to sit on top of. Its strong enough to be present through the vape but not overtake the whole recipe. TPA VBIC is my go to ice cream flavour so seemed like the obvious choice to start with and the addition of CC Devon Cream is a great supporting flavour to the VBIC and helps bring out that rich creaminess that is required and helps give the recipe that cream base for all the other flavours to cling onto.\r\n\r\nTPA Pineapple 2.5% \/ TPA Dragon Fruit 0.5%\r\nTPA Pineapple is a good flavouring for this recipe and I have tried a few in it. It has a good citrus sharpness that I wanted to have in this recipe but by itself it can be too sharp and can easily overpower a recipe and bully other flavours to sit behind it and I didn't want that so the addition of TPA Dragon Fruit helps round down the sharper notes and helps it sit nicely with the other citrus flavours. The other reason for the Dragon Fruit addition is it gives the whole recipe a bit of juiciness that you would expect from an Ice Lolly.\r\n\r\nFA Lime Tahity Cold Press 1.5% \/ CAP Italian Lemon Sicily 0.5%\r\nFA Lime Tahity Cold Press is a fantasic flavour and one I use a lot, Its a lovely natural tasting lime that is a good pairing with the TPA Pineapples natural sharpness. The addition of CAP Italian Lemon Sicily was used because I felt the lime just needed a bit of a kick to help it sit more forward as I wanted sitting beside the pineapple.\r\n\r\nINW Shisha Strawberry 3%\r\nI used this strawberry because I my opinion this is the best strawberry out there. It has a good full flavour that can stand up to a lot of flavours and can handle a steep without fading. I tried pairing this with a few different strawberry options but to be honest I thought it worked better alone in this case and of course the addition of TPA Dragon Fruit also helped pad this strawberry out a bit anyway. I wanted this strawberry to be present but sitting more in the background like you were licking the lolly rather than taking a bite out of it.\r\n\r\nCAP Super Sweet 0.5%\r\nNow this is really down to personal taste but I really do think this recipe really does benefit from a touch of super sweet to give it a bit more sweetness against the sharp notes that in the recipe and helps just round the whole recipe together a bit more but this can be adjusted to your personal taste.",

The only thing that is off to me is the TPA pineapple doesn\u2019t appear to be blending as well as the other fruits and is giving it a touch of a skunky note.  Not real off putting but it is there.  Over all pleasant vape.  "
