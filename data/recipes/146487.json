  "description": "Once upon a time, a friend of mine described to me a flavor by 63 Maui. Now defunct, and recipes not released, I had nothing to test against. So I went after making my own version of Aole Pilikia (https://www.juicedb.com/juice/15730/aole-pilikia-by-63-maui)\r\n\r\nI may have missed the mark, but what came out was undeniably very tasty. Vaguely reminds me of a Moscow mule.\r\n\r\nLet this one sit for a few days to let the lime calm down a bit, but if you want that fresh citrus bite, it's still quite tasty day one.",
