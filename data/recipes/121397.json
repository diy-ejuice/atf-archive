She absolutely loved it luckily, and claims its one of the best mixes I've made to date. I keep a pretty nice size bottle of this around for her at this point now. It's a very nice tropical vape and all around very refreshing. "

The strawberries hang out in the background but sweeten up the whole profile while also subduing some of the weirdness I personally get from the guava. I love the FA coconut and sweet coconut combo. I might steal that idea one day! I haven\u2019t tried loads of tropical recipes but the ones I have tried have been more candy-ish. This is like a nice refreshing fruit juice. I did add a little bit of sweetener before I had vaped it for the first time. Next time I\u2019m going to try leaving that out to see if that makes the fruit more authentic tasting. It\u2019s so yummy. Thanks for sharing this recipe. "

            "text": "I'm finishing up a batch of this about a month old at this point. I've really been digging the juice. It brings a very smooth, balanced tropical delight right into your taster no matter how cold and snowed in it is outside. To me the strawberry takes a bit of a backseat for the guava and coconut and the marshmallow seems to smooth it all together in a very pleasant way. Hula scratches my itch for straight fruit juice and being such a delightful SNV I'll be keeping this recipe in rotation to mix up whenever I need something on the fly or am itching for some tropical goodness. I would definitely recommend this if you're a fan of tropical fruits or need a break from the heavier vapes like bakery\/tobacco flavors."

            "text": "This recipe is an awesome, and incredibly well-balanced blend of fruits that you should mix up if you're into tropical luxury. I tried this before the FA Marshmallow was added to smooth out any harshness, so your version will probably be even better. The combination of guava and coconut makes a wonderfully smooth and creamy base, and throwing in some sweet strawberry magic is never a bad choice. This will be in my SNV rotation for a very long time. "
