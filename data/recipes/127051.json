    "description": "Here is another 2 ingredient recipe. Mouthfeel is full and a rich vanilla custard is the initial flavor with the vanilla sweetened strawberry on the exhale and a tasty treat when you open your mouth and let it breathe. This needs a 2-5 day steep. When it turns a rich rose color it is ready. Lovely CAP Vanilla custard for that rich base and FA Red Touch to give it a nice strawberrylicious balance. This is another of my ADV's. Easy and delicious, but it needs the steep!",
