Vape it or else. \r\n\r\nAdd menthol if you\u2019re into it. Add sweetener if you want to punish your cotton. I don\u2019t care. I won\u2019t even know you did it. I\u2019ll never even meet you. You kinda don\u2019t even exist. ",

I mixed it again dropping the Mango and Juicy Peach each by 1% and the strawberry  came out. Not to the forefront as you would expect by the name, but it was there nonetheless. I did enjoy this experience and the vape from both mixes. Thank you for the creativity and the lesson on how these flavors interact. Flavors I may never have thought to mix myself. Kudos."
