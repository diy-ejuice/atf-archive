  "description": "A milk chocolate glazed doughnut filled with a butterscotch cream filling and some almonds thrown in\r\nFA Zeppola acts as the doughnut base.imo it's the perfect plain doughnut flavour there is.\r\nFW Hazelnut makes the doughnut i bit darker and bridges the dough with the chocolate\r\nINW Milk Chocolate- I still have a 500ml bottle of the old version and it's awesome.If you don't have it i guess you can sub it for JF's version.I've never tried it myself but i only heard good things.\r\nThe Filling:\r\nFW Butterscotch Ripple/FA Caramel - Ripple is a soft,creamy butterscotch which is ideal for what i need in here.The Caramel lends a sharper top note to the butterscotch and adds some separation in between the filling and the doughnut\r\nCAP Super Sweet - 1 drop per 10ml is enough but you shouldn't leave it out\r\nFA Almond - that's the only little problem i have here.the almond doesn't sit on top as i would have imagined,nevertheless i can taste it in there and it's good\r\nMaybe some mixologists like ConcreteRiver, ID10-T or ENYAWREKLAW could solve this problem but for now i'm happy with the result.\r\nIt's a fucking delicious doughnut so enjoy and leave your thoughts!\r\n\r\nEDIT:If you leave the chocolate out,you got yourself a delicious recipe as well! \r\n \r\n",
