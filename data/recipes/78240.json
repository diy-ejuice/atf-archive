  "description": "Flavor notes:\r\nOne on One: Orange (Popsicle) its in this mix cause i wanted a candy orange witch would both give flavor and sweetness to the mix.\r\nOne On One: Gummy Bear and 27 Bears Capella: I wanted the gummy flavor and these two united give the perfect gummy, its sweet, its candy, its perfect.\r\n\r\nIts a simple recipe both it works very well and to me its almost spot on, this is shake and vape recipe.\r\n\r\nI have mixed this in 50/50 VG/PG but if you plan to mix this in high VG I recommend you add twice as much concentrate soo the final result will be 20%\r\nInstead of the 10% it is right now.",
