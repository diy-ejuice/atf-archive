  "description": "*FLAVOR NOTES*\r\n  \r\n\r\nThe 1st layer of this fabulous dessert is the crust. In the edible recipe this is made up of flour, butter and crushed pecan. To accomplish a realistic representation of this, I started with FW Butter Pecan. This is an amazing flavor. And added to INW Biscuit, it forms the perfect crust needed to mimic the dessert.\r\n  \r\nOur next layer above the crust is a mixture of cream cheese, powdered sugar and whipped cream. This layer has a particularly thick mouth feel to it. It's thick. And it's heavy. To accomplish this I chose the obvious LA Cream Cheese Icing along with CAP's Vanilla Whipped Cream. This mixture still needed a boost imho in terms of thickness and sweetness. That's when I added FA Vienna Cream(thick and somewhat buttery). TFA Meringue is used for 2 things-the powdered sugar of this layer and enhances the following layer.\r\n  \r\nThe next layer is just...awesome. Its pistachio pudding and milk. I used TFA Pistachio for its' lovely sweet flavor. To that I added a bit of INW Marzipan & FA Almond. TFA Meringue was added to make the mixture more of a milky pudding-like consistency.\r\n  \r\nAnd the last layer is simply....whipped cream. Mmmm. I also wanted to bring out the inherent sweetness of several concentrates so I added a bit of EM, which performed this action perfectly.\r\n  \r\nIncluded below is the actual edible recipe. Whip it up. I think you'll really enjoy it!!\r\n  \r\n*INGREDIENTS:*\r\n  \r\n1 1/2 cup flour\r\n  \r\n1/2 cup softened butter\r\n  \r\n1/2 cup chopped pecans\r\n  \r\n1(8 ounce) package cream cheese(I actually use 12 ounces for a thicker layer)\r\n  \r\n2/3 powdered sugar\r\n  \r\n1(16 ounce) container Cool Whip\r\n  \r\n2 3/4 cups milk\r\n  \r\n2(8 ounce) packages instant pistachio pudding mix\r\n  \r\n*DIRECTIONS:*\r\n  \r\n1. Preheat oven 375Â°\r\n  \r\n2. Add butter, flour, and nuts to food processor. Pulse until a crumbly dough forms.\r\n  \r\n3. Press mixture into 9x13 pan & bake for 15 minutes. Set aside to cool COMPLETELY.\r\n  \r\n4. Beat cream cheese, powdered sugar and 1/2 container Cool Whip with electric mixer. Spread over COOLED crust.\r\n  \r\n5. Beat milk & pudding mix with electric mixer on low setting. Let stand until set. Carefully spread over cream cheese layer.\r\n  \r\n6. Spread the remaining half of Cool Whip over the pudding layer.\r\n  \r\n7. If desired, top with additional chopped pecans, pistachios, almonds, or walnuts.\r\n  \r\n8. Cover & refrigerate one hour. Cut into squares & serve. Store in refrigerator up to 5 days\r\n  \r\nI like this as a shake and vape but of course with all the creams, it improves vastly after 3-7 days. My problem is, I just can't WAIT that long!! Really pops at 16+ days! 70% VG is preferred for the thick mouth feel of the creams.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n**Do not take it upon yourself to copy and publish this recipe over to ELR. THIS ACTION IS STRICTLY FORBIDDEN.** \r\nRespect mixers, they are not your ticket to success...They are your friends.\r\n\r\n#EJUICEMAKERS",
