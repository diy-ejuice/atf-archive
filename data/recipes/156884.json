  "description": "The famous Pistachio RY4 profile, with just 2 flavors. Great after a bit of steeping, give it 2 weeks or so.\r\n\r\nI know DFS Holy Grail RY4 v1 is going out of production, but sources say the v2 might even be better, so I'm confident this recipe will still be sick.",

The pistachio is very heavy and creamy in this recipe, but fits strangely well considering it holds up against the RY4 all on it's own.&#xD;\nThe Ry4 is a little in the background, but it's really comfortable. Very great vape."
