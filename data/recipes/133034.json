  "description": "Since i was looking for a nice authentic churro recipe and i couldn't find any which caters to my needs,i decided to make my own and boy it's great.\r\nImo it tastes like a real churro you can buy at some mexican street vendor.\r\nThe zeppola and the funnel cake make the base here.The Biscuit gives it more of a soft buttery consistency,just like a real churro.To give it the sugar coating FA Meringue gets the job done.0,25% is just what you need.More and the Meringue gets to overpowering and that's not what you want.\r\nOf course a churro needs some cinnamon.And what's the best cinnamon out there? Right,FLV Rich Cinnamon.1 drop per 30ml is enough to give it that nice,crisp cinnamon taste.\r\nHoly Vanilla is just here to fill it out a bit and to make it even more creamy,or less baked.Not like a cinnamon danish.\r\nThat's it,enjoy and leave review!\r\n",

But you know what? They oddly work great in this recipe! No dryness, no odd off-notes of play dough. It's a very enjoyable vape that had me vapin' it for two days straight."
