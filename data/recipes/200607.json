    "description": "Have been working on a strawberry kiwi recipe for my girlfriend so I can stop buying juice head strawberry kiwi which is her all time favorite juice. While this doesn't taste like juice head, she says it tastes just as good.\r\n\r\nThe thing about juice head is the kiwi end on it. She doesn't know what it is about it, but she loves it. I think theres a lot of kiwi in that juice with a nice strawberry finish, so I set out to make something like that.\r\n\r\nIt first started as 2 kiwi's and 1 strawberry, good, but not quite there. Then we I did 3 kiwi's and 1 strawberry. better, but still not there.\r\nThen I started adding 1 more strawberry to the mix. Did Sweet Strawberry cap. We were getting there. Then I tried Red Touch. and that added the nice strawberry finish to it. We were almost there. now we were missing that potent kiwi upfront.\r\n\r\nI decided to add the final kiwi. FA Kiwi. 4 Kiwi's. 2 Strawberries. It is complete. she loves this juice.",
