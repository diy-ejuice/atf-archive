  "description": "The VBIC, Fresh Cream and Sweet Cream make a nice milkshake base, the two creams have been my go to for milky bases for a while, I added a little bit of Vanilla Custard just for extra thickness.\r\nI typically use TPA Strawberry Ripe and CAP Sweet Strawberry as my realistic strawberry stone, but as I was mixing, I was hit with the desire to throw in a strawberry flavor I almost never use, TPA Strawberry, which has that nice strawberry hard candy flavor. \r\n\r\nDr. Gonzo strikes again! Just saw an old terrible strawberry milkshake profile from a mix I'd tried to make in some of my first attempts at recipes (this is why keeping notes is so handy!). Immediately started a fresh attempt. Last minute I decided to add TPA Strawberry and CAP Vanilla Custard.  \r\n\r\nYou can SnV, but for once I wouldn't actually recommend it, the first week it actually has a freeze dried ice cream kinda vibe to me, but I'd wait at least a week if you want to get that creamy malty milk shake taste and texture. \r\n\r\nHope you enjoy, as always, any feedback at all is most seriously appreciated ✌️",

The sweet cream is what makes this so different. It tastes like the malted milkshake was made with sweet cream as opposed to milk, and just makes this a lovely experience. I'd never be able to drink such a thing, but as a vape, this is awesome. Worth waiting the week.uff is quite amazing. The strawberry is absolutely on point here.
