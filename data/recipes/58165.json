  "description": "Sweet and Spiced Jamaican Rum blended with coconuts, pineapple and orange. \r\n\r\nThe wife wanted a vape based off one of her Jamaican Me Crazy drinks she gets every now and then. I figured it wouldn't be too hard. Its still warm outside so cool off with this sweet, mixed drink!\r\n\r\nJamaica Special - A great spiced rum. Very boozey, which is what we are aiming for here. \r\n\r\nCoconut Candy/Coco' - This is a great sweetened drink-esque coconut mix. Not harsh at all, slightly creamy which helps the pineapple and the orange blend mix into the rum\r\n\r\nGolden Pineapple - One of my favorite pineapples and tastes great here\r\n\r\nTanger/Orage - I find this blends into a great orange flavor. Its sweet, ripe, slightly crisp and riney. \r\n\r\nAs an added bonus ;) If you just do the Jamaica Special and Coconuts at the given %'s, you get an almost spot on Malibu Coconut Rum. So, got you 2 recipes in one guys! This is a pretty satisfactory SnV, but I would say give it 3-5 days for the fruits to meld into the rum, which does help bring the booze flavor down a tad. ",
