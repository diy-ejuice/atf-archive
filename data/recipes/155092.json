  "description": "Balerion is the dragon that Aegon used to conquer the seven kingdoms  (just a little GoT lore now that the show is over) You see its skull (dragons are neither male no female) in the show Under the red keep... So honestly was mixing up single flavor testers for the OOO Dragonfruit(Like Inw dragonfruit but sweeter) & INW Prickly Pear (Think of Inw Cactus with all its juicy attributes expect it has a kind of melon-y aspect to it),  I got the bottles mixed up and ended up putting both into the same bottle was a delicious mistake to me kinda of tastes like a melon hi chew, this had a good amount of flavor )for such a low percentage of flavor that  but was lacking some body which is why the FA Apple Fuji (Fuji Apple) is in there it brings another level of juiciness. The JF Sweet Strawberry adds sweetness and IMO make everything pop along with the cap double apple which is there to also support the Fuji .I previously had Cap Tart Cherry (0.25%) in this and it was holding this recipe back IMO. I have been working on this recipe for about 2-3 months I am finally at a point where I can say ive explored this profile enough and finalize =]\r\n\r\nAdd Sweetener to taste but i used 1 drop of FW Sweetener & 1 drop of TPA Sweet & Tart\r\n\r\n i would love to hear some feedback and what you guys would take out move sub or whatever   or if you guys would leave it as is. Also a tip to other beginners like me dont throw away your mixes try them taste em even if they suck atleast you learned something =] hope you guys enjoy everyone that tried this in person liked it.  I would love to know what i could do better\r\n\r\nhttps://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Balerion",
