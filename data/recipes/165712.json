  "description": "I love coconut sticky rice and  really wanted to see how close I could come to it .     On the inhale you get the lemon/lime  and some of the paw paw notes that transitions to the coconut and rice.  \r\nThe rice is a mix of sweet rice which is a sweet slightly creamy note and the rice base which  helps to support with  some texture and rice aroma \r\nI love sweet coconut by flv  it adds body  and creaminess to the mix  but I wanted that coconut to really pop   so FA coconut   works or even a little  TPA  coconut candy  could help if you want more sweetness.\r\npaw paw is a great fruit it has mango and cantaloupe notes    with a creamy almost  banana body   \r\nthe lemongrass and lime add some brightness and top notes that works in this mix .  lemongrass is a pretty potent and has a light floral note to it  that can be noticed in back end but  works in this mix   for me \r\nThe vanilla cream just help fill in the body and blend this mix  and adds a brighter vanilla note \r\nI wanted more sweetness in this,  so I added sweetness -  but sweeten to your taste ",
