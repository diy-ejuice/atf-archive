My opinion is leave the spice and add just a touch of sweetener to bring the pastry dough forward. But really it's well played as is, and my 1st experience with cardamom flavoring. "

This is my second 30ml I'm mixing up because I remember it being a light but flavorful base to showcase the cardamom flavor I love so much. I'm tempted to add cinnamon like some others but resist the urge. Cinnamon is a show boater. Let the little guy shine here. If you desperately need some extra add some floral top or something and let cardamom stand on its own feet."

But almost gave only 4 stars due to false advertising; this is not just a \"touch\" of cardamom - it's super cardamommy. Will definitely mix again, might cut the spice in half next time to see how that sweet dough tastes without so much of it. But might not, because it is so, so good.  "
