      "text": "Refreshing peach-orange-cranberry mix and an outstanding example of how a little FLV Cranberry can go a long way. TFA Nectarine just makes such a great peach nectar flavor in a beverage profile like this and all three work together beautifully, especially the brighter Nectarine with the more syrupy blood orange. The flavor gently shifts from more peachy to an orange juice body to more of that deeper cranberry flavor, so it doesn’t have clear layers of each, but also isn’t everything all mushed together. At the same time that they take turns being in the forefront, none were ever really completely absent, and the finish seems fuller and sweeter than any one of these flavors are on their own, but they they taste like natural or lightly sweetened natural juice rather than candied or artificial, and even has a wet beverage feel. Together it makes for a satisfying summer fruit vape that’s much more interesting than a simple combination of three flavors might imply. I think it might be harsh for some people, I’m not sure: I thought I maybe felt a little scratch in the throat at first, but rather than building and getting worse the way harshness often does, I got used to or whatever was causing it vaped off first, or it was all in my head, who knows. I’m definitely going to slip some WS-23 in here and see if it can be even more refreshing without upsetting what tastes like a perfectly selected balance of flavors.  "
