  "description": "When your stuck on a desert Island and need a nice juicy vape to quence your thirst and brighten your day with it's delicious flavor...\r\n\r\nJF Honey Peach: a nice sweet ripe juicy peach.\r\n\r\nWF Island Mango: a delicious juicy ripened mango that seems to encompass the whole mango flavor including the peel as it seems to have a interesting (but not off putting) funk to it that sets it apart from all the others out there.\r\n\r\nINW Cactus: for added juiciness and hey, what else would you find in a desert? ðŸŒµ\r\n\r\nFA Apricot: to help bridge the peach and mango while adding even more juiciness to help quence your thirst.\r\n\r\nI don't have alot of experience with these flavors since I just picked them up over Labor Day weekend sales... I think that it's turned out pretty damn well for just picking flavors to go together... Mix it up, quence your palate, and let me know what you think... Hope y'all enjoy! ðŸ˜Ž",
