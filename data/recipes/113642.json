  "description": "To me this image shows a cookie cake with ice cream on top and a nice buttery nutty gooey topping.\r\n\r\nI used TFA Graham Cracker Clear and Sweet Dough for my bakery component. The FA Graham is a very nice graham cracker cookie, more along the lines of an animal cracker type graham with very little if any spice notes. The TFA Graham Cracker is nice and deep dark golden graham like and the sweet dough moistens it up a tad. \r\n\r\nI built the ice cream note out of the new FA Vanilla Ice cream and Cap Vanilla Custard V1. Stay with me a minute because I bet you are wondering why Cap Custard V1 since it is so eggy... well I needed it to play in the mix for my drizzle, so just trust me it works. \r\n\r\nFA maple syrup is the perfect maple for this with all the heavy creams and the bakeries involved. It is strong enough to stand up but at 0.5% it folds into the body of the drizzle that is composed of Cap Butter cream and FLV Butterscotch. I used FA Pistachio as the main nut because it isn't a pistachio that taste like pudding, it is more along the lines of a real pistachio nut with the oily aspect and dryness of the real thing. I used Marzipan as a binder for cream notes but it also serves as a separator for the nut part of the recipe. I hope you all enjoy.\r\n",
