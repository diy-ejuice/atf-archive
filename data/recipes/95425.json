  "description": "A lovely Vanilla Ice cream soda with a little Fizz. As per the picture I purchased a F&N Ice-Cream soda after never having one before. I then set out to develop a replica of what I experienced and I am happy to say that this recipe IMO does it with around 95% accuracy. \r\n\r\nVT Fizzy Sherbet is what helps the VT Creaming Soda to bring out that little bit of Fizz type of feel. The LB ice-cream is all that is needed to get the notes I required to get those ice - creamy notes. This has a very prominent smooth vanilla flavor through the middle hence the INW Shisha Vanilla and also gives some lovely caramel toward the back where the FA Caramel works so well. Like most soda's there is sweetness that demands a sweetener hence there but niced & low. I hope you enjoy this as much as I do ! It's  lovely!\r\n\r\nSee it being created here: https://youtu.be/C76vcUEuUj4?t=16m19s",

Ive also never tried this soda but vaping this recipe makes me wish they sold here in canada!  Fizzy sherbet does amazing things for adding fizz to a recipe and VT seems to be able to do this effect so well in their flavorings.  thanks for the uniquely crafted recipe :)"
