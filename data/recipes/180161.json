  "description": "Also 1% Blueberry juice ripe that hasn't been added to this site yet.  This flavor, to me, is very jam like so I figured it would be perfect for a pie filling. Blueberry muffin helps add a non-floral blueberry note as well as the added bakery for the muffin. I am not a fan of pie crust flavorings so I've been attempting to \"build\" a pie crust using a variety of different flavors. NR Sugar crunch also is used to enhance the pie crust note. Vanilla whipped cream was added to smooth and provide a light vanilla note.",
