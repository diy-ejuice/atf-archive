    "description": "Graham Central Station:\r\n\r\nA sweet and creamy graham cracker infused desert tobacco blend paired with subtle notes of butterscotch and hazelnut. Tasty with morning coffee. This is one of my ADV's and it's designed to be more \"commercial\" with a bold amount of flavor, sort of a similar experience as an RY4. The Red Burley fades a bit after a week or so becoming more of a \"flavoring\" than a \"tobacco flavor\" but falls inline with the dessert like profile and offers just enough of a tobacco note to satiate my love for savory vapes. The Bavarian cream and butterscotch provide a deep, sweet and creamy base which is by design (Maybe too creamy for some.) The hazelnut is not so discernible as it is used to add a bit more creamy and a bit more savory. I use this in my Berserker Mini MTL at anywhere from .4-.8ohms, twisted kanthal or Clapton wire with Cotton Bacon Prime wick and I would assume it would be great in a tank as well. May be too robust for dripping depending on how full flavor you like to vape, but tastes pretty good (to me) out of a Hadaly. This can be a SNV though it benefits greatly from a crockpot steep on warm for a few hours and is best IME 3 days after that, it really helps the Bavarian Cream\/Butterscotch bloom underneath everything. Enjoy!",
