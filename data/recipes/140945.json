  "description": "Finally picked up INW Lemon Cake and it is pretty tasty. And what better way to eat lemon cake than with blueberry.\r\n\r\nBlueberry - FLV Blueberry Muffin to add a baked blueberry and FW Blueberry to add just a bit of brightness to the blueberry\r\nLemon Cake - INW Lemon Cake alone makes up the cake layer. It is a bit light on texture but seems to come across here.\r\nFrosting - VT Vanilla Buttercream Frosting for a great cream frosting, VT Sweet Cream for mouthfeel and FA Meringue for added sweetness.\r\n\r\nThis is early in the process but after 3 days, it seems pretty full flavored. It still needs a longer steep test, which may require some tweaking later.",
