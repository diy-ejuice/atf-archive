This will bring back those childhood memories but with this recipe you wont run out of flavor after 30 seconds.\r\n\r\nThis recipe mainly comes from a post by HIC on the VU forums, however, the original recipe was not even close to an authentic Dubble Bubble flavor. HIC did quite a bit of research in regards to finding the flavor components that make up Dubble Bubble, so I can not take credit for most of this recipe. \r\n\r\nIn order for the recipe to taste more accurate, I had to alter the ratios of the 4 main components of DB being: Orange, wintergreen, vanillin, and cinnamon. The original recipe used FA Orange but I felt that SC Orange was a better fit due to it being a bit sweeter and candylike. If you dont have SC Orange then FA orange at 1.25% is a suitable substitute. I also ended up adding a touch of TPA Marshmallow for mouthfeel, and a small amount of LA Bubble Gum to help fill in the gaps between the main flavor components. CAP Super Sweet at 0.5 provides an authentic level of sweetness, however it's entirely optional. Also, you may even want to drop the cinnamon a bit more as it comes off as slightly harsh as an SnV, however I think 0.1% is where it needs to be to supply that accurate level of cinnamon flavor.\r\n\r\nThis recipe seems to be best when vaped after 3 days up to 2 weeks due to the amount of vanillin which will eventually mute and throw things out of proportion a bit.\r\n\r\nAs stated before I would wait at least 3 days to vape this recipe in order to let the cinnamon die down a bit. After that, this becomes quite smooth and all of the flavors homogenize nicely.\r\n\r\nHope you enjoy this neat recipe!\r\n",
