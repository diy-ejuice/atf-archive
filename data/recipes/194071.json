  "description": "Blue Razz is the main profile, and we all know Blue Razz is amazing, but then you throw in some Black Cherry and it gets a really good sour feel without taking away too much from the profile. Blackberry's there to give it a full mouthfeel with its jammyness and adds just a bit more tart to the overall cherry sour.\r\n\r\nWith all that said, in the end, it really feels like tasting like a Chazzberry with how everything fits together. Very wet, very sweet, sharp, and just enough sour and tart.\r\n\r\nPerfectly acceptable after a SNV but give it 24 hours to settle and the sourness gets brought out more. I'm sure more days could really flesh this out.\r\n\r\nReddit link: https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/gh6u71/better_business_bureau/?",
