  "description": "**Releasing this now, have not finished testing.\r\n\r\nIf you're like me, finding your ADV at a local shop seemed impossible. You tried with no avail, you searched online shops such as VW and MBV because they were less expensive. I found some pretty decent vapes at a good price from VW. One of my all time favorites from them was their Cinnamon Roll. This is my attempt.\r\nEvery attempt at this profile has included some kind of \"cinnamon roll\" flavoring. Liquid Barn, Flavor West, Capella, but none of them really did what I needed them to. I figure it will work best if I try to do it from scratch.\r\nFLV Sweet Dough and FW Yellow Cake make up the bakery aspect.\r\nFLV Caramel and Rich Cinnamon make up the spices/flavoring.\r\nCAP Vanilla Custard ties it together creating the ooey gooey inside.\r\n\r\nSnV: Off the rip this one is a winner. Cinnamon isn't too heavy, the dough isn't too dry. The FLV caramel adds to the cinnamon sweetness. The vanilla custard creates a subtle frosting note. Can't wait to see how this one turns out after a little steep. \r\n\r\nWeek 1: \r\n",
