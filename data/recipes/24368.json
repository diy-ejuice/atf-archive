      "text": "I've never tried Mike's Melons, having tried TFA Mango and TFA Papaya individually, it didn't look like something I wanted to try with those mixed together at such high %s. On one hand, I can't imagine this not being an improvement on the original. However, the papaya is overpowering here. I like TFA Papaya in moderation but it is a bully. I'm not really getting any cantaloupe, I'm not sure what TFA Mango is bringing to the table, and the little hint of strawberry is a tad waxy. Seems like a step in the right direction but more steps are needed - try even less papaya, a brighter strawberry, and something like FLV Cantaloupe and FLV Mango that will stand out against both if you really want a Papaya-Mango-Cantaloupe-Strawberry vape.

Cantaloupe was a sweet green taste like rine. Mango tasted awful. So bad batch or just a shit flavor. I heard sumone say jungle flavors or cap Mango. I'm going to get both and throw out 4 oz of tfa I just got. o I single flavor tested papaya 1%up to 10% all good and sweet no harsh. I'm going to try this mix wo mango. Thanx"
