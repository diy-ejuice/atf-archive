            "text": "FLV Boysenberry, melon, and lemon go so well together. Personally, I would like the lemon to be a little bit more forward and make a boysenberry lemonade rather than just a bit of lemon behind this melon-forward recipe, but all of these things taste like they belong together. I love Wild Melon but it sometimes gets a teensy bit soapy on me at 2% and higher, depending on what it\u2019s mixed with, and it does here, but I\u2019m not holding it against this recipe because because there are a lot of people who don\u2019t have that issue. I\u2019d like to mix it again with half a percent of the Wild Melon replaced with half of a percent of a more assertive lemon. "
