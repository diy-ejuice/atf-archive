    "description": "This is a mexican rice milk with cinnamon and some fresh strawberries smashed up and thrown into the blender.\r\nThe base here is TPA Horchata Smooth,which is a really good place to start with.\r\nCAP Graham Cracker has 2 purposes here.To get some thickness and to infuse a touch more cinnamon.The perfect ingredient for this kind of recipe imo\r\nTPA CGA brings some dairy notes and some body as well to the mix\r\nCAP VBIC here as to get some vanilla in there and to thicken up the horchata.\r\nFE Sweet rice is...you guessed right,to get even more rice flavour.you could pump it up to 4 or 5% if you prefer a more ricy taste\r\nFinally the Strawberry mix.Now this one is a classic 2014\/15 combo which still works:why change a winning team? But feel free to use your favourite strawberry combo.\r\nEnjoy! ",
