    "description": "Was looking to make a pretty spot on Kringles Curse vape and I feel like this is very close...it's cold cold cold and very sweet..You can cut back on the sweetener obviously but the original is very sweet like a candy cane so that's what I went with...if you mix it up let me know what ya think...I'm sure cool menthol can be subbed with Like (Fa) Arctic Winter or something that's cold at a higher percentage but (Flv) Cool Menthol is my go to with menthols as it's the best hands down and you can use less of it. I used (Tpa) Sweetener because I was waiting on (Cap) Super Sweet to come in the mail so feel free to use that instead at 0.75 or 1 ",

I left the sweetener out, but on my next mix of this I try it with some. Also Subbed the FLV Cool Menthol for Smoking Bull Kristall, but I think most decent menthol flavors will work here. Recommended!"
