  "name": "Rumchata De Coco",
  "description": "This is a thick creamy sweet recipe coconut heavy and very creamy. Some people get the peppery notes from TFA VBIC if your one of those people you may want to sub for Cap Vanilla Ice cream. 10- 20 day recommended steep but for the impatient one 3 days will do.  I find it to be perfectly sweet with no added sweetener but 1% EM (Cotton Candy) or 0.5% FW sweetener is optional. \r\nI prefer EM in this over super sweet or FW sweetener because it is sweet enough without making it sickly sweet and EM in this mix serves as a blenderizer. \r\nThis recipe was uploaded on ELR on 04/17 and it's been real popular on ELR, I  figured it was time to share it here.
