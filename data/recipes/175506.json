    "description": "2 years ago I challenged myself to develop a Lemon Meringue Pie recipe without using a lemon meringue pie concentrate in a recipe called \"Oh You Tart\". It was an amazing achievement and one that I was very vocally proud of. Still to this day it stands up beautifully.\r\n\r\nHowever in the last two years a lot more flavors have become available and a lot more knowledge has been gained since then. With that said, it's time to introduce you to an even more amazing version of this recipe profile, with even more amazingly delectable mouthfeel & flavour than ever before.\r\n\r\nThis is Oh You Tart 2.0\r\n\r\nThe Base is made simple by combining the delicious tones of WF Almond cookie & WF Lemon Squares.\r\n\r\nThe lemon curd custard combines a combination of Inw Creme Brulee, VTA Sour Lemon, FE Lemon & FA Butter while some other lovely lighter lemon notes are loaned by the WF Lemon Squares.\r\n\r\nHowever this is a taller, fuller meringue pie than ever before so I have gone with a very full mouthfeel on the top of the pie by using a combination of FLV Marshmallow Vanilla, FA Meringue & a little FLV Smoked Butterscotch.\r\n\r\nThe accenting in the recipe happens from different directions here that just work. The FLV Smoked Butterscotch helps with that genuine out of the oven home baked note. The super sweet offers a little sugary note to the meringue. The FA Butter even this low helps the base, the curd and the top beautifully.\r\n\r\nThere is a lot going on here to create what is to my taste the most amazing full Lemon Meringue Pie recipe I have ever tasted with or without using a LMP concentrate. It has been an awesome experience to rebuild this profile from further knowledge while taking advantage of the latest concentrates available to me. Creating this recipe has been something that has not only challenged me once more but has rewarded with the most delicious experience that I could have ever imagined!\r\n\r\nI hope you enjoy this just as much as I enjoyed creating this recipe, but let me know what you thought in the comments below.\r\n\r\nI enjoy this at 60W on a Single 0.2ohm SST coil on a Recurve RDA.\r\nSteep Time 5-7 days\r\n\r\nSeriously if you like a solid recipe that works give it a go!\r\n\r\nCheers for reading this far, now go and get mixing!\r\n\r\n\"Together, Let's Discover!!!\"\r\n\r\nFacebook - https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/groups\/diydownunder\/\r\nDiscord - https:\/\/discord.gg\/kH4Fqbc\r\nYoutube - https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/c\/diydownunder\r\nWebsite - https:\/\/www.diydownunder.com\/\r\nInstagram IGTV : @diydownunder",
