We'll pretend it's topped with some 24k gold flake just to really sell the theme.\r\n\r\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/bvpjzm/mixer_showdown_4_newbie_booster/\r\n\r\nCome join us on Discord! https://discord.gg/ufVTyAQ",

      "text": "Addictively delicious. It tastes like nothing I’ve ever tasted before, which makes it hard to describe. The cactus is identifiable, but mutated into something more like a prickly pear and less like a cactus paddle.It’s not soapy or floral or aloe-y or anything like that, it’s just fruity and natural yet unnatural at the same time, like something grown on another planet. It tastes like the green-yellow-red color of a mango if that color were a flavor, with some gently citrusy notes and a wet fruity bubblegum syrup body. All of that is situated, somehow, in a creamy silky custard, which, even without sweetener, has a sweet, sugary finish, like the alien making this custard did not skimp on the sugar or maybe forgot to brûlée a snozzberry crème brûlée.
