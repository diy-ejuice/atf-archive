  "description": "\r\nYou can S&V this one however it does get immensely better after a couple of days! Sweetener is optional on this one guys, I personally like a little sweetness so I added 1 drop (CAP SUPER SWEET) per 15ml.\r\nIâ€™ve been playing around with this recipe for quite some time now and i absolutely LOVE carrot cake so I really had to do this recipe some justice and in my eyes,this shit is tasty af! Please mix it up and leave me your feed back it would be most appreciated if you would also rate my recipe that would be great. ðŸ’™",
