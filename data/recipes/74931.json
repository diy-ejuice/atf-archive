      "text": "This is an absolutely amazing mix of these ingredients. Coming from someone who has mixed every donut on ATF and even made up many of my own, this is a cinnamon donut, cookie, churro that is spot on to what I like in a vape. Cinnamon and sugar on the lips with a heavy fried donut on the exhale. The cookie adds a ton of mouth feel to this recipe. It takes that dryness you get on most donuts out of the picture and the yellow cake / cake batter and zeppola combination is a winner for the interior and shell of the donut. Warning - if you do not like cinnamon vapes... move on. It does have a perfect coating of cinnamon for me. I really like it. Thanks! This will be a staple in my recipe box for sure."
