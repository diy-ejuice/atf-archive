  "description": "I'm excited to participate in the MIXXED contest. Thank you to the sponsors.\r\nMy entry aims to enhance the required Basket Ingredients and turn a good recipe into a great one!\r\nLet me tell you about my selections. The TPA Strawberry compliments the TPA Strawberry Ripe very nicely. They make a more well rounded strawberry flavor together. This is important because strawberry is the main flavor of my recipe. Most recipes can benefit from having a creamy element added. I enjoy TPA Bavarian Cream. It is very versatile and always gives a nice creamy experience. Finally I added FA Cookie to enhance the bakery notes of the Cinnamon Danish Swirl and give the recipe more texture. This recipe is sweet and does not require any added sweetener.\r\nI think my recipe is delicious and I'm happy to vape it. I love the apple and strawberry. The cream gives the vapor more thickness and the bakery notes round out the recipe and give it texture.\r\nI am new to mixing. I recently quit smoking cigarettes by switching to vaping. I believe vaping is a healthier choice. For the last four months I have been spending most of my free time researching and experimenting with recipes. I have created 3 recipes of my own that I think are good and I am developing other recipes that are not finished yet. I currently have 64 flavors to work with. I already had all of the Basket Ingredients for the contest so it was easy for me to join in. I hope to win this contest. That would be a great way to get started mixing. Thank you for viewing my recipe.",
