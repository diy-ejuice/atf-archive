  "description": "This recipe has *not* been entered in a contest: **DOD WORLD MIXERS II Round 4**\r\n\r\nThought about submitting this as my final entry into the DoD World Mixer's Comp because I heard those pervs were into this sort of thing. Decided against it because it's in poor taste, despite being a tasty recipe. Mix it up for a refreshing, interesting fruit medley. \r\n\r\nSpiny: INW Cactus.  If you're a Phucker Phan, you can turn up the Cactus to 0.5%. Maybe even higher. But if you do that, I recommend at least an overnight steep. \r\n\r\nDragon: TFA Dragonfruit. Tastes like what dragonfruit would taste like if dragonfruit tasted like the essence of white gummy bears. \r\n\r\n**Str**awberry-**Ap**ple-Watermel**on**: All FA. I should change my name to HiC and charge for this stuff. ",

      "text": "Wow. This is a great vape. I get all of the different fruits but none too much. The Fuji and Watermelon are most present, especially as a shake and vape, but I get Strawberry at the end of the exhale and light Dragonfruit throughout. Cactus gives it juicyness and this twang that I have trouble explaining. It makes for a fantastic fruit mix that keeps you coming back for more. Depending on what you focus on, the flavors seem to play which each other a little different every draw. Rarely do I mix big batches of all fruit recipes, but this is definitely getting the 120 treatment. Thanks for sharing, ID10-T!"
