Hands down this is the best lemon pound cake I've tried so far and quite possibly the best lemon anything-and I've tried a lot of them. I've been rationing the 30ml I made but I think its time for a much bigger bottle. Subbed in SC Lemon for FE although I've heard that they are one and the same. Perfect recipe and a must mix! "

This is everything I look for in a lemon bakery vape. Nailed the profile perfectly. The perfect lemon riding on top a rich buttery pound cake. Excellent job. "
