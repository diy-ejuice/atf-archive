I am not much of a cannoli person but the friend that i handed it over to loved it.  Definitely needs steeping tho, i tried it after mixing and it went to the back of the test tube rack.  over a month later tried it again and it was saved from going in the trash tube pile lol.  thanks for the recipe!"
