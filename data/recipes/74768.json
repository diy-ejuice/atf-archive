  "description": "Chocolat-orange cake with a dark rich cake and a luxurious hint of orange.\r\n\r\nChocolat deutsch: A delicious Dark rich chocolat cake with coconut.\r\n\r\nChocolate, cocoa, dark bean: Allthough the coconut isn't anoying in the chocolat deutsch, the recipe doesn't call for it. By layering the dry cocopowder like cocoa and the smoother almost milky chocolate along with a bit of the bitter notes of the coffee i'm attempting to sway the balance away from the coconut a bit. \r\n\r\nGraham cracker clear and golden butter: Cause every cake needs some of that.\r\n\r\nHazelnut: Well take your pick of wonderfull properties. Nutty, creamy, moisturing, ...\r\n\r\nBlood orange and lemon zest: I got the Blood orange flavor hoping for a great orange to use in a orange creamsicle but for some reason, none of the oranges that i've tried tend to work for me there. I always get a orange syrup like flavor so I thought i might have better luck using it for what it is. The lemon zest is to up the zesty part this recipe calls for.\r\n\r\nSweetness: well it is a sweet profile so... Wreck your coils and wicks with super sweet if you want. This is what I use (or a homebrew blend of stevia in glycerin and sucralose that is kinda the same)\r\n\r\nDispite the dark flavor profile, this juice is clean and pure and will keep your gear wicking and vaping long time.",
