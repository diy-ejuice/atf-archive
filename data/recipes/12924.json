  "description": "After the Modest Monday post a few weeks back on fruit and cream, I really wanted to play around with the dewberry cream recipe put up. I've never had Kilo's dewberry and cream, but honeydew is my girlfriends favorite fruit so I thought I'd make something for her. Turns out this is one of the best fruity vapes I've ever had.\r\n\r\nNotes in the September 2016 recipes thread\r\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/50ocy6/september_2016_recipe_thread/d7flubt",
