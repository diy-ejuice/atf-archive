  "description": " A sultry, dense and creamy custard delicately infused with fresh plums.\r\n\r\nINW Smoked plum does a wonderful job in creating a realistic, ripe plum with well balanced sweet and tart notes.\r\nThe tartness offsets the sweetness perfectly and is pimped up with just a smidgen of smokiness to take this boring old plum to (to coin a phrase) infinity and beyond! \r\nThe beautifully thick, almost viscose, mouthfeel present in the plum lends itself perfectly to a thick custard base. \r\nWarning, do not stray above the 0.5%... This stuff is more potent than Kryptonite and should not be taken lightly... I have taken it to 1.5% as a single flavour but anything over that mutes the delicate plum and turns this stuff putrid.\r\n\r\nThe INW Sesame adds a little intrigue and is a perfect partner for any stone fruit. Feel free to omit the sesame it if you do not have it - BUT, I highly reccommmend it.\r\n\r\nI can write an dissertation on the INW Creme Brulee and Custard combo but I will restrain myself.  Is is my go-to combo and it just works beautifully to create a stunning thick and luscious custard base with that delicious Brulee finish...\r\n\r\nGive this at least 5 days to come together...",
