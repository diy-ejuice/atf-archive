  "description": "I've been really enjoying banana vapes lately, Puff'd is one of my favorites.\r\nThe combination of cake and light banana gooeyness is just lovely.\r\nIf you enjoy it please remember to leave a rating.\r\nShort notes for this one as it's Friday night and I want to play.\r\n\r\nPro Tip: To boost the cake note even more, Throw in DIYFS Pound Cake @ .25% if you have it on hand.\r\nOmitted from the public recipe for the sake of availability.\r\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n**CAP Sugar Cookie** It's inclusion is intended to boost the bakery note. The sugary graininess really helps the overall mix.\r\n\r\n**TFA Bavarian Cream** Playing as a not-so-shy emulsifier in this recipe as it serves to thicken and provide some vanilla boost, As well as providing a 'buffer' between the cream and pastry.\r\n\r\n**VT Banana Custard** Brings a light but noticeable banana note to the party. It's a creamy banana, Suitable sub would be TFA Banana Cream @ 1%\r\n\r\n**JF Yellow Cake** A little light handed here it serves as a cake backnote allowing the \"cream\" to shine a little more.\r\n\r\n**FLV Frosting** Up front vanilla with a little texture to bring to the game. Provides an almost gooey sugary perception to the cream filling. Pairs incredibly well with 'cake' concentrates.\r\n\r\n**CAP Super Sweet** When I mix this recipe I omit sweetener, But including it you'll find brings it more toward the traditional \"manufacturer\" variety.\r\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nBe sure to follow me on YouTube for future mixing updates:\r\nhttp://www.youtube.com/c/SteamCraft",

That VT banana custard sits nicely on top and blends really well with the Bavarian Cream and Frosting. My only critique is that I would like a little more bakery underneath. I may try boosting the sugar cookie and yellow cake just for my own palate. Thanks for the excellent recipe! "
