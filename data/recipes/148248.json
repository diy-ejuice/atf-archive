    "description": "**Grapefruit Rose Paloma Cocktail!**\r\nSaw this cocktail recipe, and had to have it in a vape, because I could see **FLV  Rose Essence** working perfectly in this.  This is delicious with a slight boozy note, a delicious sweet grapefruit, and an ever so light rose water taste on exhale.  \r\nEnjoy.  \r\n\r\n",

            "text": "I\u2019ve never had this cocktail but now I feel like I have. It is exactly what it says it is, sweet ruby red grapefruit grapefruit juice, sparkling grapefruit soda, little booze with some authentic tequila taste, and a delicate but delightful hint of rose. Seems like this is the perfect way to go with that FLV Tequila. I get kind of an annoying Mountain Dew taste from it usually but the grapefruit and citrus soda seem to just use that instead of fighting with it. "
