  "description": "**Grapefruit Rose Paloma Cocktail!**\r\nSaw this cocktail recipe, and had to have it in a vape, because I could see **FLV  Rose Essence** working perfectly in this.  This is delicious with a slight boozy note, a delicious sweet grapefruit, and an ever so light rose water taste on exhale.  \r\nEnjoy.  \r\n\r\n",

It is exactly what it says it is, sweet ruby red grapefruit grapefruit juice, sparkling grapefruit soda, little booze with some authentic tequila taste, and a delicate but delightful hint of rose. Seems like this is the perfect way to go with that FLV Tequila. I get kind of an annoying Mountain Dew taste from it usually but the grapefruit and citrus soda seem to just use that instead of fighting with it. "
