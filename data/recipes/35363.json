    "description": "And here we have another passenger boarding the ID10-T strap train, this time Wild style. Love all these straps there's so many to choose from its a god dayum Strap-On paradise! I think this Wild Strap-On is just the thing to complete the party, although many more will be added, this ones is essential to always being in the mix. I take no credit for the 75% of the mix that is ID10-T's **STR**awberry **AP**ple watermel**ON** (https:\/\/alltheflavors.com\/recipes\/6487).  Also, I like top notes which generally fade away the quickest so I like it best as a shake and vape but a 1 or 2 day steep helps the flavors bind together and really makes it into that honeydew-cantaloupe-strawberry-watermelon-apple mix.**VARIATIONS** Personally I like to add in 1% TFA Honeydew cuz I like me some honeydew (I prefer TFA's over CAP's). And Mango SC or FLV at 1% makes this magical, credit for the Strap-On-Mango goes to Apexified. Can up the Wild melon to 2% to make it more of a melon mix but it does cover up the strap on pretty well.",
