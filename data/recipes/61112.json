Starburst type is actually this -http://www.bullcityflavors.com/star-candy-fw/\r\nnot sure if they are they same or not.\r\n\r\nV2.5 - bumped up the blue ras \r\nLowered the strawberry belts and switched to watermelon sour belts.\r\nAlso lowered the star candy and lemon because it gave it some harsh notes.\r\n\r\nV3 - Lowered Liquid Barn blueraspberry.\r\nAdded Real Flavors Blue Raz\r\n\r\nV4 - removed some extracts and replaced it with just lime by cap\r\nadded sour blue raspberry candy by wonder flavours \r\n\r\nV5- Now that strawberry sour-belts is more accessible to people I wanted to release the version I like the most. You can also sub OOO Blue Raspberry Candy for the LB Blue Raspberry they are both VG based so use the same percentage. All the Flavors has them set up for a PG base though. Change the Extract to a VG based Extract in the list and use LB blueraspberry at that measurement and not the one provided.\r\n\r\nV6- in this version I wanted to go back the original-ish profile with the cap lime. I use Yellow Burst by Real Flavors to create a lemon-lime sour profile after a steep the starburst flavor softens everything up for a chewy gummy factor. The sourness in this recipe comes from the citrus notes, if you wanted you could use a sour enhancer here but I found that it really didn't do anything for me. If you do not have yellow, pink, and orange also work. You can get yellow here ---> https://www.realflavors.com/collections/real-flavors/products/yellow-candy-burst-type?variant=13730023833712\r\n\r\n\r\nSUBS\r\n\r\nCAP LIME- FA Cold Pressed lime @ .5%\r\n\r\nLB Blue Raspberry- OOO Blue Raspberry candy @ 8%\r\n\r\nRF Yellow Candy - burst type- RF Orange Candy- burst type @5%\r\n                                                         RF Orange Candy- burst type SC @ 2.5%\r\n                                                         RF Pink Candy- burst type @5%\r\n                                                         RF Pink Candy- burst type SC @ 2.5% \r\n\r\nORIGINAL VERSION\r\n\r\n7% (LB) Blue Raspberry\t\r\n0.5% (RF) Blue Raz â€“ Super Concentrate\t\r\n2% (CAP) Lime\t\r\n1% (WF) Sour Blue Raspberry Candy\t\r\n1% (CAP) Super Sweet\r\n",
