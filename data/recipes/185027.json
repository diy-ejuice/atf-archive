  "description": "*** FLV Rich Cinnamon is a 10% dilution ***\r\nMy entry for DIY Downunder \"Flavorah Mixing With 2020 Vision Challenge\"\r\nAn Apple and Cinnamon Muffin, honestly I didn't put heaps of development into this because i liked it how it was first up. If you want to mix it up feel free to add and adapt then comment what you did and what it changed.\r\nOn the inhale its a cooked apple and cinnamon like you got a piece of apple in the muffin. The exhale is a fluffy light muffin with very slight traces of the apple and cinnamon.\r\nOff the shake the cinnamon is in your face, after 3 days is mellows out and play well with the apple for me. I haven't tested it past 4 days because it was all gone.\r\nI Vaped this on a Citadel RDA - .25 @ 50w\r\n\r\n",
