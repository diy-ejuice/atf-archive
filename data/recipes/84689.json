  "description": "So just lately I've been craving some old school flavours, Looper was one of my favourites, a lot of people say they get Lemon Pledge from fruit circles but I love it.... something twangy in that lemon that sparkles, berry crunch is just a great flavour in this recipe and unmistakable but I also added some FA Breakfast to give the cereal a boost, this mix in my mech squonk and wasp is just a evening of bliss ðŸ‘Œ\r\nPs you can shake it and vape it but the cereals really come together after a few days.",
