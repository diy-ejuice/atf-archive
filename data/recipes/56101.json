    "description": "So named because of the sweet, sultry, slippery and juicy love that is being made between the mango, papaya and coconut, supported ever so subtly by the lube that is banana cream and the sweat that is dragonfruit. \r\nA very pleasing tropical experience and my current ADV. SnV approved.\r\n\r\nAlso, I switched to using FE Mango, it just has a more authentic mango flavor and texture, but I had to tweak it down just a hair as it's slightly stronger.  ",

Granted, I did sub TPA Mango for CAP Sweet Mango but if anything it just makes the Mango more realistic. Anyways, this is a straight, tropical banger of a recipe man. I guarantee that this 15ml won't last me to tomorrow, so off again I go to mix a 60ml. If you guys are on the fence about straight fruit recipes, don't hesitate and just mix this up. This sure did surprise me, Highwind!"
