  "description": "(Aditional 0.50% 0f WS23 and 0.50% sweetener optional) I added WS23 to mine and my vaping friends wanted it sweeter but I didn’t. It’s up to you if you want it sweeter and cold. \r\n\r\nI called this Wutdafo because it changes from a burgundy gummy bear to a dark berry tea and bourbon mix depending on the heat you vape it at.  Have you ever used Tea as a chaser to a mixed drink? This is like the bourbon and tea version of a dark berry sangria. I find that black currant and fresh fig are unique because they are both dark yet bright fruits flavors, Monsoon add some extra dark in nature berry notes along with a candy aspect and a slight floral note that accents the red tea very nicely. I added the sweet tangerine to bring in the added note of a sweet orange as to mimic a slight squeez into the drink and a slice of orange on the rim for a garnish, but instead it accented the candy notes from the monsoon. Vanilla swirl is serves more as a backnote and smoothing finish to this mix and adds mouthfeel. Pictures like this allow me to express my artistic mixing abilities without holding back my true mixing style. I like to mix dark intriguing complex juices that are not like your every day all day type mixes. If your into something different give this a shot it’s very good and mystical in its own way kind of like the picture.  ",
