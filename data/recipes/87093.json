  "description": "I recently got FW Grape Soda, and when I did a knuckle test, I was flooded with childhood memories of grape Kool-Aid, and knew I needed to mix up a batch.\r\n\r\nGrape soda , I started off at 5%, but the flavor was not strong enough, so I kicked it up to 8.  I added just enough Juicy Lemon to  accent the grape and brighten it a bit. A little dragonfruit to smooth and sweeten, and Supersweet for the cup of sugar sweetness.\r\n\r\nFeel free to adjust the sweetness to your taste , or add Koolada or WS23 to chill it down a bit",
