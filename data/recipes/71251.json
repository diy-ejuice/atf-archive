Tastes very much like the mints I remember, rich, creamy, a little minty, a little buttery, sweet as all hell. Just utterly vapable and delicious. The only minor quibble I have is that there's a touch too much caramel flavor. Arguably, this should knock some of the points because of accuracy/authenticity. Thing is, it actually ADDS to the taste. There's something to a little caramel added into this that kicks the flavor into overdrive. Can't put my finger on if it adds more to the buttery side or to the sweet side, but when that note shows up, it makes a nice zing moment before it slides back, and the mint goes out completely smooth.\r\n\r\nThis one's for mint addicts, candy junkies, or someone looking for a sweet, creamy minty rush to add something different, without going for the usual fruit/menthol thing. Absolutely ADV worthy, if you can handle the richness.\r\n\r\nWhile it can be shake and vaped, it really shines after 7 days.\r\n\r\nPosted with the creator's permission.",
