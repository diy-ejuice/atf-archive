  "description": "Toffee apple meringue pie with nuances of cinnamon running through the curd.\r\n\r\nStarting with the base, I use flapper pie to give that generic meringue pie taste, using FA apple pie bends that graham crust into a nice pie crust\r\n\r\nMoving onto the curd, the custard from the flapper pie already sets the foundation, adding a touch of FA premium thickens it up, then comes the apple... FLV Apple filling and CAP double apple provide the spiced stewed apple, finally VTA English toffee thickens that curd up further and brings a nice buttery finish.\r\n\r\nLastly it’s all topped off with whipped meringue that WF flapper pie provides so brilliantly.\r\n\r\nthis is really good off the shake but the apple is too tart and the toffee doesn’t show up until a week into the steep, best after around a week but the longer the better.\r\n\r\nIf you like this recipe and what I do then please rate and review :)\r\n",
