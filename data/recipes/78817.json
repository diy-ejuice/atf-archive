  "description": "**A grape cigarillo**\r\n\r\nI stole the base of this recipe from [25 Bucks](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/22505#25_bucks_by_concreteriver) by @ConcreteRiver, swapped the raspberry for the best grape for the job,  cut the Burley back for less of a rich nutty tobacco, and loaded it up with Cured for more of a generic little cigar flavor. If you're looking for something like a Swisher Sweet, this base will make a great start. Just swap the grape for a different fruit or other flavor or your choice and rebalance it as needed. ",

It has all the guilty fun of a bottom of the shelf along with the maturity and complexity of a mid tier cigarillo. Very well done, had it not been ID10-T I would have been prepared to be disgusted. This is WAY better than I expected it to be. Very well done."

Tobacco lovers and candy lovers alike will enjoy this one cuz it's a little of both. I was fortunate enough to get to try this for /r/mixersclub. It's not something I would have mixed on my own because I am not a tobacco person. But....I like big blunts and I cannot lie! And let's face it folks, blunts are the REAL reason people buy these little cigarillos. If you like grape blunt wraps, give this one a try. It'll make you go oooh, ahhh!"
