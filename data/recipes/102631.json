  "description": "Okay I found a 3 ingredient recipe that I tried simply because I had all the ingredients but I failed to label the bottle.  I had assumed it was a new recipe.  Now I have no idea how I found it.  But I realize I did leave my flavors out where I left them it's obvious what goes in here and I kinda remember the numbers.  I know the 4% strawberry ripe for sure but the others while I know are less I am less confident in how close I am.  In any case it was great!!  So trying to recreate it here.  If you created this or almost this please claim your recipe and give me the name so I can look it up and leave a review. :)",
