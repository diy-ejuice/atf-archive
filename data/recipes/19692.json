    "description": "This is it, I have enough pondering on this for a long time. Finally got everything I needed and gave it a shot. In the beginning I had no idea where to start with this recipie. Then Exclusivegirl came out with her Green Tea Recipie. So I used the idea of the to begin my blueprinting. So without her or that recipie I would have been completely stuck. Major props to her.\r\n\r\nFW White Chocolate - I used this above all the others because to me this one is more stronger on the white chocolate flavor and the one I prefer\r\n\r\nTPA Sweet Cream\/Whipped Cream and CAP Vanilla Custard - these are all here to blend that crunchinless and keep that white chocolate creamy. With out them the white chocolate would be there on the inhale but loose flavor very quickly. They really help that WC keep flavor and maintain throughout the recipie.\r\n\r\nCAP Sugar Cookie and TPA Rice Cruniches - These are obviously the Wafer. To me they complement each other very well.\r\n\r\nCAP Super Sweet is there to give it sweetness.\r\n\r\nI really enjoy this recipie and I hope you do to!",
