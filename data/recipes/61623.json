It's a dark Tobacco recipe with a lil Banana and CDS thrown in to take it to the next level.\r\nI found this a long long time ago on Reddit when I first started mixing... It's in a thread of solid clones that came from u/icecreamterror over at Planet of the Vapes (is what the thread says). Other than that I don't know who to give credit & thanks to.\r\n\r\nFor all I know this might not even be a remix but the Real Deal it tastes that good... ðŸ¤¤",
