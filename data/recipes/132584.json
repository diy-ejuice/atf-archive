  "description": "Creamy full body blueberry cheesecake. Sweeten to taste using Super Sweet. Was really going for a  heavy hitting cheesecake. With back notes of the blueberry. Made some changes to my recipe to help get it there. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes**** Wasn’t liking how I could taste the vanilla swirl in my finished 4 week steeped batch so I decided to remove it. Also tfa blueberry extra just wasn’t cutting it so changed it out to Flavor West Blueberry for a more syrupy blueberry. Will update after a few week steep. ",
