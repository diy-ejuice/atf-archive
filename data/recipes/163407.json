  "description": "This is not your everyday e-liquid, it's something you won't vape all day long, but it's something you have to try at least once.\r\n\r\nCoffee and mango do share some molecules and i have found a recipe for a drink from thailand which is coffee, mango and ice.\r\n\r\nI changed the iced part to LB vanilla ice cream to have a smooth, creamy mouthfeel and a fine vanilla note.\r\nI used TPA Mango because it tastes less ripe to me, for the coffee i used my favorite, WF Brazilian Coffee.\r\n\r\nImagine having the robust coffee note upfront, followed by a bed of sweet creamy icecream and right at the end you get this tropical kick on the very top end of the mango\r\n",
