  "description": "Ive been on a bit of a banana binge that started with my testing with creating a bubblegum from scratch (yup, Bnanurz is part of the traditional pink bubblegum flavor) but got sidetracked with this versatile flavor and ended up mixing everything but bubblegum :-)\r\n\r\nThis is my take on A Sweet and creamy Banana Cheesecake!\r\nThe Nanurz: \r\nUsing the trusty TFA Banana cream filling the main creamy banana note I added WF Banana puree to boost that Jammy sweet banana to bring this solid and well rounded Banana into my Cheesecake without getting lost into the creams too easily as I find can happen with many banana recipes after a steep.\r\n\r\nDa Cheesecake:\r\nI normally dont like dessers, and I think its for that reason that I find things like Brulee and certain Cheesecake to be too rich or the graham part of it too strong for my preference but With INW Cheesecake half of that issue is already solved as this Cheesecake has a more subtle 'graham' note in it. \r\nThis with the addition of INW Custard smoothed the cheesecake out a bit more and also brings in a lightness to the Cheesecake base.\r\n\r\nAdjust the sweetner to your preference. Steep 3-5 days\r\n\r\nEnjoy!",
