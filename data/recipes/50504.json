      "text": "This recipe is simply amazing. It uses minimal concentrates but produces great mouth watering flavor. It doesn't use sweetener but it damn sure doesn't need any. Like it's inspiration, it is easy on your coils and that is the proverbial icing on the cake. If you like fruity, tropical flavors, I can't reccomend this mix enough. In a Godda Da Vida was great, but 1% of CAP Sweet Mango puts it over the edge. It's a simple, but brillant addition. "

This recipe though makes it so much more palatable, I still get a note of that aftertaste but the mango smooths it out so that I can enjoy the tropical noes and not be hit with a smack of bitterness.

      "text": "My palate rejects the premise that In Godda Da Vida was missing anything at all. In fact I consider that assertion to be something akin to heresy or sacrilege. However, this made for a slightly different and equally delicious vape as Godda, with the Sweet Mango blending in and sweetening and ripening the Papaya part. It makes me want to play around with adding a little summin summin to Godda as well, something I previously would not have entertained, as it seems like desecrating a DIY treasure.  So this recipe is either inspirational or a bad influence, depending on your point of view. But the bottom line is that it's a helluva great vape. "
