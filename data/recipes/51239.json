  "description": "**UPDATE:** With the HS French vanilla ice cream @ 1% being discovered feel free to replace TFA VBIC with that and bump the TFA Strawberry to 3%...it's great either way\r\n\r\nRose milk by Diy or Die was hands down the best S&C that I tried and I knew after my first 30ml concentrate was gone as fast as I got it...I had to try and nail this down. This is very close in profile IMO and If you like S&C, try this and you won't be disappointed. Feel free to swap the TPA Strawberry with Straw Ripe for a brighter version that's just as good. I also must stress you try the original for yourself... Enjoy!",

I did do it with Ripe instead and got to say it was very good not to strong on the strawberry more a lighter strawberry not flavor. I actually really enjoy this flavor a lot. I don't know if I will ever try the real version unless Wayne releases the recipe as I don't usally buy one shots. But overall this was a very great flavor. Well done. "
