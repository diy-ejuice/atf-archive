Will update after a few days steep...if I remember.&#xD;\n&#xD;\nUpdate:  After about a week and a half the the banana has receded a bit, and the creamy goodness of TFA Pistachio has pronounced itself further.  I'm really digging this one; maybe not as an ADV, but definitely in the rotation.  This is my first go 'round with TFA banana, and I'm really enjoying the Runt banana nostalgia.   The simplicity of this mix also augments its appeal.&#xD;\n&#xD;\nWell done Chris!"
