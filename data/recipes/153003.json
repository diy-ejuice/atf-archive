  "description": "A Turkish delight infused ice cream.\r\n\r\nRose and raspberry ice-cream partnered with lemon and elderflower ice-cream.\r\n\r\nThe first decision I made was the ice cream base, I wanted to limit the vanilla as to not interfere with the main flavour so I chose FLV custard to get that eggyness and then loosened it with FA Milk.\r\n\r\nThe raspberry and elderflower can easily be dropped from this recipe but version one felt like it was missing something and the raspberry just gives the rose a little body and then my OCD kicked in and the lemon looked a bit lonely so I added a touch of elderflower because, well, it just worked and I like the lemon and elderflower combo, at 0.30 it’s going to give you that floral vibe but it won’t bog you down after a tank-full. The FLV rose essence really is the star of the show here, it let me add elderflower and still keep it on the low side of the floral spectrum.\r\n\r\nYou can totally drop the super sweet from this and not lose any of the characteristics, it’s all subjective but I feel it adds to that Turkish delight for that gelatinous syrupy edge.\r\n\r\nIf you like this recipe and what I do then please rate and review :)",

      "text": "I was frankly pretty concerned when I saw what went into this recipe, specifically the 4.25% FLV Custard, which tastes like something I might add a little of to make a custard more custardy without increasing vanilla, but it’s really dry, like custard powder, and I wouldn’t have thought building a recipe around such a high amount of it would work this well. But it does, the FA Milk blends with and fixes it beautifully, and all the other elements work together so it really is what it says it is - lemon elderflower ice cream + turkish delight-infused ice cream. That Rose is a bit of a shrinking violet but it gets a nice boost from the elderflower and raspberry and the lemon is a lovely addition that seems like it might also be helping keep any dryness at bay. It all comes together into a lovely floral ice cream, as every bit as good as any I’ve tried, maybe better.  "
