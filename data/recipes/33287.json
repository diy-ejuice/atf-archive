  "description": "So yeah, this is a low effort recipe of mine from YEARS ago or so. FAIR WARNING. I am a strawberry either non or \"hard to taster\"  I heard or read someone mention at one time that Dragon Fruit is a perfect partner for Strawberry. This was my tester for that recipe. I have since refined and \"complexed\" the fuck out of this recipe to no end but also still to this day I mix this very same recipe in a 100mL bottle, chuck it in a drawer and set a steep timer for 21 days for this. \r\n\r\nCouple of notes for you here, I was not going for a profile here, it was a test to see what two of the three did together.\r\nThis may not be original, it is stupid simple in percentages and flavorings, likely that someone did the same exact same thing at some point.\r\nI am not interested in feedback on this recipe, this profile is a natural progression in most mixer's development at some point or another and at this point only serves to prove out the point that you do not need crazy amount of different flavorings in retarded percentage values to get a very vapable juice in return.\r\n\r\nStupid simple, good, have some if you have the inclination. Or don't. :)\r\n",
