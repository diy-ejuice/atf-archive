  "name": "Toff Notch Custard | For MTL/Pod Devices",
  "description": "This is the first recipe I've made that I can actually taste on my dotAIO with the dotShell installed, maybe now that thing will get some use. This is a pretty straightforward recipe and only the first version of it, feel free to play around with the %'s of those dark sweeteners and see what works, the toffee comes through quite well at 1%, I would like to see some more of that butterscotch though. I suppose it all depends on the device you use it on too. I haven't been able to taste anything on this pod, I'm more of an RDA lover myself :) Please reduce the SS if you wish, all the percentages are high because pods.\r\n______\r\nGive this a week to steep for best results. It's possible to SNV it but I think the custard really starts to fill out and combine with the darker flavours by day 5 (and the toffee settles down) TPA VC2 is top notch custard indeed!\r\n______\r\nI'm a new mixer, started in April, only just started playing with some MTL stuff and any feedback is appreciated so I can improve my mixing skills.  I swore I'd never get a dotAIO but when the hype still hadn't died down I figured I'd get one for when dripping isn't practical, ya know :) ",
