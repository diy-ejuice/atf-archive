  "description": " Made this on a whim, gonna give it a week before i try it.\r\nMy initial thoughts, PUR butter pecan pralines ice cream at this % along with LB vanilla ice cream and FW butter pecan acts as boosters for it. PUR marshmallow to give it alittle further depth and mouthful feeling. And WF vanilla cream extra for that extra creaminess to this mix like when u get that last bit of melted ice cream at the bottom of the bowl. I think the blend of these flavors brings enough sweetness and richness to this mix to make it satisfying",

      "text": "It's funny. I've never really liked butter pecan ice cream, yet I like everything that goes into it. This, however, is a absolutely sinfully decadent vape. Rich, buttery, pecans that straddle the line between nutty goodness and candy-like praline...and then, there's the cream. A luscious extra creamy vanilla that in no circumstance could be called plain. This is top to bottom an absolute banger of a flavor. If the ice cream actually tasted like this, my beloved Chubby Hubby would be in danger of being replaced.&#xD;\n&#xD;\nThis bad boy is for dessert fans, ice cream idolaters, nut lovers, people who like it buttered, and anyone looking to vape their calories. Seriously, just hit it!&#xD;\n&#xD;\nCracking job, JJ. "
