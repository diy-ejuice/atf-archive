  "description": "I've been working on this complex recipie for a while now. I'm pretty satisfied with this being the final. Mix enjoy. \r\n\r\nCap funnel cake \r\nImo a very accurate funnel cake 4-5% is best when going for funnel cake as the main profile. It's pretty accurate imo. \r\n\r\nFa zeppola. This adds a little more dough to the funnel cake a little bit of sweet sugar notes as well \r\n\r\nCap sweet cream/marsh... Sweet cream is here just to make the over all flavor a little creamy. And marsh is just for the sweetness and mouthfeel. \r\n\r\nFa fuji/tpa caramel \r\nCan be tasted inhale and exhale they both sit at the front of this profile  and really top off this mix. \r\n\r\nYou can shake and vape is good but Fuji and caremel bent a lot after full steep. \r\n1 week smells and taste wierd the dough really comes out a little too much. \r\nThen \r\n2 weeks its spot on and awesone",
