  "description": "**EDIT 4/25/18:** I'm editing this recipe to change the percentage of INW Creme Brulee from 3% to 1% (and DIYFS Holy Vanilla from 1.5% to 1%). \r\n\r\nI feel like I'm taking crazy pills, here, because whatever the unsavory note is in INW CB that so many people are picking up I don't taste *at all*, but too many damn fine mixers have pointed it out to me for me to not do *something*. \r\n\r\nTo anyone whom I might have emotionally scarred with my over-exuberant use of Creme Brulee, I cannot apologize enough. I love you guys, and the last thing I'd want to do is hurt you. Thank you so much for all of the feedback, you cannot imagine how valuable it is to me, because I have no one in meat-space (who vapes) to bounce ideas off of, and reign me in when I start letting my weird palate & kinky appetites take the wheel. You guys keep me sane... *ish*.  ;-)\r\n\r\n*\"Wouldst thou like to live deliciously?\"*\r\n\r\nA rich, voluptuous smoked vanilla custard with a hint of dark tobacco. Tastes like sin.\r\n\r\n**THE CUSTARD:**\r\nCap Vanilla Custard + INW Custard + INW Creme Brulee = My Current Custardstone. \r\nThese ratios are more or less my favorite, though if I'm topping this custard with fruit, I normally start the CAP VC at 4%. However, 5% is perfect here, because it really stands up against the smoke notes, and makes the whole experience more... rapturously rich.\r\n**THE BLACK MAGIC:**\r\nEven if you're nervous about tobaccos, do not omit the INW Black for Pipe, *please!* It keeps the “smokiness” of the recipe from being too one-note, and adds this really bewitching, dark complexity to the vanilla. This is not a tobacco recipe, but it needs the mystery that INW Back for Pipe brings. \r\nFA Black Fire bumps up that pagan bonfire note, and DIYFS's Holy Vanilla has never tasted so unholy. It's as sweet as the devil whispering in your ear.\r\n\r\n**INSPIRATION/THE RAMBLING ASIDE:**\r\nI'd like to say this recipe has no culinary reference, but one night, about 3 days after I mixed it, I happened upon what turned out to be my favorite episode of “A Cook's Tour” on Netflix. \r\n\r\nIf you've never seen “A Cook's Tour”, I can't say that I actually recommend it. The production values are horrible, especially in light of Bourdain's other shows like “No Reservations” or the masterfully shot and edited “Parts Unknown”. \r\n\r\nStill, food shows are my heroin, and a major source of cooking/mixing inspiration, so even though I found “A Cook's Tour” mostly hard to watch, Season 1 Episode 18 “The French Laundry Experience” is an absolute gem, and is so friggin' hot it pretty much qualifies as porn for me.\r\n\r\nSpecifically, at one point during the dessert orgy at French Laundry, Thomas Keller serves Anthony Bourdain a tobacco leaf and coffee custard as a  sort of cheeky homage to the bad-boy chef, reducing him to a giggling, blushing schoolgirl. It was the first of a few ah-ha! moments for me, because I felt like my desire to include tobacco in a custard recipe wasn't so weird after all. It also made me think that adding a tiny bit of coffee flavoring might be a nice touch in future iterations.\r\n\r\nThe next ah-ha! moment came when, after 40 days of struggling with my impatience, I cracked open my batch of Black Phillip that I swore I wouldn't touch for at least 2 months, and tested it. Turns out that one wildcard ingredient that might not work, the Inawera Classic Black for Pipe, was right at home in that dark, smoky whirl of decadent custard fog. It definitely wasn't “ready” yet, but it hinted at some unusual and intriguing things to come.\r\n\r\nIt's now been steeping for about 50 days, and I've already decided I'm immediately mixing 2 more 60ml batches, at least one of which I hope to steep long term, like 3 months minimum, but ideally until late October, early November, when the smoky, lightly sweet complexity should shine like a beacon against a chilly autumn night.\r\n\r\nOh, and another thing, this recipe is a madman with a cup of coffee in the morning.",

      "text": "This is amazing! I was one who was intrigued by the original recipe but let down by it; I left it a 3-star review. Cutting back on the Creme Brulee made all the difference. It left the caramelized sugar crust but nixed the acrid burnt note that marred the original, and now after steeping for two months (I meant to try it at 1 month but life happened) it's this sinfully decadent, wickedly smoky, rich vanilla custard that's a perfect antidote (alongside a strong cup of black coffee) to the bummer of once again failing to die in my sleep. I think I've found the perfect October/November morning recipe here. Love it! "

      "text": "I’m not big on tobacco, but the smoky accents in this recipe are incredible. The custard is full and gooey. I’ll probably be stealing the 1.5 INW:5 CAP combo, so I hope that’s okay. The Creme Brulee is a little high for me here. I don’t particularly enjoy that flavor to begin with.. But, to my palate, the campfire toast of Black Fire covered most of Creme Brulee’s offensive notes. It really was perfect to vape around the bonfire as trick or treaters made the rounds. I have a friend who adores this stuff. She tried it out months ago and immediately requested I make her a couple 120’s of “that delicious campfire custard stuff.” My only gripe is the burnt caramel of Brulee, but you’ve still done a good job, Runt! Hope you’re doing well.&#xD;\n Edit for the revision: Lowering the Creme Brulee avoided the acrid burnt notes that some folks, myself included, complained about. The custard base isn’t affected and remains just as bold and creamy as before. The Black Fire is allowed a little more room in the mix, making the tobacco come forward some for me. The Black Fire is definitely bold, but I dig it! Imagine smoking a robust pipe tobacco next to a campfire and then enjoying a homemade dish of Creme Brulee... that’s precisely what this is. It’s relaxing, luxurious, and it’s my favorite time of year in vape form. Phenomenal mix, Runt!"

      "text": "i mixed this on 7/28 and honestly didn't like it at all until this weekend (11/6). i had tried it at the one and two month marks and had similar complaints to the other reviews. maybe something changed with mine that didn't for them- or perhaps it's just differenes in palates. i loved it this weekend tho- it seemed to have really meshed into something lovely. i will echo the other sentiments of most likely decreasing the creme brulee next time- maybe by half or even less. i think that was largely what kept it from being enjoyable until now for me- i just hope that a decrease doesn't throw off the balance of the custards/tobacco. i'm going to experiment a bit with it. it's a great recipe tho- thanks for sharing.

This is a profile I would love to play around with, though. I think with couple tweaks, this could be a great mix. Thanks for sharing and tackling  such a great idea! "

      "text": "This just wasn't vapable to me. Mainly for the same reason ID10-T states. Inw Creme brulee is a dynamite flavor and not just in the sense that it's good. It's also easy to blow up a recipe when you use it. Even just a touch too high and it can potentially ruin everything with a moldy acrid note. Also I seem to get a bit of too much holy vanilla. Contrary to what dave says I think that actually upping the inw custard to something a little crazy could do a lot to mute that creme brulee off note. Anyway, don't let this get you down cause I know you are a kickass mixer with plenty of other irons in the fire! "

      "text": "WTF...seriously no reviews?!  I don't see how. This mix is freaking amazing. I mixed this up on Aug 1, and vaped the whole silky smooth, smoked, amazing freaking mouthgasm in one day on Halloween. This was great. The smoke/tobaccos used work to give accents but not overwhelming at all, almost not noticeable at points. That surprised me in a good way. The mix of INW/CAP made for an amazing custard. Much better than CAP on its own, by far. Guys, if you haven't mixed this up, please do yourself a favor: Mix this up and forget it for a while. Its SOOOO good. PLEASE MIND THE STEEP! haha. "
