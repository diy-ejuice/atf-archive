  "description": "This recipe reminds me to a hipster homemade root beer I tried a few years ago in Bariloche, Argentina.\r\n\r\nFLV Root Beer is the best in its kind but for my profile I needed more body and sweetness. Flavorah Cream and Butterscotch toghether create a rich caramel cream full of body and texture, and a bit of FLV Milk Chocolate adds warmness and a sutil dark note. FLV Vanilla Bean is an idea I took from @Thadentman and @Kopel and it works great to add a very natural vanilla and also boost the vanilla from other flavors.\r\n\r\nSalud!",
