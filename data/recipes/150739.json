    "description": "A popping cherry lollipop popper! \r\n\r\nThis is a morish cherry Popsicle sure to turn your lips red! \r\n\r\nMB Red cherry is a fantastic new(ish) entrant in the cherry category and is set to upset some of the big players. Most of the cherry options are bleh and Molinberry has manged to create a winner here! This is a juicy, sweetened, red cherry, minus the medicinal cough syrup vibe - enough said! This get truly better with time and develops a fantastic deep and juicy cherry after the 2 week mark. The Red Cherry is filled out with a touch of INW Cherries (NOT INW CHERRY!) to fill in the gaps  and allows the full cherry to shine. A lick of FA Forest fruit completes the richness and body and keeps the cherry form being linear.\r\n\r\nA smidgen of Fizzy Sherbet adds the fizzy, sour centre element.\r\n\r\nGood after 3 days or so but better after 7 and even better after 14!\r\n\r\nMB Red Cherry notes here: https:\/\/youtu.be\/1bMjDMsuamA\r\n\r\n ",
