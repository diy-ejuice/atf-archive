    "description": "I have been wanting to remix this juice for over a year the first time I vaped it I knew it was capella golden pineapple and FW blueberry.The lime was tricky the original juice was a little harsh so I wanted a more toned down version   capella lemon lime ,Tpa key lime fit the bill In this mix leaving me with a refreshing change of pace from my usual Ry4 recipes... it's crisp and refreshing...thanks for checking it out.... testing on a Shenray Hadley clone  Ni80 Aliens coil 30watts... There will be a VSO flavors version of this coming soon..",

I expected a good balance between the Blueberry, Pineapple and the Lime. Its still tasty and maybe a good remix but for my tastebuds not enough. Keep going!!"
