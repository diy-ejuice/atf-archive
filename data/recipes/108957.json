    "description": "Boysenberry tastes a lot like a cross between a blackberry and a raspberry. It has the juicy intensity of a blackberry, the sweet, floral character of a raspberry and a little bit more of a tang than either of its parents. Top that off with bilberries with an overall complex, tangy and sweet flavor. The main role of the marshmallow and the whipped cream is to increase volume, without adding any dairy or weight. You could pump up the sweetness with a few drops of ethyl maltol but I don't think it was needed in my case.\r\n\r\nI found that it is best to let this one sit for a few days to allow the texture to build\r\n\r\n#DIYDOWNUNDER\r\nhttps:\/\/www.diydownunder.com interested in participating then join DIY down under and check it out.",
