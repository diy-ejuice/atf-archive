  "description": "In progress. \r\n\r\nThis is my first recipe worthy of being shared with the community =P I take so much inspiration from the great minds here and am incredibly grateful I discovered this place/hobby. \r\n\r\nAs soon as I tried VT LMT I knew it would serve as a major contribution to something wonderful someday. Part of me also wanted to find some kind of use for FA Custard Pi after going through the trouble to get it and not seeing it used in many recipes. Without spending too much time or energy on it, over a few months, I acquired various flavors for various recipes and it was now time to get down to brass tax. \r\n\r\nFE Lemon with a touch of FA Florida Lime along with FA Custard Pi make up what can be considered the lemon curd of this recipe. FE Lemon is a tactful bakery lemon with that staying power many lack, the Florida Lime just makes it pop a tad more, I'm sure one could sub FA Lime Distilled or TFA Key Lime and get near-similar results. I just happen to prefer the way this tastes and I think youll agree. \r\n\r\nThe Custard Pi contributes to the lemon layer as well as the custard portion, with great help from FA Custard Premium. Hands down my favorite custard it is just **so** buttery and fits in here seamlessly with its Pi cohort. \r\n\r\nFA Cookie and FA Apple Pie combine to emulate a rather decent tart layer, and I'm sure they both benefit from the premium buttery goodness and various cream subtleties throughout their fellow flavors.\r\n\r\nFA Meringue for the meringue, FA Cream Whipped to prop it up with some major texture, INW Creme Brulee to add some layer separation, and VT Lemon Meringue Tart brings it all together with notes/hints of everything. \r\n\r\n",
