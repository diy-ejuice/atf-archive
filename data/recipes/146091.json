  "name": "Dracarys - fiery apple lemonade",
  "description": "A fiery apple lemonade with a cool finish\r\n\r\nFLV lemonade and VT fizzy sherbet make the base of the lemonade, boosted by a touch of FA grapefruit\r\n\r\nThe combo of FA Fuji and CAP double apple combine to make a strong punch of apple which keep it present from start to finish, it does die down after a few days but is kept crisp by the grapefruit and ws-23\r\n\r\nThe star attraction is the FLV red cinnamon which puts a different spin on the recipe and with the mild heat you feel on the throat and the cool blast of ws-23 they really play off of each other to give a satisfying vape.\r\n\r\nSide note: a splash of whiskey/bourbon works well with the red cinnamon in this recipe and if thatâ€™s your thing then I would suggest adding some :)\r\n\r\nIf you like what I do and this recipe then please rate and review.",
