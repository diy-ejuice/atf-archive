    "description": "I imagined this as a juice, but in my mind I picture it as more of a syrup\/candy. So don't imagine this served cold, but it's sweet and the flavors should come off candy like. Maybe I'll change it to a straight up candy profile if this profile doesn't work out. (note: after a LONG steep, I like this one quite a bit. I do want to make it a bit more juicy, but I'm not sure how I'm going to yet.)\r\n\r\nPear: I LOVE TFA Pear, if it was up to me it's the only pear I would ever use at like 10% :) but I wanted to round out the pear for others that might want to try. I used a 1:1 FA TFA Pear mix. I also added a little bit of TFA Quince to round it off.\r\nRaspberry: I used what I had, INW and TFA once again to give it a fuller flavor.\r\nCactus: I used a small amount of cactus to add a juicy mouth-feel.\r\nFuji: From my experience with fuji I thought that it would mix well with the profile I'm looking at.\r\n\r\npicture credit: yonanas UK",

My recipe also used inw raspberry at 1% as well as SC Pear(which I VERY highly recommend!) and once I mixed this up it was very close to mine. Raspberry and pear work amazingly together and I have tasted pear in many blue raspberry products. The apple and quince are a nice touch, although quite subtle as the inw raspberry tends to be a bit of a bully in many recipes. All said, this is a great, flavorful and juicy recipe and definitely worthy of a mix."

While this recipe tastes very different from that flavor in that the raspberry takes the foreground, as INW Raspberry does, at least as a SNV, it's fresh and very tasty. Thanks!"
