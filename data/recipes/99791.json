    "name": "Creamy Biscuit n Banana",
    "description": "After being hooked on Nom Nomz Monkey Brek i decided to try a version i enjoy for myself..\r\nNow im not a huge fan of Banana vapes as they always taste chemicly or like foams eughhhh so this is light on the Banana but you still get a good flavour from it, I found FW Banana a great all round banana, Shisha was a close second but tasted a little to candy\/foams to me but feel free to swap it if thats what you prefer, Now if youve had Monkey Brek youll know its all about the biscuit... i have tried lots of variations but this one just got better.... This was also my first venture with VTA Buscuit base and it didnt really add much straight off but i think its a steeper so i left it in... \r\nAlso 0.5 Super Sweet sounds a lot but its not sickly sweet... if your worried try starting lower.... \r\nHope you enjoy as much as i am :)",
