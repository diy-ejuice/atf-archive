  "description": "An Inspired Remix of a popular Aussie eLiquid called\r\n\"Jake The Musk\" \r\nA simply delicious and balanced Musk stick flavour that satisfies so many vapers downunder. \r\n\r\nAvailable from:  https://www.juicecartel.com.au/collections/australian-e-liquids/products/juice-cartel-range-rtv?variant=12122923925624\r\n\r\nI have called this \"Fire Your Muskets\" because I have been under fire by some Aussie eLiquid companies for chasing this recipe profile. \r\nI don't belive in \"cloning\" any more than I really believe in Santa Claus or a fart powered Unicorn flying backwards over a rainbow and falling into a pot of gold lol. I do believe in being able to be inspired by an eLiquid that keeps you off the stinkies and customizing something close or better to suit your taste buds and olfactory. This is why I call this an \r\n\"Inspired Remix\"\r\n\r\nAll the other development details and how I came up with this final version can be seen via the DIY Downunder You Tube channel. \r\n\r\nPart 1: \r\nhttps://youtu.be/laqI2Cxqr9k\r\n\r\n\r\nVersion 1 - July 15 2019\r\nCotton Candy (10% EM/Ethyl Maltol) (TPA)2.00\r\nMusk Candy (TPA)1.50\r\nRainbow Sherbet (TPA)2.00\r\nSuper Sweet (CAP)0.50\r\nvery close off the shake maybe Musk could come up 0.5%, lets steep a couple of days.\r\n\r\nVersion 2 - July 15 2019\r\nCotton Candy (10% EM/Ethyl Maltol) (TPA)2.00\r\nMusk Candy (TPA)2.00 ***\r\nRainbow Sherbet (TPA)2.00\r\nSuper Sweet (CAP)0.50\r\nMusk up 0.5%, lets steep a couple of days. Seems a little stronger than the original but is delicious. Highly suspect the Musk may fade a little though to come into balance. \r\n\r\nVersion 3 - July 17 2019\r\nCotton Candy (10% EM/Ethyl Maltol) (TPA)2.00\r\nMusk Candy (TPA)1.75 ***\r\nRainbow Sherbet (TPA)1.75\r\nSuper Sweet (CAP)0.50\r\nDefinitely tastes closest to the original but not quite as pleasant as the 2% musk has a more depth of flavor and solid sweetness. \r\n\r\n3 Day steep\r\nI enjoyed this on a Dual Recurve RDA 0.14ohm SST Alien Coils, COTN Threads wicking at 70W \r\n\r\nI hope you enjoy this just as much as I enjoyed creating this recipe, but let me know what you thought in the comments below.\r\n\r\nSeriously if you like a solid recipe that works give it a go!\r\n\r\nCheers for reading this far, now go and get mixing!\r\n\r\n\"Together, Let's Discover!!!\"\r\n\r\nFacebook - https://www.facebook.com/groups/diydownunder/\r\nDiscord - https://discord.gg/kH4Fqbc\r\nYoutube - https://www.youtube.com/c/diydownunder\r\nWebsite - https://www.diydownunder.com/\r\nInstagram IGTV : @diydownunder",
