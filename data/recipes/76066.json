    "description": "A dark, bready tobacco with a fruity fig finish.  Something like eating a sleeve of fig netwtons and a freshly opened pack of cigarettes at the same time, but at least moderately more pleasant than that.  It's a bit obnoxious, really.  But obnoxious can be fun, and sometimes I need a tobacco that doesn't screw around.\r\n\r\nThis recipe has a long and tortured genesis.  The original base for the recipe was a recipe called \"Gravity\" from a MixLife grudge match between myself and the mighty ID10-T.  The original parameters of the mixoff were five flavors, all flavorah.  I came up with a fig newton after messing around some of the darker, bolder flavors from the flavorah line.  I eked out a win (shoutout to making stupid, risky choices) with this recipe:\r\n\r\nGravity\r\n\r\n.25% FLV Apple Pop\r\n.25% FLV Cookie\r\n2% FLV Ginger Snap\r\n.25% FLV Raisin Rum\r\n.75% FLV Sweet Fig (Subbed out for .5% FLV Fig, as the judges didn't actually have sweet fig.)\r\n\r\nIt was good enough to win, but it was overall just a bit too dark and intense for a fig newton cookie.\r\n\r\nBut hey, Ckemist suggested turning into a tobacco, so that's what we did.  Lean into the darkness.\r\n\r\nNot a ton has changed from the original gravity recipe here.  I've cut the FLV Ginger Snap in half, just because that tobacco is already pretty darn dark and I didn't need everything going too bitter and burnt.  I've also just embraced the sub for FLV Fig as opposed to FLV Sweet Fig.  There isn't much of a difference, and the straight Fig is quite a bit more popular.\r\n\r\nI don't really have a solid enough grasp with tobaccos to start throwing 4 at a time in here, so I just settled for one of my favorite non-aromatic tobaccos at the basic bitch percentage of 2%.  Messing around with the tobacco here is a good idea.  Make it work for you.  I'd generally stay away from anything aromatic.  If there's anything too close to an ammonia flavor in there it's going to push that FLV Fig into some weirder off notes.  This also doesn't seem to work particulary well with oriental\/turkish\/herbalish tobaccos.  You just want something solid for all the newton to bounce off of.  Kentucky worked for me here.  Cured felt a little lighter but it was a'ight as well.\r\n\r\nI'm a bit of masochist, but adding .5% FA Black Fire adds a really interesting sweet smoke to this... I thinks it's a bit too dark to really work well with INW DNB or FLV Classic Cigarette for anything too overtly ashy.  This also benefits quite a bit from .25% FA MTS if it's coming across as too harsh for you.\r\n\r\nSteep time here is mostly going to be dictated by the Tobacco.  This works pretty well after an overnight, and starts to fade out a bit on day 3.  That tobacco should come back in about 2 weeks though, so maybe forget about it for a while, okay?  I find it works best as a high nic mtl banger but do whatever you want.",
