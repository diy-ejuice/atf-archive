  "description": "New to mixing, and this is my first clone... and yes, this was a total accident. If you have ever vaped this juice before, it has a distinct taste you just donâ€™t forget. I was messing around with LB Rainbow Sherbet and was just trying to boost it with different fruits. I got a good balance going so I decided to throw in my favorite ice cream and gave it a go.
