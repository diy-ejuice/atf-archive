  "description": "**A dark and spicy pipe tobacco, with bright and refreshing fruit notes.**\r\n\r\n**Steep: 1 week. Good straight away but the tobacco develops and blends with the other flavors over time.**\r\n\r\nFlavor Notes:\r\n\r\n* CAP Cinnamon Danish Swirl -- This flavor sits more in the base, but acts as sort of a bridge between the darker base notes and the lighter top notes, bringing some nice bakery and a refreshing spice.\r\n\r\n* JF Fuji -- The fuji sets an overall bright tone for the fruits to play in and pairs well with the Cinnamon.\r\n\r\n* TFA Strawberry Ripe -- Used mainly for its sweetness, but also sets an important undertone of strawberry.\r\n\r\n* FLV Fig -- Pairs well with the apple, extremely well with tobacco, and brings a dark fruity aspect to help tone down some of the brighter fruit notes.\r\n\r\n* FLV Alpine Strawberry -- I wanted to taste the strawberry but not be overwhelmed by strawberry; the best way I felt to do this was with the ultra fresh and crisp powerful strawberry note from Alpine strawberry.\r\n\r\n* FLV Cavendish -- I used a number of different tobaccos to find the best pairing, and I felt this one did the best job. It's nice and dark, has a robust tobacco flavor without being ashy, dry, too cigarette-y, or overwhelming with tobacco flavor. You can use a number of different tobaccos here in its place with success, but this one I think is the tastiest.\r\n\r\n\"The day is coming to an end. You've enjoyed time with your friends and family, as well as indulging in some delectable delecacies including apple pie and fresh strawberries. You have a sit and load your pipe with your favorite pipe tobacco. You've got a nice thick jacket and hood on as the brisk air nips at your face. Relax and reminisce as you enjoy an Autumn Sunset.\"",
