Forest Mix is the perfect mix of berries to nail down the mixed berry lemonade feel without feeling overwhelming, and LA lemonade really adds that extra lemon punch.&#xD;\n&#xD;\nIf you are a beginner, definitely try out this recipe. Hell, make sure to try it out even if you arent. "

For example, I tested it in an Elevate and it pretty solid.  That's obviously a tough balance when you're mixing for tart lemonade, but this one's just a little too harsh on good attys."

After around a week the lemonade aspect starts to drop off significantly, though that is an issue with LA Lemonade more than anything. This is usually what I mix for friends when they want something \"summery.\" Outstanding simple recipe. 0.5% WS23 makes a welcome addition here as well, to make it more of a beverage vs. a candyesque flavor. Either way works well though."

Once I let it steep the berries were the forefront of the mix with lemon\/lemonade taking a seat at the back of the bus making this more of a berry mix with hints of lemonade."
