    "description": "Edit after all this time, they did change Holy Grail RY4, V2 is a good RY4 but lost some of the complexity that made me fall in love with HGRY4 in the first place. It did get a bit creamier but also a bit sweeter. I might at some point release a fix for it, till then RIP HHGRY4 you are already missed, well you will be when the last of this 30 odd ounces of the original is gone ;)\r\n\r\nI can keep revising recipes for months if not years as I get bored with a really good profile and do something different with it. Gonna release this one before I change it again. :) I have three favorite \"RY4\" concentrates. The original from Hangsen holds a special place in my heart, RY4 Double from TFA does as well but it tends to be on the harsh side for me. Lastly, Holy Grail RY4 from DIYFS is near to perfect for me but suffers from what all RY4s do, (in my opinion)... NOT ENOUGH TOBACCO\r\n\r\nA simple, delectable desert tobacco.\r\n\r\nHoly Grail RY4, one of my absolute favorite RY4s, heavy on the warm creamy caramel, heavy on the vanilla. used a bit heavy here to get the \"warm creamy caramel\" to the front.\r\nFLV Red Burley, I absolutely love this concentrate. It is one of the handful of tobacco concentrates that are not NETs that I feel truly compares to a single varietal test to the actual tobacco it is named after. This is an odd concentrate, it comes in STRONG and true as a shake and vape, then dies off over a week, coming back in week two of the steep, less strong but way more nuance.\r\nFLV Kentucky Blend, this is a really good analog cigarette concentrate, used a bit low here for a very slight smoky ash without having to use a TA. This can be left out completely but I feel it adds a nice note.\r\n\r\nThe pairing of the two FLV tobaccos here is to amplify and authenticate the little bit of tobacco that Holy Grail has. If I am going to long steep a bottle of this >3 weeks I bump the FLV Tobaccos up to double what they are here. Not that they fade away but at double what they are they maintain a stronger presence outside of the 3 week steep.\r\n\r\nThis is a really good shake and vape (by my definition, at least let it sit over night after vigorous shaking), it does change significantly over the next 14 days hitting it's peak of meld and nuance at that point. If you are a desert tobacco lover give this one a shot in a larger mix to experience the change in profile and nuance. I listed 60 vg as ideal as I feel tobaccos benefit from a bit higher PG, but it is also really good at my max VG percentage of 70. This is really good in any flavor atty\/tank, different coil types and airflow will accentuate different aspects of the profile immensely. ",

I'm not really a tobacco guy so I probably can't vape this all day. However I sure do make sure I have a tank ready to go for certain times of the day where I just want to sit back and indulge in me-time. Took Fear's advice and doubled the tobacco and mixed up a big batch for a 2 month long steep. This was my intro into DIY mixing. Thanks for that. 1\/16\/19 Edit - I blew through my month long steep batch of 240mls and now tapping into my 2 month long steep batch.  I can't put this down. I got a dedicated squonker just for this recipe and started falling into a tobacco rabbit hole. "

Somewhere around day 7, it shifted and the tobaccos came forward in a huge way, adding a simultaneous bright woodiness and dark earthiness that is just sublime, with that hint of cocoa fading out. Now, at day 17, it's a perfect caramel and vanilla wrapped up in tobacco. Got coworkers thinking i'm hitting a waffle cone, and their jaws drop when i go \"Nope, dessert tobacco.\" Seriously, this bad boy is a must mix, and really, you should make a big ass batch, minimum of 60 ml. You can notice the changes, and it just keeps getting better. Get you some."

It's a little harsh fresh but that chocolate note blends with the vanilla in the RY4 and seems super creamy for me and sits beautifully right on top of the tobaccos. After about 10 days that chocolate note fades into the background and I'm left with the perfect tobacco forward RY4. The caramel is sweet and dark. The vanilla brightens that caramel up a bit. Then underneath is a well balanced tobacco combo that fits the profile perfectly. Great job! This should be a EVERYONE'S perfect RY4. "

I have had to force myself to only vape one tank every few days to make it last. I mixed a 240 with the double FLV percentages for a long steep so I never have to be without this flavor or ration myself once I've observed the nuance change in my initial 30 mL. Excellent job!
