    "description": "So i tried the  recipe  by (Huckleberried) i found it on bullcityflavors . And i didn\u2019t find it to be very cheesy or cheesecaked . so i added some flavors to make it more  \u201cauthentic \u201c all i did was add caps sweet cream at 0.25% and caps new york cheesecake at 0.5 % and it made it a whole lot better you can probably even bring new york cheesecake up to 1 % if you want more cheesecake .
