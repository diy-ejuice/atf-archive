    "description": "Ok so this was my first foray into the realm of Custard.  I decided I wanted to make a Clafoutis, which is basically a dessert with cherries and custard with a bit of a crust to it.  \r\n\r\nEveryone knows cherries are a bit of a bear, so I didn't want to bite that off with my first custard.  I decided to go with a Pluot Clafoutis.  A pluot is a plum\/apricot hybrid.  VT Blood Plum\/FA Apricot make the pluot and the liquid amber helps to add that \"cooked\" vibe.  The shisha vanilla is what it is, a vanilla accent, the FA cookie makes a light crust.  I used a OOO Powdered Sugar to add a sprinkling of powdered sugar.  That last part is the custard which is the main part of this profile.  I started with INW Custard, but I felt it was too weak.  Not creamy enough and not enough body.  I asked @alfredpudding for help and as usual, he was game.  He suggested I add 3% CAP NY CC, which @ediblemalfunction uses in his Custard.  This was the missing piece, I'm really enjoying this right now.",

            "text": "I'll chime in with ID10-T on this. I have zero clue what the hell a Pluot Clafoutis is or how it should taste like - but hey, it doesn't matter. As long as the vape tastes good, which this does. However there are a few pointers. First is that 3 days is not enough steeping. After 3 days I find it to fall a little flat, the plum hasn't really set in with the rest and the NY Cheese Cake is still on a very bullying stage. Now after 7 days (as to where I'm writing this) it's much, much better and the flavors has really blended in well together. Although, I still find something in the fruit department lacking to accompany the plum and the apricot. It needs just a touch more of a fruity body to really make this shine. So I'd say this is pretty much close to home - nearly flawless as ID10-T described it. Sucks I can't give it 4.5 stars, cause that's exactly where it is. Very good and enjoyable vape. Sorry for teasing you about it, my dear friend."

            "text": "As far as I can tell, this is a nearly flawless recipe. I have no idea what a cooked pluot would taste like, as I\u2019ve only ever eaten them fresh, but now I can imagine that I do. The Liquid Amber really does give the stone fruit a cooked vibe. It\u2019s interesting the way the fruits come across as situated within the custard instead of just on top of it, but the Liquid Amber isn\u2019t getting weird with it. There\u2019s a lovely, thick vanilla custard that is reminiscent of the only kind of clafoutis I\u2019ve tried, a peach one, and a light crust note that works. I didn\u2019t really get a sprinkling of powdered sugar at first, but the more of it a vaped, the more it came out. This seems like an exemplary use of most of these ingredients, especially the Blood Plum. Maybe FLV Apricot could have emphasized the cookedness of the pluot better than FA\u2019s, but it\u2019s really hard to say without knowing what a cooked pluot tastes like, and it\u2019s a bangin stone fruit custard recipe just the way it is.
