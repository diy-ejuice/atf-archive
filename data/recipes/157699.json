  "description": "A fresh citrus apple soda for y'alls!\r\n\r\nI just keep throwing random stuff at the fizzy/sprite base that I used in my Citraspberry recipie, and this works really well.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n**FA Fuji** / **CAP Double Apple** pair up great to give us a well rounded apple flavor, and **FA Pear** gives that extra sweetness that those flavors are lacking.\r\n**FLV Citrus Soda** / **CAP Lemon Lime** serves as the fizzy \"sprite\" base.\r\n**TFA Vanilla Swirl** might seem wierd here, but it mutes the sharp notes that both the citruses and apples have, and brings a very nice *slightly* vanilla touched sweetness. I think most of you won't taste the vanilla, unless you are really looking for it.\r\n**WS-23** is optional or use at your prefered percentage. I recommend starting at 0.25% if you are not used to it, otherwise 0.5-1%.",

      "text": "I never thought apple and citrus would work as well as this, but it's a definite flavor monster.  The soda base that is used here is perfect and seems to work well with whatever is thrown at it.  The apple notes are crisp and fresh and combine with the soda base to create something different but nonetheless tasty.  The vanilla swirl definitely tones down the harshness of the fuji apple and is hardly noticed in the mix, if at all. Another amazing soda mix!"
