  "description": "**Brulee My Bread Pudding**\r\n&nbsp;\r\n**Brief Description:**\r\nDripping or in a tank, it's definitely a creme brulee bread pudding. It's a warm caramelized doughy pastry covered in a sweet custard sauce. This is an excellent vape with a cup of coffee in the morning or after dinner as a dessert. On inhale you get more of a creamy doughy flavor. On the exhale you taste the caramelized sugars and spices.\r\n&nbsp;\r\n**Cinnamon Bun (DF) 1% / Sweet Dough (FLV) .5%:**\r\nThe cinnamon bun and sweet dough make up the bread pudding portion of this recipe. Sweet dough is a light doughy flavor. It makes up the backbone of the bread pudding. The Cinnamon bun portion adds the spices and stickiness you would expect from a bread pudding. \r\n&nbsp;\r\n**Creme Brulee (INW) 1%:**\r\nThis is an excellent brulee flavor. It's slightly eggy, thick, and has a sweet caramelization to it.\r\n&nbsp;\r\n**Vanilla Cream (DF) 2% / Toasted Marshmallow (TPA) 0.75%:**\r\nThe vanilla cream and toasted marshmallow help to combine the bread pudding and creme brulee. Since the bread pudding tends to overpower the caramelized sugar a bit in the brulee, the toasted marshmallow is being used to back it up a bit. The vanilla cream is more like an ice cream flavor. Its a custard which helps boost that element in the creme brulee. I recommend steeping that flavor at least a week for it to really shine.\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nI tried this at shake and vape and immediately loved it. I have noticed a lot of improvement as it steeps. The vanilla cream is starting to add a nice hint of vanilla and brings balance to the overall mix. ",
