    "description": "This as close as I can get to the recipe. I\u2019ve learned the secret ingredient.Its Chemnovatic flavors. Lemon Cream Wafer at 3.5%. This flavor is not listed on all the flavors yet. But it\u2019s the key ingredient in it. The other flavors are just the help it needs. It\u2019s good off the shake but after 4 days you really start to taste everything. I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s going to allow me to save a flavor it doesn\u2019t have yet. So YOU MUST READ THIS for this recipe to work. So take out the lemon cream and switch it to the lemon cream wafer.",

As soon as I opened it and smelt it, was like oh ya.... that's what you smell when you smell lemon tart, fresh like opening a window on a spring day.  It almost even smells buttery all on its own which is weird and confusing but man I can't stop smelling it. "
