    "description": "this is a raspberry and rhubarb cheesecake, it's sweet and tart and super delicious\r\n\r\nYes We Cheesecake is the foundation of this mix, the rhubarb acts as the counterpart of the raspberry and everything melts together as a very tasty recipe.\r\nit's good as a shake n vape, but it's best after a 5 day steep.\r\nI don't like to eat rhubarb, i don't like the smell and the texture. But as a vape, wow.. this flavor combined with the Cheesecake and the raspberry is just addictive.\r\nWhen i give out a bottle to friends for testing, i don't mention anything about the rhubarb, and everyone just says, this recipe is tart and plays very well with the cheesecake part.\r\nAs the recipe steeps, the cheesecake pushes a bit forward and the raspberry & rhubarb combo blend together into a sweet, syrup type fruit jam thing.\r\n\r\nUse sweetener at your own taste, i like it even with 1%",
