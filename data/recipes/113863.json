  "description": "So one of my all day vapes from before i started diy was a flavor called spoon licker by ITC Vape. Its a strawberry cake batter flavor and believe it or not i cant even begin to come close to making it like they do. But then again it has been around 3 years since i was buying this e juice so maybe i am closer than i think. So because i dont think my spoon licker is as good as the original i have never released one of my spoon licker remixes. So instead of going after spoon licker i decided to go after a different yet close profile. I went with a strawberry cake batter and and wowzer is it good.  I mean it is just an over glorified strawberry cream so how can it be bad?\r\n\r\nSweeten to taste with your preferred sweetener.",
