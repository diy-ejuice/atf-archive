    "description": "***I DIDN\u2019T USE FA CARAMEL***\r\nI used Solub Arome Sweet Caramel which isn't on ATF but I think FA caramel or FW salted caramel will both work as a substitute at the same %\r\n\r\nReally happy with this as a complete package with all of the layers present that make up a good pie.\r\n\r\nI tried so many different things to get the crust right but nothing was strong enough to show through until I tried INW biscuit with a touch of FLV caramel to darken it.\r\n\r\nThere aren\u2019t many good caramels out there but I took some advice and used a combo of WF caramel butter and Solub Arome to get that sticky thick caramel I was after\r\n\r\nFlapper pie provides the background profile with Vanilla custard 2 for that nice thick velvety filling\r\n\r\nAnd some nice whipped cream to top it all off\r\n\r\nI used SS to sweeten instead of FW sweetener as it helped to make the caramel pop a bit more\r\n\r\nIt definitely needs a steep unfortunately. It needs a good week for everything to shine through, especially for the caramel and cream but you can get an idea of the profile after a couple of days\r\n\r\nTested on  a single coil flavour RDA (Hussar RDA V2) with an alien at 0.24 ohms",
