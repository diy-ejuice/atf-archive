  "name": "YEO Layer: Sweet Rice/Soy Milk Layer for your Recipes",
  "description": "This is a LAYER (much like a \"stone\") meant to be used in your recipes as somewhat of a foundation. It has a delicious and fragrant sweet rice top note that takes center stage in recipes. But then followed with the most deliciously milky cream that is light, yet full flavored and flufly. Feel free to tinker with this base and use in your recipes. HTTP://DIYORDIEVAPING.COM for more recipe ideas and full flavor notes. ",

I've made so many banging recipes using this base and the sky is the limit, when it comes to bending the FE rice in other recipes! Thanks for showing us DIYers how good this under the radar flavor is! "
