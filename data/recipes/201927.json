  "description": "This needs some balancing, so I'm very much open for ideas...\r\nThe recipe was influenced by the first-ever-premium liquid I've fallen in love back in 2014 - \"Gold Tiger\" by X-Bud(Liquideo FR). It's by no means a clone but rather an inspiration taken from the days of using low power mods and MTL atomizers (Vamo v5 and Nautilus).\r\n***\r\nI love the combination of various custards with CAP Cake Batter and there's nothing I can do about it. Tobaccos are not too bold but still quite noticeable even after two weeks of steeping. Thick caramel tobacco custard with some SPICE!\r\n***\r\nFor those who want less tobacco but more caramel can simply drop the HS Ry1 and increase HS Ry4 percentage up to 4% or use your preferred Ry4. Enjoy!",
