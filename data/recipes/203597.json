  "description": "TFA RY4 Double is an excellent tobacco with notes of vanilla and caramelized sugar. It's dark and robust.\r\n\r\nI've added FA Marshmallow here to give the recipe some excellent mouth feel and round out the edges of the profile. It adds a little bit of sweetness and some slight stickiness.\r\n\r\nFLV Caramel is a really good brown sugar. It really sets off those sweet dark notes that are in the RY4 and makes the recipe pop. \r\n\r\nSweeten to taste.\r\n\r\nWatch the Video here:\r\nhttps://youtu.be/USuN-Oewzns",
