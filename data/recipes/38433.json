  "name": "Candy of Mexico",
  "description": "This recipe originally came about during my quest to create the Mexican candy Pelon Pelo Rico into a vape. Living in the Southwest Pelon is a staple at every convenient store and it only made sense to recreate it. While this recipe is not exactly Pelon, it is something similar, almost like taking all of the Mexican candies on the shelf and mixing them into a bowl. (Make sure not to over pour the FLV heat, too much and it can really take over and be un vapeable, for me at least, I do like 1 or 2 drops in a 30 ml.) Here I bring you the candy of Mexico! ",
