  "name": "Getting Guava With It!",
  "description": "My version of this Guava Candy includes a drop of Super Sweet per 15ml. The flavors are pretty sweet on their own but feel free to add to your liking.\r\n\r\nAfter a shake it is, for me, a funky, cartoonish and candy-like sweet guava. With a little cactus tingle on the exhale. After a day or two the flavors blend together to a more cohesive guava candy. I can only describe it as a Funky Guava. \r\n\r\nPersonally, I did't notice a difference between 2-3 days and a 1,5 week steep. Curious how it wil fade/evolve after a longer steep though.\r\n\r\nInspiration from ENYAWREKLAW's Sweet Guava Flavorbook entry recipe & RockeyHarlow's Burst Duo Guava Dragonfruit (Somewhat Close) Clone.\r\nIf requested by ENYAWREKLAW of RockeyHarlow I will take the recipe down. Because I am not sure if I posted the recipe correctly",
