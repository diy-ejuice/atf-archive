  "description": "**Enjoy this full flavored, heavy \"sticky\" caramel Pistachio RY4**\r\n  \r\nYou **MUST** use **Health Cabin Caramel** for this mix. It is the only *sticky* caramel on the market(imho) currently & is a perfect mate for **TFA Double RY4**! No ifs, ands, or buts!!!!\r\n  \r\n**TFA Toasted Marshmallow** adds a great *toasted* tobacco' nuance. **TFA Red Oak**...what can I say? It adds the perfect *woody* aftertaste that most RY4s lack. No extra vanilla flavoring was needed here,  as **TFA Double RY4** has that covered! **CAP Sugar Cookie** adds sweetness, as well as helping the **TFA Pistachio** with that *roasted* feel I was looking for.\r\n  \r\n*2 week steep recommended*\r\n  \r\n*70% VG*\r\n  \r\n*If you prefer your RY4 sweeter, you can bump up the EM to 0.75-1%*\r\n  \r\n*If you like it, review it. If you don't like it? Please be constructive and say why. Because through constructive criticism, other DIYers can learn. Thanks!!*\r\n  \r\n\r\nPlease don't use my recipe for commercial gain. Enjoy!!\r\n  \r\n**E-JUICEMAKERS ONE-SHOTS**",
