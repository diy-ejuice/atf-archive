After going through tons of research and trying different recipes that are posted, I finally came up with my all time favorite strawberries and cream recipe that I would love to share. \r\nI LOVE INW Shisha strawberry and with TFA VBIC, it's too damm deliciouss! TFA Strawberry Ripe is there to create a more milky tasting strawberry. \r\nIt's a very milky strawberry ice-cream that I really hope you all enjoy like I do! \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPlease excuse my grammar, I'm Thai and I have poor english skills : ( \r\n",

      "text": "This used to be my ADV for many months. It's an excellent recipe except for one problem. After it steeps longer than a month I get a perfume off note. I think the Shisha Strawberry is doing weird things with the Bavarian Cream, or maybe it's the Marshmallow. I do use TFA Marshmallow instead of Cap's. I'm not sure what is causing it. I would really like to figure it out.  A lot of strawberry and cream recipes get weird after a few months sitting though. This recipe is still very good. I still go back to from time to time. Give it a mix and you will be happy! I would maybe lower the Shisha Straw to 2%"
