  "description": "Sweetener Optional\r\nFUCK A VAPE BAN OR A PMTA\r\nThis is a combination of notes from a recipe i thoroughly enjoy & Cheesecake Trinity\r\nI wanted a coconut cheesecake so I used used the coconut notes from u/hashslingingslashur  Coco De Leche - https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/42350 (highly recommended recipe if you love coconut or are interested in dipping into it) this is the only ratio of coconuts for me at least that does not come off with suntan lotion vibes, I also added FA Meringue to help with sweetness, From here i brought over u/Alfredpudding's Cheesecake Trinity. I will use Alfred's original description of the trinity because I feel like he broke it down very well and frankly cause he probably did a better job then i would do ALso Laziness  (The INW - Yes, We Cheesecake is the best cheesecake flavor available and creates the base for the trinity. Capella - New York Cheesecake is the first support flavor, bringing an additional note of caramelized sugar for the crust, adding some serious creaminess, and opening the bridge to vanilla flavors a bit more. Lastly, the TFA - Cheesecake (Graham Crust) completes the crusty undertone portion of the trinity and adds another hint of dairy.) https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/99cd5h/the_cheesecake_trinity/\r\nGive it a week steep and your ready to go enjoy. \r\nBe safe and stay healthy during these times \r\nVape On",

      "text": "MAN, IS THIS TASTY! The way the meringue interacts with the coconut is something special! I'm getting a sweet creamy inhale, the meringue melts on the tongue and makes way for a brilliant coconut experience on the exhale, which actually feels slightly toasted with the graham crust from TPA. The cheesecake trinity really makes for a wonderful base - rich, thick and a creamy mouthfeel with just a slight tang. The whole thing is dense, moist and full of flavour. Great job with the coconut profile. I'd been recommended these two coconuts and this recipe made them shine! ~3 days of steep time and it just tasted so good after eating a coconut yoghurt, so if you like coconut, like I do, I'd give this recipe a go. &#xD;\nIt's as if those Rafaello Balls (think Ferrero Rocher - but with white chocolate &amp; coconut) have been smashed into a good cheesecake and in the best way possible. Thanks for this! I'll definitely mix this one up again! You let this steep for a month+ and it's simply amazing"
