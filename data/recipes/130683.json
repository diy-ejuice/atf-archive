  "description": "Flv Red burley is a beautiful flavor on it's own with its deep dark notes and spice pairing it with Kentucky blend is a match made with its spice carmel tones. This is where Milk and Honey plays it's role to add a toasted rich mouth feel,  along with the  freshness of red apple sitting along side the pear.. this is a excellent ADV in my opinion. Great as a shake and vape. Enjoy! ",
