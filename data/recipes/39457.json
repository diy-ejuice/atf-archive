    "description": "A sweet violet mango candy that anyone with a sweet tooth can appreciate!\r\n\r\nFLV Mango and FA Violet are the stars here, melding perfectly into a bright mango candy flavor. FLV Guanabana bolsters the mango and also adds some tart tones to the mango flavor.\r\n\r\nFLV Cream and FA Vienna Cream give some mild creamy body, without affecting the candy profile with a little help from FLV Sweet Coconut.",

            "text": "Had a chance to check this out early and I have to say its a really solid vape. Solid balance with a nice floral finish and subtley changes as you vape it. Its acidic and then creamy with a floral ending, really quite pleasing. I find guanabana can carry most vapes but the fact that the mango is the main player with the violet is really impressing."
