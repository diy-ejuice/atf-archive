  "description": "After the last round of DOD worlds, I was really shocked that no one made a Strawberry Milkshake. Well, I felt like one so here we go. \r\n\r\nA fucking simple banging Strawberry Vanilla Milkshake.\r\nThere's nothing crazy going on here, just a simple combo that works amazingly.\r\nJust the INW Shisha Strawberry providing a great strawberry note and the balancing act of vanillas and creams from TPA VBIC and CAP Van Cust. The HS IC and FW Hazelnut really fill out the depths, providing a very straightforward and simple to grasp recipe. \r\nIt's the fucking simple strawberry vanilla milkshake.",
