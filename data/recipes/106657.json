  "description": "Bought some Meyer Lemon White Chocolate cookies on a recent trip to Publix.  This is my take on them.  They were thin with crisp edges (INW Biscuit) and gooey centers (FLV Cookie Dough).  The lemon was bright and up front (FE Lemon) . . . riding on top of the sweet sugar cookie dough (CAP Sugar Cookie).  They were liberally dotted with white chocolate chips (TPA White Chocolate/LA Cream Cheese Icing) and dusted lightly with powdered sugar (FA Meringue).",
