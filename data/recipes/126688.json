  "description": "This  is  a  tropical twist on the classic moscow mule which is a ginger beer, lime and vodka beverage.    This was made for Diy down under -  mixing with me mates VT show \r\n**Ginger and Golden Syrup**  create the ginger beer base.  FW  ginger is the closest ginger to an actual ginger beer and works in this application \r\n**Pineapple**  sits in the  middle here  bridging the top notes of passion fruit and blood orange to to the base note of ginger \r\n**Passion fruit and Blood Orange**     passion fruit for me has a predominate Orange note that I wanted to pull forward with the bright and crisp blood Orange champagne which also adds a bit of that fizz impression \r\n**Persian lime**   for me is  a sweet tart authentic lime juice  which is what I  needed here, and  is the upfront prominent note  in this  mix   \r\nAdd sweetner to your liking  I used  FLV sweetness at  0.30% \r\n\r\nLearn more about mixing here:\r\nfacebook - https://www.facebook.com/groups/diydownunder/\r\nDiscord - https://discord.gg/kH4Fqbc\r\nYoutube - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCTCwb7ULyfJALQlehomZZQA\r\nwebsite - https://www.diydownunder.com/",
