  "description": "Mixed for the mixen vixens the image this week  looked to me to be a graham cracker base with a philly cream cheese filing and a  banana flambe topping \r\nOn the inhale of the vape you get the dark sweet  caramelized notes followed by the  sweet vanilla cream cheese  and slight cooked caramelized  banana finish \r\n\r\n**FW Graham Cracker** is a solid  graham cracker with some vanilla  butter notes  -  it creates the base   for this mix  along with **JB biscut** for some additional texture and butter notes \r\n\r\n**INW yes we can cheesecake and INW creme brulee** work well together to create  a creamy  filling very similar  to the philly cream cheese .  It is more  of  a creamy  vanilla then an authentic Italian cream cheese filling.  The burnt sugar note of INW cream brulee is also used in this mix to support that flambe  note .   \r\n\r\nThe **SA banana flambe** is a sweet  cooked banana, that initally can be a bit like candy but has a really nice full body.   It is  noticeable on the back end of the inhale but is light on the caramelized sugar and rum.   To support the caramelized sugars and syrup  I added  **Jamaican rum, golden syrup and  smokey butterscotch**    FLV smoked butterscotch adds a woody warm note on the back end which is really unique., and build off of the rum.   VT golden syrup is a   darker  sweet syrup  that has a nice sticky mouth feel \r\n\r\n**NOTES/SUB**: This is a sweet mix on its own so does not really need sweetner but if you want to add  more would recommend FLV sweetness .50%   \r\n Banana Flambe can be subed  with  Molinberry  soft banana or  WF banana puree ( for a slightly brighter top banana)   if you want more of a cake note then TPA  banana nut bread   has a solid banana note and could work here .  \r\nIn other versions of this mix I have subed  Smokey Butterscotch for  FW butter pecan if you do not want that smokey note but you want more texture and swet nuttiness to the mix  or  WF  Butterscotch cream pie for more cream and lighter butterscotch top note .
