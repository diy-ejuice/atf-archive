  "description": "Still craving for that sweet tobacco taste? Love bananas, tobacco and butterscotch? Look no further.\r\nTry this mild banana vape with a rich vanilla tobacco flavor and sweet butterscotch.\r\n\r\nBuilding blocks:\r\n\r\nRF SC Butterscotch is a lovely addition to this recipe, it bridges the banana and vanilla perfectly. \r\n'Solo tested at 2.5%, the recommended.maximum, steep 3 days.\r\nIt's got a rich, dark butterscotch taste. and is quite creamy and with a mild throat hit.\r\nPerfect mixer for coffee, tobacco, chocolate and some fruits that needs a rich butterscotch layer.' \r\nIf you do not have the RF SC, it can be subbed with FLV Butterscotch.\r\n\r\nRy4 Double used for its caramel, vanilla notes and mellow tobacco flavor. I added TFA Red Oak to give a sweet smoked touch to this recipe. i would have use FA oak but i felt this it would be a little dry on the mix.\r\n\r\nJF Vanille got that deep dark vanilla taste and soly added to support the RY4 vanilla flavors\r\n\r\nTFA Toasted Marshmallow to round and bind this mix.\r\n\r\ns/v 48 hours to settle but give it 7 days or more for the RY4 to fully grow and makes this mix a rich balanced banana cream with smoked flavors.\r\n\r\nEnjoy.\r\nshare and rate if you like it.",
