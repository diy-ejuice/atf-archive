  "description": "This is essentially a spiced-cookie butter custard . . . it's involved . . . there's a lot going on here.  This is the closest that I've been able to get to the flavor of cookie butter.  I'm not at all ashamed that it uses 900 (some relatively hard to come by) concentrates.  For real . . . just order them from the UK.  ",

And the graham for FW Graham Cracker.  All 1:1. But with that said, this is already amazing after a shake, and I presume will just get better. The ginger brad and eggnog are wonderful together. It's think and creamy. I'll be getting the required flavours to make this as written. But either way it's a new favourite. Thank you very much for sharing this one."

This recipe is RICH, but not in an overly sweet/tons of sucralose kind of way, more like one of those deserts you get to treat yourself every once in a while. At first the spice notes seemed a little high but after my cotton broke in it was a great accent to the rest of the recipe. Thanks for posting this, it was a truly enjoyable experience."

      "text": "This is magnificent. It tastes like Cookie Butter Ice Cream, but with the ice cream removed and replaced with a rich, warm, buttery vanilla custard. It's so satisfying! The only drawback I could find is that all of the spice notes could be turned down just a little. They're a bit high for cookie butter ice cream, or even just cookie butter without ice cream. A case could be made for authenticity for some kind of cookie butter custard, as a warm custard would certainly enhance the spice notes in there. And when only enjoying it a little at a time, it really doesn't matter, because it is just plain delicious. But those spices kind of build on the palate for me so unless I put it down and vape something else for a bit, they start to overwhelm the custard with nutmeg and ginger a little. Definitely not an all-day vape for me because of that, but absolutely wonderful as a short-term treat just the way it is. Probably shouldn't be ADV-ing all that FA Butter anyway (it tastes too good to be good for you), so maybe it's for the best that the spice notes serve as a reminder to take a break from it now and then.
