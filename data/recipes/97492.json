I ordered black tea from flavorah for another couple recipes, and Bryson threw red tea in as a bonus and I found this...and I'm glad I did.  I could easily carry this to work with me and bust through the whole bottle in a couple days."

A nicely balanced mix &#xD;\nOkay    hot day and found this again  and vaped the WHOLE dang 30  ml.. and now need to mix MORE and MORE.. think I may add a touch of mint  or even that sorbet     this is soo   dam good  and simple!!!!
