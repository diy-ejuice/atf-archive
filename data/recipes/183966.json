    "description": "I'll start off by explaining the guava paste or guava cheese layer, more commonly known here in Brazil as \"goiabada\". Ever since I got into DIY, I dreamed of a good guava concentrate! As it is pretty difficult to get flavorings from various brands down here, my first experience with any type of guava was pretty disappointing, I believe everyone can guess the brand which I'm talking about. Then, my second guava type flavor was Sweet Guava from Capella, I'll be honest here and say that this flavoring is far from what a real pink-centered guava tastes like, it is more of a very light watered down guava juice.\r\n\r\nFast forward to early December 2019 when I got Pink Guava in the mail. As soon as took the cap off and took a whiff, I fell in love with it! I had finally gotten that real, ripe guava smell. One of my favorite parts of the guava is the skin, which brings a tartness that balances so well with the sweet, creamy inside of it, and I gotta say, Pink Guava brings all of this to the table, except for the extreme sweetness that is part of that delicious pink, redish center.\r\n\r\nAlright, enough with the small talk, let's get down to business!\r\n\r\n**WF Banana Pure\u00e9\/TPA Brown Sugar\/VT Glazed Strawberries\/FLV Pink Guava\/CAP Sweet Guava** - All these make the **Guava Paste** layer, each playing its role here to bring the perfect \"goiabada\". The banana pure\u00e9 and glazed strawberries bring both the creaminess and the glazed\/jammy feeling of the cooked up guava. The brown sugar here is pretty obvious, contributing to the sweetness as well as the \"cooked\" sugar. And then comes the beauty of the guavas, pink guava is an almost complete guava and sweet guava does a wonderful job completing it with its inherent sweetness and lighter body.\r\n\r\nOk, after I developed the perfect guava paste layer, I needed the **Perfect Cheesecake**, and that's where the @Developed team came in and solved all my previous cheesecake attempts. It really is the perfect cheesecake flavor and with the guava paste on top if, I finally nailed my favorite dessert in vape form!\r\n\r\nI recommend making a one-shot of this guava paste to use it in other recipes that might call for something of the sort. Corn bread is actually really good with it and I'm working on another recipe to balance both flavors appropriately.\r\n\r\nIf you read this huge text, I appreciate the time. Now, if you just scrolled down and got down here just to see the recipe, mix this up ASAP and make sure to leave a feedback!",
