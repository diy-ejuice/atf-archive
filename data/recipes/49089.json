  "name": "Pear and Caramel - Remix",
  "description": "In keeping with the theme of Remix Month!\r\n\r\nThis is a flavour I'm very proud of and I am finally happy to release to the Public. This is a Remix of one of my favourite eliquids \"Pear and Caramel\" by Creamy Clouds ELiquids.\r\n\r\nI found the original to be fairly sweet, so I decided to keep the Pear and Caramel base, but add some weight to it and make it a proper cheesecake. \r\n\r\nUnctuous Caramel smothered over a Poached Pear sitting atop a freshly baked Cheesecake!\r\n\r\nFlavour Notes:\r\n\r\nTFA Pear\r\nA beautiful, ripe grainy pear flavour with a slight candied pear taste in the background. It's fairly sweet on it's own, and doesn't have too much depth, but for this recipe it just seems to work the best.\r\n\r\nCAP NY Cheesecake\r\nThe base for the recipe, You CANNOT sub this flavour out for the TFA Cheesecake. It just doesnt work. CAP NY Cheesecake has that beautiful cheesecake grain with a slight hint of vanilla and a great \"bakery\" flavour that just helps round everything off.\r\n\r\nINW Biscuit\r\nInitially I started with 0.5% but I found I was missing that classic biscuit base that I love so much on a cheesecake... this ingredient does it best. Buttery, Sweet and a great caramelised bakery flavour with just the slightest hint of toasted coconut... it's fantastic!\r\n\r\nFA/TFA Caramel\r\nThis caramel combo is my \"go-to\" caramel combo for pretty much everything that needs a strong caramel flavour. It's a well rounded, slightly candied, but also fudge-y  caramel combo that just rounds off the pear and cheesecake and really brings everything together.\r\n\r\nTFA Ethyl Maltol \r\nJust helps add the extra sweetness and round off those bakery notes from the INW Biscuit to sit with the NY Cheesecake a bit better.",
