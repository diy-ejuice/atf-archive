  "description": "So this is my entry for the competition.\r\n\r\nI honestly didn't know what to do with the Strawberry ripe so I messed around with some strawberry flavors and cake. In the end after over 10 variations I decided on this one. My wife told me that it tasted alot like her yabluchnyk(ukrainian apple cake) with strawberries/Jam ontop so I went with that name.\r\n\r\nCAP CDS,TFA Straw ripe and FA fuji were used because I had to. I tried to keep the cinnamon relatively low because I didn't want it to be a explosion of cinnamon and drown out the rest. Fuji is just enough to give the yellow cake a apple flavor without it just turning into some weird apple mash cake.\r\n\r\nStrawberry ripe + Red touch: I used quite several combinations of strawberries to work. I can't taste strawberries so I had to use my wife for testing purposes and to her this combination worked the best as an apple jam when combined with the rest.\r\n\r\nYellow cake: It's the best base for a cake. It's pretty much a no brainer.\r\n\r\nToasted marshmallow: This was something that I put in on a random thought. I was planning to use something like meringue but toasted marshmallow in my opinion doesn't get enough love. For me it raised the sweetness up a notch and blended the cake/cinnamon well with the toasted part making the cake seem abit more \"baked\".\r\n\r\nSweetener: Cake is sweet. strawberries are sweet. I just wanted to brighten everything up and just give a sweeter impression without overblowing and destroying coils.\r\n\r\nThis was a incredibly difficult challenge with the basket ingredients. Especially with my complete lack of strawberry flavor. it's abit typical and \"safe\" to do a bakery cake flavor but I think that IF I go through that I could do alot better. If there is no strawberry. I enjoy the vape even without the strawberries and I hope you guys enjoy it too.\r\n\r\nI mixed it at 70VG and 3MG and found it great after about a week.",
