The description below will also be updated to fit the current profile. Make sure to follow this recipe, follow me on twitter, and on diyordievaping.com to stay updated on this project. \r\n\r\nStrawberry Cheesecake:\r\nYou will notice this will be a S&C a lot of the time. I've been vaping a tweaked version of my Boosted remix - https:\/\/diyordievaping.com\/2018\/09\/12\/boosted-diy-ejuice-clone\/ - but recently I wanted a bit more \"cheesecake\". While Rose Milk usually fits the bill, I didn't want something too creamy, and still had a bit more \"candied\" strawberry. So I ended up here. \r\n\r\n",

I don't have TPA Bavarian Cream but I do have FW Bavarian Cream or FW Yogurt I used CAP Sweet Yogurt and I did the same percentages.  Even if you don't usually like Sweet Strawberry it works here, this is now my ADV as well.  I did use a bit more Super Sweet I like my juice SWEET, I used 1.5%  It was delicious on the Shake but the next morning it was twice as good.  I made 30 mils and it will be gone the day after I made it going to have to make a huge bottle tonight.  Love to all and Thanks Wayne of Diy or Die      &#xD;\n&#xD;\nUPDATE:  Vaped what I made then mixed a 120 ml 6mg and a 60ml 0mg for my Husband vaped through all that and just went through a panic because I wrote the name down wrong so when I went to look for it...couldn't find it...OMG...no panic like the panic of losing your current all day vape (pun intended).  I am now going to write keep the recipe in my Evernote ...can't let this happen again."

My husband only vapes the Strawberry Overdose Clone but he tried this and loved it so I'm mixing him up some too. Solid recipe, Wayne! If you do update this can you name it and save it separately? It's too good to lose when you update your adv!"
