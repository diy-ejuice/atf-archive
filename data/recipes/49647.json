    "description": "I single flavor tested FLV Smore in various percentages and all I could think of was damn this is all the enticing flavor notes I need to pair with a classic southern tobacco blend. But it wasn't all the notes I needed for this one.\r\n\r\nThe name? I have no clue, vaping a few iterations of this in a hotel on a business trip I just thought it needed this name :)\r\n\r\nThe combo of Red Burley and Cured is a natural one for me. They just seem to perfectly complement each other. Cured keeps Red Burley from getting too far into \"Nutty Land\" and Red Burley keeps cured out of the \"Generic Tobacco Park\" Both are excellent tobacco concentrates. I threw Tatanka in on a whim \"AND IT JUST WORKS\" so no magic here. I will be chucking some Tatanka in a few things going forward, another great concentrate. (If you are unlucky enough to not have Tatanka, FLV Native works really well here at 1% I just liked the Tatanka version a bit better.\r\n\r\nThe dessert notes, I really wanted this to be more of a tobacco vape with nuance notes in the back ground. I get carried away and tend to make them RICH. This is a test of my restraint in balancing a tobacco dessert profile as opposed to my usual DESSERT tobacco profiles.\r\n\r\nFLV Smore - I really wanted this one to play here and bring a little of the toasted marshmallow and dark chocolate notes it has in. I get an indistinct creamy texture with this concentrate. It may be my broken taste buds, it may be everyone's WHO CARES, it just works here. I do not get much if any graham cracker with this concentrate. It may be that you have to take it up higher than I am brave enough to with this concentrate. The chocolate here gets to be a bit strong above 1.5% and I absolutely despise chocolate vapes.\r\n\r\nFLV Toffee and FLV Caramel, using here to bring some more sweet to this this, some more brown, some more rich to tame this tobacco profile a bit more so that more people than me can enjoy it. Using the Toffee of course for the \"Murcan\" toffee note that it has and the Caramel to bring the sweet and brown up a notch. Also using these two to cut the chocolate note a bit so I can enjoy this, if you missed it, I hate chocolate vapes.\r\n\r\nSteep times, most of you sometimes tobacco vapers are gonna want to let this sit for a week to tame those tobaccos some and let the other notes come in to play a bit more. If you are like me and enjoy that bold fresh in yo face tobacco that FLV has when fresh are gonna want to mix larger and SnV then enjoy on a steep.\r\n\r\nVG, I truly believe that tobacco vapes are best at 60%VG or 50% VG, some will call poo on that so do as you please :) (this is good at 70% VG)",

I skipped the S&amp;V option on this one but let it steep 14 days to make sure the tobaccos had time to come back from that weird little vacation they like to take from days 4ish to 12ish. Perfection. I wasn't in a hurry to try this one until after I fell hard in love with Fear's Pheasant Ridge recipe; it convinced me to trust his judgment when it comes to FLV Toffee. You're next, Prapple Bacco!"

I'm picking up more of the toasted fluffiness, rather than that deep chocolate note. The combo of caramel\/toffee works perfect and sweetens the entire mix, bordering on the line of a RY4 type of vape. Another great tobacco recipe from our Tobacco King! Awesome job @Fear !"
