  "description": "I wanted to just enjoy a nice crisp apple cider paired with butterscotch. After playing around with the profile for a while this is what I came up with that feels balanced, satisfying, and flavorful. It ended up veering a little bit from the profile due to the cinnamon danish swirl but in a good way.\r\n\r\nApple Mix and Fuji  create a really nice tart baked granny smith apple with a nice layer of slight spicy cidery goodness. The Fuji helps the apple have texture and crispness while the Apple mix completes the darker layers of the fruit and adds heat to it. \r\n\r\nLiquid Amber used in small quantities adds an almost slightly fermented spiced sour aspect to our apple and really turns it into an all-out cider. The authenticity this flavor adds just amazes me.\r\n\r\nButterscotch ripple adds a nice counterbalance to our apple top note and forms a nice soft crack butterscotch glaze. Bolstered with a tiny bit of bavarian cream helps it stand up to the apple. There's a bit of inherent cream in both of these flavors that really helps to mellow out the whole vape a bit which it needs.\r\n\r\nCinnamon Danish Swirl completes our mix and really bridges the gap between the butterscotch and the apple cider making this a vape worthy of its name. The only way i can describe what it does is it fills in the gaps in the recipe. It adds a bit of cinnamon and a bit of mouth tingling warmth that really adds to the mouth feel of the recipe overall.",
