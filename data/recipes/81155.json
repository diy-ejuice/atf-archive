  "description": "This is a baked custard filled pie that's wrapped in a sugar cookies rather than a pie crust. I got the concept from the holiday pie they sell at McDonald's. It's nothing fancy, but damn is it good. That new custard is pretty much CAP V1 but without the sharp vanilla. If you sub it out here, this will still be good but it's not close to the same thing. The actual pie isn't full of vanilla, it's just an egg custard with sugar cookie and that's why this FA premium works wonderful in this mix. It fills out the INW and takes that dryness it has out and leaves you with a rich egg custard with a full body and buttery back note. If you like custard you need this new custard for sure",

This juice prompted me to, at least, show the creator my appreciation. This recipe has sold me on Custard Premium and all of the love that it gets. I don't pick out all of the flavors and subtleties. What I do get is a flavorful vape, the sum of it's parts, so to speak. I definitely get the flavor of a holiday pie, although I've never had one. The most difficult part is waiting a week to partake after whipping up a batch"

Overall an exceptional recipe, ive mixed 3 100mls of this and I rarely vape the same recipe twice. I often get fatigued from flavors pretty quickly, but not this one, full flavored and not exhausting."

The lingering mouthfeel is incredible, so creamy and spot on, the closest mouthfeel to an actual food I've ever tried with vaping, especially a custard. Well done. I'll make a bigger batch and give it a longer steep as this is definitely a keeper and hopefully gets tastier with time. Thanks so much for sharing the recipe"

The vanilla cupcake in there sends it over the edge for me. It‚Äôs the perfect use of that flavor, and it‚Äôs actually really present at only 1%. It melds with the sugar cookie so well, and the icing note is exactly where it belongs. It definitely reminds me of those custard pies, only this is better. I can‚Äôt get enough of it. It‚Äôs my new obsession. This is probably my favorite custard recipe to date. Phenomenal job, my friend. You couldn‚Äôt have done better. Thanks so much for sharing!"
