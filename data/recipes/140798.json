    "description": "Ah the memories of my grandma roses candy dish, you know the one where you go to grab a piece of candy and an entire brick of candies come out.  I always picked out the strawberry ones.  Pazzo Jack on its own would create that flavor, but I wanted something different.  The pink burst I feel gives the strawberry an extra layer, and the tangerine helps with that bite you feel in the back of your throat.  Of course adjust the sweetener to your liking (I am a coil killer and like it at .75%).",

I was worried the tangerine would be too noticeable but it's not. It serves its purpose quietly in the background. The burst makes it taste more authentic.  Very very good recipe. I will definitely be putting this in my ADV rotation!"
