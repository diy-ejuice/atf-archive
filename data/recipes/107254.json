  "description": "This is an attempt at making Disneys favorite Ice cream treat...However the first time I ever had it was NOT at disney but a little Peruvian restaurant..I couldn't believe how fantastic it was! Here is my attempt at creating it..I'm sure any cream bases will work I used Sweet cream because I didn't want to use vanilla custard as it was take over the whole recipe so I went with Sweet cream and Vanilla swirl.",
