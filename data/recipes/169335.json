  "description": "FLV Yam and Eggnog are the stars of this recipe and they give you a GREAT pumpkin pie filling.  Yam tastes JUST like pumpkin puree without added spices from the can.  The Vanilla custard makes it richer along with the sweet cream.   Graham cracker clear and the sugar cookie are for the sweet crust.  Cream Cheese Icing is used here as the sweetener.  I've been working on this recipe for three years and feel that I finally got it right!  I omitted the cinnamon from my version as I can't vape cinnamon, but I had a friend taste test the version with cinnamon and mine and he feels it's even better with it. ",
