  "description": "Smooth almonds coated with sticky caramel toffee.\r\n\r\nFA Almond is the undisputed king of almonds and sits proudly as the chieftain here. It fulfills the role of nut (duh) but more importantly, it adds a delicious creaminess and in doing so, blends seamlessly with the toffee to create a fabulously thick and creamy toffee.  \r\nFW Hazelnut boosts the nuttiness a tad and assists further with the overall, nutty, creamy feel.\r\n\r\nCaramel Toffee and English toffee has been my go-to caramel/toffee flavour for quite some time now and is just a phenomenal combo. Itâ€™s versatility is boundless and this is my maiden voyage by using it with a nut base. It does a splendid job in creating a thick and creamy toffee with zero off notes.\r\n\r\nThis baby needs 5 days to come together and will just improve with a longer steep.\r\n\r\nEnjoy!\r\n",
