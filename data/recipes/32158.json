  "description": "I am very proud of this recipe I think it turned out great. This is an Apple cinnamon Danish with a gooey Apple center and icing on top. This recipe is good immediately  but gets better and better every day after I would say it is at its best after around 6 days but it is definitely vapable after a good shake. Let me know what you think. ",
