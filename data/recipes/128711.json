  "name": "Mixin Vixens- Jarvis - Kahlua Coconut Cream Mint ",
  "description": "After the show I tried a version with Creme De Menthe and decided I liked the mixture of the boozy notes better for the idea I was going for.  \r\n\r\nThe idea for this drink -- going against knowing it's supposed to be yet another eggnog recipe -- I went for 1 shot of kalua, 1 shot Creme De Menthe, mixed with coconut milk and frothed cream.  The effect of the peppermint stick in the cup comes with the creme de menthe and the ws-23.  This worked out well in terms of creating what I was thinking about.  \r\n\r\nI liked it shake and vape, I would say the creams will totally come out after a week or two steep. I haven't steeped this yet so if there are any drastic changes to it in the next few weeks I'll update this recipe. If it goes as I suspect it will, I probably won't need to update it and a week or two steep will see richer creams and a slight smoothing of the boozy warm notes and a calming of the cooling and the mint.  But feel free to shake and vape this as it's pretty yummy. ",
