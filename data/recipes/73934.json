But off the shake it is a easy 4/5 and I suspect it will get better. Hats off to you and well done!&#xD;\n&#xD;\nEDIT: I tried adding 1% Shisha Vanilla to this, as the vanilla was a bit on the weak side for me. Worked wonders and can highly recommend it if you want more vanilla."

Nah, but pretty awesome to have a shake-and-vapeable vanilla custard. The list of \"recipes inspired by this one\" should be a lot longer than the one listed at this point. My head is swimming with ideas for other S&amp;V custards using this as a base and if you give this a try, yours probably will be, too. This recipe feels like more than just a yummy and neat trick, it feels IMPORTANT.   "
