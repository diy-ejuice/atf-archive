  "description": "So, the story behind this recipe is fairly simple. @AlfredPudding spent a fair amount of time in the diy e_juice discord and was very generous with his time and energy. I had asked him for some help in cloning one of my first juices, Frozen Hulk Tears. The man, the myth, the legend came back at me with this mix telling me both (1) this will be a better version and (2) the cap SS is essential here and not to mess with that scary 1%. He was right on both accounts. I've silently enjoyed this recipe for a good while and had asked a while back if he minded I shared it. I just never really got around to posting it, unsure also about how to properly do the recipe justice, or thank my friend properly for making something this amazing that truly hits that spot.\r\n\r\nIf you liked Frozen Hulk's Tears or just like a sour apple/watermelon profile, try this. \r\n\r\nOriginal art by @zany",
