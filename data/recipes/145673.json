This is because(unlike other brands) this is a smooth/strong flavoring with little to no throat hit. In addition, Purilum's CC doesn't taste muted 2-3 hits in, as has been my personal experience with other brands. This flavoring is truly a hidden gem. \r\n  \r\nI included **CAP Vanilla Whipped Cream** strictly for mouthfeel.\r\n  \r\n  \r\nMy pistachio layer contains **TFA Pistachio**(candy-like), **FA Marzipan**(more candy-like than INW) & **FA Almond.** I dont recommend subbing INW Marzipan here due to it being more creamy(cotton candy isn't creamy) and more 'cherry' tasting. FA Marzipan isn't creamy, and is more of a candied almond flavor(which benefits pistachio greatly).\r\n  \r\n\r\n**FA Apricot(Armenia)** was the best choice for my light fruity layer due to its' cooked/jammy quality. I wanted to keep this layer lighter than the cotton candy & pistachio layers so that it *feels* like a complementing accent to the pistachio. And I think at this percentage, this was achieved really well. FA Apricot also adds a \"wet\" quality to the overall mix to avoid dryness, as is often experienced with other cotton candy mixes.\r\n  \r\n\r\n**FLV Sweetness** was added because cotton candy is all sugar. This sweetener will achieve our desired effect without adding harshness, muting or coil-gunking properties. It will also taste more *natural* than other sweeteners. CAP SS will make it sickeningly sweet, EM(and Sugar Daddy) will mute the fuck out of this mix.\r\n  \r\n**70% VG**\r\n  \r\n**SNV**\r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n*Please don't use this recipe for commercial gain. Thank you*\r\n  \r\n**EJUICEMAKERS**",
