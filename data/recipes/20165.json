    "description": "so my mom is known throughout the family for her holiday desserts.. coquito, rice pudding, coconut flan (working on this might be 2nd submission), pumpkin cheesecake. shes not allowed entrance to homes if she doesnt bring one or more of these things.(jk)\r\none of my favorties she makes is her rice puddin that she throws some coconut in. she boils rice adds cream of coconut, evaporated milk, sweetened codensed milk, and topped with a dusting of cinnamon end result is a delicious sweet coconut rice pudding. so far i am at v2 of this and its nice that it would coinside with the competition points. I am going to be eating alot of this over the next 5-6 weeks so im sure the recipe will change as I get closer..ill be sure to edit any changes.  \r\nCAP Horchata 4% -milky, light cinnamon, closest thing to an impression of rice.  \r\nFLV Vanilla custard 2.5% - pudding flavor (i've heard somewhere that this was reformulated and i have to order flv vanilla pudding to try here)  \r\nDIYFS Holy Vanilla .75%- creamy delicious vanilla.  \r\n TFA Rice Crunchies 2.5%- Ive never gotten too much out of this flavor but i need that rice note so here is where i started. v1 was 1%.  \r\n TPA Coconut Candy 1.25%- because i love this with the next ingredient.  \r\nFlv Sweet coconut 1.25%- My favortie coconut on the market (v1 i tried Fa coconut because i wanted to switch things up and use something i dont normally and after v1 i quickly went back to my go to coconut mix).  \r\nFLV Vanilla Pudding 3%- With this I no longer needed Marshmallow. This brings a light extra vanilla custardy flavor but plays very nice with flv vanilla custard which has a nice pudding flavor in itself. \r\nSucralose .75%- v1 didnt have sweetener but thinking of how sweet my reference tastes it needed a bit.\r\ndropped cinnamon ceylon out of v1 because was too much even at 1 drop per 30ml.  \r\n Next week my mom will be making up some rice pudding and i will compare and tweak or maybe even reconstruct completly if i have to.\r\nIm enjoying the base even it needs to steep this is just notes off of S&V. pudding flavor is there, still no rice, and i need to up the coconut.  \r\nFor menu: Not My Mamas Rice Puddin: Sweet coconut rice pudding. Finished with a pinch of cinnamon.\r\nI have gotten positive reviews of this recipe.. still tweaking %s but damn good",

If anyone is reading this, try deejay mills' coconut flan recipe. It's delectable. Definitely a contender for recipe of the year in my book"
