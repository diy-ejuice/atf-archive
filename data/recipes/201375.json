  "description": "A spin off my Mango Cream Soda...\r\n\r\nHere we have a delightful and simple Guava Soda, with fresh bright notes of guava followed by a slight cream note.\r\n\r\nCAP Sweet Guava is pretty good as far as guava flavors go and FLV Pink Guava is a rock solid bright pink flavor which perfectly supports the CAP Sweet Guava. This makes up the Guava fruit portion of this mix.\r\n\r\nLastly no surprise VTA Creaming Soda is used here for the cream soda base and it's sitting perfectly at 1.5%\r\n\r\nFA Kiwi adds a bit more realism and body behind the vape but I didn't want the kiwi flavor to punch through so only a little was used for this application.\r\n\r\nI also needed the mix to bee on the cooler side since let's face it, hot warm soda is plain disgusting but a fresh cold soda is refreshing, so I reached for a little WS-23 and used about 0.4% to add enough coolness to the vape but not enough to give any off notes.\r\n\r\nFinally Guavas are sweet, Cream Soda is sweet, and you can't have sweet without sweetener. My first thought was to use CAP Super Sweet since it has citric acid in it and that would benefit the guava right? I didn't have such luck with that so I opted for one of my go to sweeteners FW Sweetener and sat it at a 0.5%",
