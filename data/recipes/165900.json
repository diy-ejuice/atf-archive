    "name": "OLDSKL Cornflake Tart and Custard",
    "description": "On the inhale you get a touch of  dark sweet strawberry   that transitions to the sweet maple cornflakes note and ends  with a bit of the tart note from the sweet currant.    The custard  gives it some body and fills in middle and adds some volume and mouth feel .  Tried on a reload S at 70 watts  with a alien coil  @.16 .  really solid at 3 days , flavors settle even more and round out a bit  by day 5 \r\n\r\ncereal 27 it is the best corn flake cereal out there but is a bit darker  then actual corn flake and needs a little help with \"corn\"   - so 1 drop of  FA corn  can do that .   Corn grows a bit so   1 drop \/ 30 ml is really all I needed, but wait a day or so before fore you add  more to your liking  - or  use a 10% dilution \r\nThe pie base is  mix of pie crust and sugar cookie  -   ooo pie crust is  the closest I have found to actual flaky dry pie crust, sugar cookie adds some buttery body  to the crust that I find is needed and like the way  it works with the custard\r\nMaple syrup by fa   is a  solid maple and I  really enjoy it;   but some  do not, if you are not a fan of maple feel free to add  more  golden syrup.   I do find the  maple syrup will fade a touch  so  try as is   but you may end up wanting more  \r\nRed currant adds some brightness to the  strawberry that works in this application .   \r\n\r\nI like this SWEET so I added .30 of cap super sweet   - but the golden syrup and maple syrup  really do add a nice amount a sweetner ",
