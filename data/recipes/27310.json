  "description": "Welcome to vanilla heaven! \r\n\r\nYou want in your face sweet vanilla custard? You got it!\r\n\r\nAs a . Shake and vape you get straight French vanilla. One week in your going to be getting smooth velvety vanilla cakey goodness that smells so enticingly good your going to want to pick it up every time you smell it! At four weeks it begins to morph into something in between a potent vanilla custard with a slab of birthday cake mid inhale. At six weeks the magic begins and you get that full on in your face vanilla cakey feel followed by a lingering custard on the exhale. For me this hits every aspect of an ADV custard. \r\n\r\nYou can sub the capella vanilla custard for v2.  Or flavorah/TFA vanilla custard but it won't he the same! ",
