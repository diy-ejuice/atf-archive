  "name": "Pineapple Cream Soda Float",
  "description": "Before heading off to Florida I made myself a little refreshing treat, a pineapple cream soda float... it’s a simple profile yet effectively different enough to appeal to everyone’s tropical side ;)\r\n\r\nVTA creaming soda lays the base, MB funky and VTA sugarloaf provide the pineapple and what a great job they do... the FLV lemonade helps the pineapple by accenting it with a touch of lemon and helping the soda side of things. Finally the FA ice cream sits on top of the soda, only at 2% as I didn’t want it too heavy it fits in nice at that percentage.\r\n\r\nSuper sweet isn’t essential but totally worth it but to each their own and can be dropped out dependant on your tastes  :) \r\n\r\nWs-23 works a treat in this recipe, you lose a bit of the cream but is really refreshing.\r\n\r\nIf you like this recipe and what I do then please rate and review accordingly ❤️\r\n",
