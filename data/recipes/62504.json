            "text": "This is a great recipe overall. I mixed it with FA Polar Blast because I don't have WS-23. The cooling effect is perfect with the polar blast. It's very much a candied flavor which is mentioned in the article for it, so I was expecting it. &#xD;\n&#xD;\nIt's sort of got a \"green\" taste to me and I'm not sure whether it's the Pineapple or the Jackfruit or maybe a mixture of one or both of them and the Super Sweet (sucralose has an odd taste to me). In any case I think that's a totally subjective thing, I just wanted to mention it. It's a great vape either way. I'll likely be mixing more of it and maybe removing the super sweet altogether. This 30ml is gonna go fast. "
