  "description": "Coffee and doughnuts any cop would blow off calls for lol. \r\n\r\nSAP was OMG yum moment. Then I added custard and it became an OMFG moment. Then it needed a week for the OMFG to come back. \r\n\r\nThe VC just made every flavor pop. Each is recognizable while being a perfect blend.  Used Erythritol instead of Super Sweet to save my coils. If you use super sweet I’d go at least half the amount or less depending on how sweet you like your vapes. \r\n\r\nIts been preferred by my household on our Alien 220 mods at 40 to 50 Watts. \r\nHope you’ll try it and let me know what you think.\r\n",
