  "description": "Simple, sweet, exotic. Add a fruit like strawberry, pineapple, or maybe some lime. \r\n\r\nThis is definitely an exotic fruit base to build on but delicious and dare I say excellent on it's own. \r\n\r\nFLV mango is a smash hit on its own at 3%. One of my new favorite flavors for sure. \r\n\r\nTPA Jackfruit by itself tastes like a tropical fruit similar to mango but also has a juicy fruit bubble gum vibe. I would not say this mix tastes like bubblegum though just a delicious mango vape. I use jackfruit at 3% sometimes but 2% has been my preferred level.\r\n\r\nKeeping with the simple fruit blends for the spring/summer! \r\n\r\nEnjoy!",

      "text": "I've tried a lot of simple two-ingredient combinations with FLV Mango and this is the best one yet. As suggested, you could try adding any number of other fruits to it and it would likely take well to them. I'm looking forward to playing with it. Probably starting with some kind of coconut. But it's tasty as hell all by itself, with Jackfruit gently highlighting and enhancing the pineappley and fleshy, peachy notes in the mango. If you're into cooling agents like Koolada, adding a little could easily make this a sweet tropically fruity summertime ADV. "
