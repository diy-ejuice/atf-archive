  "name": "Korean Festivi-teas!",
  "description": "In honor of the Vape Rally today in DC, we decided to make mixes based on Washington DC. The Korean War Veterans Memorial stuck out to me, so I decided to venture down Korean desserts. There is a dessert style tea that is found during festivities as well as being drank to help digestion due to the ginger. The tea is called Sujeonggwa. It is a tea made with ginger, dried persimmon, and cinnamon. Normally fairly sweet as well. This is a simple mix, trying to replicate a long boil/steep with the spices, so they are a little stronger, while still holding the sweetness of Persimmon plus sugar. Give it a go! The rich cinnamon is at ONE drop per 30mL",
