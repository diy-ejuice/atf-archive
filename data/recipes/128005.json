  "description": "A simple, straight forward, watermelon pixie stick mix.   If you have ever wanted to vape a powdery substance that is perfectly legal then this recipe is for you!  This is sweet and tangy with hints of watermelon intermingled.  As an added bonus you can use this as a SNV. \r\n\r\n**Photo credit: Qsimple, Memories For The Future Photography <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/8798099@N02/8703468217\">2013-04-21 Elf Fantasy Fair, edition Haarzuilens 2013, Mali May</a> via <a href=\"http://photopin.com\">photopin</a> <a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/2.0/\">(license)</a>** ",

On the exhale i get a nice blend of all the ingredients in this recipe. With watermelon mostly on the tail. I do reconmed anyone that like this type off candy vape to give it a mix."
