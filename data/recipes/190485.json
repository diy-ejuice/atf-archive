  "description": "Summer is coming, time for some tropical goodness! A simple and tasty mix to get you into the mood. \r\n\r\nFW Papaya can easily be subbed with FA Papaya, thou I would reduce the percentage a bit.\r\nI tried it with TPA Coconut Candy before, but the papaya is sweet enough on it's own. CAP Coconut is a way better fit for this recipe.\r\nStrangely enough, TPA Banana Cream is by far the best banana flavor for this. Every other banana I had available tasted a bit off in here.\r\n\r\nI like to add 1% WS-23 (10% dilution in PG). You can decrease the amount or leave it out completely, you call.\r\n\r\nLet it steep for at least three days!\r\n\r\nHope you enjoy. Have a nice vape! ",
