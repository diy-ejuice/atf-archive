  "description": "***This is a transformation of @RUG_ly - Baked Custard All Day. His recipe is a superb custard that I highly suggest you try before mine. Also check out his other recipes too as he creates some lovely simple mixes and has a YouTube channel: \r\n\r\nhttps://alltheflavors.com/recipes/203151#baked_custard_all_day_by_rug_ly\r\n\r\nWith this I simply added the banana cream on top.\r\n\r\nThis is a simple banana and custard... Nothing fancy, but delicious.\r\n\r\nHeavier on the custard and light on the banana, which is what I wanted out of this for something mellow but flavourful all day.\r\n\r\nStraight off the shake the sugar cookie stands out but it does settle down after a day and the banana comes through.\r\n\r\nI may alter this slightly in the future with more cream of some kind and less sugar cookie.\r\n\r\nI mix this at 60vg/40pg and use in an Aegis Boost.",
