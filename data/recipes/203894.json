It\u2019s more cheese than graham crust. It gets used up around 3% pretty frequently which is too high imo. It gets a weird offensive off note so I don\u2019t usually go higher than 1%. \r\n\r\nTFA Graham Cracker (clear) pairs really well with the NY Cheesecake which is somewhat lacking in the crust department. It\u2019s a medium dark, crunchy graham note that\u2019s just slightly sweet. \r\n\r\nCAP Vanilla Whipped Cream is just a light, fluffy cream with a slight vanilla note. Does well here to fill out the cheesecake and gives the mix a little creamy vanilla. \r\n\r\nI always use CAP Super Sweet a .5% in cheesecakes because I think the citric acid is something that they need but sweetener is optional as always. \r\n\r\nWatch the Video here: \r\nhttps:\/\/youtu.be\/Zut4sfG3JLY",
