    "description": "#remixmonth\r\n\r\nA little late to the show but I thought I'd share what is a pretty great remix of the infamous Lenola cream by kite in clouds.\r\n\r\nTasty strawberries and dark berries,banana,cream and graham crust. This was a pretty simple profile to crack its layers are pretty simple and it doesn't try to be something other than its profile portrays. \r\nIf you like the original I feel this should fulfill your requirements without paying a premium, I've kept the flavours simple and they should already be in your arsenal or otherwise easily obtained.\r\n\r\nBest between 7-10 days the flavours really then come alive sweet berries and creamy banana with a graham cracker exhale.\r\n\r\nEnjoy xx\r\n",
