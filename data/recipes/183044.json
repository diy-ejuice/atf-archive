  "description": "Here's a simple and delicious, Strawberry Donut.\r\n\r\n(FA) Meringue & (INW) Shisha Strawberry are used as the Glaze/Frosting.\r\n(CAP) Sugar Cookie & (FA) Zeppola are the base of the Donut.\r\n(CAP) Vanilla Custard is used to fill out the Donut.\r\n(CAP) Super Sweet can be adjusted to your liking. However, used at 1% seems to be a perfect balance as it pulls together the Strawberry & Meringue resulting in a sweet sticky Glaze/Frosting.\r\n\r\n- Hope you enjoy! \r\nHAPPY MIXING, & HAPPY VAPING!!! :)\r\n",

Cream/frosting combo is good as well. I did knock the super sweet down to 0.25% felt like 1% would been a bit much for me and my sweetness likings. Excellent job and thanks for sharing"
