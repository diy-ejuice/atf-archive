    "description": "First time mixing in a long time, This is a collective collaboration with my boy Ricky (Find him on ELR @ rickjinx http:\/\/e-liquid-recipes.com\/list?filter=109009). Being the fat boys we are we found ourselves craving a sweet vanilla cake. The final product we came up with is what you will see here. Enjoy! :)\r\n\r\nJust a pleasant MOIST vanilla cake. Feel free to experiment by adding additonal fruits. Think of this as a straight MOIST (yes I'm going to say it again) MOIST white vanilla iced cake blank slate to build on, Or enjoy it straight up as is. Not overbearing to the senses and can easily be an all day vape for bakery lovers.",
