  "description": "<p>@ConcreteRiver<br>\nSetup: Recoil w/ flavor barrel, Dual 15 wrap 26g 3mm Nifethal 70 coils @.14 ohms. 60w power, 450F temp limit. Full Cotton Wicks.</p>\n\n<p>Testing: CAP SilverLine 27 Fishes, 2 and 5%, 60/40 VG/PG, Steeped 5 days.</p>\n\n<p>Flavor Description: A pretty solid, slightly muted Swedish Fish Flavor with a full mouthfeel.</p>\n\n<p>The flavor here is definitely in the ballpark of swedish fish. Tastes like an aggressively &quot;red&quot; candy. Capella themselves calls out red licorice and raspberry, and I could definitely see either of those. This does seem to have a bit more of a generic red licorice vibe than straight swedish fish. I also pick up something that tastes a lot like an artificial bright red cherry as an accent. Maybe missing just a light bit of tartness and deepness for an actual swedish fish, but it&#39;s definitely recognizable.</p>\n\n<p>This actually has a pretty great mouthfeel. Very dense and chewy, with some of that sticky waxiness from actual swedish fish. Doesn&#39;t feel like a straight ahead gummy candy, whatever they&#39;re doing here mimics that half way between a jelly candy and gummy bear thing that actual swedish fish have. Isn&#39;t a big chemical mess like most other candy texturizers.</p>\n\n<p>I do feel like this flavor could stand to be a bit more vibrant. It feels a bit muted overall, like the flavor feels just a half-step in the background and is a bit hazy through that texture. Might be fixable with some sweetener, but solo it feels like the flavor is struggling a bit against the texture here. It tastes like a swedish fish, but it doesn&#39;t quite have that mouthwatering vibrancy of actual candy. Just cranking up the percentage doesn&#39;t seem to help, as it just starts to push some off-notes to the front.</p>\n\n<p>The only other explicit swedish fish flavor I&#39;ve tried is TPA&#39;s Swedish Gummy, and this seems to be a pretty big step up. This is noticeably less harsh and floral than the TPA Version, and the mouthfeel is quite a bit more like actual swedish fish. I feel like TPA&#39;s version does the deeper part of the flavor a bit better, but 27 fishes is a whole lot more palatable.</p>\n\n<p>Off-flavors: While this definitely tastes &quot;red&quot; it probably has a bit too much of a cherry or red licorice vibe to really hit swedish fish outright, but it&#39;s fairly close. The cherryish part of this gets a bit plasticy and chemical at higher percentages.</p>\n\n<p>Throat Hit: Light to moderate. Not as punchy as TPA Swedish Gummy.</p>\n\n<p>Percentage testing: I&#39;m not getting too much out of this at 2%. Some light gummyish mouthfeel but not a lot of actual flavor. Pretty mellow down here, although the mouthfeel might be useful.</p>\n\n<p>At 5% this is quite a bit more full. I&#39;m getting a relatively clear candy flavor out of this but it feels a little bit muted and in the background. There&#39;s some cherry off-notes creeping in around the edges but it isn&#39;t particulary harsh or plastic. Mouthfeel is pretty solid.</p>\n\n<p>Trying this a bit higher at 8% on a day steep, the flavor still feels a bit flat, but it is fuller. I&#39;m getting more aggressive chemical off-notes but it&#39;s not awful for a bright candy flavor. Mouthfeel is legitimately sticky and full.</p>\n\n<p>Just based on these tests, I&#39;d probably start around 3% as an accent flavor, primarily for mouthfeel. I&#39;d probably use this as a primary flavor around 6-7%.</p>\n\n<p>Uses &amp; Pairings: Passable as single flavor red swedish fish flavor solo, probably with a bit of sweetener to try to fill out that flavor a bit. I threw a drop of FA Blackcurrant in my remaining 5% sample, and even as a shake and vape its seeming to fill this out a bit more, so that&#39;s promising.</p>\n\n<p>At lower percentages, this is probably going to be a pretty decent candy texturizer. Flavor is pretty weak down there, but I&#39;m still getting some solid texture without much that tastes chemical or weird. If that little bit of red isn&#39;t going to clash with your profile, this will probably end up working a lot better than FW Gummy Candy or CAP Jelly Candy as a texturizer. I&#39;ll be doing 27 Bears tomorrow, so I&#39;ll have a better grasp on how it compares.</p>\n\n<p>TPA Red Licorice is already pretty thick, but this could make it even thicker and chewier.
