Sort of a light camphor warmth and almost a light pine taste. It could theoretically be a barrel char or something, but it isn&#39;t quite clicking for me. It&#39;ll kind of work as a smokiness for a couple drags and then go back to tasting just bitter and herbal.</p>\n\n<p>Thinner flavor overall. Seems pretty top heavy with those boozy notes, but there isn&#39;t much of a thicker base for anything to grab onto. Fairly light on the sweetness overall, without some of the really heavy, sweet depth I&#39;d expect from a cognac.</p>\n\n<p>Off-Flavors: Bitter and astringent. Doesn&#39;t have much in the way of body.</p>\n\n<p>Throat Hit: Moderate. Decent boozy bite, but there is a some harsher bitterness to it.</p>\n\n<p>Percentage testing: At 1%, this is light. Kind of a light booze and slight bitterness. No real body.</p>\n\n<p>At 4%, the booziness is coming through a bit more but so is that bitterness. Nothing really deep, sweet, or even fruity. Still, no real body to it.</p>\n\n<p>At 8%, no more boozy but maybe more bitter. I can&#39;t tell if this is supposed to be smokey or whatever, but it doesn&#39;t really work.

Just based on these tests, I&#39;d probably use this as a lighter accent around 3% primarily for a light booziness and realizing you&#39;ll have to work around the bitterness.</p>\n\n<p>Uses &amp; Pairings: I think this one might end up being fairly difficult to use. By itself, doesn&#39;t really do a convincing cognac flavor. It&#39;s kind of bitter and astringent to try to be using in a sweeter cognac type cocktail.</p>\n\n<p>Because this doesn&#39;t really have a fruitiness or heavy sweetness to this, you may be able to bend this one around a little bit. I can see using a bit of this with the right mix of apples and getting close to something like a calvados or even a pear brandy. The booziness is fairly accurate to a brandy style liquor and should blend fairly well if you wanted to work in your own fruit base.
