There&#39;s a fairly prominent sweetness to it that feels a lot like a sort of mass market bourbon level of sweetness. Tastes appropriately mellow and corn-ish. There&#39;s also a bit of oak in here. Not really overwhelmingly charred or intense, but enough to come across as an oak as opposed to a peat or any other kind of whiskey barrel.

More like smelling bourbon than actually consuming it, but I mean, vaping and all.</p>\n\n<p>Right off the bat, this doesn&#39;t really work like any of the other bourbons I&#39;ve tried. It&#39;s thinner and boozier than the whole lot including TPA Kentucky Bourbon, FW Whiskey, and FLV Bourbon. Doesn&#39;t&#39; feel like it&#39;s going to be an easy sub for anything. It&#39;s sweet like TPA Kentucky Bourbon but significantly less substantial. The Oak here isn&#39;t quite as aggressive as FLV Bourbon but it&#39;s pushing in that direction.

Feels thin and top heavy by itself.</p>\n\n<p>Throat Hit: Moderate, but booze and all. Not unduly harsh for the general level of booziness.</p>\n\n<p>Percentage testing: At 1%, at least with this kind of steep, I&#39;m not getting much out of this. Slight booziness and a bit of sweetness. Nothing that really identifiably tastes like a whiskey.</p>\n\n<p>At 4%, this is reading just a bit more like a whiskey.
