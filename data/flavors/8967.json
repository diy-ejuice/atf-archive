Full Cotton Wicks.</p>\n\n<p>Testing: Vape Train Shisha Raspberry, 1%, 4% and 8%, 60/40 VG/PG base, Steeped 12 days.</p>\n\n<p>Flavor Description: Vape Train says this: &quot;is on the slightly on the sweeter spectrum of raspberry flavours without the tartness of actual real raspberries.&quot; I&#39;m not sure I agree.</p>\n\n<p>The top end of the flavor is actually fairly tart. Feels like a pretty realistic kind of raspberry tartness, stopping short of an over-aggressive citrusy or sour candy type of tartness. Softer flavor, without much in the way of bite or punch. Base is a bit heavier, but still not overwhelmingly sticky or cloying. I think the base is where the candy is coming in, with a warm, flat kind of sweetness. Pretty straight-forward raspberry candy flavor, but not really intense. Overall effect with the tartness is still sort of candied, but not a full on candy raspberry.</p>\n\n<p>I will say, I think this flavor lacks some vibrancy and depth. That tarter top end is relatively thin and soft, and the body doesn&#39;t hit a syrupy, bold kind of richness you get from the more aggressive raspberry flavors. The actual structure of the flavor kind of reminds me of a Medicine Flower flavor. What&#39;s here is fairly evocative of a raspberry, it just doesn&#39;t cohere into something that feels bold, at least at the tested percentages.</p>\n\n<p>Off-flavors feel pretty mellow for a raspberry flavor. At 8% I&#39;m picking up something a maybe a bit floral, but it&#39;s not nearly as floral as berry flavors can get. I&#39;m not picking up anything green or vegetal. It also doesn&#39;t seem to have the dreaded ketchup vibe of TPA Sweet Raspberry.</p>\n\n<p>I think the closest analogue for this I&#39;ve tested is probably FLV Red Raspberry. I think the FLV Red Raspberry tastes a bit more realistic and almost seedy, but this is quite a bit more easygoing and imparts some of that tartness without having to really fine-tune your percentages to avoid blowing the recipe out with aggressive florals and sticky sweetness.</p>\n\n<p>Off-Flavors: Lightly floral at higher percentages. Feels a bit soft.</p>\n\n<p>Throat Hit:Light, I get a tiny bit of bite but not out of line for a fruit flavor.</p>\n\n<p>Percentage testing: At 1%, I&#39;m getting some light, fairly realistic raspberry tartness in the top notes. Sweeter base hasn&#39;t really come through, and I&#39;m still tasting quite a bit of my testing base.</p>\n\n<p>At 4%, tartness is a bit more pronounced. Still feels fairly realistic. Lightly candied raspberry base, stil feels a bit soft and not really heavy or syrupy.</p>\n\n<p>At 8%, doesn&#39;t feel much more tart or busy on the top end. Picking up a light floral note. Base is maybe just a bit heavier but still doesn&#39;t feel all that full.</p>\n\n<p>Vape Train suggests mixing this from 2-5%, and that seems like a good enough recommendation. Just based on these tests, I&#39;d say this is vapable higher, but doesn&#39;t really bring anything to the table at higher concentrations. I&#39;d go around 2-3% as a raspberry accent. Doesn&#39;t really seem to have enough presence for a solo or primary flavor. As soft as the top end of this flavor feels, it does show up pretty well in mixes from some limited mixing experience with it.</p>\n\n<p>Uses &amp; Pairings: I&#39;d use this as a tarter raspberry accent in heavier profiles. Seems like a really good fit for tobaccos, or as raspberries (instead of a raspberry frosting or jam) on top of a bakery profile. Really good fit for cocktail or beverage profiles. Kind of reminds me of the raspberry note from raspberry zinger tea.</p>\n\n<p>Decent raspberry choice for creams to keep them from going too floral or turning them into something that feels like a raspberry syrup.</p>\n\n<p>You could probably throw enough at this to make it sort of work as a candy raspberry, but there are better options for that.</p>\n\n<p>Would work okay as a raspberry accent in busier fruit profiles, assuming you&#39;ve got most of your body from something else.</p>\n\n<p>Second Opinions: I can&#39;t find anything solid out there.</p>\n\n<p>Here&#39;s the product page from Vape Train Australia.
