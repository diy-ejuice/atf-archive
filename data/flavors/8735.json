  "description": "<p>Setup: Recoil w/ flavor barrel, Dual 15 wrap 26g 3mm Nifethal 70 coils @.14 ohms. 60w power, 450F temp limit.

Not quite as thick, dense, and chewy as 27 Fish, but it has that waxy thing from actual gummy bears down pretty well. Actually feels like it coats your mouth with that halfway dissolved gelatin thing that a mouthful of gummy bears has going on.</p>\n\n<p>And it tastes like gummy bears. Mostly like white pineapple gummy bears. There&#39;s some actual tartness here that could either be a tarter take on pineapple or more of a discrete orange flavor. I&#39;m also getting some sweeter strawberryish flavor in here too. The classic haribo flavors are raspberry, strawberry, lemon, orange, and pineapple... and I could definitely see all of those being in here but it&#39;s weighted more towards the pineapple and the citrus.</p>\n\n<p>The only direct competition that I&#39;ve had for this would be FW Gummy Candy, and this has a much better mouthfeel but it does have a pretty identifiable fruit flavored attached. FW Gummy Candy has always sort of worked a bit better in theory than in practice for me, so while 27 bears might not theoretically be as versatile, It&#39;ll work better when the actual flavor of gummy bears isn&#39;t going to get in the way.</p>\n\n<p>Off-flavors: Not really, pretty much just gummy bears. Gets a bit chemical at high percentages, but nothing too bad within usable percentage ranges.</p>\n\n<p>Throat Hit: Light to moderate. I do get a bit of harshness on this, but it seems to settle in a bit moderately quickly and smooth back out. Initially seems to dry out your mouth a bit and that might be contributing.</p>\n\n<p>Percentage testing: At 2%, this is weaker. I&#39;m mostly getting a light candy pineapple. Seems to be missing some of the other fruit accents in there. Texture is a little sticky, but it&#39;s more like a dry sticky and not that gelatinous gummy bear thing.</p>\n\n<p>Filled in quite a bit at 5%. Still very much pineapple forward, but I&#39;m picking up some extra citrus tartness and some &quot;red flavor&quot; way in the back. Flavor still feels like it could be maybe just a touch more saturated.</p>\n\n<p>Trying this up at 8%, I&#39;m starting to find some of the chemical edges of this flavor. The red part has filled in a bit but it&#39;s almost tasting a little too citrus heavier. Mouthfeel is dramatically better than 5%.</p>\n\n<p>Just based on these tests, I&#39;d probably use this an accent flavor around 3% and a primary flavor around 6-7%.</p>\n\n<p>Uses &amp; Pairings: A higher percentage of this concentrate, too much sweetener, and some questionable marketing and you&#39;ve got yourself a hype flavor. This could use maybe a bit more &quot;red&quot; to it with a candied strawberry or raspberry, and maybe some vanilla swirl to round the edges off, but pretty remarkably close to a single flavor gummy bear as it is.</p>\n\n<p>Should be useful as a slightly tart, gummy mouthfeel additive for more diverse candy profiles. I don&#39;t think you&#39;re completely going to get away from the fruitiness here, but you can probably overwhelm it with your fruit flavor of choice especially at lower percentages. The mouthfeel shows ups a bit later than than the fruit flavor, so it&#39;ll be fairly difficult to get a clear fruit flavor not already in that gummy bear spectrum and still get all of that mouthfeel.</p>\n\n<p>Second Opinions: Still fairly new.</p>\n\n<p>Shoutout to ceedee99uk for linking reviews from PeegoreVapes in another thread.</p>\n\n<p>Here&#39;s the product page from Capella.
